Each hour includes how we predicted each race would turn out before any votes are counted, based on POLITICO race ratings.Indiana Kentucky Kentucky s 6th District features one of the marquee House races of the night. If Democrat Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot, manages to unseat GOP Rep. Andy Barr after the polls close at this early hour, it could presage a strong Democratic night. But if Barr wins by a comfortable margin, Republicans will feel better about their chances to retain a narrow majority.3 Dem 12 GOPPolls close at 6 p.m. ET in most of Indiana, home to a toss-up Senate race. Sen. Joe Donnelly is the third-most-vulnerable Democratic incumbent on the map -- if Republican Mike Braun wins here, it could dampen Democrats  hopes of winning the majority in the chamber.0 Dem 1 GOPThere are no governor s races at this hour.Alabama Florida Georgia New Hampshire South Carolina Vermont Virginia The top House races closing at 7 p.m. are in Florida and Virginia. Two are probable Democratic pickups: one in Miami (FL-27), and one in Northern Virginia (VA-10). But there s another toss-up race in South Florida (FL-26), and two more in Virginia (VA-02, -07). Those three will be more early barometers for the battle for the House.30 Dem 37 GOPThe rest of Indiana closes at 7 p.m. ET, as does most of Florida, where Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and GOP Gov. Rick Scott are locked in perhaps the closest -- and certainly the most expensive -- Senate race of 2018.2 Dem 0 GOPThe race to succeed Scott as Florida governor is also neck-and-neck -- as is the contest just to the north in Georgia. Both Democratic candidates -- Andrew Gillum in Florida and Stacey Abrams in Georgia -- would be the first African-American governors of their respective states. In Georgia, if neither Abrams nor Republican Brian Kemp wins a majority of the vote on Tuesday -- a possibility given the closeness of the race and the presence of a Libertarian candidate on the ballot -- the two will meet in a December 4 runoff.0 Dem 5 GOPNorth Carolina Ohio West Virginia More key battleground House races close at 7:30 -- mostly in red territory. There are three competitive House races in North Carolina, including the barn-burner in the state s 9th District, which the GOP is fighting to protect after Rep. Robert Pittenger was defeated in a primary. In Ohio s 12th District, GOP Rep. Troy Balderson and Democrat Danny O Connor are staging a rematch of the August special election, which Balderson won by a single percentage point.7 Dem 24 GOPSen. Joe Manchin -- a Democrat seeking reelection in a state President Trump carried by 42 percentage points -- has defied the odds and maintained a lead over Republican Patrick Morrisey throughout the campaign. Can Manchin hold on to win another six-year term?2 Dem 0 GOPOhio s gubernatorial race is one of the biggest prizes of the night. GOP state Attorney General Mike DeWine faces Democrat Richard Cordray, whom he unseated as AG back in 2010. Cordray later seved as Consumer Financial Protection Bureau chief and has brought the architect of that agency, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), to the state to campaign with him.0 Dem 1 GOPConnecticut Delaware Illinois Kansas Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Mississippi Missouri New Jersey North Dakota Oklahoma Pennsylvania Rhode Island Tennessee Texas Polls close in more than a dozen states at 8 p.m. ET, but no state is more critical to the battle for the House than Pennsylvania. A new, court-ordered congressional map undid Republicans  gerrymandered districts earlier this year, and Democrats can pick up between three and six seats on Tuesday -- potentially a large chunk of the 23 they need to win back the majority.84 Dem 69 GOPRepublicans hope to unseat Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill on Tuesday. Even if the GOP hasn t picked up a seat earlier in the night, the party can essentially lock down the Senate majority if GOP state Attorney General Josh Hawley beats McCaskill. Democrats, meanwhile, are banking on popular former Gov. Phil Bredesen to steal an open seat in bright-red Tennessee, though most pre-election polls have GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn in the lead there.9 Dem 5 GOPDemocrat J.B. Pritzker is poised to oust Illinois GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner on Tuesday in the nation s most-expensive gubernatorial election in history. Nearly $300 million will end up being spent in the contest -- more than half from the billionaire Pritzker s own wallet. Democrats are also likely to win the governorship in Michigan, where former state Sen. Gretchen Whitmer leads GOP state Attorney General Bill Schuette in the polls.7 Dem 5 GOPArkansas There s one competitive House district in Arkansas: the 2nd District, where GOP Rep. French Hill is facing a spirited challenge from Democrat Clarke Tucker.0 Dem 4 GOPThere are no Senate races closing at this time.Arkansas GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson -- the former congressman and Bush-era DEA administrator -- is likely to win reelection without breaking much of a sweat.0 Dem 1 GOPArizona Colorado Louisiana Minnesota Nebraska New Mexico New York South Dakota Wisconsin Wyoming Minnesota is a microcosm of the nation s political realignment. Democrats are favored to knock off two GOP incumbents in the Twin Cities suburbs -- Reps. Erik Paulsen and Jason Lewis. But Republicans  best chances to pick up seats nationwide are in two open-seat races here: one on the Iron Range, and another, rural seat in southern Minnesota.40 Dem 31 GOPWhile most polls close in Texas at 8 p.m. ET, the far western corner around El Paso is in the Mountain Time Zone and stays open an hour later. That s the geographic base of Democratic Rep. Beto O Rourke, who has raised a staggering $70 million in his bid to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz. Polls also close in the neck-and-neck Arizona race between two members of Congress: Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally.5 Dem 2 GOPWisconsin GOP Gov. Scott Walker is in the fight of his political life against Democrat Tony Evers. Walker -- who is running in his fifth political race in the past eight years -- was tied with Evers in the final poll of the campaign.5 Dem 4 GOPIdaho Iowa Montana Nevada Utah Republicans currently hold three of Iowa s four congressional districts, but that dominance is threatened on Tuesday. Democrats are favored to oust GOP Rep. Rod Blum in Eastern Iowa, and they have GOP Rep. David Young on the ropes in the southwestern corner of the state. The party is also making a late move on controversial GOP Rep. Steve King, amid recent scrutiny of King s ethnocentric and anti-immigration stances.6 Dem 8 GOPPolls close statewide in Nevada, home to the only GOP senator seeking reelection in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016: Dean Heller. Heller is running neck-and-neck in the polls with Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen. Meanwhile, Republicans have targeted Democratic Sen. Jon Tester for defeat in Montana.2 Dem 1 GOPThe gubernatorial races in Iowa and Nevada are extremely tight in the final days of the campaign. The winning candidates could play roles in the 2020 presidential race: Both states hold early presidential nominating contests, and both are swing states in the general election.1 Dem 2 GOPCalifornia Hawaii Oregon Washington Democrats could pick up as many as a half-dozen House seats in California -- most in Southern California, where Republicans are defending five districts Clinton carried in the presidential race. But because mail ballots can be postmarked as late as Tuesday, it could be weeks before some of the closest races are decided.51 Dem 11 GOPParty control of California s Senate seat isn t up for grabs. Because of the state s top-two primary system, both candidates are Democrats: 85-year-old Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and her 51-year-old, liberal challenger, state Sen. Kevin de Leon.3 Dem 0 GOPDespite Oregon s Democratic lean, incumbent Gov. Kate Brown faces a stiff challenge from Republican Knute Buehler on Tuesday.3 Dem 0 GOPAlaska Alaska GOP Rep. Don Young -- first elected in a 1973 special election -- is the dean of the House. But Young, 85, is locked in a surprisingly close race with Alyse Galvin, who won the Democratic primary but declined the ballot line and is running as an independent. Congressional Leadership Fund, the leading pro-GOP House super PAC, launched an 11th-hour field operation to boost Young in the final days of the race.0 Dem 1 GOPThere is no Senate race in Alaska this year.Trailing in the polls, independent Gov. Bill Walker suspended his campaign last month, though he ll still be on the ballot. Walker endorsed former Democratic Sen. Mark Begich in the race against Republican Mike Dunleavy.The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know.

                        Immigration
                    By ASSOCIATED PRESS12/31/2018 04:24 PM ESTWASHINGTON   President Donald Trump s pick for attorney general, William Barr, once questioned the value of a wall along the Mexican border similar to the one the president has advocated, describing the idea as  overkill. Barr was attorney general under President George H.W. Bush when he was asked in a Feb. 24, 1992, interview whether he supported a proposal from Republican presidential challenger Pat Buchanan to erect a barrier of ditches and fences along the border to stop illegal immigration.Story Continued Below I don t think it s necessary. I think that s overkill to put a barrier from one side of the border to the other,  Barr replied on  The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour  on PBS.  In fact, the problem with illegal immigration across the border is really confined to major metropolitan areas. Illegal immigrants do not cross in the middle of the desert and walk hundreds of miles,  instead choosing more  certain specified routes. Those routes through more populated areas have since largely been closed off, pushing migrants to riskier desert routes.Other public statements by Barr from his tenure as attorney general and within the last year suggest a hardened immigration approach more in line with the broader security measures Trump and his advisers have discussed.Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning   in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Barr s views on a wall have changed, but pointed to other comments from his tenure in which he described fences as effective in stopping drugs and illegal immigration. As attorney general, he also announced the hiring of additional agents to patrol the border and promoted upgraded fencing and investments in sensors and other technology.Barr s positions on immigration are significant because of the Justice Department s role in defending and enforcing administration policies and because border security has been a top priority of Trump s White House. While the Justice Department today prosecutes people who cross the border illegally and defends the administration s policies, it was more directly involved in immigration enforcement during Barr s earlier tenure as attorney general   1991 to 1993   because it included the Immigration and Naturalization Service. That agency was dissolved and its responsibilities largely folded into the Department of Homeland Security following the 9/11 attacks.Barr s past comments on the effectiveness of a wall reflect a nuance often missing from Trump s rhetoric, who made the construction of a  big beautiful wall  of concrete and steel a centerpiece of his campaign, and who has more recently cited a lack of additional funding for it as the reason for partially shutting down the government.The president selected Barr to replace Jeff Sessions as attorney general after forcing Sessions out over Trump s lingering outrage for his recusal from the Russia investigation. A transcript of the PBS interview was included in thousands of pages of documents Barr produced to the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee ahead of a confirmation hearing.Trump s ambition for a wall has given way to a more modest reality, with the president now describing the barrier as  artistically designed steel slats  and saying he doesn t care what people call it.
                    Immigration
                    By ASSOCIATED PRESSHis former chief of staff John Kelly told The Los Angeles Times in an interview published Sunday that Trump had abandoned the notion of  a solid concrete wall early on in the administration. Trump seemed to respond to Kelly with a tweet Monday morning saying  an all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED. Whatever the terminology, border security remains the central sticking point in the partial government shutdown. Trump is seeking $5 billion for a wall. Newly empowered congressional Democrats have resisted the demand in favor of enhanced technology.In the 1992 interview with PBS host Jim Lehrer, Barr said the Justice Department was taking steps to control illegal immigration and that  there are some barriers that have reduced violence and made it easier to interdict the aliens crossing. But he expressed ambivalence about an expansive wall, saying,  They generally try to go up through certain specified routes and, in fact, we re only talking about a 200-mile area where there s appreciable crossings, illegal crossings, and in fact, 40 to 50 percent of the illegal crossings in the United States occur on a 14-mile stretch south of San Diego. Even if Barr does not embrace a sprawling border wall, there are other indications his immigration views won t depart much from the aggressive stance of the White House and of Sessions, whose Justice Department defended a travel ban that blocked arrivals from some Muslim-majority countries and backed a since-abandoned enforcement policy that separated children from parents at the border.Barr defended the legality of Trump s travel ban in a February 1, 2017, Washington Post opinion piece, saying complaints that it was discriminatory were  baseless  since only a handful of countries were singled out and the criterion for their inclusion  was not that they were Muslim but that the risk of terrorist infiltration from these countries is especially high.  He and other recent Republican attorneys general praised Sessions in a separate op-ed for  attacking the rampant illegality that riddled our immigration system. Missing out on the latest scoops?

                        In interviews with POLITICO, advisers and allies project confidence that perceptions of her as cold or aloof will fade once people see her campaign.
                    By NATASHA KORECKI12/31/2018 12:00 PM ESTThe anti-Elizabeth Warren narrative was written before the Massachusetts senator even announced she was exploring a presidential run.She s too divisive and too liberal, Washington Democrats have complained privately. Her DNA rollout was a disaster   and quite possibly a White House deal-breaker. She s already falling in the polls, and   perhaps most stinging   shares too many of the attributes that sank Hillary Clinton.Story Continued BelowIn the year of the woman, it adds up to one unwelcome mat for the most prominent woman likely to be part of the 2020 field. But it also presents an unmistakable challenge: How does Warren avoid a Clinton redux   written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground?In interviews with POLITICO, nearly a half-dozen current and former Warren advisers and associates acknowledged the rap on her, even as they dismissed it as little more than D.C. chatter. Any comparison to Clinton will recede, they said, once Warren hits the campaign trail in early states and weaves her own narrative in front of real voters. Amplified by an advanced video and digital operation her team has assembled over the past year-and-a-half, in part to help humanize her as a candidate, Warren will quickly remind people of her early years as an anti-Wall Street, pro-consumer crusader, they argue.Those attributes will thrust her back to the front of the Democratic pack, those close to Warren predict.The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know. Follow our presidential election coverage.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Elizabeth is not that,  a onetime Warren adviser said of portrayals of the senator as cold or unlikable. The person was given anonymity to address the Clinton comparison frankly.  I don t think it s fair. I know her. I think she is a warm and affectionate person. Once she s on the stump and gets going on her economic message, she s quite good   Hillary had three decades  worth of animosity   it was just the way the world had treated her   that had built a crust around her that you really couldn t penetrate. I don t feel like Elizabeth has that kind of edge to her.  All of us are just scratching our heads over why this is happening. She has a great operation, she s very smart about it all,  added Warren s biographer, Antonia Felix.  She s not just a viable candidate, she s someone who can actually win. It s like they re throwing cold water on that. Others see sexism in the barrage of Warren criticism and alleged parallels to Clinton. If there s a public perception that s personally rankled Warren, it s the depiction that she s cold, according to one of her former advisers.  They say that about women   anybody who runs for president. As you go up the political ladder and go up in the polls, you will get that criticism,  said Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based Democratic strategist.  First it was Hillary Clinton. Then it was Nancy Pelosi. Now it s Elizabeth Warren. Who knows who is behind her. Fair or not, Warren will have work to do to overcome wariness of her likely candidacy. A USA Today/Suffolk poll released last week assessing excitement behind potential 2020 Democratic candidates showed a net negative for Warren   more people opposed the idea of her candidacy for president than supported it. And a quarterly poll of Iowa Democrats saw Warren s standing among potential White House seekers drop 7 percentage points   16 percent to 9 percent   from September to December.Likely driving those numbers was the DNA episode, which dominated media coverage of Warren in the weeks leading up to the midterms. Unlike her counterparts in the Senate who are eyeing a White House run, Warren skipped visits to Iowa and even nearby New Hampshire during the campaign.Though Warren wasn t absent from the election   she spent or helped raise $11 million for Democratic candidates in early states and other competitive midterm races   skipping early states and the usual media bump that goes with those trips arguably contributed to her struggle so far to craft a national narrative. From an earned-media perspective she hasn t been out defining herself. She s been defined by the speculative echo chamber that is Washington and  potential Democratic 2020 rivals, said Democratic strategist Dave Jacobson.Warren s camp has been taking steps to prepare for her first full-fledged introduction to a national audience. In 2017, the campaign hired on a full-time videographer and now has several staffers dedicated solely to video. So far, Warren has invested more heavily in her digital infrastructure than any of her potential 2020 Democratic competitors. 
                    2020 Elections 
                    By NATASHA KORECKIOne purpose of the ubiquitous video is to capture Warren in more relatable, personable moments and move them to social media platforms. Last week, for instance, while waiting at the airport for holiday travel, Warren recorded what looked to be an off-the-cuff video blasting President Donald Trump for his  tantrum  that prompted a government shutdown.Felix and other longtime associates of Warren say the senator s ability to explain kitchen table economic issues to middle-class voters will shatter any  Pocahontas  caricature built up by the right. Those skills will become evident once she starts traveling to early states like Iowa and New Hampshire, which is expected in January. Once Warren is in front of crowds, they say, her bona fides as a working-class champion that shot her to national prominence, with best-selling books and daytime television sessions with Dr. Phil, will break through, they argue. When it comes to the questions about her likability, Warren s been there before.In her first Senate campaign in 2012, Warren ran on a populist economic message but was depicted as detached from the average voter   someone who dined with intellectuals at Harvard   while her competitor positioned himself as a regular guy. We were running against a Republican in Scott Brown whose whole case was likability. He was the person you wanted to have a beer with,  said Doug Rubin, a Boston-based Democratic consultant who worked on Warren s 2012 campaign. Rubin said what ultimately resonated with voters was Warren s ability to explain the complex economic issues that average people face.  I think there is a real power in her values and her work. Warren s reputation as standoffish stemmed in part from the arms-length distance at which she kept reporters in the Senate hallways, where until recently she rarely stopped for interviews. The early intent was for Warren to project more  workhorse than showhorse,  but a different perception took hold. It got under Warren s skin,  the former adviser said. Warren would say:   Now I m being portrayed as this aloof person.  She didn t like that. Kate Donaghue, a grass-roots Democratic organizer and Democratic National Committee member in Boston, described Warren as someone who thrives on relationships: calling all of her major supporters on their birthdays, moving to the other side of a crowded room to give a quick hello hug, and often being the main star at Donaghue s annual holiday party. But like Clinton, gendered terms like  shrill  or  scoldy,  are already ascribed to Warren, as people dismiss her as a viable 2020 contender, said Adam Jentleson, a progressive strategist and former staffer to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). What s been lost in recent coverage of Warren, he said, are her talents as a public speaker who can connect with the average person. She is an extremely powerful speaker, and I think that s something that is not mentioned very often and I wonder why,  he said.  The case against her is she s too divisive, she s made some missteps and therefore she s done. I think people who think that haven t seen her work a room recently.   Anybody who discounts her raw power as a speaker is making a big mistake. 
                    
                    By BEATRICE JIN, KATELYN FOSSETT, ISABEL DOBRIN, EMILY GOLDBERG, BRENT D. GRIFFITHS, ALENA SADIQ and JUDAH TAYLORBut the biggest criticism facing Warren was her October decision to release a DNA test in defense of her claims of Native American heritage. The move, and the way she carried it out, was roundly blasted as a political miscalculation. She was criticized for seeming to play into Trump s taunts of her as  Pocahontas.  Warren was also panned for the timing of the rollout, less than a month before critical midterm elections. Democrats called it a distraction at a time when party leaders needed to unify behind a message to defeat Republicans and some condemned her as having played into Trump s hands.To Warren s team, addressing claims of Native American ancestry and whether they played a role in Warren s ascent as an academic at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Law was a necessary evil that was dealt with over the course of months in 2018. That included opening up to The Boston Globe, which in an investigation found that Warren s ancestry claims played no role in her hiring at Harvard or four prior positions at other law schools.If Warren were to run for president, it was an issue that had to be detonated with plenty of breathing room before the 2020 cycle, several sources with knowledge of the decision said. So far, though, it has stubbornly stuck around.Patty Judge, the former Iowa lieutenant governor who funds the quarterly Iowa poll that saw Warren s approval fall by 7 points, attributed the drop to the negative reports after Warren s DNA release. That could change once Warren brandishes her retail side, she said. She s dynamite when you re with her. She s magnetic. She s very compelling,  Judge said.  Probably what she needs to do is get out here and get a lane established for herself. Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/31/2018 08:13 PM ESTNancy Pelosi is trying to put Mitch McConnell in a bind over President Donald Trump s border wall   and leave the Senate GOP shouldering the blame for a government shutdown with no end in sight.The presumptive House speaker, along with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, together announced plans on New Year s Eve to pass bills funding the quarter of the government that s shut down since the president refused to sign any bill without big border security funding increases. Story Continued BelowPelosi s new House Democratic majority will pass a legislative package delivering funding for nonimmigration enforcement departments that have shuttered during the impasse, plus a stop gap bill funding the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, which would only offer a short-term punt to the ongoing impasse over a border barrier.Under McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate won t pass the legislation without the support of the president, which is unlikely given Trump s recent comments. On Monday night, Trump dismissed Pelosi s gambit. The Democrats will probably submit a Bill, being cute as always, which gives everything away but gives NOTHING to Border Security, namely the Wall,  he said on Twitter.That leaves Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Schumer (D-N.Y.), who are hoping to pin the political fallout from the shutdown on McConnell for declining to challenge the president. McConnell, like Trump, is up for reelection in 2020.  The president is using the government shutdown to try to force an expensive and ineffective wall upon the American people, but Democrats have offered two bills which separate the arguments over the wall from the government shutdown,  the two Democratic leaders said.  If Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans refuse to support the [bill without DHS funding] then they are complicit with President Trump in continuing the Trump shutdown.

You can unsubscribe at any time.A short-term spending bill passed the Senate by voice vote this month after both McConnell and Schumer endorsed it. Schumer and Pelosi said  it would be the height of irresponsibility and political cynicism for Senate Republicans to now reject the same legislation they have already supported. But Trump has said he wouldn t sign it and the House never took it up, instead passing a bill with billions more for the border wall than Senate Democrats will support. The 115th Congress will now adjourn without a solution, and Pelosi will take the speaker s gavel in the middle of a shutdown now on its 10th day.Republicans dismissed the Democrats  move as unproductive considering the widespread belief that Trump won t sign anything shorts funding for his wall. He told Fox News in an interview airing Monday evening that  we are not giving up  on the fight, and signing on to Pelosi s plan would be a massive cave to Democrats after his constant attacks on Pelosi and Schumer.  They re saying post-shutdown they don t want a solution. They want to just punt everything and have the same impasse in February,  said a GOP aide familiar with ongoing spending negotiations.  Their bills aren t drafted with bipartisan consultation. It s just a political exercise for them. Pelosi s plans put a new spotlight on McConnell, who along with other Senate Republicans believed that Trump would sign that short-term bill funding the government after meeting with Vice President Mike Pence. McConnell has largely withdrawn from the debate since then, succinctly taking to the floor after the shutdown began to declare the Senate won t pass a spending bill that the president doesn t support.

                    By ELI OKUNHouse Democrats intend to vote on the plan Thursday, the same day they officially take control of the House from Republicans. Pelosi did not confer with McConnell before making her move. After the House passes the package, McConnell could then take up those bills and amend them and try and send them back to the House. He could also ignore them, or simply vote them down. Democrats are hopeful there will be pressure from moderate Republicans to pass the package of non-DHS bills and isolate the shutdown to just the department tasked with patrolling the border. Pelosi s strategy is  designed to put Republicans on the spot,  a senior Democratic aide said, by using six of the Senate s own spending bills, which already have broad support from both parties. Trump tweeted that Democrats need to  come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security.  And Rep. Mark Meadows, a House conservative who is close with Trump, blasted the measure as a  nonstarter  on Monday afternoon. Nancy Pelosi s newest funding proposal doesn t represent any serious attempt to secure our border or find a compromise,  Meadows posted on Twitter.
                    Government Shutdown 
                    By BURGESS EVERETT and GABBY ORRStill, Democrats  move breaks a stale debate over the shutdown and is an attempt to restart negotiations that have been remarkably lifeless since the shutdown began the weekend before Christmas. The House and Senate had pro forma sessions on Monday, and no updates were given by GOP leaders. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) opened and shut the Senate, then took a back route out of the Capitol as reporters waited for him.With Trump unwilling to budge on his border funding demands, most lawmakers   including the top leaders   left town before Christmas while roughly 800,000 workers were either furloughed or forced to work without pay. Trump is almost certain to reject the Democrats  plan on Homeland Security, with his advisers demanding at least $2.1 billion for the border project in recent days.But Democrats hope they can tempt McConnell, a former appropriator, to bring up the other massive funding package to dramatically shrink the effects of a federal shutdown.The plan could carry political risks for the Democratic Party, though, which has been historically split on immigration policy. This week, House Democrats will be swearing in new members, some of whom want to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency altogether. Other wings of the party, such as unions, have been more skeptical of immigration reform. Democrats  plan also does not include several of the other must-pass items that House Democrats plan to tackle in the new year. That includes an extension of the Violence Against Women Act, which expired Dec. 21. It also will not include the billions of dollars in disaster aid that lawmakers from California, Florida and Alabama requested this fall to deal with wildfire and hurricane damage.Pelosi plans to hold separate votes on those issues in the coming weeks, according to the House Democratic aide.

                    Updated 12/31/2018 06:22 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump on Monday demanded Democrats come back to Washington early to approve funding for a wall at the border with Mexico, as a government shutdown over the issue threatens to stretch well into January. I m in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall,  Trump tweeted. Though he said he was in the West Wing, there was no Marine posted outside that section of the White House, the usual indicator that the president is there, according to a pool report. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley tweeted later Monday that he had just seen Trump  sitting behind the Resolute Desk working. Story Continued BelowTrump canceled plans to travel to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to stay in Washington over the shutdown. It s incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a Wall doesn t work,  Trump continued on Twitter.  It does, and properly built, almost 100%! They say it s old technology - but so is the wheel. They now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying!  I spent Christmas in the White House, I spent New Year s Eve now in the White House,  Trump said in advance excerpts released later Monday from an interview with Fox News  Pete Hegseth.  And you know, I m here, I m ready to go. It s very important. A lot of people are looking to get their paycheck, so I m ready to go whenever they want. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi returned to Washington on Monday afternoon.Trump also has pushed back hard on comments from his outgoing chief of staff, John Kelly, who told the Los Angeles Times in an exit interview this weekend that plans for a  solid concrete wall  were dropped early in Trump s tenure.The 2020 Election.

Republicans still have unified control of government. Lawmakers will return to Washington later this week, when Democrats will take control of the House. But Democratic leaders appear to be waiting for Trump to offer publicly a government funding deal that differs from his repeated demands for wall money.Trump also contended that Democrats voted to fund a border wall before he became president, which congressional Republicans have also argued during the shutdown. In fact, the Democrats voted for additional fencing at the border in 2006 and for a comprehensive immigration package in 2013 that also included some fencing. The 2013 bill was eventually killed by Republicans.Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning   in your inbox.

                        White House 
                    By CAITLIN OPRYSKO12/31/2018 09:13 AM ESTPresident Donald Trump insisted Monday that his administration has  never abandoned  plans to construct a literal wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, breaking with his outgoing chief of staff, who said such plans were left behind early in Trump s presidency. An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media,  the president wrote on Twitter.  Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me! Story Continued BelowAlthough Trump blamed the media for suggesting that his administration had abandoned plans for a wall, it was, in fact, White House chief of staff John Kelly who said as much in an interview over the weekend with the Los Angeles Times. Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general who first served Trump as secretary of Homeland Security before taking on the chief of staff role, will leave administration this week. To be honest, it s not a wall,  Kelly said.  The president still says  wall    oftentimes frankly he ll say  barrier  or  fencing,  now he s tended toward steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it. The president s long-promised border wall has taken center stage over the holiday season, with Trump refusing to sign government-funding legislation that does not include significant appropriations for his signature campaign promise. Democrats, who will take control of the House of Representatives this week, have thus far refused to meet the president s demand, closing wide swaths of the government for a shutdown now in its 10th day.The 2020 Election. The New Congress. The Mueller Investigation. Be in the Know.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Trump and his advisers have at times sought to downplay the image of a concrete wall along the border, with the president arguing instead that the wall could be composed of steel slats so that it would be see-through. But the president has also insisted that the U.S. needs a  good old fashioned wall  along its southern border in order to be secure.Critics of the wall have said the White House demand for $5 billion in funding would be a waste of money that could be better spent adding Border Patrol personnel or investing in other kinds of barriers or monitoring technology, which Kelly said he heard while he was in charge at the Department of Homeland Security.The outgoing chief of staff told the L.A. Times that when he conferred with Customs and Border Patrol agents who  actually secure the border,  they told him,   well we need a physical barrier in certain places, we need technology across the board, and we need more people.   Trump claimed Monday that a  powerful  border wall was key to his campaign pledge of border security and called on congressional Democrats to return to Washington and address the issue, though Republicans still control both chambers of Congress for a few more days. At a meeting with Democratic leaders earlier this month, Trump declared he would be  proud  to shut down the government over his border wall and pledged  I will be the one to shut it down. I m not going to blame you for it.  Our Southern Border has long been an  Open Wound,  where drugs, criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country.

BloombergSHUTDOWN LATEST   BURGESS EVERETT and GABBY ORR:  Inside the Pence-Schumer showdown :  For two straight days, Mike Pence and Chuck Schumer traded proposals and sat face-to-face in a breakneck sequence of meetings to prevent   then quickly end   a government shutdown. In reality, though, the back-channel talks never stood a chance. The failure by two men with little shared history and no apparent personal chemistry highlighted a critical difference between this showdown and those in the past: For years under President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell each maneuvered his party out of repeated political crises. But under President Donald Trump, who s made no concerted effort to establish a genuine rapport with congressional Democrats, there s no such release valve.  POLITICOTHE PRESIDENT VS. JOHN KELLY -- @realDonaldTrump at 7:51 a.m.:  An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!  ... at 8:03 a.m.:  If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria, which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President, they would be a national hero. ISIS is mostly gone, we re slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting ISIS remnants...... ... at 8:12 a.m.:  ...I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places. Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media, or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived, like to complain about me & my tactics, which are working. Just doing what I said I was going to do! ... at 8:19 a.m.:  .....Except the results are FAR BETTER than I ever said they were going to be! I campaigned against the NEVER ENDING WARS, remember! -- Yesterday afternoon he tweeted:  President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound. I agree, totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing, slightly larger version! Good Monday morning.

If they re especially good or funny or poignant, we just might publish them. Email them to daniel@politico.com. With that, here are  Six Smart Thoughts on the Stupid Shutdown,  from our colleague JOHN BRESNAHAN, POLITICO s Capitol Hill bureau chief:1) House GOP hardliners don t have an end game strategy. The Freedom Caucus types know how to start a fight, but they don t know how to end one. This feels like the 2013 government shutdown for House GOP hardliners all over again, except this time Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) won t bail them out. There aren t many good options here since there s no clear bailout opportunity, or backroom dealmakers who can talk this out in private.2) Few Republicans are breaking with Trump. The shutdown won t end until that happens. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) made some noise on Sunday, but it was just Graham freelancing. Rs are sticking with Trump so far, especially McConnell. Dems are counting on R senators who are up for re-election in 2020 (Cory Gardner, Thom Tillis, Susan Collins) to pressure McConnell to put a stop to this. So far, it hasn t happened. Congress hasn t been in session, either, which makes this the strangest shutdown ever. That changes later this week when the press begins to hound rank-and-file lawmakers and leadership to find a solution.3) Trump s threat to shut down the border feels like a bluff, according to top GOP and Democratic sources. Even Republicans say that in private. It s a  nuclear bomb  that will do serious damage to the U.S. economy and shock Wall Street. No one believes Trump will go that far, even though White House aides continue to study the issue.4) What we have here is a failure to communicate. In this age of hyper-partisanship, all anyone cares about is messaging to their own side. That makes it harder for lawmakers to work across the aisle.5) Trump and GOP leaders have misjudged how much  The Wall  has become a moral issue for Democrats. The president is counting on pressuring Dems -- via the government employee unions -- to get the anti-wall activists to back down. But for Dems, rejecting the wall has become a rejection of all that is Trumpism. Stop the wall, the thinking goes, and you stop Trump -- even if he is still president.6) Trump will actually have to lead us out of this morass. Dems don t trust him; Republicans don t totally trust him either. He will have to put an offer directly to Pelosi and Schumer -- then back it up publicly -- for anyone to even start negotiating. Nobody else can do it -- not Mike Pence, not Mick Mulvaney, not Jared Kushner. It has to be Trump.YIKES --  Videos: Migrant children dragged, pushed at Southwest Key shelter,  by Arizona Republic s Mary Jo Pitzl:  Videos from a Southwest Key shelter for migrant children show staffers dragging and pushing children, incidents that occurred shortly before the federal government suspended the shelter s operations early this fall.

As we continue to pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world, drug companies continue to pocket billions of dollars. They can afford to spend nearly $175 million for lobbying, and more than $6 billion for advertising, and yet we re supposed to believe they can t find a way to lower prices? Americans shouldn t have to choose between buying medication and buying food for our families. It s time for Congress to step up and put people before profits. Stop the greed.

                    Updated 12/31/2018 05:42 PM ESTSen. Elizabeth Warren is officially in the hunt for the White House.The Massachusetts Democrat and former Harvard Law professor filed papers Monday creating an exploratory presidential committee, becoming the first major potential 2020 contender to do so in what s anticipated to be a sprawling Democratic field.Story Continued BelowAt the same time, her campaign blasted out an email to supporters that included a high-quality, biographical video that delved into her hardscrabble roots in Oklahoma, her crusades as a consumer advocate and her battles as a Donald Trump antagonist. America s middle class is under attack,  Warren declares in the video announcement.  How did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie, and they enlisted politicians to cut  em a fatter slice. Warren, whose 2017 Senate floor clash with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spawned the  nevertheless, she persisted  rallying cry, is expected to quickly follow up with a travel schedule that will take her to early presidential states, including Iowa and New Hampshire. That travel schedule will be subject to any Senate action on the ongoing government shutdown.The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know. Follow our presidential election coverage.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

She has already assembled a staff of more than 70 people, and the $12.5 million in her campaign account puts her on solid footing ahead of a likely campaign.Launching the exploratory committee gives Warren a legal mechanism to ramp up fundraising and officially lock down key operatives in early states whom her team has courted for weeks. If she fully takes the plunge, the senator is expected to make a more robust presidential campaign announcement at a later date.In her email to supporters, Warren portrayed herself as a fighter for the middle class standing up to  a bunch of billionaires and giant corporations  writing their own rules in Washington:  That s not how government is supposed to work. You know it. I know it. And we know it is time to fight back.  Her video, which intercuts footage of the senator speaking directly to the camera with footage from her life and campaigns, delivered a similar message of economic injustice as she traced her history as a consumer advocate who was behind the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. On Monday, Warren emerged from her home along with her husband, Bruce and their dog, to talk to reporters. Warren said since her morning announcement, she had already received campaign contributions from all 50 states. She was asked whether she would change anything about her DNA rollout and if she were too polarizing for a national audience. Each time she steered back to a message about the economy.  I m in this fight all the way,  she said.  Right now Washington works great for the wealthy and the well connected. It s just not working for anyone else.  The political world has readied for a glut of potential presidential contenders to begin announcing in early 2019, with eyes on top-tier candidates like Warren and Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand. Even a change to Warren s Twitter handle on Saturday   from @elizabethforma to @ewarren   didn t go unnoticed, prompting 2020 buzz online.With her move on Monday, Warren got a jump on like-minded Senate colleagues, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), with whom she s expected to compete most closely for the progressive-minded supporters he attracted in his 2016 run. Like Sanders, Warren holds a massive email list and formidable ability to raise small-donor money online. She enters with arguably the most advanced campaign infrastructure of a crowded roster of potential candidates. Still, she also enters the fray at a time when the Democratic roster is expected to be the most diverse in the party s history, including Senate colleagues equally adept at mesmerizing crowds. In 2016, Warren refused the call of a  Ready for Warren  draft effort that tried to lure her into the Democratic primary. Now, she finds herself in a different moment, battling a caricature of a Massachusetts liberal amid unrelenting blowback from her decision last fall to release DNA results and answer questions about her Native American heritage.

GRIFFITHS, ALENA SADIQ and JUDAH TAYLOREven her largest home-state newspaper, The Boston Globe, declared recently she was too divisive, had missed her moment and should therefore sit out 2020. In a November POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, 5 percent of those surveyed said Warren was their first choice to be the Democratic nominee in 2020. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sanders and outgoing Texas Rep. Beto O Rourke led the prospective field.Warren s creation of an exploratory committee comes after months of careful deliberations and meticulous planning. For more than a year, the senator took a series of steps signaling her White House aspirations. She released 10 years of tax returns, introduced a major anti-corruption legislative package, published policy papers and delivered major speeches, including on foreign policy and race.In September, Warren told the media she would become more accessible in the Senate hallways, after years of avoiding impromptu gaggles with the national media. When I first came here, I had never run for office before and never been a public official. I thought it was important for me to put my head down and learn how to do this job,  Warren said at the time.  But with Donald Trump attacking the free press, I started thinking again about my responsibilities to be more accessible to the press here in Washington. Last month, Warren staffers were scouting presidential headquarters locations in the Boston area. The senator herself placed dozens of calls to elected officials, candidates, labor leaders and others in early presidential states.Warren entered the Senate in 2013 amid fanfare, including immediate speculation about a future presidential run. Already a liberal icon, she became the state s first female senator and raised nearly $40 million, a sum that at the time ranked her among the most prodigious Senate fundraisers in history.She had a major a breakout moment in 2017, when McConnell reprimanded her as she read a letter from civil rights icon Coretta Scott King. She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,  McConnell said then. It became an instant meme for the left, symbolizing Democrats  resistance to the Trump administration. Warren later launched a merchandising campaign off of the  she persisted  mantra, and more recently, geographically specific  Persist  groups backing Warren have sprung up on Facebook. Warren catapulted to the national stage with her 2003 book The Two-Income Trap, which immediately branded her as an expert in pocketbook economics.Eli Okun contributed to this story.

                        Government Shutdown 
                        Two men with no shared history or apparent personal chemistry are charged with ending the shutdown.
                    By BURGESS EVERETT and GABBY ORR12/31/2018 05:05 AM ESTFor two straight days, Mike Pence and Chuck Schumer traded proposals and sat face-to-face in a breakneck sequence of meetings to prevent   then quickly end   a government shutdown. In reality, though, the back-channel talks never stood a chance.Story Continued BelowThe failure by two men with little shared history and no apparent personal chemistry highlighted a critical difference between this showdown and those in the past: For years under President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell each maneuvered his party out of repeated political crises. But under President Donald Trump, who s made no concerted effort to establish a genuine rapport with congressional Democrats, there s no such release valve. That s largely why the two sides find themselves with no obvious way out of a week-plus government shutdown that s threatening to stretch well into January.Pence and Schumer (D-N.Y.) approached the shutdown assignment under near-impossible conditions   with Trump demanding his border wall money and Democrats just as insistent he not get it. On top of that, the schmoozing Brooklynite and buttoned-up Hoosier lack the relationship that Biden and McConnell had built up over decades working together in the Senate. And they have minimal political space to strike a deal, as questions persist whether anyone, even the vice president, can negotiate on behalf of Trump.The 2020 Election. The New Congress. The Mueller Investigation. Be in the Know.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Privately, some Republicans said the talks between the vice president and the Senate minority leader looked like little more than a sideshow mounted to create the appearance of action. The whole thing is so ridiculous it is hard to imagine anything being serious,  said one Republican senator of the Pence-Schumer talks.On the Friday before Christmas and with hours to spare before the deadline, it appeared that Pence and Schumer might have something. Rank-and-file Republicans persuaded the president to send Pence to the Capitol along with White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner. They met extensively with Schumer, and hopes rose that a shutdown could be averted.A senior White House official said Trump dispatched the trio to meet with Schumer   a move that came at the request of Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.)    because of their experience negotiating on the Hill.  A second aide suggested that Pence was doing the dirty work because Trump didn t want to be in a room with the New York Democrat after their relationship disintegrated during a stunning public squabble in the Oval Office earlier this month. The vice president was very direct about the position of the White House during their latest meeting, and he went down there to make sure that was communicated properly,  the senior White House official told POLITICO.Yet Schumer didn t entirely buy that Pence had authority from the president to negotiate. Democrats say Trump s allies have offered so many different messages on the shutdown that they can hardly keep track: from the conciliatory words conveyed by press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders days before funding lapsed, to the hard-line stance from House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) once the shutdown began.So when Schumer and Pence sat down on Dec. 22   the last real substantive talks between Democrats and Republicans   hopes were dim that the two could strike a deal that could satisfy both the president the Democratic base. And Pence s request for roughly half the $5 billion for the wall that the president wanted was quickly dismissed by Democrats. 
                    Congress
                    By DAVID COHEN Senator Schumer made clear to the vice president, in private after their Saturday meeting, that the offer would not pass the Senate, and told the vice president that we would not consider any offer the president has not publicly endorsed, given that the president has changed his position so many times,  said Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer.Since then, it s been all blame game: White House officials have castigated Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for refusing to speak to them, and the Democrats have insisted that the White House can t seem to comprehend they won t bend on the border wall.Though Schumer has the instincts of a deal-maker, he s responded to his party s activist base by refusing to meet Trump even halfway on his border demands. The minority leader even rescinded a previous bipartisan compromise of $1.6 billion for fencing along the border, shaving it down to $1.3 billion, in line with Pelosi s figure.Pence, by all appearances, has little sway over Trump s bottom line. The vice president had strongly indicated to Republican senators that the president would sign a short-term spending bill into February that lacked wall spending   only to watch Trump disavow a short-term fix.Democrats are skeptical that $2.5 billion, give or take, that Pence sought from Schumer earlier this month was blessed by Trump.A source close to Pence said the vice president was sent at the direction of Trump and had a  respectful  dialogue with Schumer, despite the absence of meaningful progress. I hope they made some progress. Mike can get along with anybody, and I think Chuck would, but I think he s got a different constituency,  said Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), referring to pressure on Schumer from the left.Schumer s office reassured progressive groups ahead of the meeting that he would not bend to Pence s position, said Angel Padilla, policy director for Indivisible. Padilla said ever since Schumer stopped advocating for the bipartisan bill and its $1.6 billion in fencing, the Democratic leader has  stayed strong.  He is Schumer, and we will always be concerned about a deal,  Padilla said.  We re with him as long he sticks to [a bill to reopen the government without wall funding]. But if he starts negotiating wall money, we re not with him. Some Democrats view Trump as so toxic   his approval rating dropped to 39 percent in a Morning Consult survey released the day the government shut down   that they have a hard time envisioning making any deal directly with him. That increases the importance of having a fallback between leaders like Pence and Schumer.
                    Media 
                    By MARY NEWMANBut their relationship was practically nonexistent until now. Schumer had left the House by the time Pence was elected in 2000. And though Pence, as Trump s No. 2, frequently comes to the Capitol for weekly Senate GOP lunches, he doesn t stop by Schumer s office and rarely speaks to him by phone.Pence and Schumer have had few substantive discussions other than when Pence notifies congressional leaders of U.S. military action, according to a former Democratic leadership aide. It s not that they don t get along. Rather, Schumer and his party view the Trump White House as mercurial and uninterested in creating bipartisan relationships. I don t think this is personal or personality driven. It all stems from the fact that this White House is not set up to have entrees to Democrats,  the aide said.  They could be best buddies and cook up the greatest deals and then walk into the Oval Office and the president could tell them to pound sand. Pence and Schumer will have more opportunities in the coming months to steer Washington away from crisis. The debt ceiling will expire sometime next year, creating the potential for a much more substantive financial crisis. Biden and McConnell clinched a deal in 2011 to avoid a default on the government debt, then a year later hatched an agreement to increase taxes on the wealthy. But the current vice president and minority leader have a ways to go to establish a working relationship.Asked whether there are any Senate Democrats with whom the vice president shares a close working relationship, a senior White House official deadpanned,  He has a good relationship with Jeff Flake,  the outgoing Republican Trump critic from Arizona.

                    Updated 12/30/2018 04:36 PM ESTThe White House is searching for a line of attack against Democrats in its border-funding fight, but can t seem to find one that sticks.President Donald Trump and his top aides have sought to blame Democrats in a slew of ways for the government shutdown, now in its ninth day. One minute, Trump aides and allies are accusing Democrats of staying out of talks. The next, they re blaming House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi s own bid to be speaker. Story Continued BelowThey even tried, unsuccessfully, to drive a wedge between Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).At the same time, Republicans can t say what kind of deal Trump would accept to reopen the government, or how he would work with Democrats once they retake the House in just four days.Trump has made no public appearances in several days, only firing off tweets that blame Democrats for the shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) have been largely silent as they await a cue from the president. It is clear that the White House is flailing,  Drew Hammill, Pelosi s spokesman, said Sunday.  They ve repeatedly tried to shift blame in ways that are simply not credible. Amid the White House s continuing incoherence, Democrats have stayed united and on message.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) floated his own idea to end the standoff over border security that has halted roughly one-quarter of federal operations.Graham, the next chairman of the influential Senate Judiciary Committee, pitched a plan on CNN on Sunday that would tie legal protections for young immigrants known as  Dreamers  to a $5 billion measure to fund a border wall. There is a deal to be had, I think, if the president would get behind it,  said Graham, a Trump confidant who planned to have lunch with the president on Sunday afternoon.That proposal remains a long shot, especially after Trump himself called off a deal to revive the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program this spring in return for $25 billion for his border wall.There is also little interest on Capitol Hill at the moment. Senate GOP leaders have not endorsed the idea, and Pelosi said this month that she was unwilling to trade legal status for so-called Dreamers for money for a border wall that she considers  immoral. After huddling with Trump on Sunday afternoon, Graham suggested that the president was indeed considering his plan to pair $5 billion for border fencing with broader immigration reforms.  After lunch, I ve never been more encouraged. If we can get people talking, we can find our way out of this mess,  Graham told reporters at the White House. The president was upbeat. He was in a very good mood and I think he s receptive to making a deal if it achieves his goal of securing our border and I think we can get there if everybody will start talking to each other,  Graham said.Still, talks to reopen the government are virtually nonexistent as the partial shutdown enters its second full week.
                    Government Shutdown
                    By GABBY ORR and QUINT FORGEYThe House will return for a pro forma session Monday, though no business will conducted until lawmakers return Thursday.With the standoff lengthening, early polling shows that Trump is paying a political price.More people blame him than Democrats in Congress for the shutdown. Forty-seven percent of people held Trump responsible, compared with 33 percent who blamed Democrats, according to a poll by Reuters/Ipsos released on Thursday.And just 25 percent of people support Trump s decision to shutter government operations over his border-funding demands.Kellyanne Conway, Trump s longtime adviser, said on Sunday that the president is ready to strike a broader deal on security whenever Democratic leaders are willing to resume talks, arguing that Democrats  completely walked away from the table.  We haven t heard from them. It s complete crickets,  Conway said on CNN.Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the House majority whip, specifically blamed Schumer in a Sunday appearance on Fox News. If the Senate s got a different way and a better way to approach border security, they ought to put that plan on the table. Chuck Schumer was for this in 2006,  Scalise said, referring to a border security law that included fencing as well as new technology.  I d be curious to know what changed. Is it just that Donald Trump s the one now requesting it? But if he s got a better way to keep this country safe, I think it s incumbent upon him to show the American people what that plan is. But Democrats maintain that it s up to the White House to offer any compromise that can actually pass the Senate. They point out that Republican leaders left town with negotiations completely stalled at the White House level, marking the House GOP s final act of its eight-year majority. At this point, it s clear the White House doesn t know what they want when it comes to border security,  Schumer spokesman Justin Goodman said on Sunday.  While one White House official says they re willing to compromise, another says the president is holding firm at no less than $5 billion for the wall. Meanwhile, the president tweets, blaming everyone but himself for a shutdown he called for more than 25 times. 
                    Congress
                    By DAVID COHENPelosi s office insists that she is ready to negotiate directly with Trump, who hasn t reached out to her since Dec. 11. The next House speaker plans to return to her Capitol Hill office Monday and Tuesday, though any breakthrough is unlikely until Thursday, when Democrats officially retake the House.During the first three days of the shutdown, Vice President Mike Pence and the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, did float a series of border-fence proposals that included less than $5 billion but were still far above the $1.3 billion that Democrats have said they would support.Since then, neither side has budged.The White House and GOP leaders have tried to blunt some of the political damage, with Trump personally urging his staff to find a workaround to pay the Coast Guard. Separately, Scalise intervened to make sure that homebuyers could still purchase flood insurance plans. Great work by my Administration over the holidays to save Coast Guard pay during this #SchumerShutdown,  Trump tweeted on Sunday.  No thanks to the Democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of Americans!  Still, agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency have exhausted their reserve funds, and are now shuttering operations until they receive their new budget. Federal workers are technically still paid for now, but that will end if a deal isn t reached before the next pay period, on Jan. 11.Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), chairman of the Appropriations Committee, acknowledged on Sunday that Republicans will lose leverage when they turn over control of the House this week, and that they will need to work better with Democrats. We re gonna have to negotiate,  he said on CBS   Face the Nation.   I think that we ought to see what do the Democrats really want. We ve got to move away from the blame game   blaming the president, blaming the Democrats, Pelosi and Schumer and others   and get back to doing what we re sent there to do, to fund the government.

                    By QUINT FORGEY12/30/2018 12:38 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump s demand for billions of dollars to fund a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border amounts to a  ransom note  for taxpayers being held  hostage  by the partial government shutdown, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said Sunday. Yes, we need comprehensive immigration reform. Yes, we need to enhance border security,  Jeffries, the incoming chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said during an interview on ABC s  This Week. Story Continued Below But we are not willing to pay $2.5 billion or $5 billion and wasting taxpayer dollars on a ransom note because Donald Trump decided that he was going to shut down the government and hold the American people hostage,  Jeffries said.  That s unreasonable. The president has requested roughly $5 billion from congressional Democrats for a barrier along the southern border, while Democrats have offered $1.3 billion for a variety of border security measures. Their inability to strike a deal by midnight on Dec. 21 has resulted in a lapse in government funding that has entered its ninth day. At its core, our responsibility in government is to manage public money,  Jeffries said.  We can either manage it efficiently or we can waste taxpayer dollars. And what Donald Trump and the Republicans want to do is waste $5 billion in taxpayer money on an ineffective medieval border wall that is a fifth-century solution to a 21st-century problem. Jeffries also said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)  are going to work expeditiously  to reopen the government on Thursday, when Democrats officially retake control of the House.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                        Government Shutdown
                    By QUINT FORGEY12/30/2018 11:55 AM ESTThe Senate s top appropriator on Sunday declared that efforts to end the partial government shutdown remain  at a standoff  and urged the White House and congressional lawmakers to stop deflecting blame. Our negotiations are at an impasse at the moment,  Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said during an interview on CBS   Face The Nation  in discussing the funding battle.Story Continued Below I wish it were not so,  Shelby continued,  but we ve got to move away from the blame game   blaming the president, blaming the Democrats, [Rep. Nancy] Pelosi and [Sen. Chuck] Schumer and others   and get back to doing what we re sent there to do: to fund the government. The shutdown began midnight Friday Dec. 21 after President Donald Trump and Democrats in Congress failed to strike a deal over his request for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The administration has publicly requested roughly $5 billion in taxpayer dollars for the project, while Democrats are offering $1.3 billion for a variety of border security measures. Right now, we re at a standoff, and I think that s not good for the Senate, the House, or America,  Shelby said Sunday, warning:  If we blame each other this could last a long, long time.

At the end of the day, all of this will end. We don t know when, in negotiations,  he said.  It s not a question of who wins or loses. Nobody s going to win this kind of game. Nobody wins in a shutdown. We all lose and we kind of look silly. Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning   in your inbox.

The chatter among people familiar with the selection process, our colleague ELIANA JOHNSON tells us, is that few outside the administration want the job of replacing JIM MATTIS as defense secretary, given the president s decision to yank American troops out of Syria and other recent moves. (Among some administration officials, there are bitter jokes about SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY.) as the real national security adviser.)-- THE TOUCH, THE FEEL OF COTTON? White House intimate SEN. TOM COTTON (R-ARK.), a former Army captain and Iraq War veteran, doesn t want to run the Pentagon, we re told. Neither does retired Gen. JACK KEANE. So PATRICK SHANAHAN may be running the E Ring indefinitely as the incoming acting secretary, unless intel chief DAN COATS, or someone else, catches Trump s fancy.-- REMEMBER, it was Coats who said  that s gonna be special  when told in July that the president was planning to meet Russian leader VLADIMIR PUTIN.

Cohen s attorney David Schwartz told Page Six:  There is a lot of interest in Michael s story, but he isn t open to doing anything at the moment because of continuing investigations.   Page SixSUNDAY BEST   SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.) floated a government funding deal proposal on CNN S  STATE OF THE UNION  with DANA BASH:  Here s what I think might work: $5 billion for the wall/border security -- Democrats have voted for more than that in the past -- married up with the BRIDGE Act, which Sen. [Dick] Durbin and I wrote, a three-year, one-time renewable work permit for the DACA population, about 700,000. We have about 400,000 TPS [Temporary Protected Status] people who came here from natural disasters and war-torn countries decades ago, their visas running out. So basically $5 billion for the wall, plus the BRIDGE Act, TPS and some legal changes to do away with some of the magnets to illegal immigration might save the day in the Senate.

JEFFRIES:  What Donald Trump and the Republicans want to do is waste $5 billion in taxpayer money on an ineffective, medieval border wall that is a 5th-century solution to a 21st-century problem. Yes we need comprehensive immigration reform, yes we need to enhance border security, but we are not willing to pay $2.5 billion or $5 billion and wasting taxpayer dollars on a ransom note because Donald Trump decided that he was going to shut down the government and hold the American people hostage.

                    By QUINT FORGEY12/30/2018 11:20 AM ESTPresident Donald Trump s border chief elaborated Sunday on how immigration officials would spend the roughly $5 billion the White House is requesting from Congress for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico frontier   insisting the taxpayer dollars would fund  not just a dumb barrier.  It s about 215 miles of wall system,  Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said on ABC s  This Week,  including in his calculations various auxiliary technologies to bolster enforcement efforts.Story Continued Below What we re talking about is not just a dumb barrier,  McAleenan said.  We re talking about sensors, cameras, lighting, access roads for our agents, a system that helps us secure that area of the border. That s what we were asking Congress. Border officials have already constructed a barrier along 35 of the 40 miles of wall funded by $300 million from the president s fiscal 2017 budget, McAleenan said    a record time for a major government procurement of this nature,  he added. And Customs and Border Protection is  already on contract and launching construction  for the portions of the wall financed through the administration s fiscal 2018 budget, McAleenan said.

                    By QUINT FORGEYMcAleenan also defended the efficacy of the proposal that has plunged the government into a more-than weeklong shutdown and a bitter, partisan funding fight. We need a barrier to help us stop that, to push into   the traffic into areas that we can control more effectively,  McAleenan said, citing mass entries and an influx of narcotics along the southern border.  We need to attack all of the different vectors that could threaten us,  he added.Missing out on the latest scoops?

Terry McAuliffe said Sunday when asked about the resolution of the partial government shutdown.Referring to President Donald Trump as the  angry, emotional, unstable man sitting in the White House,  McAuliffe told CNN s Dana Bash on  State of the Union  that Trump and his fellow Republicans are fully to blame for the shutdown   and that everybody knows the border wall at the crux of the shutdown dispute won t be built.Story Continued Below Donald Trump owns this, he said he wanted to own it in the December meeting in the Oval Office,  McAuliffe said, referring to a televised meeting that Trump held with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Maybe,  McAuliffe said,  we can get to a place where we can have immigration reform tied together with border security. And that s what we ought to do moving forward. McAuliffe, whose home state of Virginia stands to be one of the hardest hit by the shutdown since it is where so many government workers reside, has long been a vociferous critic of Trump.

It is a silly semantic argument because people who just want to say  wall, wall, wall  want it to be a four-letter word and not respect what Customs and Border Patrol and ICE tell us they need, which is enhancements at the border,  Conway said during an interview on  Fox News Sunday. Story Continued Below There may be a wall at some places, there may be steel slats, there may be technological enhancements,  Conway said.  But always saying  wall  or  no wall  is being very disingenuous and turning a complete blind eye to what is a crisis at the border when it comes to the drugs pouring in. Conway s comments come amid a partial government shutdown that began at midnight Dec. 21 and has now stretched over a week.The president also appeared to entertain backing down from his wall request in a video message posted to Twitter on Dec. 21. Blaming illegal immigration for an influx of crime, drugs and gang violence, Trump said:  The only thing that s going to stop that is great border security   with a wall, or a slat fence or whatever you want to call it. But we need a great barrier. And if we don t have it, it s never going to work.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday on CNN that a compromise on border security that  might save the day in the Senate  is possible in the Senate. At the end of the day, there s a deal to be had,  he said to  State of the Union  host Dana Bash, adding,  We need to start talking again. Story Continued BelowGraham described the outlines of a potential deal that would exchange funding for a border wall, as sought by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, in exchange for protections for so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who have grown up in the U.S. after being brought here as young children. Those protections have been sought by Democrats on the Hill. So, to my Democratic friends, there will never be a deal without wall funding, and many Republicans are going to offer something as an incentive to vote for wall funding that you have supported in the past,  Graham said.After meeting with the president later, Graham reiterated his hopes for a compromise proposal. There s a lot of distrust in town and I guess you can blame both sides for that,  Graham said.  But after lunch, I ve never been more encouraged.

You know,  Graham said,  President Trump is not going to walk away from this fight without border security funding, money for the wall, for lack of a better way of saying it. And Democrats have a chance here to work with me and others, including the president, to bring legal status to people who have very uncertain lives. Later he added,  He s not a man under siege. The president is firm in his commitment to make sure we get money for border security. Graham said he was  not asking anybody to do something new,  only asking for everyone to  rearrange the deal that was offered before.

                        The Utah Republican fiercely opposed Trump in 2016. Now he s ready to endorse the president in 2020 after finding success in the Trump era.
                    By MARIANNE LEVINE and BURGESS EVERETT12/30/2018 07:23 AM ESTIn 2016, Sen. Mike Lee made a last-ditch attempt at the Republican National Convention to derail Donald Trump from winning his party s presidential nomination   shouting on the floor until the convention chair walked off the stage. Two-and-a-half years later, he s ready to endorse Trump s reelection campaign.  Look, I had some concerns and I expressed those,  Lee said in an interview.  I ve been pleased with the number of things he s done, and he s been very helpful to me on criminal justice reform.   I ve talked to him a lot and talking to him helps me develop a relationship with him. Story Continued Below  I quite like him,  Lee said, adding that he intends to endorse Trump s presidential bid this time around. The Utah Republican is thriving in the Trump era, which has upended the Republican Party and left many of Lee s colleagues smarting over the president s erratic style. But while hawkish Republicans seethed as the president pulled out of Syria and upended plans to avert a government shutdown, December has been a good month for the libertarian-leaning Lee, who backs Trump in both fights. Lee played a key role in pushing the Trump-backed prison and sentencing overhaul in the face of resistance from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). He even kept his own whip count in a bid to pressure leadership before the bill was ultimately passed   something Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn derided as  kind of a side show.

You can unsubscribe at any time. And despite McConnell s opposition, Lee also forced to the floor a resolution to withdraw U.S. support for the Saudi-backed war in Yemen. The measure, co-sponsored with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), passed the Senate with bipartisan support.  Those two issues,  Lee said,  are examples of what can happen with an idea when you cultivate it and nurture it over the course of many years.  Meanwhile, Lee continues to strengthen ties with Trump, lunching with him and a handful of other conservative lawmakers at the White House amid a government shutdown that GOP leaders sought to avoid.  I m a big believer in the need to bolster border security and I think he is right to place emphasis on that,  Lee said of Trump. Lee s spate of successes underscores his unique strategy: He works around party leaders to get his priorities implemented. It s rubbed many of his GOP colleagues the wrong way, even as his influence has grown with a hard-line president. Lee, who has a reputation as something of a loner in the Senate, isn t abandoning his rogue tactics. Before the Senate left for the holidays he blocked passage of a bipartisan public lands bill, drawing scorn from Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). Yet not long after Gardner yelled at Lee on the floor, the two hugged it out, Lee said. As Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) put it, when Lee  disagrees with his Republican colleagues he does it in a way that sometimes maintains friendships, unlike some other members of his caucus.  As to Lee s relationship with Senate leadership, he will be  an independent actor until the day he dies,  said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a frequent foreign policy foe.

                    By MARY NEWMAN During his eight years in the Senate, Lee has played several roles, from Sen. Ted Cruz s closest political ally to bipartisan dealmaker. He s repeatedly challenged Senate leadership, but next year he is set to chair the Joint Economic Committee and will be included in influential chairmen s meetings. He will also again lead the conservative Steering Committee, which meets weekly and represents the chamber s conservative Republicans.  Though Lee still embraces the confrontational tea party politics that swept him into office and took out establishment-backed incumbent Bob Bennett in 2010, he s also earning plenty of praise from his Democratic colleagues.  Mike Lee was one of the earliest people I worked with as a United States senator on [criminal justice reform],  said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).  I still remember I was hours-old as a senator sitting on the subway with him talking about these issues. He s been such a good partner of mine, and he should be celebrated as one of the champions.  Lee s Senate colleagues describe him as hardworking and a stalwart supporter of conservative values. But he also fought publicly with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) over criminal justice reform and keeps Senate leadership at arms length. He tangled with Cornyn for weeks over how much support the criminal justice bill had. Each said he was right, although the final 87-12 vote reflected Lee s whip count, which many in the party described as overly optimistic at the time. Cornyn describes Lee as  a passionate guy  and that  there was just some misunderstanding about which whip count that the leader relies on.  Back in 2016, Lee attempted to join Senate leadership by arguing that the party s top members were subject to term limits earlier than expected, a reading of the rules that his colleagues rejected. He doesn t seem eager to seek a formal leadership post now. Lee said that while he doesn t agree with Senate GOP leaders on every issue, he tries not to surprise anyone.  I try to send signals to where I m going, what I m willing to do, what I m not,  he said. But just one day after the Senate passed the criminal justice reform bill, Lee stunned his Republican colleagues by blocking a vote on a public lands package led by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). Lee complained that the bill was airdropped on him just that morning. The argument fell flat among some of his colleagues, who privately groused that he was rewriting criminal justice reform on the fly, too.

                    By POLITICO MAGAZINE  I m pretty doggone upset,  Gardner yelled at Lee on the Senate floor.  Wonder why people are sick of this place? Because of tonight.   While Lee has often found himself at odds with Senate colleagues, he s capitalized on his relationship with the Trump administration to advance his priorities. Lee worked with Jared Kushner on criminal justice reform and with Ivanka Trump on a child tax credit that was included in the GOP s tax overhaul.  That s an example of something that didn t germinate, wasn t planted by leadership necessarily but it was a good idea,  Lee said of the tax credit. Next year, Lee plans to continue working with Ivanka Trump and Senate Republicans on a proposal that would allow new parents to use their Social Security benefits to take parental leave when a child is born and pay the money back later. He also sees an opportunity to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia, particularly with Democratic control of the House. Lee describes his strategy as waiting for the right moment for an idea to succeed. The Yemen resolution gained momentum after the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the administration s refusal to directly link Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Khashoggi s killing.  The stars aligned,  he said. Lee was also a rare GOP voice applauding Trump s move to pull U.S. troops out of Syria. Trump returned the favor, citing Lee approvingly in a tweet defending his Syria decision. For someone so used to going it alone, Lee s found a surprising ally in the White House.   I had real concerns about him,  the senator said of the president,  and have been very pleased. Missing out on the latest scoops?

                        Since Dec. 11, Trump has addressed Democratic leaders only via Twitter. For most White House aides and allies, that s a positive development.

                    Updated 12/29/2018 06:06 PM ESTNegotiations to reopen the government are happening exactly where White House aides want them   on President Donald Trump s Twitter feed.As the federal government shutdown entered its eighth day on Saturday, the president once again had no public events on his schedule. Instead, he spent the day making private calls to congressional allies, holding closed-door huddles with White House aides   and tweeting. According to White House aides and outsiders close to the administration, it s a tactic Trump will stick with in the coming days.Story Continued BelowThe strategy has raised questions even among those in Trump s own party who wonder why the president has evaded the public spotlight at a critical juncture as he tries to win $5 billion in funding for his signature issue, a southern border wall. It wasn t long ago, in the lead-up to the November midterm elections, that Trump was pounding the pavement at near-daily rallies and conducting a barrage of interviews with major newspapers and television networks to push his agenda. This time around, though, the president has mostly remained cloistered in the White House. He hasn t spoken to Democratic leaders since a jaw-dropping televised Oval Office meeting on Dec. 11 in which he sparred with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, shockingly declaring that he d be  honored  to close the government over border security. White House officials haven t even discussed a budget deal with Schumer or Pelosi since last weekend.But for most White House aides and allies, Trump s approach is a positive development. They view the president s tweets as less risky than winding news conferences, during which Trump has been known to repeat false claims and tussle with journalists. They also see a benefit in letting the news cycle play out and simply letting the president s Twitter feed amplify certain stories, such as the recent death of a California police officer who was allegedly shot by an undocumented immigrant.  I wouldn t take it as him not being engaged,  said a person close to the White House, requesting anonymity to speak candidly.  We all know he uses Twitter as his main microphone and right now, there are a lot of things percolating where it doesn t necessarily require him to be out there. 
                    Government Shutdown
                    By ANDREW RESTUCCIA, HEATHER CAYGLE and JOHN BRESNAHANTrump used the Twitter microphone on Saturday to accuse the Democrats of being more interested in investigating his administration than negotiating a deal to reopen the government. I am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security,  he wrote on Twitter, a day after conservative media lit up with images of Pelosi vacationing at a luxury Hawaiian resort.  From what I hear, they are spending so much time on Presidential Harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military! Trump has employed that same turn of phrase in a string of recent tweets, lamenting online last Sunday that  Presidential Harassment has been with me from the beginning!  Earlier this month, he tweeted that his approval rating  would be at 75%  were it not for the  Presidential Harassment  of special counsel Robert Mueller s team of federal prosecutors and the  phony Russia Witch Hunt.  And in November, Trump claimed that the  prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems  was to blame for stock market fluctuations.Hours later, the president returned to Twitter to again blame Democrats   this time for the recent deaths of a young migrant boy and girl, who died weeks apart from each other while in custody of U.S. immigration officials, and for blocking Senate Republicans from approving construction of a barrier along the border last year.The flashpoint in talks to reopen the government, which closed at midnight Dec. 21, remains Trump s request for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats have offered $1.3 billion for border security measures. Vice President Mike Pence countered that offer on Dec. 22, asking for roughly $2.5 billion during a meeting with Schumer. But White House officials have said no progress has been made since the Senate minority leader rejected the overture.

                    By QUINT FORGEYEven with the unlikely prospect that a spending deal will be reached before the incoming House Democratic majority is seated on Thursday, White House staffers have remained at work, filling up the parking lot each morning.Officials have held meetings about the shutdown, including a recent briefing on the economic impact of closing down the border   a step Trump said he might take if he didn t get his wall money   and are working to keep the executive branch running as smoothly as possible. During the January government shutdown, some senior aides were tasked with vetting visitors to the White House who had long-planned meetings or future roundtables with Trump   a task not typically included in their portfolio. The limited staff and extra hours make for an unpleasant atmosphere inside the West Wing, according to one White House official who experienced two shutdowns during his tenure. At the end of the day, you can t make up the work of 25 of your other co-workers who were told to go home,  the official told POLITICO, adding that  essential staff  versus  non-essential staff  designations only serve to exacerbate tensions between employees.  There s a lot of hurt feelings when people are deemed non-essential. A handful of those essential employees, including White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and incoming acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, have spent a portion of their time since the Christmas holiday supplementing Trump s tweets with additional comments on the status of negotiations and who s to blame for the shutdown. Mulvaney, who held court with reporters outside the White House on Friday, said Trump is  absolutely  considering closing down the U.S.-Mexico border.

The stock market has yo-yoed in recent weeks, rattled by the shutdown, questions about Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell s job security and ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.The president tweeted Saturday that he spoke over the phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying the two men  had a long and very good  conversation. Deal is moving along very well,  Trump wrote online.  If made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made! For his part, Xi said he and Trump  hope to push for a stable progress  of U.S.-China relations, according to the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency.Earlier this month, the two countries reached a deal at the G-20 summit in Argentina to continue negotiations, with Trump agreeing to delay a new round of tariffs for the time being and Xi vowing to purchase more goods from the U.S.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                            Some of President Donald Trump s closest allies on Capitol Hill and in D.C. are wondering why he didn t  instruct GOP leadership to keep Congress in town until they secured a government funding deal. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesDID TRUMP BLOW THIS SHUTDOWN? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP had an empty Washington and the captive attention of the media the last eight days. Why wasn t he on TV blasting Congress for inaction every single day?  I m the only guy who can sign a bill into law, but Congress has gone home,  he could ve said. HE STAYED HOME FROM FLORIDA, but hardly appeared on television or in public. If you re going to do the  I m working  thing, shouldn t you just do it, and sit at a table with  Nancy Pelosi  and  Chuck Schumer  place cards, and empty chairs? THE PRESIDENT has the unique ability to mold the newscycle to his liking -- especially with Congress out of town. Yet he hardly did anything publicly.FURTHER   WHY DIDN T TRUMP instruct GOP leadership to keep Congress in town until they got a deal?   If he believes his position is the right one, why not try to highlight that? Some of his closest allies on Capitol Hill and in D.C. are wondering this.THE WHITE HOUSE has been putting out the message that CHUCK SCHUMER wants a deal, but NANCY PELOSI -- fearful she ll lose the speakership -- is holding Democrats back. Schumer and Pelosi have worked judiciously to make sure there is zero daylight between them. Plus, she takes the majority in FIVE DAYS, at which point the game shifts in her direction.YA DON T EVEN CALL?   If the White House is so concerned about PELOSI, why has PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP not spoken with Pelosi since Dec. 11? That s 18 days without contact between the president and the incoming speaker during a federal government shutdown. The White House has not reached out to Pelosi s staff to try to schedule a get together. There has been no outreach to Pelosi at all from VP MIKE PENCE or INTERIM CHIEF OF STAFF MICK MULVANEY.DAY 8   This shutdown is now the ninth-longest shutdown in U.S. history.

Fox NewsTHE NEW CONGRESS   WAPO S FELICIA SONMEZ and ELI ROSENBERG:  Hoyer says House will not seat a North Carolina Republican amid questions about integrity of election :  Incoming House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer said Friday that Democrats next week will not seat a North Carolina Republican amid allegations of election fraud in the state s 9th Congressional District.  Given the now well-documented election fraud that took place in NC-09, Democrats would object to any attempt by [Mark] Harris to be seated on January 3,  Hoyer said in a statement.  In this instance, the integrity of our democratic process outweighs concerns about the seat being vacant at the start of the new Congress.   The statement came after North Carolina dissolved its elections board Friday without certifying the Nov. 6 results, leaving the fate of the seat in doubt days ahead of the start of the new Congress. David B. Freedman, an attorney for Harris, said the Republican has cooperated with the investigation and  looks forward to this matter coming to a resolution as quickly as possible so that he may serve the people of the 9th Congressional District as he was elected to do.

WaPoFALLOUT   NYT S BEN HUBBARD in Beirut:  Syria s Kurds, Feeling Betrayed by the U.S., Ask Assad Government for Protection :  Feeling betrayed by the United States, its Kurdish allies in Syria asked the Syrian government on Friday to protect them from possible attack by Turkey.  The request surprised some American officials and could help open the way for the forces of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, backed by Russia and Iran, to start retaking the Kurdish-held part of the country near Turkey s border. That would be a big step toward Mr. Assad s goal of reclaiming all of Syria, upended by almost eight years of war.  It was also the first sign that President Trump s abrupt announcement last week that he was withdrawing American troops from Syria was not only shifting alliances in the conflict but directly benefiting Mr. Assad   a brutal autocrat once described by Mr. Trump as an  animal  responsible for chemical attacks and other atrocities. American-backed Kurdish People s Protection Units, or Y.P.G., said the Syrian government should send troops to the city of Manbij, near the Turkish border. The request amounted to a United States ally calling on an enemy of the United States to protect it from another American ally, Turkey.  NYTREMEMBER HIM? ñ  Scott Pruitt: After the High Life, a Job Hunt,  by WaPo s Juliet Eilperin, Brady Dennis and Josh Dawsey:  For the next stage of his career, Pruitt has tapped the industry connections he cultivated during his year and-a-half as a Cabinet member, according to four individuals briefed on his plans, as he works to make his way in the private sector and establish his own consulting business. Pruitt is promoting coal exports and doing other work for his longtime friend, coal baron Joseph W. Craft III, while offering himself as an energy consultant and paid speaker, said several friends and associates, who asked for anonymity to speak frankly. ... The president once viewed him as a loyal soldier and confidante, brainstorming on policy in the Oval Office and commiserating about Democratic attack dogs by phone. But Trump also has joked about some of Pruitt s missteps, according to senior administration officials. On more than one occasion, they said, the president congratulated [acting EPA Administrator Andrew] Wheeler for not attempting to buy a used mattress from the Trump Hotel, a move Pruitt once tried.

                    By BURGESS EVERETT12/28/2018 05:13 PM ESTThe American Civil Liberties Union and a coalition of left-leaning political, immigration, environmental and labor groups are urging Democratic leaders to further pare down their border fence offer to President Donald Trump once Democrats take over the House and try to reopen the government.In fact, the groups want House Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to deny the president money for his fence altogether rather than give the Department of Homeland Security a year of funding at the same level as last year. The two Democratic leaders have offered Trump roughly $1.3 billion in money for fencing as part of a continuing resolution for DHS, though Trump has publicly asked for as much as $5 billion.Story Continued Below Less money is of course better than Trump s demand for $5 billion, but the harms caused by your proposed funding as compared to his are just as real, divisive, and damaging. In short, a continuing resolution that includes $1.375 billion for border barrier construction clearly funds Trump s wall project and must be rejected,  the coalition of groups wrote in a letter obtained by POLITICO.Dozens of groups signed the letter, from Indivisible to the ACLU to the National Immigration Law Center. The message was delivered to Capitol Hill offices on Friday afternoon and also included a demand that Democrats cut the Department of Homeland Security s detention and deportation funding.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Schumer and Pelosi have held firm on their bid not to give any new money to the president beyond current funding levels. The Senate Appropriations Committee had forged a bipartisan deal for $1.6 billion for fencing, but House Democrats panned it after the midterms and Democratic leaders are now united around delivering the president no increase over last year s fence funding.But Democrats  leverage will get even better when the new Congress begins next week and Pelosi becomes speaker. And that s why progressive groups are asking the leaders to give Trump a far worse deal than he would have gotten a week ago, when negotiations to keep the government open were still happening in earnest between the White House and members of Congress from both parties. As much as we all desire an end to the shutdown, however, rewarding Trump s DHS with border barrier money is the wrong course of action,  the groups wrote.  Now is the time to truly say NO to Trump s wall: no to $5 billion, no to $2.1 billion, no to $1.6 billion, no to $1.375 billion. And to reject any additional funding for detention beds, ICE and Border Patrol agents, or other harmful enforcement. Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/30/2018 01:34 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump is venting in public and private about Democrats  refusal to fund a border wall, but there is no sign the president is advancing deadlocked budget negotiations that have kept the government closed for a week.Cooped up in the White House after canceling his planned two-week-plus vacation to his private Florida club, Trump is consumed by the shutdown, according to people close to him. And the president is increasingly isolated. Congress has essentially recessed until the new year and First Lady Melania Trump headed back to Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday, according to a spokeswoman, after briefly returning to Washington to accompany the president on a surprise Christmas trip to visit troops in Iraq.Story Continued BelowThe White House s ratcheted-up rhetoric on Friday   with Trump threatening to shutter the entire southern border if he doesn t get his way   has done nothing to move Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).Democrats barely acknowledged Trump s latest volley, with a Pelosi spokesman saying Friday that real negotiations won t begin until the president publicly endorses an offer to reopen the government. Democrats have made it clear that, given that the president has changed his position so many times, we would not consider any offers from the White House that the president has not publicly endorsed,  Drew Hammill, Pelosi s spokesman, said Friday.Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning   in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.And privately, Democratic sources say they think desperation is fueling Trump s latest threat, taking it as a sign that they are winning the shutdown messaging war. Trump spent much of Friday in the West Wing meeting with staff and making calls, according to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.On Friday night, the president dined for two hours with Vice President Mike Pence, acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner at the vice president s Naval Observatory residence. Since returning from his overseas excursion, Trump has been throwing out Twitter threats   to no avail   in an attempt to get Democrats to concede to his demand for $5 billion to build a wall along the southern border with Mexico.Trump s latest apparent ultimatum, which came in the form of four early-morning tweets on Friday, was a pledge that Trump would close the U.S.-Mexico border if Democrats didn t come around. He also threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries, saying they  are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.  We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve!  he wrote in a series of tweets.But the vow appeared to do nothing to jumpstart the stalled talks to reopen the government. Discussions between lawmakers and the White House about how to end the crisis remained almost nonexistent, with members of Congress seemingly resigned to wait until next year to deal with the matter.Pelosi, the incoming House speaker, hasn t heard from the White House directly in more than two weeks when Trump phoned her after a tense televised meeting in the Oval Office on Dec. 11.And Schumer privately made clear to Pence a week ago that Democratic leaders wouldn t seriously consider an offer until it was publicly backed by the president, according to Schumer s spokesman   something Trump has yet to do. Indeed, as the shutdown entered its seventh day, both sides appeared dug in, with Trump doubling down on his calls for billions in funding for the border wall and Democrats, convinced that the whole episode is politically damaging for the president, making plans to reject the White House s demands and reopen the government in the next Congress.Trump s latest threat came after reports emerged Thursday that a group of migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador was on its way to Mexico. According to news outlets, thousands of the migrants are expected to stay in Mexico to seek employment. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money. Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!  Trump tweeted.Trump has issued similar threats before but has so far not carried them out.

                    By REBECCA MORINSuch a move would also be so controversial   and have such serious ramifications that ripple far beyond immigration   that congressional Republicans are already signaling their opposition. I don t think [Trump] could sustain it if he were to try to shut the border,  said a senior GOP lawmaker, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  There s too much trade that goes on every day to shut down the border. This GOP lawmaker speculated that Republicans from border states  would freak out about this. I don t see how Trump holds them. U.S. companies with Mexican holdings, or that ship to Mexican customers, would also pressure lawmakers to oppose any border shutdown. The trade between the two countries totals roughly $600 billion annually, while U.S. direct investment in Mexico is worth more than $100 billion, according to the U.S. Trade Representative s office. More than 1.2 million U.S jobs rely on exports to Mexico.The White House did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether the administration has modeled the economic costs to the United States of closing the southern border. But Trump has been known to circumvent such processes, long a foundation of major presidential decisions, in favor of his own gut instinct.For now, at least, there is little that Trump can do beside wage a public messaging war against the Democrats. Even his top aides acknowledge that the negotiations are on hold until Nancy Pelosi becomes House speaker next year. We fully expect that until [Rep. Nancy Pelosi] is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don t expect to hear from the Democrats again,  Mulvaney said during a Friday Fox News interview. Mulvaney said that while the administration has come down from its initial request for $5 billion for a border wall, Democrats, who do not want to approve any funds for the structure, notified the administration Thursday night that they would not be providing a counteroffer. Mulvaney declined to say what compromise the administration would accept, only that Trump is firm in his desire for a wall. Maybe there is a place in between there that we can compromise   you can get a little bit of what you want, we can get a little bit of what we want,  Mulvaney said.

                    By QUINT FORGEYThe shutdown mess has devolved into a public game of finger pointing even after Trump publicly declared earlier this month that he d take responsibility. More recently, the White House and its allies are trying to make the case that Democrats are unwilling to compromise, even though Democrats proposed $1.3 billion for border security. The Trump administration has also moved further from a deal by escalating border money demands in the last 10 days. Mulvaney and Pence asked for $2.5 billion in wall and border security money last weekend.As the two sides remain entrenched, the effects of a shutdown are becoming increasingly pronounced, with six days left until lawmakers are expected to return to D.C.The Environmental Protection Agency is set to run out of funding on midnight Friday. More national parks are slated to close, after states like Utah have exhausted their own funds to keep the nation s most popular destinations open through the holidays.And on Friday, the Office of Personnel Management began offering advice to the 800,000 federal employees who could lose pay in a prolonged shutdown. The agency distributed sample letters that federal workers can send to credit and mortgage companies if they fall behind on payments.In the House, no votes are expected through at least New Year s Day   effectively allowing GOP lawmakers to stay home during the final days of their Republican majority.It s a far cry from the last government shutdown that lasted more than a week: Back in 2013, the GOP-led House remained in town and passed nearly a dozen piecemeal funding bills that they forced the Democratic-led Senate to reject.This time, though, the House hasn t taken a single vote since blowing past the Dec. 21 deadline to fund the government.Sarah Ferris and Garrett Ross contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                            House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) arrives to a Democratic caucus meeting on Dec. 11. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICOGOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN   DAY 7   NANCY PELOSI will be speaker in six days, and she plans to do one of the following things to open the shuttered portion of the government.OPTION 1) Pass a full-year CR for the portion of the government that s shut. That would keep all government agencies at their current funding levels. OPTION 2) Pass a six-bill package, and a CR for Homeland Security until September. This would boost some government agencies  money, but would keep DHS at its current levels. OPTION 3) Pass the stopgap that the Senate passed, which would fund all government agencies through Feb. 8 at their current levels.EACH ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS would result in President Donald Trump getting $1.3 billion for border security. No wall. Not $1.6 billion. No slush fund. Nada.-- A SENIOR DEM AIDE SAYS THIS:  What part of Democratic majority and he s not getting the wall do they not understand? YES, THE SENATE is still Republican, and will still have a say in this. But, as Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan note, the Senate will have an incentive to get out of this mess soon too. Read Bade and BresnahanA SMART REPUBLICAN HILL HAND MAKES THIS POINT: TRUMP can not get out of here without folding in some way, since he won t be getting the $5 billion he s asking for. Why isn t he folding before the Dem majority takes over, and before it seems like he s folding to Pelosi?FWIW   THE HOUSE AND SENATE both have canceled votes for the remainder of the week, and have accepted the reality that the next Congress will have to reopen the government.WE VE BEEN BANGING the long shutdown drum for some time now, but it seems more and more evident that this could be a long stalemate that lasts until mid January or later. Yesterday, the House and Senate gaveled in for just a few minutes each. One senator was in the Senate chamber: Republican Pat Roberts of Kansas, who presided over the quick session.Happy Friday. CLICKER -- Invariant s Heather Podesta s annual holiday card of funny New Year s resolutions.A TROOP VISIT OR POLITICAL RALLY?   -- NYT S ANNIE KARNI,  Trump Iraq Visit Is Called a Political Rally :  During his surprise visit to American troops in Iraq and Germany this week, President Trump singled out red  Make America Great Again  caps in a sea of military fatigues, signed a  Trump 2020  patch and accused Representative Nancy Pelosi and other leading Democrats of being weak on border security.  Now the president is facing accusations that he was playing politics with the military.  When that starts happening, it s like the politicalization of the judicial branch,  said Mark Hertling, a retired three-star Army lieutenant general. Visiting troops abroad is a presidential tradition in which the commander in chief puts aside politics to thank a military that represents a broad spectrum of the country. But Mr. Trump s political comments and his encouragement of supporters in the crowd veered from those norms.  He has to understand that there exist some audiences that should not be addressed as part of his base, because they are not,  Mr. Hertling said.  It s a violation of protocol by the president.

TIMES NABIH BULOS in Amman:  Iraqi politicians, fuming after Trump s visit, demand U.S. forces leave the country :  The visit confirmed U.S. disregard for other nations  sovereignty, said Hamdillah Kaabi, spokesman for nationalist Muqtada Sadr s Sairoon party. Sadr, the Shiite Muslim cleric whose loyalists battled U.S. forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, now heads parliament s largest bloc. He campaigned to limit the influence of both Washington and Tehran in Iraq s affairs. Kaabi said Thursday the party had long sought to end Washington s  arrogance and disrespect  in its dealings with Iraq.    Trump was initially set to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi at the military base. However, Abdul Mahdi s invitation to join Trump there came with only two hours  notice for  security reasons,  said White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, according to a pool report. Abdul Mahdi was in a different part of the country and unable to attend, she said. Abdul Mahdi s office issued a delicate statement insisting that due to  differences in the points of view on arranging the meeting,  the two leaders instead held a phone call in which they discussed  developments after the U.S. president s decision to withdraw from Syria.

In Trump s Washington, facts are less relevant. Insults and highly personal attacks are increasingly employed by members of both parties. The White House press briefing is all but gone, international summits are optional, the arts are an afterthought and everything   including inherently nonpartisan institutions and investigations   is suddenly political. Taking a wrecking ball to decorum and institutions, Trump has changed, in ways both subtle and profound, how Washington works and how it is viewed by the rest of the nation and world.  He s dynamited the institution of the presidency,  said Douglas Brinkley, presidential historian at Rice University.  He doesn t see himself as being part of a long litany of presidents who will hand a baton to a successor. Instead, he uses the presidency as an extension of his own personality.

During the same period of late August or early September, electronic eavesdropping by an Eastern European intelligence agency picked up a conversation among Russians, one of whom remarked that Cohen was in Prague, two people familiar with the incident said. The phone and surveillance data, which have not previously been disclosed, lend new credence to a key part of a former British spy s dossier of Kremlin intelligence describing purported coordination between Trump s campaign and Russia s election meddling operation. The dossier, which Trump has dismissed as  a pile of garbage,  said Cohen and one or more Kremlin officials huddled in or around the Czech capital to plot ways to limit discovery of the close  liaison  between the Trump campaign and Russia. ...

The guidelines that emerge from these meetings are sent out to 7,500-plus moderators around the world. The closely held rules are extensive, and they make the company a far more powerful arbiter of global speech than has been publicly recognized or acknowledged by the company itself, The New York Times has found. The Times was provided with more than 1,400 pages from the rulebooks by an employee who said he feared that the company was exercising too much power, with too little oversight   and making too many mistakes. An examination of the files revealed numerous gaps, biases and outright errors.  As Facebook employees grope for the right answers, they have allowed extremist language to flourish in some countries while censoring mainstream speech in others. ...

POLITICO,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/12/28/what-will-history-books-say-about-2018-223561,  
 a love fest at a summit in Singapore. Neither approach moved Kim toward unilateral nuclear disarmament as predicted by Trump. At a joint news conference a month later, Trump embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin s worldview in at best a childish attempt to show his domestic fans that the U.S. intelligence community, which consistently warned (and leaked) about the Kremlin s malevolent intentions, was not getting the better of him. At the end of the year, Trump did favors for both the strongmen of Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Excusing one for killing dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Turkish soil and then paying off the aggrieved Turkish leader by withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria to allow him to finish off his enemies the Kurds there. In both cases, Trump s willfulness signaled the strategic and moral bankruptcy of U.S. leadership. Meanwhile, China fought back against Trump s reflexive steel tariffs by targeting industries critical to Trump s electoral base, later contributing to historic Democratic gains in the farm belt. Even allies figured out how to play the Child-Emperor. Both Mexico and Canada convinced Trump that by renaming the North American Free Trade Agreement and making microscopic changes he could declare victory on that front, despite having repeatedly called NAFTA  perhaps the worst trade deal ever made  and promising to tear it up. As Trump raged at the world and came up empty, the deaths this year of Senator John McCain and former President George H.W. Bush, both lions of U.S. global responsibility, put a fine and solemn point on this historical moment being, at least temporarily, the close of a 75-year era of U.S. foreign engagement. In the first year of the Trump crisis, observers including this historian had hoped that senior presidential advisers, nonpartisan civil servants and traditionally Republican congressional leaders would be willing and able to contain the worst instincts of the novice president. The second year showed that the most effective containment would have to come from newly empowered Democrats, the judiciary and the results of the ongoing Mueller investigation. In the November midterm elections, some of the political laws of gravity had held and public revulsion toward Trump translated into a blue wall of support, allowing Democrats to win about 40 House seats and take the majority. Although the year saw Trump put a second justice on the Supreme Court whose confirmation hearing highlighted the sectarian fervor of Trump supporters who passionately embraced a deeply flawed human being for a lifetime appointment he had no more success with the third branch of government in 2018 than in 2017. Indeed, in 2018 the judiciary buttressed the work of the Mueller inquiry, arguably the institution that most symbolized that the U.S. constitutional system was not buckling under Trump. Despite a torrent of invective from the president, the former FBI Director Robert Mueller and his team of nonpartisan lawyers continued their investigation of Russian influence in the 2016 election. The indictment and sentencing of the Trump family lawyer, Michael Cohen, would not have been possible in the authoritarian regimes that the president so admired. In Turkey, Russia or Saudi Arabia, it would be the prosecutor who disappeared to a cell or worse. But in the United States, despite Trump, it was not only Cohen who faced justice but prosecutors left breadcrumbs leading to the Oval Office itself. As the year ended, the victory of the Democratic Party in the midterm elections (with its promise of subpoena-led investigations and accountability), the hollowing out of the Trump regime, the president s consistently low approval ratings, and the possibility that the Mueller inquiry would produce evidence of Trump as an unindicted co-conspirator either in financial crimes or collusion with Russia signaled for some observers that the tide in the United States, at least, had turned against the nativist wave of 2016. On the other hand, there was no reason to believe that the dark populism of Trumpism was fading outside American cities and suburbs or that Trump and his acolytes were doing anything but digging in for a long struggle, whatever the political, human or economic costs to the nation or the world.***Tech disruptedMaragaret O Mara is a history professor at the University of Washington.By the end of the 21st century s second decade, America s largest technology companies had amassed wealth and influence impossible to imagine at the dawn of the digital age 70 years before. With user bases in the billions, market capitalization in the trillions, and products and platforms that had become ubiquitous and essential tools for modern life, Big Tech had disrupted nearly every other business sector and become celebrated as a shining example of American innovation and entrepreneurship.The mood changed abruptly in 2018, amid a cascade of new revelations about the role of social media and other internet platforms in fueling the era s political discord. Both in a fractious United States and in fragile and volatile democracies overseas, the open and connected platforms of techno-optimistic Silicon Valley had become weaponized in ways that their creators had never intended. It was hardly the first time that a new communications medium had been accused of upending politics newsprint, radio and television had been vulnerable to nefarious influences when they too were new on the scene but the scope, speed and scale of online media dwarfed all that came before.With cooling sentiment about some tech products came also a new skepticism toward big tech companies that made them. After decades of wanting to become the next Silicon Valley, cities started to look at tech s presence with new wariness. When online giant Amazon concluded its headline-making search for a second headquarters city by announcing that it would locate tens of thousands of workers in New York City and suburban Washington D.C. (receiving billions in local tax incentives in exchange), the news was greeted with as much trepidation as celebration. The extraordinary reach of these remarkably young and market-defining firms Facebook was 14 years old in 2018, Google was merely 20 recalled the rapid-fire growth of the great oil, steel and railroad trusts in the late 19th century s Gilded Age. And 2018 s freshly combative stance toward tech in the nation s newsrooms and its corridors of political power recalled the growing calls for reform in the early 20th century s Progressive Era. Would Washington once again increase its regulatory power and flex its antitrust muscle to curb the power of big business as it did in the age of Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson? Our textbook s next chapter will hold the answer.Investigation

                    By CHRIS PRICE and LILY STEPHENS12/28/2018 05:05 AM ESTIt s been a tumultuous year of fighting on Capitol Hill over immigration, tax reform, a Supreme Court nomination, a government shutdown and more. But there were moments that shone through the thick curtain of partisanship. Here are just a few that stood out.Story Continued BelowPutting aside differences after John McCain s death
                            Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer lay a wreath at the casket of Senator John McCain during his memorial service at the Capitol Rotunda on August 31, 2018 in Washington, DC. | Ken Cedeno-Pool/Getty ImagesJohn McCain s death in August brought a spirit of togetherness to Capitol Hill. From Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, both Republicans and Democrats put aside their differences to praise the longtime Arizona senator for being willing to reach across the aisle ñ even if it meant breaking with his own party.In an interview with NBC, Hillary Clinton said McCain  really understood in the marrow of his bones what it meant to be an American and how important it was for us to, yes, disagree and differ, but, at the end of the day, to come together, to work together, to trust each other to get things done. Honoring civil rights and remembering Martin Luther King, Jr.

Paul Ryan and John Lewis shared a moment during an April ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King, Jr. s assassination. Lewis, a Georgia Democrat who once marched with King, and House Speaker Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, both gave remarks honoring the late civil rights leader for his work in bridging political and racial gaps.  He made America look up, and just as important, he made America look within. By his works, we saw the great promise of the American idea,  Ryan said.  We see it here today, in people from different backgrounds, from often very different persuasions, all of whom are coming together to honor Martin Luther King s life and legacy. In recalling bloodshed meant to divide us, we embrace what unites us. Changing a vote to help a friend attend a funeral

Scott ApplewhiteIn April, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) changed his vote from  no  to  present  on Mike Pompeo s Secretary of State nomination to help out Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), who needed to speak at a close friend s funeral. The Democrat s courtesy for his friend drew widespread praise from the GOP and allowed Pompeo s nomination to proceed (even though Coons opposed him).  That was a profile in courage, I think. He may catch a lot of flak for that,  said Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) of Coons  kind gesture for Isakson.  And that made a big impression on those of us on the Republican side. Coming together after devastationNatural disasters hammered the United States this year, from wildfires to hurricanes to floods to a  bomb cyclone.  And although there was political fighting over how to best respond, the devastation still brought together fierce political opponents.

Roy Cooper after Hurricane Florence hit the East Coast.

Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom after the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century scorched more than 200 square miles and destroyed nearly 10,000 homes. Although the president was criticized for tweeting that the fires only happened because the state s  forest management is so poor,  the meeting one week later was notable given Trump s normally tense relationship with the solid blue state and its Democratic leaders. It was also the first time the president visited California in the past 13 months of deadly disasters the state has faced.  Jerry and I have been speaking, and Gavin and I have gotten to know each other, and we re all going to work together,  Trump said as he stood with the two California leaders.Enjoying a bipartisan tradition, one year after a shooting

Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) and Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) during the 57th annual Congressional Baseball Game. Just one year prior, the Republican was injured in a shooting during the bipartisan event, which led leaders in both parties to condemn violence. Richmond is the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and a critic of President Trump, while Scalise is a strong House ally of the president. Both lawmakers put their politics aside to enjoy a bipartisan tradition and an American staple.An embrace at George H.W. Bush s funeral

Bush was spotted hugging Nancy Pelosi, the longtime Democratic Party leader, and discreetly passing Michelle Obama a candy or mint ñ just like he did at Sen. John McCain s funeral this summer.

                        Government Shutdown 
                        Democratic leaders think the president is playing a losing hand and will be under pressure to relent.
                    By RACHAEL BADE and JOHN BRESNAHAN12/27/2018 07:30 PM ESTHouse Democrats   increasingly convinced they re winning the shutdown fight with President Donald Trump   are plotting ways to reopen the government while denying the president even a penny more for his border wall when they take power Jan. 3.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her top lieutenants are considering several options that would refuse Trump the $5 billion he s demanded for the wall and send hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal employees back to work, according to senior Democratic sources. Story Continued BelowWhile the strategy is fluid, House Democrats hope to pass a funding bill shortly after members are sworn in. They believe that would put pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to follow suit. And they re confident that their political leverage will only increase the longer the shutdown lasts   a notion that some GOP leaders privately agree with.Indeed, the specter of a lengthy shutdown could hurt Trump s already damaged image more than it would Democrats   especially because he claimed ownership of the crisis two weeks ago. Democrats believe the shutdown battle   combined with the volatility in financial markets and special counsel Robert Mueller closing in on Trump   exacerbates the appearance of a cornered president acting out of his own political self-interest instead of the needs of the American public.A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

If not, one of the first things we ll do will be to move to pass legislation to reopen the government. And the president can decide whether he wants to sign it or not.  I believe Democrats are going to move [to end the shutdown] on Jan. 3,  added Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat whose district includes thousands of federal employees.  It s got to be the first item of business. On Thursday afternoon, when the House briefly went into a pro forma session, McGovern tried to bring up a Senate-passed bill to reopen the government, the second attempt by House Democrats to do so in recent days. Republicans refused to recognize McGovern, stifling his effort   but not before he yelled to the empty chamber:  Mr. Speaker, 800,000 federal employees don t know whether they will get paid! Mr. Speaker! With it increasingly unlikely that Republicans will do anything in the remainder of the 115th Congress to end the stalemate, House Democrats are considering a procedural tactic that would allow them to move quickly once they re officially in the majority on Jan. 3. They re weighing including multiple funding options in a package of rules for the new Congress that they intend to approve that day, according to Democratic sources. That would give Trump and Senate Republicans several options to choose from.The alternatives under discussion have already been floated to Trump by Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). But one option they re not considering, sources close to the Democratic leaders said, is offering the president more than the $1.3 billion they already put on the table to fund fencing at the southern border.
                    Government Shutdown
                    By BURGESS EVERETT, ELIANA JOHNSON and RACHAEL BADESo far, Trump has refused the $1.3 billion as too little. But Democrats believe he ll come under fire as stories of furloughed federal employees spread in January, and the chaos of a shutdown starts to affect everyday Americans. The American people know that this is a Trump shutdown,  McGovern said. One option Democrats are considering is a short-term funding measure to open now-shuttered agencies until Feb. 8. A week ago, the Senate approved a continuing resolution with that timeline. Some House Democrats believe that if they quickly push the CR through their own chamber, McConnell   a former appropriator who despises shutdowns   will feel pressure to act.A short-term bill would also allow newly empowered House Democratic appropriators to put their mark on the last remaining funding bills before they pass a larger package in February, two Democratic sources pointed out. But with Trump still urging Hill Republicans to fight for his wall, McConnell is unlikely to take up a stop-gap funding bill. GOP leaders have made clear they will not act without the president s public support for any funding bill to reopen the government.Connolly also isn t interested in a short-term funding solution. He wants an agreement that keeps the entire government funded through Sept. 30.
                    
                    By POLITICO STAFF I see a growing sentiment among Democrats to have a funding vehicle that carries us through the end of the fiscal year,  Connolly added. A  short-term CR gets us very little. Trump rejected a temporary fix just last week, instead blessing an attempt by House Republicans to provide $5 billion for the wall, which led to the shutdown. House Democrats are also considering a CR for the affected agencies that would last through the fiscal year. Such a proposal would mean no policy changes for the agencies that are currently closed; they would operate on the same budget they had in fiscal 2018.A third option being considered includes passing full appropriations bills for all affected agencies except the Homeland Security Department, which is where Trump s wall money would go. That department would operate under current levels through the rest of the fiscal year. No matter what option House Democrats go with, House Minority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and other Democrats from Virginia and Maryland intend to add a provision to any funding bill guaranteeing back pay for any federal employees hit by the shutdown.CORRECTION:  An earlier version of this story misstated the amount Democrats have offered Trump for fencing along the southern border.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                        Government Shutdown
                        Republicans and Democrats look more dug in now than they were a week ago.
                    By BURGESS EVERETT, ELIANA JOHNSON and RACHAEL BADE12/27/2018 11:43 AM EST
                    Updated 12/27/2018 05:20 PM ESTThe 115th Congress essentially gave up on trying to reopen the government on Thursday, with both the Senate and House closing out the session just minutes after opening it, and leaving the political crisis for the next Congress to solve. The House session ended in a bout of shouting as Democrats tried to get the chamber to pass a bill funding the government   but not President Donald Trump s border wall. The Senate session consisted of Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) setting up next week s schedule and asking an empty room whether anyone objected. And the White House, for its part, blasted out a new statement attacking Democrats over their opposition to the border wall.Story Continued BelowThe effort seemed to reflect a lack of enthusiasm among members to end an almost week-long shutdown affecting a quarter of the government, with not even congressional leaders nor the party faithful trying to pin the blame on the other side.The impasse seems almost certain to continue until Jan. 3, when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) ascends to the role of speaker under a new Democratic majority. Until then, Republicans have only a slim hope that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) can consummate a deal with Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, with negotiations going almost totally silent.  We have not been able to reach agreement,  said Roberts, the only senator in town on Thursday as well as on Christmas Eve.  I hope that we can come up with something that can get this solved. That resides squarely with my good friend Chuck Schumer and the leadership here to present the president with a number he can agree with. A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Party leaders are now gaming out how the new Democratic House will react to the shutdown and there are increasing worries that the funding lapse will persist for weeks, potentially deep into January. On MSNBC, outgoing Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) said plainly:  I don t see a scenario where the government opens back up until a new Congress is sworn in. In theory, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) could call Congress into session before Pelosi takes over. But those hopes have just about run out, so some lawmakers are taking things into their own hands.Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), the incoming House Rules Committee Chairman, tried to bring up a bill reopening the government on the House floor Thursday afternoon. But Republicans gaveled the Massachusetts Democrat down as he yelled to an empty gallery,  Mr. speaker 800,000 federal employees don t know whether they will get paid! Mr. Speaker!  Vital departments of our government are in limbo because of this manufactured government, and I couldn t even get recognized!  McGovern said afterwards. He later added:  The American people understand that this is an urgent matter, the only people who don t seem to be in any hurry are the Republican leadership and the president. It s just ridiculous. Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, said:  Democrats will act swiftly to end the Trump Shutdown  after taking over the House. He added that they will not support Trump s  immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.  Hammill s statement followed a stern statement from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, who dinged Democrats for not returning Pence s offers that would have included roughly more money for fencing than the Democrats  $1.3 billion stance.  The only rational conclusion is that the Democrat party is openly choosing to keep our government closed to protect illegal immigrants rather than the American people. The president does not want the government to remain shut down, but he will not sign a proposal that does not first prioritize our county s safety and security,  Sanders said. There s been little discussion between the White House and Democrats in recent days, according to people in both parties, and the two sides appear more entrenched than they were a week ago.  The president continues to push proposals to fund the ineffective and expensive wall, which he knows can t pass the Senate,  said Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer.  For the White House to try and blame anyone but the president for this shutdown doesn t pass the laugh test. He added that the two sides are still  very far  away from a compromise. 
                    
                    By POLITICO STAFFTrump arrived back in the United States on Thursday after a surprise post-Christmas visit to American troops in Iraq and Germany and was pleased by the news coverage of his trip, which temporarily displaced shutdown headlines, according to a White House official. After a Twitter respite during his 36 hours abroad, he was back at it Thursday, accusing the Democrats of abandoning their base and asserting in tweet that most of the federal workers affected during the shutdown are Democrats.  Democrat s say they don t want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed), and they don t want ICE. They don t have much to campaign on, do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!  Trump added on Thursday afternoon. Republicans said they ve heard nothing new about a potential resolution from Schumer, whose Democratic minority can block any funding bill with a filibuster. Schumer had been negotiating with Vice President Mike Pence last weekend, to no avail. The Senate will only vote on a funding bill once there is agreement with the House to pass a bill and a commitment from the president to sign it.  Not much is happening in Washington,  conceded Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on Fox News. Compared with the last extended shutdown in 2013, this episode is remarkably low-key. The closure covers only a quarter of the government, and it s hitting during the holidays, when many federal workers and lawmakers are off of work. What s more, members of Congress are doing comparatively little messaging compared to the impasse of five years ago, when conservatives tried to defund Obamacare and eventually GOP leaders blinked.There have been almost no press conferences in recent days aimed at pinning the blame on the opposition, which could be in vain anyway since Trump said he d be  proud  to own the shutdown (before subsequently trying to pin it on Democrats).
                    white house
                    By REBECCA MORINIn the void of traditional congressional partisan messaging, including Republican leaders who might moderate the president s tone, Trump has continued his offensive   and he has been egged on by supporters who encouraged him to shut down the government in the first place. On his radio show on Monday, Rush Limbaugh urged the president hold his ground until Democrats take control of the House in early January:  I want the president to hold firm on this, this shutdown is one that the Democrats own. Limbaugh played a key role in convincing Trump to shut down the government over the border wall, expressing disappointment that the president was at one point prepared to sign a continuing resolution to fund the government through early February. Trump eventually sent him a personal assurance that he would not yield in his demands and was willing to shut down the government over them. Now there is almost no incentive for Democrats to compromise right now in the final days of unified GOP rule. Their hand will strengthen considerably when Pelosi becomes speaker, and she can send over funding bills shorting the border wall and see how McConnell deals with it.Rebecca Morin and Eli Okun contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop,  Trump tweeted.  Time to get tough on Border Security. Build the Wall! Story Continued BelowThe two-day statewide manhunt ended Friday with the arrest of Gustavo Perez Arriaga, who came out with his hands up as a SWAT team prepared to raid a home in Bakersfield, California. Ronil Singh, a Newman, Calif., police officer, was shot and killed during a traffic stop early Wednesday in an incident involving a suspect he believed to be driving drunk. Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson, who led the investigation, blamed California s sanctuary law for preventing local authorities from reporting Perez Arriaga to U.S. immigration officials for deportation after two previous drunken driving arrests.

                        Government Shutdown
                        Republicans and Democrats look more dug in now than they were a week ago.
                    By BURGESS EVERETT, ELIANA JOHNSON and RACHAEL BADE12/27/2018 11:43 AM EST
                    Updated 12/27/2018 05:20 PM ESTThe 115th Congress essentially gave up on trying to reopen the government on Thursday, with both the Senate and House closing out the session just minutes after opening it, and leaving the political crisis for the next Congress to solve. The House session ended in a bout of shouting as Democrats tried to get the chamber to pass a bill funding the government   but not President Donald Trump s border wall. The Senate session consisted of Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) setting up next week s schedule and asking an empty room whether anyone objected. And the White House, for its part, blasted out a new statement attacking Democrats over their opposition to the border wall.Story Continued BelowThe effort seemed to reflect a lack of enthusiasm among members to end an almost week-long shutdown affecting a quarter of the government, with not even congressional leaders nor the party faithful trying to pin the blame on the other side.The impasse seems almost certain to continue until Jan. 3, when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) ascends to the role of speaker under a new Democratic majority. Until then, Republicans have only a slim hope that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) can consummate a deal with Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, with negotiations going almost totally silent.  We have not been able to reach agreement,  said Roberts, the only senator in town on Thursday as well as on Christmas Eve.  I hope that we can come up with something that can get this solved. That resides squarely with my good friend Chuck Schumer and the leadership here to present the president with a number he can agree with. A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Party leaders are now gaming out how the new Democratic House will react to the shutdown and there are increasing worries that the funding lapse will persist for weeks, potentially deep into January. On MSNBC, outgoing Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) said plainly:  I don t see a scenario where the government opens back up until a new Congress is sworn in. In theory, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) could call Congress into session before Pelosi takes over. But those hopes have just about run out, so some lawmakers are taking things into their own hands.Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), the incoming House Rules Committee Chairman, tried to bring up a bill reopening the government on the House floor Thursday afternoon. But Republicans gaveled the Massachusetts Democrat down as he yelled to an empty gallery,  Mr. speaker 800,000 federal employees don t know whether they will get paid! Mr. Speaker!  Vital departments of our government are in limbo because of this manufactured government, and I couldn t even get recognized!  McGovern said afterwards. He later added:  The American people understand that this is an urgent matter, the only people who don t seem to be in any hurry are the Republican leadership and the president. It s just ridiculous. Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, said:  Democrats will act swiftly to end the Trump Shutdown  after taking over the House. He added that they will not support Trump s  immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.  Hammill s statement followed a stern statement from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, who dinged Democrats for not returning Pence s offers that would have included roughly more money for fencing than the Democrats  $1.3 billion stance.  The only rational conclusion is that the Democrat party is openly choosing to keep our government closed to protect illegal immigrants rather than the American people. The president does not want the government to remain shut down, but he will not sign a proposal that does not first prioritize our county s safety and security,  Sanders said. There s been little discussion between the White House and Democrats in recent days, according to people in both parties, and the two sides appear more entrenched than they were a week ago.  The president continues to push proposals to fund the ineffective and expensive wall, which he knows can t pass the Senate,  said Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer.  For the White House to try and blame anyone but the president for this shutdown doesn t pass the laugh test. He added that the two sides are still  very far  away from a compromise. 
                    
                    By POLITICO STAFFTrump arrived back in the United States on Thursday after a surprise post-Christmas visit to American troops in Iraq and Germany and was pleased by the news coverage of his trip, which temporarily displaced shutdown headlines, according to a White House official. After a Twitter respite during his 36 hours abroad, he was back at it Thursday, accusing the Democrats of abandoning their base and asserting in tweet that most of the federal workers affected during the shutdown are Democrats.  Democrat s say they don t want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed), and they don t want ICE. They don t have much to campaign on, do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!  Trump added on Thursday afternoon. Republicans said they ve heard nothing new about a potential resolution from Schumer, whose Democratic minority can block any funding bill with a filibuster. Schumer had been negotiating with Vice President Mike Pence last weekend, to no avail. The Senate will only vote on a funding bill once there is agreement with the House to pass a bill and a commitment from the president to sign it.  Not much is happening in Washington,  conceded Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on Fox News. Compared with the last extended shutdown in 2013, this episode is remarkably low-key. The closure covers only a quarter of the government, and it s hitting during the holidays, when many federal workers and lawmakers are off of work. What s more, members of Congress are doing comparatively little messaging compared to the impasse of five years ago, when conservatives tried to defund Obamacare and eventually GOP leaders blinked.There have been almost no press conferences in recent days aimed at pinning the blame on the opposition, which could be in vain anyway since Trump said he d be  proud  to own the shutdown (before subsequently trying to pin it on Democrats).

                    By REBECCA MORINIn the void of traditional congressional partisan messaging, including Republican leaders who might moderate the president s tone, Trump has continued his offensive   and he has been egged on by supporters who encouraged him to shut down the government in the first place. On his radio show on Monday, Rush Limbaugh urged the president hold his ground until Democrats take control of the House in early January:  I want the president to hold firm on this, this shutdown is one that the Democrats own. Limbaugh played a key role in convincing Trump to shut down the government over the border wall, expressing disappointment that the president was at one point prepared to sign a continuing resolution to fund the government through early February. Trump eventually sent him a personal assurance that he would not yield in his demands and was willing to shut down the government over them. Now there is almost no incentive for Democrats to compromise right now in the final days of unified GOP rule. Their hand will strengthen considerably when Pelosi becomes speaker, and she can send over funding bills shorting the border wall and see how McConnell deals with it.Rebecca Morin and Eli Okun contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    By ELI OKUN12/27/2018 09:00 AM ESTPresident Donald Trump seemingly added a new spin to his usual shutdown rhetoric Thursday, tweeting that its economic impact disproportionately falls on Democrats. Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs, Human Trafficking, Gang Members & Criminals from coming into our Country,  he wrote, before pivoting to a financial   but still partisan   argument.  Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats? Story Continued BelowIt was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to government workers not getting paid during the shutdown or to low-income Americans losing benefits because of the shutdown.Trump s firm demand for funding to build more of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border has been the crucial factor in the partial government shutdown now entering its sixth day. The president insisted on $5 billion for a wall, which cleared the Republican-led House, but Democrats refuse to pay for it.

                            President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump meet with troops at Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq on Wednesday. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP has landed back in the United States after a 29-hour journey to Iraq and Germany. Trump stopped for a quick visit to Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany, where he met with Air Force leaders based there, according to Time magazine s Brian Bennett, who was part of the pool for the president s trip to Iraq and Germany. -- FROM THE RAMSTEIN POOL REPORT, sent last night at 9:03 p.m. Eastern:  President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump entered a large [hangar] where hundreds of service members were arranged in a large semi circle to greet the president.  Hello folks,  Trump said, stretching out his arms. He was wearing his signature long red tie and a black overcoat. The First Lady was in black and white sneakers, a black bomber jacket and olive green pants. A few troops in uniform had brought red hats and held them as POTUS and FLOTUS shook hands and greeted troops. Pool was ushered out into a van after 15 minutes.    POTUS and FLOTUS spent about 45 minutes greeting troops in the hangar at Ramstein, Germany. Pool was pulled out after 15 minutes to load in a press van. Toward the end of President Trump s time with the troops, pool could see through the windows POTUS speaking into a microphone, also could hear cheers. Pool was not ushered back into the room so didn t hear any remarks. The First Lady spoke too. Pool was told the remarks were not planned. We are rolling at 9:28 pm ET / 3:28 pm local. ABOARD AF1   -- TRUMP on AF1 about SYRIA and ISRAEL, per Brian Bennett:  I spoke with Bibi. I told Bibi, you know we give Israel $4.5 billion a year. And they are doing very well at defending themselves.   We ll always be there for Israel.   So that s the way it is, we are going to take great care of Israel. Israel is going to be good. We give Israel 4.5 billion a year. And we give frankly a lot more than that if you look at the books. They ve been doing a good job. -- TRUMP S PLANE flew with the call sign  Reach 358  when it was en route to the Middle East, and when it was between Iraq and Germany.  Reach  is a call sign used by military cargo planes. But as it made its way from Ramstein to Andrews, it switched back to Air Force One.ON THE GROUND   AP S DARLENE SUPERVILLE at Al-Asad Airbase, Iraq:  President Donald Trump once opined that it wasn t  overly necessary  for him to visit troops in danger zones abroad. But with the lights of Air Force One out and window shutters drawn, the president did just that, slipping into Iraq at night to greet U.S. service members and show that his norm-busting presidency would hew at least to this tradition.  Addressing troops at an air base in western Iraq Wednesday, Trump defended his decision to pull forces from neighboring Syria, declaring of Islamic State militants:  We ve knocked them out. We ve knocked them silly.  His appraisal is at odds with that of military officials, aides and allies who consider IS a diminished but deadly force. His defense secretary and envoy to the anti-IS coalition quit after Trump blindsided much of the national security establishment with his call.  Trump had faced criticism for not yet visiting U.S. troops stationed in harm s way as he comes up on his two-year mark in office. ... Trump told his audience in Iraq that the decision to withdraw the roughly 2,000 troops from Syria illustrated his quest to put  America first.   We re no longer the suckers, folks,  Trump said at al-Asad Air Base, about 100 miles or 60 kilometers west of Baghdad.  We re respected again as a nation.  He did not meet Iraqi officials while there but spoke on the phone with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi.

All 30 stocks in the Dow industrials notched gains, as did each of the 11 sectors in the broader S&P. Shares of Amazon.com, Facebook and Netflix climbed more than 8%, while retailers including Kohl s and Macy s rallied as early data on the crucial holiday shopping season appeared robust. Energy stocks including Exxon Mobil and Chevron, meanwhile, rose alongside a nearly 9% climb in oil prices. But as in many of the volatile days that have characterized markets since the end of September, investors and traders were left scratching their heads to explain the wild swing, with the Dow adding nearly 450 points in the last hour of the session.  WSJ-- WSJ S PETER NICHOLAS and PAUL KIERNAN on JAY POWELL:  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has told White House officials he is open to their suggestion that he meet directly with President Trump, a sit-down that they hope will defuse Mr. Trump s anger over interest rate increases that he blames for dramatic market swings, a senior administration official said Wednesday.... The law is somewhat vague on the president s power to fire the Fed chairman, who is a member of the central bank s board of governors. A 1935 statute says the president can remove a governor  for cause,  though the term isn t defined. Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, is the latest, saying in an interview Wednesday that Mr. Powell, who goes by Jay, is secure in his job.

BORDER TALES --  Nielsen deflects blame for boy s death in Border Patrol custody,  by Ian Kullgren and David Beavers:  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen sought to deflect blame Wednesday for the Christmas Eve death of an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy in the custody of U.S. Border Patrol agents, blaming  a system that prevents parents who bring their children on a dangerous and illegal journey from facing consequences for their actions.  ...  Our system has been pushed to a breaking point by those who seek open borders,  Nielsen said in a written statement.  Smugglers, traffickers, and their own parents put these minors at risk by embarking on the dangerous and arduous journey north.  In January, Trump will have to face a Democratic House with newfound oversight authority. Incoming Majority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Wednesday in a written statement that the House will  hold hearings on the young boy s death and the death of seven-year-old Jakelin Caal earlier this month   as well as the conditions under which thousands of children are being held.   POLITICO-- NYT S MIRIAM JORDAN:  A Guatemalan boy who died on Christmas Eve while in United States custody was moved among at least four crowded facilities at the border over the six days from his apprehension until his death.  That chronology, provided by government officials, underscores how stretched the facilities and their staff are in handling the surge of Central American families reaching the southwest border, particularly minors. Kirstjen M. Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, acknowledged on Wednesday that the  dramatic increase  had pushed the system to  a breaking point.  She said she had ordered her agency to bolster medical screenings of children at the southwest border and had enlisted the medical corps of the United States Coast Guard to assist. The secretary also said that she would travel to the border this week to personally observe the screenings.  Moving forward, all children will receive a more thorough hands-on assessment at the earliest possible time post-apprehension   whether or not the accompanying adult has asked for one,  Ms. Nielsen said in a statement.

                    Updated 12/26/2018 05:27 PM ESTThe tweets stopped and soon the jig was up.President Donald Trump s trip to Iraq this week, his first to a war zone as president, was supposed to be a surprise. But the White House couldn t keep the sensitive trip a secret for long.Story Continued BelowAfter tweeting more than three dozen times over the last four days, Trump ceased his rapid-fire online missives on Tuesday night. By Wednesday, the president was nowhere to be found, without any scheduled public events. There was no uniformed Marine standing outside the West Wing, normally an obvious signal that the president is in the Oval Office. White House officials went silent. Soon, amateur aircraft watchers were tracking a Boeing VC-25, the military plane that serves as Air Force One, flying over Europe. It wasn t the first time aviation obsessives had flagged possible signals that a president might be headed to a war zone. But the real-time tracking of Trump s flight, paired with Trump s Twitter disappearing act offered the strongest hint yet that he was finally making the trip.Past administrations have taken extreme measures to keep presidential trips to war zones secret, fearing serious security risks if they re made public. Journalists traveling on the trips must agree to strict embargoes barring them from reporting anything until the president is out of harm s way. Often, the trips are so hush-hush that reporters are only allowed to tell their spouse and one editor that they are on the way to a war zone, where they sometimes have to rely on satellite phones to relay the news back to Washington.Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what s driving the afternoon in Washington.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.But the age of secret presidential jet-setting is rapidly coming to an end, as amateur flight trackers send news of unidentified military aircraft crisscrossing the globe in real time via Twitter. And while the White House prevented major news outlets from publishing stories about the trip before they made an official announcement, it couldn t stop rampant online speculation.The fanatic community of flight trackers were the first to report that Trump appeared to have taken off from Joint Base Andrews around midnight on Christmas on a Boeing VC-25A, one of the modified Boeing 747s that serves as Air Force One. The plane was not using the traditional Air Force One call sign, but was instead dubbed RCH358.  Reach  is a call sign often used by military cargo planes.An aircraft spotter in the United Kingdom identified the trademark 747 Wednesday morning, and snapped a photo. CivMilAir, a Twitter account that tracks military aircraft, retweeted the image, setting off a flurry of speculation among plane watchers worldwide.Further complicating the efforts is a president who can t seem to keep a secret. Trump has been broadcasting the possibility of an upcoming trip to a war zone for weeks, both in public and in private.  No, I m going to a war zone,  Trump shot back at a reporter last month when he was asked whether he was afraid to make such a trip. He told The Washington Post in a November interview that he would make the trip  at the right time,  perhaps even before Christmas.According to a White House official, the Trump administration had been planning the trip for more than six weeks.In an interview with journalists traveling with him in Iraq, the president signaled his frustration with the secrecy surrounding the excursion, adding that previous planned trips had been scuttled because word began leaking out. Asked if he had concerns about making the trip, Trump said,  Sure. When I heard what you had to go through?

                    By REBECCA MORIN and WESLEY MORGANHe added,  I had concerns about the institution of the presidency. Not for myself personally. I had concerns for the First Lady, I will tell you. Trump then described the security precautions Air Force One takes when landing in a war zone. If you would have see what we had to go through in the darkened plane with all windows closed with no light anywhere   pitch black,  he saidThe prospect of a surprise trip to Iraq or Afghanistan has kept the White House press corps on edge for weeks. At one point, rumors circulated that Trump had ditched reporters and departed for a war zone while he was alleged to be golfing at his Mar-a-Lago club over the Thanksgiving holiday. And there were whispers that the president was tacking on a covert trip to Iraq or Afghanistan on his return trip from the G-20 in Argentina. Both sets of rumors turned out to be false.Despite all the rumors, the specifics of Trump s trip were closely held.The trip was kept off the White House s official travel log, but by Wednesday afternoon, West Wing aides got word that the president was en route to an unknown destination and would not return to Washington until Friday, according to one of those aides. The surprise trip occurred on the fifth day of a government shutdown, with several federal agencies shuttered and neither the president nor congressional Democrats have given any indication they are any closer to reaching a deal to reopening the government than when it began. Presidential trip planners have for years fought back against leaks. Ahead of then-President Barack Obama s surprise 2012 trip to Afghanistan, the White House actually released a fake public schedule packed with West Wing meetings to throw reporters off the trail. But that didn t stop an Afghan news station from reporting that Obama had arrived in Kabul, spurring a few U.S. new outlets to do quick write-ups on the trip. A Drudge banner blared  Where is Obama? The White House and U.S. embassy in the country quickly tried to kill the reports, denying that Obama was in Afghanistan. The U.S. news organizations that had picked up the Afghan news agreed to pull their pieces until the White House officially announced the trip. BuzzFeed editor in chief Ben Smith, who had retweeted rumors of the news, even agreed to post a denial from the White House on Twitter.He later explained:  Like most news organizations, we will typically defer to the White House s judgment on true security risks. In this case, we had no original reporting on the subject, and it didn t seem like right moment to have an abstract argument about the contemporary media ecosystem, though I think it s getting harder and harder to unring these bells. Given the quick unveiling of Trump s Iraq trip on Wednesday, Smith s comments now seem prophetic.Eliana Johnson contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/26/2018 03:49 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump visited U.S. troops in Iraq for the first time during his presidency, the White House said Wednesday, after he came under criticism for not going earlier and during a tumultuous period for his national security team. President Trump and the First Lady traveled to Iraq late on Christmas night to visit with our troops and Senior Military leadership to thank them for their service, their success, and their sacrifice and to wish them a Merry Christmas,  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted.Story Continued BelowThe president had been hinting for weeks that he would soon visit U.S. troops in a combat theater. The trip to Al Asad Air Base, which the White House kept quiet until after the president spoke to troops, comes days after Trump ordered a full withdrawal of the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria and pushed for halving the 14,000-strong U.S. military contingent in Afghanistan.  We re no longer the suckers, folks,  Trump said during remarks at the base, according to a pool report.  We re respected again as a nation. Trump said he would not withdraw troops from Iraq, The Associated Press reported, although he said the Islamic State militant group is  very nearly defeated. He added that if there is a resurgence by the group, troops in Iraq would be able to combat it.The president and first lady Melania Trump spent three hours visiting with troops, where he took selfies and signed autographs, according to the pool report. Melania and I were honored to visit our incredible troops at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. GOD BLESS THE U.S.A.!  he tweeted after the visit. Trump planned to make one additional stop before returning to the U.S. Friday, the White House told reporters, though they didn t name the location.The trip comes as the national security establishment is going through a particularly chaotic period.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who sent Trump his resignation letter after failing to persuade the president to reverse course on the Syria pullout, is on the job for just a few more days. He remained in D.C. as the president made his trip. His deputy, former Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan, takes over as acting Defense secretary on Jan. 1. The 2020 Election. The New Congress.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Brett McGurk, the top civilian envoy responsible for efforts to defeat the Islamic State, resigned shortly after Mattis, reportedly also over the abrupt Syria pullout. Trump has taken shots at both Mattis and McGurk on Twitter in recent days.The president on Tuesday made calls to U.S. service members stationed in Guam, Bahrain, Qatar and Alaska, but he did not speak with troops stationed in Afghanistan, Iraq or Syria. Journalists have traditionally agreed to hold off on reporting a U.S. president s travel to a war zone for security reasons, consenting to an embargo of the details of the trip. But speculation that he was abroad began to rise as observers noticed that Trump had not tweeted on Wednesday, even though he had been active on social media over the Christmas holidays. Flight trackers on Twitter also played a leading role in outing the president s post-Christmas travel plans, flagging the departure of an unidentified military aircraft from Joint Base Andrews early Wednesday and tracing its path to the United Kingdom and then to Italy. Reporters have for weeks been waiting for Trump to make an unexpected trip abroad. The president canceled his scheduled trip to his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida because of the partial government shutdown. The White House hasn t been distributing a daily schedule for the president since the shutdown, so Trump s relative absence from public view in recent days made it easier for him to secretly travel abroad.Last month, a reporter asked the president whether he was  afraid  to visit a combat theater.  No, I m going to a war zone,  Trump responded, though he would not say when.But Trump also signaled earlier this year that traveling to a war zone was not a huge priority.  I will do that at some point, but I don t think it s overly necessary. I ve been very busy with everything that s taking place here,  he said in an October interview with the AP. The day before Thanksgiving, Mattis cryptically suggested that he had advised Trump not to visit some combat areas, but he didn t say which ones.  The president is the commander in chief and he decides where he needs to go,  Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon at the time.  There are times I don t want him in certain locations, to be frank with you, for his security and the troops  security. There s places that, I ve been very straightforward, I don t want him to go at certain times. 
                    Government Shutdown 
                    By JOHN BRESNAHAN and RACHAEL BADETrump s nearly two-year delay in visiting deployed troops has long been a subject of speculation and criticism. Barack Obama made the first of his five visits to Iraq and Afghanistan just three months after taking office. George W. Bush made six trips, with the first coming two years after he ordered U.S. forces into Afghanistan and eight months after he launched the war in Iraq. The president should visit the combat theaters  not just to get an idea of what s going on, but to personally thank men and women in the uniform of the United States who are exposing themselves to great dangers for the country,  Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) told reporters in October. That goes a long way, and that s something that the commander in chief should do,  Reed said, calling such trips  absolutely indispensable. For units deployed in combat theaters, a presidential visit can be both a morale boost and a logistical disruption. Security concerns can grind day-to-day flights and other activities to a halt. They distract from the military effort while they are happening, they consume resources, and they provide targets to the enemy, so you have to balance all that against the political benefits,  David Sedney, who served with the State Department in Afghanistan under Bush and was a senior Obama Pentagon official, said in an interview earlier this year.Al Asad, a remote airbase in the desert of western Iraq s Anbar Province, is a logistical hub for U.S. troops helping Iraqi forces fight Islamic State holdouts near the border with Syria. As one of the largest U.S. bases in the country from 2003 to 2011, it also hosted George W. Bush s summer 2007 visit at the height of the surge. About 5,200 U.S. troops are in Iraq advising local forces on counterinsurgency operations and providing airstrikes, artillery, intelligence and other support. Some troops deployed near the Syrian border have recently been firing artillery into the Hajin area of Syria, where U.S. special operations forces were helping Kurdish and Arab militias grind down the Islamic State s last territorial pocket in the country before Trump s surprise Syria pullout order last week.In recent days, U.S. convoys and flights of helicopters have been photographed leaving Syria for Iraq, which is expected to remain a hub for counterterrorism against Islamic State remnants. The Pentagon has reportedly floated the possibility of launching occasional special operations raids from Iraq into Syria to compensate for the pullout of the 2,000 advisers on the ground, but the fate of the air campaign remains unclear. Although the president has praised the armed services, he has not served in the military, and he was able to avoid being drafted to fight in Vietnam because of a medical exemption for bone spurs. The New York Times on Wednesday reported that daughters of the late podiatrist Larry Braunstein said the doctor provided the diagnosis of bone spurs for a medical exemption to Trump as a favor.

Because of the partial government shutdown, however, an extension to file an opening brief for the appeal has been requested until government funding is restored.The appeal comes several days after the Supreme Court let stand Tigar s ruling in a 5-4 decision, with Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the court s four liberal justices.The president has long criticized the 9th Circuit, calling it  very unfair.

                    Updated 12/26/2018 02:28 PM ESTLawyers for President Donald Trump are invoking the government shutdown to seek a delay in a court case over claims that Trump is illegally profiting from business his Washington hotel does with foreign countries.Justice Department attorneys representing Trump asked a federal appeals court on Wednesday to postpone indefinitely all further filings in an appeal related to a suit that the governments of Maryland and Washington, D.C., filed over Trump s alleged violation of the Constitution s ban on foreign emoluments.Story Continued BelowThe government s brief is not due until Jan. 22, but DOJ lawyers asked the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Richmond, Va., to put the appeal on ice until the shutdown ends. The Department does not know when funding will be restored by Congress,  Justice lawyers wrote.  Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including  emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property .   Undersigned counsel for the Department of Justice therefore requests a stay of briefing on the President s mandamus petition until Congress has restored appropriations to the Department.

You can unsubscribe at any time.A short time after the government filed the request, the court agreed to put the case on hold indefinitely.The Justice Department lawyers appear to be asking the appeals court not only to lift the deadlines in the case, but also to extend them by the duration of the shutdown once Congress and the president put new funding in place.Similar motions were being filed Wednesday in a variety of civil cases the federal government is involved in, including some litigation related to Trump s policy limiting grants of asylumThe Justice Department is one of the government agencies lacking appropriations because of the shutdown, but most personnel, such as FBI agents, prison guards and criminal prosecutors, have been designated as essential. Lawyers handling civil litigation for the federal government are typically furloughed during a shutdown. However, if a court orders the Justice Department to keep working on a civil case, attorneys are permitted to do so.Justice Department attorneys are representing Trump in the case because the D.C. and Maryland suit was initially filed against Trump in his official capacity as president. Justice lawyers typically represent all government employees sued in connection with their official duties. The case was later amended   at the suggestion of U.S. District Court Judge Peter Messitte, the judge overseeing it   to name Trump personally as a defendant. He now has private lawyers also representing him in the litigation.The Justice Department filed an unusual petition with the 4th Circuit earlier this month in a bid to halt discovery in the case and to seek review of Messitte s refusal of federal government motions to dismiss the suit on standing and other grounds.The 4th Circuit issued an order last week granting a stay of discovery while the appeals court takes up the dispute. That means lawyers for Maryland and D.C. had to shelve, for now, plans to use subpoenas to demand information about foreign officials  use of the Trump International Hotel in Washington. The appeals court said it planned to hear arguments in the fight in March, although that timeline could be in jeopardy if briefs in the case are substantially delayed.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/26/2018 05:29 PM ESTHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen sought to deflect blame Wednesday for the Christmas Eve death of an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy in the custody of U.S. Border Patrol agents, blaming  a system that prevents parents who bring their children on a dangerous and illegal journey from facing consequences for their actions. The boy s death, combined with the death earlier this month of a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl in Border Patrol custody, raises questions about conditions for detainees at a time when President Donald Trump is trying to rally support for get-tough policies on immigration amid a government shutdown over whether to spend $5 billion on a border wall.Story Continued Below Our system has been pushed to a breaking point by those who seek open borders,  Nielsen said in a written statement.  Smugglers, traffickers, and their own parents put these minors at risk by embarking on the dangerous and arduous journey north. In January, Trump will have to face a Democratic House with newfound oversight authority. Incoming Majority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Wednesday in a written statement that the House will  hold hearings on the young boy s death and the death of seven-year-old Jakelin Caal earlier this month   as well as the conditions under which thousands of children are being held. Caal, along with her father, was part of a group of 163 migrants arrested Dec. 6 near a border crossing in New Mexico. She began vomiting and stopped breathing while in the care of U.S. Customs and Border Protection before eventually dying at a Texas hospital. There is no reason that President Trump should be asking to fund a border wall when we are missing basic humanitarian pieces,  said Rep. JoaquÌn Castro (D-Texas).Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning   in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Border authorities blamed the boy s death on a variety of factors even as they promised to more closely examine medical care of children. There are  literally dozens  of migrants crossing the border each day with illnesses, and DHS is looking into whether migrant shelters in Mexico  may be prone to spreading disease, et cetera, that are causing some of these illnesses,  a DHS official told reporters on a conference call Wednesday.DHS is seeking to examine health conditions at Mexican migrant facilities, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nielsen will soon be visiting installations south of the border.The child was detained Dec. 18 with his father illegally crossing the border near El Paso, Texas, and was transferred to the hospital the morning of Dec. 24 after coughing and exhibiting flu-like symptoms, DHS officials said on the call.The boy tested negative for strep throat and, despite having a high fever, was diagnosed with a cold and released back to border agents with prescriptions for antibiotics and Tylenol, officials said. Later that night, after a series of welfare checks, Border Patrol agents rushed him back to the hospital after he appeared nauseous and lethargic. There was no emergency medical technician on site, officials said.DHS officials didn t say whether staffing in the El Paso facility was affected by the federal government shutdown; nearly 90 percent of DHS employees are considered  exempt  and continue to work.The child lost consciousness on the way and was pronounced dead at the hospital just before midnight. He was identified by authorities in his home country as Felipe GÛmez Alonzo, according to The Associated Press.Authorities are conducting an  ongoing investigation regarding the decisions and factors,  the DHS said on the call.In response to the boy s death, the department on Wednesday ordered secondary medical checks on every child in its custody, with a particular focus on children under 10. This is a tragic loss,  said CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan in a statement Tuesday.  On behalf of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, our deepest sympathies go out to the family. McAleenan supported the president s position on Wednesday, telling CBS:  We need border security investments, absolutely. CBP said it needs assistance from other government agencies in providing health services to migrants in its care. The agency  is considering options for surge medical assistance  from the Coast Guard and may request further aid from Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. CBP is also coordinating with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Ted Hesson contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

And volumes are tipped to slow further even as the U.S. and China seek to resolve their trade spat, with companies warning of ongoing disruption. Already there are casualties. ... Recent data underscore concerns that trade will be a drag on American growth next year. U.S. consumers are feeling the least optimistic about the future economy in a year, while small business optimism about economic improvement fell to a two-year low and companies expect smaller profit gains in 2019.

Sherrod Brown hasn t decided whether he s running for president   but he s checking off a lot of the boxes that come along the way. The Ohio Democrat is reaching out to fellow senators and party officials in early primary and caucus states. His team is collecting rÈsumÈs for potential campaign workers in those states.  He is airing a broad campaign theme with a concise slogan    the dignity of work    in a rising number of press interviews and TV appearances, and he wants to road-test the theme in speeches or town hall-style events. And Brown s staff is looking into arranging time for him to visit with former President Barack Obama, who has met with a parade of potential 2020 candidates seeking his counsel in the past year.  POLITICO--  Black Voters, a Force in Democratic Politics, Are Ready to Make Themselves Heard,  by NYT s Astead Herndon in Baltimore:  Brown, the Ohio Democrat also considering a presidential campaign, said it s important that Democratic progressives make a distinction between President Trump s  phony populism  and a true populist message, which does not divide on racial or religious lines.  In an interview, Mr. Brown said those who characterize him as a politician for the  white working class  are missing the point, because his message on the  dignity of work    which is inspired by a speech from Martin Luther King Jr.   specifically acknowledges the existence of discrimination and has support throughout Ohio s minority communities.  I never talked about the  white working class    I talk about workers,  Mr. Brown said.  If we talk about the minimum wage increase, or if we fight against tax cuts for the rich or if we passed better trade policy   that will help black workers every bit as much as it will help white workers. And in many cases, it will probably help them more.   My message is never to segment white workers and black workers except when talking about discrimination against black workers,  he said.  NYT

The Pentagon and State Department have denied knowing whether American bombs were used in the war s most notorious airstrikes, which have struck weddings, mosques and funerals. However, a former senior State Department official said that the United States had access to records of every airstrike over Yemen since the early days of the war, including the warplane and munitions used. At the same time, American efforts to advise the Saudis on how to protect civilians often came to naught. The Saudis ... often ignored a voluminous no-strike list. ...

CBP said in a statement late Tuesday that an agent first noticed the boy had a cough and  glossy eyes  at about 9 a.m. Monday. He was eventually hospitalized twice and died just before midnight, the agency said. CBP had said earlier that the boy died just after midnight.CBP said in the statement it needs the help of other government agencies to provide health care. The agency  is considering options for surge medical assistance  from the U.S. Coast Guard and might request help from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.A CBP spokesman could not immediately answer how many children are currently in the agency s custody.

The White House referred questions about the latest case to the Department of Homeland Security, CBP s parent agency. CBP officers and the Border Patrol remain on the job despite the shutdown.CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in a statement that the child s death was a  tragic loss.

                    By ASSOCIATED PRESSFelipe was taken with his father to a hospital in Alamogordo, N.M., where he was diagnosed with a common cold, according to the timeline.The boy was released just before 3 p.m., about 90 minutes after he had been found to have a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 Celsius), CBP said. He was prescribed amoxicillin and ibuprofen and taken with his father to a holding facility at a highway checkpoint.At about 7 p.m., agents helped clean up the boy s vomit. CBP said the father  declined further medical assistance  then.But at about 10 p.m., the boy  appeared lethargic and nauseous again,  the agency said, and agents decided to have taken him to the hospital. The boy died at 11:48 p.m. Monday, the agency said.The hospital, the Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center, declined to comment, citing privacy regulations.
                    EMPLOYMENT & IMMIGRATION
                    By TED HESSONFelipe and his father were detained by CBP for about a week, an unusually long period time that the agency did not fully explain Tuesday.CBP typically detains immigrants for no more than a few days when they cross the border before either releasing them or turning them over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for longer-term detention.Agency guidelines say immigrants generally shouldn t be detained for more than 72 hours in CBP holding facilities, which are usually smaller and have fewer services than ICE detention centers.CBP said it apprehended Felipe and his father on Dec. 18 about 3 miles away from an official port of entry, the Paso del Norte bridge connecting El Paso and Juarez, Mexico. They were held at a processing center for almost two days, then taken to the El Paso Border Patrol station on Thursday.CBP said it moved them to Alamogordo at about 1 a.m. Sunday  because of capacity levels at the El Paso station.  Alamogordo is about 90 miles (145 kilometers) from El Paso.The agency didn t say why it held Felipe and his father for so long, but said its officers repeatedly conducted welfare checks on them.Oscar Padilla, the Guatemalan consul in Phoenix, said he was told by the boy s father in a telephone interview that the two had been traveling from their home in NentÛn, a village about 280 miles (450 kilometers) from Guatemala City. They were planning to go to Johnson City, Tenn.CBP promised  an independent and thorough review of the circumstances,  and the Guatemalan foreign ministry called for an investigation  in accordance with due process. Democratic members of Congress and immigration advocates sharply criticized CBP s handling of Jakelin Caal s death and questioned whether border agents could have prevented it by spotting symptoms of distress or calling for an evacuation by air ambulance earlier.CBP has said it took several hours to transport Jakelin and her father from a remote Border Patrol facility to a larger station, where her temperature was measured at 105.7 degrees Fahrenheit (40.9 degrees Celsius). Emergency medical technicians had to revive her twice. She was ultimately flown to an El Paso hospital, where she died the next day.Xochitl Torres Small, a Democrat who will represent the district starting in January, called for a thorough and transparent investigation into the children s deaths and more medical resources along the border. This is inexcusable,  Torres Small said in a statement Tuesday.  Instead of immediately acting to keep children and all of us safe along our border, this administration forced a government shutdown over a wall. Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/25/2018 06:48 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump used a Christmas morning gathering in the Oval Office to reiterate the reasons he insists funding is needed for a border wall, even if it means the federal government will continue to be partially shut down. I can t tell you when the government is going to reopen,  Trump said, according to pool reports. Story Continued BelowNot until, he explained,  we have a wall, a fence, whatever they d like to call it. I ll call it whatever they want. But it s all the same thing. It s a barrier from people pouring into our country. Fielding questions Tuesday morning in the Oval Office after talking with members of the armed forces, Trump also doubled down on his criticism of the Federal Reserve, saying they are raising interest rates too quickly; again expressed his belief that it was Democrats who colluded with Russians, not his campaign; and again defended his firing of FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. It s a disgrace what s happening in our country. But other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas,  the president said.
                    government shutdown
                    By BURGESS EVERETTThe dispute over funding for a border wall led to the partial government shutdown that started early Saturday. The House, with Trump s backing, approved a bill that included $5 billion for the would-be wall, but the Senate did not, and Congress adjourned without the bills being reconciled.Keeping up his drumbeat of recent days, Trump stated:  We want the wall money to be increased,  but did not say whether figure of $5 billion was non-negotiable.The president said he thought that even those federal workers who were losing their paychecks would be supportive of his efforts. I think they understand what s happening,  he said.  They want border security. The people of this country want border security. It s not a question of me. I d rather not be doing shutdowns. In discussing his insistence on the need for a wall, the president said the people of San Diego had asked for one. People were walking through Mexico right into San Diego, right over people s front lawns by the hundreds, by the thousands. And they came to us, they asked for a wall,   Trump said, without offering any supporting evidence of this type of onslaught.  A drone isn t going to stop it.

                    By CHRISTOPHER CADELAGOTrump said he believed the wall would serve as a  barrier from drugs  and also against human trafficking. He also responded to criticism that the wall wouldn t really keep people out. Now there may be the case of an Olympic champion who can get over the wall but for the most part you are not able to do it. Very high. It s gonna be 30 feet. Much of it is 30 feet high. Some if it s low. But in some areas we have it as high as 30 feet. That s like a three-story building. The president also gave a timeline for the completion of the wall. It s my hope to have this done, completed   all 500 to 550 miles   to have it either renovated or brand new by election time,  he said, presumably referring to the November 2020 presidential election.Trump also noted that he had canceled his Christmas plans for a trip to Mar-a-Lago to be in Washington during the shutdown crisis. (First lady Melania Trump did join him on Christmas Eve for a church service at the National Cathedral.) My family s in Florida   Palm Beach. And I just didn t want to go down and be there when other people are hurting. But it s gonna all work out. Later in the day, he circled back to the holiday on Twitter. I hope everyone, even the Fake News Media, is having a great Christmas! Our Country is doing very well. We are securing our Borders, making great new Trade Deals, and bringing our Troops Back Home. We are finally putting America First. MERRY CHRISTMAS! #MAGA CORRECTION:  An earlier version of this article misstated when the government shutdown began.Missing out on the latest scoops?

(AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino) | Alessandra Tarantino/AP photoMERRY CHRISTMAS!   THE POPE S MESSAGE, via the Telegraph:  Pope Francis has used his traditional Christmas Day address urging people to overcome their religious and cultural differences to end conflict in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East. Delivering his sixth  Urbi et Orbi  address to 50,000 people gathered in Saint Peter s Square on Tuesday, the pope said Jesus Christ had given the world  fraternity  and differences should not be seen as a  detriment or a danger  but  a source of richness .  My wish for a happy Christmas is a wish for fraternity,  the pope said.  All of us are brothers and sisters in humanity.  Just days after Donald Trump, the U.S. president, announced he would withdraw American troops from Syria and urged Saudi Arabia to help rebuild the country, the pope called for an urgent political solution that would allow millions of Syrian refugees to return home.  May the international community work decisively for a political solution that can put aside divisions and partisan interests, so that the Syrian people, especially all those who were forced to leave their own lands and seek refuge elsewhere, can return to live in peace in their own country,  the pope said.  The Telegraph-- @realDonaldTrump at 7:59 a.m.:  Merry Christmas! DRUDGE banner,  ALL ALONE AP:  Trump tells boy that believing in Santa Claus at 7 is  marginal  :  President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump on Christmas Eve took calls from children anxious to find out where Santa was on his gift-giving journey. In one conversation, Trump asked a 7-year-old named Coleman,  Are you still a believer in Santa?  He listened for a moment before adding,  Because at 7, it s marginal, right?

Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents began dropping off the migrants late Sunday at a local bus station without warning local shelters that usually take in large groups after they seek asylum and are released by federal agents. About 200 arrived Sunday, about 200 more arrived Monday and the total number could exceed 800 by Wednesday, according to U.S. Rep. Beto O Rourke, D-El Paso. Normally, ICE would alert the Annunciation House, a local shelter that has taken in tens of thousands of migrants and has several locations across this border city. But that didn t happen Sunday night, O Rourke said.  Our challenge is that, so far, ICE has been unable to give us enough of a heads up to have those beds ready so you don t have migrants sitting on the sidewalk or in a parking lot or in a bus station or on a Sun Metro bus,  O Rourke told reporters in the parking lot of a local park about a block west of the bus station.

Warmbier s parents sued North Korea in April over their son s death. The 22-year-old student died days after he was returned to the United States in a coma, and an Ohio coroner said the cause of death was lack of oxygen and blood to the brain.  North Korea is liable for the torture, hostage taking, and extrajudicial killing of Otto Warmbier, and the injuries to his mother and father, Fred and Cindy Warmbier,  Judge Beryl Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said in her ruling. Pyongyang has blamed botulism and ingestion of a sleeping pill for Warmbier s death and dismissed torture claims.

                        2020 Elections
                        Four candidates are laying groundwork for campaigns, and two are already sparring, which could signal a long and difficult primary in 2020.
                    By JAMES ARKIN12/25/2018 07:51 AM ESTArizona Democrats like their chances to beat Martha McSally again in 2020. But they may have to settle a long and crowded Senate primary first.Four Democrats have already started laying the groundwork for Senate special election campaigns, meeting with party leaders and even sparring over their credentials   even before McSally was appointed to fill the next two years of the late Sen. John McCain s term. The party believes McSally will be vulnerable after losing a tough campaign to Sen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema in 2018.Story Continued BelowIt s possible the Democratic field would clear if Democrats land a candidate they have coveted for years: Mark Kelly, the former astronaut and Navy veteran married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who is laying the foundation for a potential campaign. But if not, a big primary could put the Democratic nominee in the same position as McSally was in 2018: trading intraparty attacks until the end of August 2020, just weeks before mail voting starts in the general election, in one of the most important states in the fight for the Senate majority. Two potential candidates are already criticizing each other s credentials before even entering the race.Since Giffords resigned from Congress a year after surviving a 2011 shooting, Democratic leaders have tried in vain to recruit Kelly to run for office in Arizona. But he is now taking active steps to consider a 2020 Senate campaign, including a sit-down meeting earlier this month with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), the incoming chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, according to a person familiar with the meeting.Kelly s unique biography and recent work as a national gun-control advocate with Giffords has given him a major fundraising network and a profile that supporters believe would make him a formidable candidate. 
                            Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said in an interview he was leaning toward running and would likely announce a decision in early January. | Matt York/AP Photo With Mark s ability to fundraise, his biography as a former astronaut and veteran and of course being married to Gabby Giffords, I think all those things put him in a really strong place,  said Roy Herrera, a veteran Democratic lawyer in Arizona who is close with Kelly and other potential candidates. Herrera added that while Kelly has resisted entreaties to run for office in the past, he is looking at 2020  very seriously. So are three other Democrats. Grant Woods, a Republican-turned Democrat who was once Arizona s attorney general, has been publicly weighing a bid for months and told POLITICO he has taken every step toward running, calling his potential campaign  full speed ahead.  Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said in an interview he was leaning toward running and would likely announce a decision in early January. Rep.-elect Greg Stanton, the former mayor of Phoenix who won election to Sinema s House seat in November, is also considering a campaign.Woods, who also served as McCain s chief of staff in Congress in the 1980s, said he met with Cortez Masto in mid-December during a visit to Washington, where he also sat down with several other senators who previously served as state attorneys general. Gallego said he had a meeting scheduled with DSCC leadership last week that was rescheduled for early January because of the potential government shutdown. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), one of the former attorneys general in the Senate, is a longtime friend of Woods and grew close with Kelly after working with him on gun control. Blumenthal met with Woods in Washington and also has spoken to Kelly about a potential Senate campaign, and he said both would be good senators, though he declined to discuss details of either meeting. Some Democrats are concerned about the potential for a nasty primary if all potential candidates enter the race. Gallego and Woods, in particular, appear ready to go to battle representing opposite ends of the Democratic spectrum   Gallego as a staunch progressive and Woods as a former Republican fed up with President Donald Trump.In separate interviews, the two potential candidates swiped at each other s political viability.Gallego cited his background as a combat veteran and work on the Armed Services Committee as critical factors in a state with a large veteran population, and he said he would be able to mobilize young and Hispanic voters. When asked about Woods, he jokingly asked whether Woods planned to run as a Democrat.
                    2020 elections
                    By MARC CAPUTO, STEVEN SHEPARD and SCOTT BLAND Grant Woods is not a moderate,  Gallego said, criticizing Woods for co-chairing former Republican Gov. Jan Brewer s 2010 campaign.  The most important thing besides me or Grant winning is the fact that we take back the Senate,  Gallego added.  I don t think Grant can do it. Woods criticized Gallego as relatively new to Arizona and less experienced. He brushed off questions about why Democratic voters would back a former Republican, saying his own views would be mainstream within Democratic politics   he is pro-abortion rights and anti-offshore drilling   and comparing himself to former Vice President Joe Biden. Woods also pointed out that Sinema voted with President Donald Trump 62 percent of the time in the last Congress, according to FiveThirtyEight, and said he expected his own voting percentage would be much lower. (Gallego has voted with Trump 17 percent of the time.)Woods became a major supporter of Sinema this year after renouncing the Republican Party over Trump, and he said her victory is proof that a candidate like him would be formidable.  Kyrsten s election is a powerful road map of what Democrats need to do in Arizona,  Woods said, citing her centrist message aimed at independent voters.  It shows you can win, but it also shows it s very difficult to win. The governor s race here showed how not to do it,  Woods continued, referring to Democrat David Garcia s double-digit loss to Republican incumbent Doug Ducey. Sinema s campaign largely avoided Garcia, who ran to her left on issues including immigration.Republicans are counting on a 2020 Democratic skirmish to help McSally, who lost to Sinema by 2 points and faced criticism from Republicans over her campaign decisions and messaging. The GOP is optimistic McSally will operate from a position of strength as an incumbent, having struck an uplifting tone upon her appointment, praising McCain and saying she looked forward to working with Sinema.

                    By NATASHA KORECKI The field will not be cleared for [Democrats],  said Barrett Marson, a Republican operative who ran a pro-McSally super PAC this year.  They will have an expensive primary and could come limping out.  But not all of the Democrats considering campaigns may actually launch them. And Felecia Rotellini, the state Democratic Party chairwoman, rejected the notion that the primary would be detrimental to the party s chances to defeat McSally.  I m not willing to concede that we ll have a nasty primary,  Rotellini said.  It s not even 2019 yet, and I m a firm believer that a primary will help our candidates. Rotellini said she has spoken to all four potential candidates: Gallego, Kelly, Stanton and Woods. She declined to address those conversations other than to say all four were deliberating on potential campaigns. She said she would work to avoid intraparty fighting, but she was  cautiously optimistic  that such attacks would be kept to a minimum. Rotellini also previewed what s likely to be a central Democratic attack against McSally: her appointment to the seat following a failed campaign.  It s clear that Washington, D.C., insiders handpicked Martha McSally to represent Arizonans,  Rotellini said.  After running a very divisive, dishonest campaign for over a year, the voters rejected her. They don t trust her. Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/24/2018 04:30 PM ESTA large swath of the federal government is shut down   and so are negotiations to reopen it.President Donald Trump s standoff with Democratic leaders over the border wall dragged into a third day on Monday, with no hopes on either side of a Christmas deal to break the stalemate. It s been 48 hours since the last real discussions between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Vice President Mike Pence, and there s growing sentiment in the Capitol that the closure could drag on until mid-January.Story Continued BelowThe president spent the day airing his grievances about the impasse on Twitter, saying he s  waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security.  And the Capitol was empty on Monday save for a quick House session and Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), who told everyone to prepare for a long standoff.  This is my fifth shutdown. I m beyond frustrated. LBJ said,  Sometimes you just have to hunker down like a jackass in a hailstorm and just take it.  So that s where we are,  Roberts told reporters.  Every one of the shutdowns I ve been associated with have not worked. And they worked to the advantage of the people that are on the other side. While Trump has told allies he d be willing to come down from his demand for $5 billion in border wall money, Democrats have stood firm on $1.3 billion for fencing, consistent with current spending levels. On Saturday, Pence offered Schumer a bill to reopen the government that would provide $2.1 billion for fencing and an additional $400 million for Trump s other immigration priorities; Democrats countered with $1.3 billion in fencing and more aid for Puerto Rico as part of a disaster package, according to a person familiar with the talks, which essentially recirculated past offers.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Senior Republicans are now looking toward January as the likely end date for the shutdown, which is affecting a quarter of the federal government. Some GOP officials now predict nothing will budge until House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) becomes speaker; that could push the closure to early- to mid-January. Once Pelosi takes over as speaker, she is expected to send a funding bill sans wall money to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Confident that Trump is losing the PR battle, Democrats have hardened their position, refusing to raise their $1.3 billion offer for border security. In a joint statement, Schumer and Pelosi said different White House officials are contradicting themselves in talks to end the shutdown,  making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment.  In addition to Pence, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and adviser Jared Kushner had been leading talks with Schumer.  Instead of bringing certainty into people s lives, he s continuing the Trump shutdown just to please right-wing radio and TV hosts,  the Democrats said of Trump.  As long as the president is guided by the House Freedom Caucus, it s hard to see how he can come up with a solution that can pass both the House and Senate. Democrats have also been talking to Senate Appropriations chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), who attended a lunch with Trump on Saturday. Shelby and House Freedom Caucus members were among the attendees, who hoped to get on the same page with the president about getting more border security money than Democrats have offered. 
                    Government Shutdown
                    By CHRISTOPHER CADELAGOThe president s allies argue that Pelosi can t compromise until she s speaker.  There s no question that her speakership seems to be in balance against border security. That s a problem they re going to have to solve on the Democrats  side,  said Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) on Fox News. He implored Democrats to  meet in the middle and provide some resources for a wall and more resources for border security broadly. The shutdown has given Democrats another data point to portray Trump as an agent of chaos presiding over a flailing administration. In the past few days alone, the president pushed out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, drew bipartisan scorn for his decision to pull American troops out of Syria and attacked the Federal Reserve chairman for raising interest rates as the president watched the stock market plunge. That beating continued on Monday, with major domestic exchanges dropping more than 2 percentage points in Christmas Eve trading. The president was set to convene a meeting on border security on Monday afternoon with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and other officials. Ahead of that event, Trump continued attacking Democrats.
                    Government Shutdown
                    By JOHN BRESNAHAN and JAKE SHERMAN Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence,  Trump tweeted, referring to past immigration bills that also would have given undocumented immigrants legal status.  It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked, that they turned against it. Desperately needed! In another tweet, Trump wrote:  I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. Congress has basically given up on ending the shutdown until at least later this week, when the Senate will come back into session on Thursday. Until then, lawmakers have been told they could be called back if negotiations intensify, but there s been no sign of that being necessary.Roberts seemed surprised to leave a short Senate session to find about a dozen reporters waiting for him, eager to learn the latest on the shutdown. Don t you people have anything better to do?  the senator joked. But Roberts didn t appear to, either. Poinsettia in hand, he stopped to hold court for several minutes with the assembled scribes.

It was its worst Christmas Eve ever. The S&P 500 dropped into a bear market.The president, a stock-obsessed businessman, again made clear where he lays the blame. The only problem our economy has is the Fed,  he tweeted.  They don t have a feel for the Market, they don t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders.

It s Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos,  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a joint statement.  The stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve   after he just fired the Secretary of Defense. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who s in line to be the next head of the House Financial Services Committee chair, blamed the decline on uncertainty caused by Trump and Mnuchin.  It would be in our nation s best interest if they stopped what they are doing,  she said in a statement.The threat that Trump might fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whose role s independence from political whims is fundamental to the banking system, has already scared investors.Trump has trained his ire on Powell over the falling stock markets. The New York Times reported Sunday that he has asked aides about firing the chairman.Most experts reject Trump s characterization of the tumult on Wall Street, which just had its worst week in a decade   since the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed s steady raising of interest rates has played a role in sliding stock markets. But so, too, have Trump s trade wars and a partial government shutdown that he initially declared himself proud to own.
                    Government Shutdown
                    By JOHN BRESNAHAN and JAKE SHERMANThe latest jolt arrived Sunday, when Mnuchin announced that he had talked with the heads of the country s six biggest banks to ensure they all had sufficient cash on hand.The Treasury secretary was trying to reassure. And he also sought to tamp down speculation about Powell s firing. But by Monday morning, it was clear his statement may have backfired.Two executives familiar with Mnuchin s calls to bank CEOs told POLITICO that the calls themselves were fine   but that Mnuchin erred with the follow-up statement. He was doing what he should do and what he does do, which is be in regular contact with CEOs, find out what they are seeing, what they are worried about,  said one executive.  But in this case he made a mistake and made it look like markets needed reassurance when they don t need reassurance.  He didn t need to put out that statement at all, it looked panicky.

                    By ELI OKUN12/24/2018 10:41 AM ESTAmid a government shutdown centered on President Donald Trump s demands for border wall funding, the president again slammed Democrats on Monday for refusing to give him the funding levels he wants. Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence,  Trump tweeted.  It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked, that they turned against it. Desperately needed! Story Continued BelowThe comments echo a talking point that congressional Republicans have circulated in recent days   noting that a failed 2013 immigration plan, which garnered Senate Democratic support, would have devoted $46 billion to border security.That is much more than the $5 billion Trump has demanded in border wall funding, a point that largely prompted the current shutdown.But the $46 billion tells only part of the story. Just $8 billion would have gone toward border fencing   which Democrats are at pains to note is different than a wall. A  30-foot concrete wall, 30-foot steel spikes, that s not the smart way, and that s what all the experts on the border tell us,  said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) on Sunday s  This Week  on ABC in discussing the distinction.

                    By DAVID COHENAlso, the $46 billion was part of a broader immigration package that included a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants. House Republicans quashed that legislation, declining to take it up.Trump has continued to hammer immigration restrictions, his signature issue.He tweeted late Sunday night,  The most important way to stop gangs, drugs, human trafficking and massive crime is at our Southern Border. We need Border Security, and as EVERYONE knows, you can t have Border Security without a Wall. The Drones & Technology are just bells and whistles. Safety for America! But his insistence that illegal immigration has surged to crisis levels misrepresents the facts on the ground. Border Patrol arrests in fiscal 2018 were less than half the numbers during the Clinton administration, and the most recent data are fairly consistent with arrests during the Obama administration.Trump has held firm in his demand for more border wall money, with his administration forecasting an extended government shutdown over the impasse.The Republican-led House passed a stopgap spending bill last week that would have allocated Trump s $5 billion   but it went nowhere fast in the Senate, which had already passed legislation that did not include that funding. Negotiations to end the shutdown have slowed to a crawl, with some observers expecting it to last until Democrats assume power in the House in the new year.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                            Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin steps off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base on Dec. 2, 2017. | Mandel Ngan/AFP/GettyBULLETIN   NETANYAHU CALLS EARLY ELECTIONS   AP S ARON HELLER in Jerusalem:  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s government agreed Wednesday to hold early elections on April 9 after the ruling coalition appeared to come up short on votes needed to pass a contentious piece of court-ordered legislation, Israel media reported. Netanyahu s religious, nationalistic coalition has been roiled by internal divisions for months. Avigdor Lieberman resigned as defense minister last month to protest what he perceived to be the government s weak response to rocket attacks from Hamas-ruled Gaza.    The latest polls appear to predict another solid victory for Netanyahu, one that would assure his place in history as Israel s longest-serving leader and allow him to solidify his close alliance with President Donald Trump. Another term would also allow Netanyahu to push forward with his nationalistic agenda and worldwide campaign to thwart Iran s nuclear ambitions.  APGOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN: Day 3. Merry Christmas Eve. There has been practically no movement in resolving the standoff over the funding of a big chunk of the government. The Capitol was completely empty yesterday. We hardly saw anyone. This is among the strangest shutdowns ever. JOHN BRESNAHAN and JAKE SHERMAN:  The  all-I-want-for-Christmas-is-$5-billion-for-the-wall  shutdown EVERYTHING WAS EERILY QUIET BUT   YESTERDAY, at around 5 p.m., Treasury sent out an email with this subject line:  Secretary Mnuchin convened individual calls with the CEOs of the nation s six largest banks.  -- TREASURY SAID:  Secretary Mnuchin conducted a series of calls today with the CEOs of the nation s six largest banks: Brian Moynihan, Bank of America; Michael Corbat, Citi; David Solomon, Goldman Sachs; Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan Chase, James Gorman, Morgan Stanley; Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo. The CEOs confirmed that they have ample liquidity available for lending to consumer, business markets, and all other market operations. He also confirmed that they have not experienced any clearance or margin issues and that the markets continue to function properly. HUH!?!?? We got emails from several Wall Streeters wondering what was going on. No one thought bank liquidity was an issue. Mnuchin is in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, by the way. -- FT S KATE ALLEN in LONDON:  A ripple of unease has spread through financial markets after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin s highly unusual effort to reassure investors about Wall Street banks  liquidity. The statement appeared to be an attempt by the administration to calm nerves after a volatile week for traders and media reports that President Donald Trump was contemplating firing Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell.  Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, warned that among traders,  sentiment is so negative right now that markets will assume the worst  about any suggestion that Mr Trump could seek to remove Mr. Powell.  Until this weekend, markets were not that concerned about liquidity or clearance issues,  Mr. Thin said.  At best, Mnuchin made a rookie policy mistake in trying to reassure markets; at worst, Mnuchin knows something that the markets don t.   Quiet European markets have caught a sense of the uncertainty   the FTSE 100 is down 0.8 percent in thin pre-Christmas trading on Monday, with the pan-European Stoxx 50 down 0.4 percent. French and Italian indices have also been hit, with the CAC 40 falling 0.6 percent and the FTSE MIB down 1 per cent.  FT-- WAPO S DAMIAN PALETTA and JOSH DAWSEY:  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin startled financial analysts, bankers and economists on Sunday by issuing an unusual statement declaring that the nation s six largest banks had ample credit to extend to American businesses and households. Mnuchin made the statement on Twitter after calling the leaders of the six banks, seeking to address an issue that had attracted little concern ahead of the treasury secretary s tweet. The statement came hours before Asian markets were set to open and following a sharp sell-off that made last week the worst for U.S. markets in a decade. President Trump has been furious at the sell-off, and efforts by Mnuchin to inspire confidence in the market have so far failed. Several analysts said Sunday night that his outreach to the banks and subsequent statement were likely to backfire and drive even more concern.  WaPo-- AND FOR GOOD MEASURE   REUTERS:  The Treasury said Mnuchin will convene a call on Monday with the president s Working Group on Financial Markets, which includes Washington s main stewards of the U.S. financial system and is sometimes referred to as the  Plunge Protection Team.  The group, which was also convened in 2009 during the latter stage of the financial crisis, includes officials from the Federal Reserve as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ON MATTIS   -- NYT, A1, HELENE COOPER and KATIE ROGERS:  Trump, Angry Over Mattis s Rebuke, Removes Him 2 Months Early :  Mr. Mattis had wanted to stay through a NATO defense ministers meeting scheduled for February, hoping to enshrine recent moves by the alliance to bulk up its security compact as a bulwark against Russia. But Mr. Mattis s resignation letter did him no favors on that count: It had become hard to envision how he could continue for two months to represent a president whose own views toward Russia are far more benign. As it became clear that the two men s ideas of how to treat both friends and adversaries were so publicly at odds, the White House decided that there would be no reason for Mr. Mattis to stay on during what two officials called his  lame duck  period.  NYT-- WAPO S PHIL RUCKER, DAN LAMOTHE and JOSH DAWSEY:  Trump decided hastily to remove Mattis in reaction to negative news coverage, according to senior administration officials, one of whom said the president was eager to retaliate against Mattis and show up the widely respected former general.  Another official said Trump and other advisers suspected Mattis of being part of a campaign to stoke negative coverage about the president. After canceling his Christmas trip to Florida in view of the government shutdown, Trump was marooned this weekend at the White House watching hours of cable television news shows. Advisers said he stewed over commentary hailing Mattis as heroic   a human guardrail against the president s impulses. Trump was so angry with Mattis that on Sunday morning he directed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to inform the defense secretary that he was being pulled from office two months early, according to a senior administration official.

Gordon Adams, a former Democratic White House budget official specializing in defense, called Shanahan  a perfectly competent manager.   It is not clear how his competence will mesh with a president who is not,  he added.  POLITICO-- WAPO S DAN LAMOTHE:  Shanahan, 56, will take the helm after a 30-year career at Boeing in which he became a senior vice president. Like Mattis, he is a Washington state native who has touted the national defense strategy the Pentagon adopted last year, which focuses heavily on preparing the military for a fight against a  near-peer competitor  like China or Russia. Unlike Mattis, he has no military experience, no previous government experience and little experience with foreign policy.

Democrats will still face a tough fight to impose greater oversight on the U.S. military deployments that have mushroomed during the past 17 years. But prospects will be much brighter for the lawmakers who have spent years pushing Congress to weigh in on the use of American forces in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia and most recently Yemen. If they succeed, the result could be legislation restricting President Donald Trump s ability to send combat troops to new countries, or at least setting a time limit for the executive branch to seek new authorization. That would at least guarantee more frequent public debate about where American troops are engaged and why.

POLITICOSPORTS BLINK ñ  Huawei Had a Deal to Give Washington Redskins  Fans Free Wi-Fi, Until the Government Stepped In,  by WSJ s Stu Woo and Andrew Beaton:  Two years after a congressional report labeled Huawei Technologies Co. a national-security threat, the Chinese firm unexpectedly scored a big-name ally in Washington. It was the Redskins, the capital s National Football League franchise. Huawei reached an agreement in 2014 to beam Wi-Fi through the suites at the team s FedEx Field, in exchange for advertising in the stadium and during broadcasts. It was a marketing coup for a company hankering to beef up its meager U.S. business and boost its image inside the Beltway. But the deal didn t last long. A government adviser read about the partnership. He knew the FedEx Field suites were a frequent haunt for lawmakers and senior officials across many agencies. So he triggered an unofficial federal complaint to the Redskins, who quietly tore up the deal.  WSJ

According to Der Spiegel, only one of the two orphans exists, and the aid money went to the reporter s private bank account. Mr. Relotius has not been available for comment since the scandal broke, but according to the newsmagazine s editors, last week he explained the fraud this way:  It wasn t about the next big thing. It was the fear of failure.  He also said,  The pressure not to fail grew as I became more successful.

                    By ASSOCIATED PRESS12/23/2018 05:49 PM ESTRALEIGH, N.C.   Affidavits released Sunday by North Carolina s elections board allege absentee ballots were collected from voters by the man at the center of vote fraud allegations or those working for him.These latest documents focus on last month s disputed 9th Congressional District race, the year s only unresolved congressional election. Investigators are looking into whether McCrae Dowless and others working on behalf of GOP candidate Mark Harris ran an illegal operation to collect large numbers of absentee ballots from voters in at least two counties.Story Continued BelowIn the batch of affidavits released Sunday, registered voter Christopher Eason of Bladenboro alleges he gave his signed but otherwise blank mail-in absentee ballot directly to Dowless, who had been hired by the chief strategist for Harris  campaign. It s illegal for anyone other than a close relative or guardian to take a person s ballot. I signed the absentee ballot envelope but left the ballot completely blank. I did not make any selections in any of the contests on the ballot,  Eason said in his affidavit signed Dec. 7, adding Dowless came to his home and asked for his absentee ballot.Another voter, Hazel Guyton of Bladenboro, said in an affidavit that she filled out her absentee ballot and Dowless and a woman stopped by to pick it up. She said he d been  doing that for me for several years,  though she states she suffers no legal disabilities.The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know.

His attorney, Cynthia Adams Singletary, did not answer Sunday calls but has asserted previously that Dowless hasn t broken any campaign laws.Also released Sunday was an analysis by a Harvard University professor who determined rates of unreturned absentee ballots in two 9th District counties were  extreme statistical outliers. Stephen Ansolabehere, a government professor at Harvard, said absentee mail voting patterns in Blade and Robeson Counties differed considerably from other North Carolina counties in two ways: The  exceedingly high rates  of unreturned ballots and the performance of the Republican candidate in those areas. Mark Harris greatly over-performed in these two counties when compared with what one might have expected based on patterns elsewhere,  he wrote in his analysis.The affidavits and the absentee ballot analysis for Robeson County and the portion of Bladen County in the 9th District were filed by attorneys for Democrat Dan McCready, who trailed Harris by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris, McCready and candidates in a few other local races affected by the absentee ballot probe had until Friday to submit evidence for the board to review in advance of its Jan. 11 hearing.

                    By CHRISTOPHER CADELAGONeither Harris nor his campaign provided any such evidence or affidavits before the deadline, elections board lawyer Josh Lawson said Sunday. The candidates have until Jan. 6 to submit legal briefs to the board, which could ultimately order a new election or certify the results. The certification delay means no one will be representing the south-central 9th District when the new session of Congress begins Jan. 3.Other affidavits from local residents provided by McCready s attorneys and released Sunday also alleged that Dowless had held hundreds of absentee ballots unlawfully or  trashed  them as a way to affect election outcomes.In a separate matter before state judges, elections board Chairman Joshua Malcolm said in an affidavit Friday that the board s investigative staff members have conducted 100 interviews related to the election irregularities and are reviewing more than 182,000 documents produced from 12 subpoenas.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                        The president spent the weekend digging in on his position, and aides say he accepts a closure that could drag into the new year.
                    By CHRISTOPHER CADELAGO12/23/2018 03:37 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump is now the  proud  owner of a government shutdown   his third. And he doesn t seem to mind.The threat of an extended shutdown is far less of a concern to the president than not making good on his central campaign pledge to build a border wall and looking like a fraud, according to White House aides and Trump allies. Trump spent the weekend digging in on his position behind closed doors, meeting with hard-line conservatives and signaling through his top aides that he could stomach a closure that could drag on well into the new year.Story Continued BelowMick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, set the bar on Sunday. I don t think things are going to move very quickly here for the next couple of days,  he told Chris Wallace in an interview on Fox News.The holiday shutdown comes amid a series of tumultuous Cabinet shakeups   Trump announced on Sunday that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis would depart earlier than expected   a stock market rout and turbulence from the Republican congressional ranks over the president s decision to pull troops from Syria and scale back the U.S. presence in Afghanistan.
                    Government Shutdown
                    By JOHN BRESNAHAN and JAKE SHERMANAmid all the disarray, Trump is resuming a partisan mantle he views as a unifier for the right: border warrior.Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the House Freedom Caucus chairman, compared Trump s stand to the Battle of the Alamo, offering that the historic struggle between Texans and victorious Mexicans is remembered  not because they won there, [but] because they fought there. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who lunched with Trump and Meadows on Saturday at the White House, argued that Democrats and their leaders were the reason the country was in for a protracted confrontation. Sen. Schumer, we re not going to abandon the wall,  Graham said later Saturday, referring to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).  We re going to build a wall, and to all those Americans who want us to abandon the wall and open up the border, that s what this fight s about. The president s aides, in private, have half-heartedly tried to pin the blame on Democrats   despite their boss  saying earlier this month in the Oval Office that he would be proud to shut down the government for border security, suggesting that the American people were with him on the issue.Trump, who cast the southern border wall in political terms as a  total winner,  even as polls show that majorities of Americans don t support the structure, is marching out senior administration officials to assert that he s been  very clear  about his expectations for funding various  physical barriers.   We are open to a lot of different options along those lines,  one of the officials said.

                    By SARAH FERRIS, QUINT FORGEY and HEATHER CAYGLEMulvaney said on Sunday that the president s wall demands were  absolutely necessary. Republicans are not uniformly falling in line. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee blasted Trump for failing to avoid the partial shutdown, dismissing his hardening negotiating posture on immigration as  a made-up fight so that the president could look like he s fighting. Trump did not arrive voluntarily at his latest choice to pursue the wall at all costs. Last week, he came under withering attacks from conservatives   notably commentators and hosts who appear on Fox News   who urged the president to veto a Senate-approved bill without wall funding that would have averted the shutdown.Republicans close to the president said he was shocked by the swift reaction, particularly given everything he d done up to that point, and that he had come to see this hinge moment as his best, and possibly last, chance to extract significant wall funding.As the shutdown became a reality, some advisers have urged Trump to focus entirely on the border and Democrats  intransigence, despite their backing similar security funding before he became president. One ally said the goal was to center the clash on who is with Trump and who is against him. As Graham put it,  This is about them hating Trump so much, wanting him to lose, they can t understand that America needs to win. 
                    White House
                    By BRENT D. GRIFFITHSTrump s reelection campaign has leapt quickly at the chance to capitalize on the stalemate and paint him as an authentic promise-keeper. One Trump campaign appeal to supporters tarred Democrats as insensitive to the safety of Americans.  FIGHT BACK,  it implored.  Donate to become an Official Build the Wall Member.  And other Trump-backed groups are running ads and circulating petitions to Republicans.For the president, the border wall is about far more than a structure, allies concede. The White House has long seen his  Build the wall  promise as an indicator for how far his early pledges alone could take him with voters he ll need to secure reelection. The wall is important, but it s more the underlying anti-immigrant message that s the key,  a former White House official said.In addition to saying Mexico would pay for the wall   a goal the administration maintains is still viable, albeit most likely retroactively   others of Trump s big early claims remain unfulfilled and look increasingly doubtful.During his 2016 campaign, Trump estimated he would complete the entire border wall within two years from the time he started.  We ll start quickly,  he added.  And it ll be a real wall. While the wall has yet to come to fruition, the president has been filling the void with more words.Trump repeatedly boasts about how much of the wall has already been built, even though little if any building has happened, let alone during his presidency. To keep up appearances during the midterm elections, aides handed out signs that read  Finish the Wall. Well before the recent conservative backlash reared, one threat the president s team identified on the subject was supporters beginning to doubt his ability to deliver.Though Trump could continue to point a finger at Congress, which has given him only a fraction of what he wants for border security, another person close to the president noted that the government-funding exercise was one area where he had the ultimate say.For now, it s a function of leverage, which the ally acknowledged Democrats have.Missing out on the latest scoops?

Or the  Please just give us something  shutdown.The partial government closure that began at midnight Friday is in its second day, and there are no signs the impasse will end soon. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney warned on Sunday the shutdown could drag on into January, when Democrat Nancy Pelosi is expected to take over as speaker of the House.Story Continued BelowPresident Donald Trump has quietly come down from his original $5 billion demand for a border wall to just $2 billion, according to Republican lawmakers and aides.Trump has also backed off his demand that Congress approve an actual border wall, instead suggesting a steel picket fence of sorts, the design of which Trump tweeted to widespread disdain.  Yeah, I don t think he settles for less than $2 billion for the wall,  said a source who attended a Saturday meeting with Trump in the Oval Office.A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

No money for a border wall or steel slats or anything remotely resembling the kind of  beautiful  barrier that Trump wants to build. Democrats are OK with a  fence  or more money for  border security,  but any obstacle that Trump can call a wall is unacceptable. Well, what Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi have both told the president is, we are not going to build a wall, period,  Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said on NBC s  Meet the Press. All of which means that a government that spends $3.8 trillion annually is being disrupted over 0.005 percent of its annual budget.In fact, the 2018 Christmas shutdown is starting to look a lot like 2013   when government funding lapsed for 16 days   or 1995-96, when a partisan showdown between Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich lasted 21 days. That s especially bad news for the 800,000 federal employees who won t get paid until the shutdown ends, half of whom may also be furloughed.It s not even clear who is going to do the negotiating to end the shutdown. No one wants to deal with Trump, who has very little credibility with party leaders on either side of the aisle. And no one is going to sign off on a deal unless Trump publicly declares for his support for any agreement first. Everyone has to hold hands on this,  said an aide to one top Democrat.  We re not doing anything until the president says he will sign it. 
                    Government Shutdown
                    By SARAH FERRIS, QUINT FORGEY and HEATHER CAYGLEAn exasperated Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) says Trump needs to negotiate directly with Democrats. Instead, Trump met on Saturday with hard-line Republicans   the  Lou Dobbs Caucus,  as a GOP lawmaker dubbed them   who urged him not to back off at all. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) privately told a House Democrat that McConnell should be the one negotiating with Trump. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Pelosi have all headed back home for Christmas, and they re not negotiating at all. Those who have spoken to Trump say he s privately aware that his leverage vastly decreases in 2019, meaning he needs to have the border wall fight now.Yet Democrats seem stronger with every passing day. While Republicans aren t going to get the $5 billion Trump wanted, conservatives are unwilling to accept the $1.6 billion for border security that Democrats offered. Trump himself rejected $1.3 billion that was on the brink of passage last week.  Here s the problem, of course, is that as recently as two weeks ago, they had offered us $1.6 billion for that same thing, so they re moving in the wrong direction,  Mulvaney said on  Fox News Sunday. Trump is coming off a rough stretch of his presidency. House Democrats routed Republicans on Election Day, and subpoenas are expected to start flying early next year. Trump s obsession with special counsel Robert Mueller grows daily. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned over Trump s decision to pull all U.S. troops out of Syria, and he rebuked the president in an open letter rejecting  Trumpism  as a national security doctrine. Trump retaliated on Sunday by announcing he s forcing Mattis out by Jan. 1.

And now the Christmas shutdown   the third shutdown of Trump s tenure as president   which threatens to drag on for weeks.The New York Times reported on Saturday that Trump  spends ever more time in front of a television, often retreating to his residence out of concern that he is being watched too closely.  The Nixonian overtones of that image aren t lost on Democrats. He s not behaving like he s fit for office. He s behaving extremely erratically,  said former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro on  Meet the Press.  Castro is considering a run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. I can tell you every day I question whether or not we can endure another two years,  Durbin added.  I think we can; I think this Constitution is strong. The American people are strong. But I m hoping that my Republican colleagues will step up and join us in a bipartisan effort to put this government back on track. For her part, Pelosi is already promising to act quickly when she takes over as speaker on Jan. 3. Until President Trump can publicly commit to a bipartisan resolution, there will be no agreement before January when the new House Democratic Majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government,  Pelosi said Saturday in a letter to her colleagues.Burgess Everett contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

I think there s an implication here for Nancy Pelosi s election for the speakership  ...  I think she s now in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she s speaker,  he continued.

POLITICOPELOSI SPOKESMAN DREW HAMMILL RESPONDS: As Mr. Mulvaney well knows, House Democrats are united in their opposition to the President s immoral, expensive and ineffective wall.

Is he willing to accept anything that does not include money specifically to build a new border wall, even if the Democrats, as they have said, are willing to get money for more border security? MULVANEY:  Sure, and [I m] not going to tell you what our bottom line is in the negotiation but it s a fair question as to what we would accept. No, the president s not going to not accept money for a border wall. Now, what one people call a wall and another person might call a fence.    As to what the number is, all I can tell is that the Democrats offered us ñ I think they offered us $1.6 billion a couple weeks ago, then they offered the president $1.3 billion this week. That s a negotiation that seems like it s going in the wrong direction. We ve insisted on 5 for the discussions, now we re between $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion. The 2020 Election. The New Congress.

After a meeting yesterday between SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER (D-N.Y.) and VP MIKE PENCE, Schumer s spokesman said this:  The Vice President came in for a discussion and made an offer. Unfortunately, we re still very far apart. THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE of the state of the negotiations: Ohio Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) -- the longest-serving woman in the House -- came to the Senate side to snap photos, and visit Schumer. She told us the New York Democrat told her that the negotiations were between Republicans like SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY.) and the president. But McConnell went to the floor yesterday saying that negotiations were between Schumer and the president. THE CAPITOL was mostly quiet yesterday.

Bob Corker said Sunday the president could easily have avoided the current fight over funding for a border wall if he wanted to. [T]he Tennessee Republican called the battle, which has led to a partial shutdown of the government,  a made-up fight so that the president could look like he s fighting.  Lamenting the  purposely contrived fight,  Corker said borders would still be  insecure  no matter who was to win the shutdown fight.  It s not just about the money, it s what we are spending it on,  Corker said, saying a wall might not be the most effective solution anyway. He cited security technology the U.S. military has used overseas.  POLITICO-- MARGARET BRENNAN interviewed SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY.) on CBS   FACE THE NATION : BRENNAN:  You ve been warning a lot about fiscal responsibility and this staggering twenty two trillion dollar debt. So with that in mind do you intend to vote for any kind of spending bill that includes billions of dollars from U.S. taxpayers without any offset? PAUL:  No. In fact, I ve never voted for any of these large spending bills that puts all of this spending together because we have a trillion dollar deficit this year --  BRENNAN:  So the border wall is -- is --  PAUL:  And Republicans as you recall we promised we were going to spend less money.  BRENNAN:  The border wall is is not something you would vote for?  PAUL:  We promised to spend less money and so I won t vote for it. -- CHUCK TODD spoke with SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R-PA.) and SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-ILL.) on NBC S  MEET THE PRESS  about Defense Secretary Jim Mattis leaving: TOOMEY:  I think General Mattis has put his finger on where the president has views that are very, very distinct from the vast majority of Republicans and probably Democrats, elected and unelected.   I strongly disagree with this decision to withdraw, prematurely in my view, from Syria. -- DURBIN:  I was one of many senators who privately sat down with General Mattis and said please stay. Stay as long as you possibly can. We desperately need your mature voice, your patriotism in the room when this president s making life or death decisions about national security. But it obviously reached a breaking point.   It breaks my heart that he s going to step aside. We counted on him to be there and to stop this president from his worst impulse.

Often he erupts.  Freaking idiots!  he calls his aides. Except he uses a more pungent word than  freaking.   For two years, Mr. Trump has waged war against his own government, convinced that people around him are fools. Angry that they resist his wishes, uninterested in the details of their briefings, he becomes especially agitated when they tell him he does not have the power to do what he wants, which makes him suspicious that they are secretly undermining him. ... The swirl of recent days   a government shutdown, spiraling scandals, tumbling stock markets, abrupt troop withdrawals and the resignation of his alienated defense secretary   has left the impression of a presidency at risk of spinning out of control.  At the midpoint of his term, Mr. Trump has grown more sure of his own judgment and more cut off from anyone else s than at any point since taking office. He spends ever more time in front of a television, often retreating to his residence out of concern that he is being watched too closely.  NYT-- WAPO S PHIL RUCKER:   A rogue presidency : The era of containing Trump is over :  For two years, they tried to tutor and confine him. They taught him history, explained nuances and gamed out reverberations. They urged careful deliberation, counseled restraint and prepared talking points to try to sell mainstream actions to a restive conservative base hungry for disruption. But in the end, they failed. For President Trump, the era of containment is over. ... Trump will enter his third year as president unbound   at war with his perceived enemies, determined to follow through on the hard-line promises of his insurgent campaign and fearful of any cleavage in his political coalition. So far, the result has been disarray. ... Republican lawmakers once afraid of crossing this president are now openly critical. ...  Trump is surrounding himself with  yes  men and women   at least relative to Mattis and other former military generals who tried to keep him at bay   who see their jobs as executing his vision, even when they disagree. He has designated some officials, including the new White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, as  acting,  meaning they must labor to please the president to eventually be empowered in their positions permanently.

The resignation takes effect Dec. 31. ...   The recent decision by the president came as a shock and was a complete reversal of policy that had been articulated to us by [National Security Adviser John] Bolton and others,  McGurk wrote [in a departure email to his team].  It left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered with no plan in place or even considered thought as to consequences.    McGurk is planning to go to Stanford University, starting in March. He will teach a course and write.

NANCY COOK,   Bushies  creep into Trump s administration: Trump is suspicious of people who have worked for the Bush family, but has little choice but to keep hiring them   to the anger of some hard-core supporters :  Earlier this month Trump picked Bill Barr, a former Attorney General under President George H.W. Bush as his replacement for Jeff Sessions. Two of his recent hires for the White House counsel s office, Mike Purpura and Pat Philpin, served under President George W. Bush. They will report to the new White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, who served in the elder Bush s Justice Department. Meanwhile, the newly confirmed deputy secretary of the Treasury Department, Justin Muzinich, worked on Jeb Bush s presidential campaign and helped to draft his tax plan.

Pat Toomey said Sunday on NBC that James Mattis  resignation letter  put his finger on  those differences. I think General Mattis has put his finger on where the president has views that are very, very distinct from the vast majority of Republicans and probably Democrats, elected and unelected,  Toomey (R-Pa.) said of Mattis  letter resigning from his position in Trump s Cabinet.Story Continued Below I strongly disagree with this decision to withdraw, prematurely in my view, from Syria. In resigning Thursday from his position as Defense secretary, Mattis stated,  One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. Speaking Sunday on  Meet the Press,  Toomey noted that Trump doesn t have the same views on America s postwar  Pax Americana  foreign policy, built on an internationalist viewpoint.

It s been great for all of us, and it has taken the commitment of leadership,  the Pennsylvania Republican said.Toomey said the solution is for the Senate to push back on presidential authority. I think senators need to step up and reassert a bigger role for the Senate  in foreign policy, Toomey said, adding that he would be looking for Trump to nominate a new Defense secretary who has  a more traditional view  of U.S. foreign policy. Toomey said he customarily gives the president wide latitude in picking his Cabinet but would be more cautious in this case. The president s views are so divergent, certainly, from mine that I think I ll be much   this one s going to be tough,  he said. Addressing the issue of the partial government shutdown that began early Saturday, Toomey called it  a big distraction  from the fact that the Congress had been able to restore order this year to an unwieldy appropriations process. He noted that the shutdown would have been broader if not for that.Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning   in your inbox.

We have a plan, a bipartisan plan, that s on the table. We have the 2013 plan that passed by a supermajority in the Senate that would address the vast bulk of these issues. So, we re ready for a broader discussion. The president hasn t been there,  he said.Merkley says his visits to the U.S.-Mexico border have convinced him that the president does not grasp the situation fully. When you talk with the border guards,  he said,  they fill you in on what s really happening and say the president s vision and understanding of the law, he just doesn t get it.

A border wall is absolutely necessary, which is why we re having the battle,  Mulvaney told journalist Chris Wallace during an interview on  Fox News Sunday,  referring to the government shutdown that went into effect at midnight Friday amid partisan debate over funding for Trump s wall.Story Continued Below A border wall is necessary   we ve known this since Reagan,  Mulvaney said, adding that the barrier would need to be part of a more comprehensive immigration solution.In an August 2015 interview with a South Carolina radio station uncovered last week by CNN, Mulvaney said then-candidate Trump s immigration platform posed  a bunch  of problems.

                    Updated 12/23/2018 03:44 PM ESTThe partial government shutdown that began Friday could stretch for more than two weeks, with negotiations at a stalemate and congressional leaders leaving town to spend Christmas with family.Mick Mulvaney, the White House s acting chief of staff, predicted on Sunday that it was  very possible  the funding lapse would drag on through New Year s and into the next Congress, when Democrats retake control of the House of Representatives.Story Continued Below I think it s a really good question here as to whether or not this deal can be cut before the new Congress comes in,  Mulvaney said in an interview on  Fox News Sunday.   I don t think things are going to move very quickly here for the next couple of days. Mulvaney, backed by several other Trump allies, has blamed Democrats for rejecting the administration s attempts to reach a deal over the weekend. But the White House has only escalated its demands for funding the president s border wall since the shutdown started at midnight on Friday, forcing roughly 420,000 federal employees to work without pay over the holidays.Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday presented a funding deal that would include $2.5 billion for border security, including new fencing and $400 million for other immigration priorities, according to two Democratic aides.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) rejected that offer, and a Schumer spokesman said Sunday the two remained  very far apart.  The details were first reported by The Washington Post. If Director Mulvaney says the Trump Shutdown will last into the New Year, believe him   because it s their shutdown,  the spokesman, Justin Goodman, said on Sunday.
                    Congress
                    By BURGESS EVERETT and JOHN BRESNAHANDemocrats in both chambers have already agreed to $1.3 billion for border fencing, the same amount that s already been signed into law.Democrats say they ve had  real discussions  with Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who initially struck the deal for $1.6 billion back in June, according to a person familiar with negotiations. That progress has been dismissed by the White House, the person said, because officials are  being guided  by the House Freedom Caucus.Trump, meanwhile, is only hardening his approach to border wall funding. He indicated to conservative lawmakers at a Saturday lunch meeting that he wouldn t agree to less than $2 billion, according to an attendee.Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who chairs the House Freedom Caucus and also attended the meeting, said Sunday that talks were now focused on securing between $1.6 billion and $5 billion for the wall. There are a number of conservatives who believe that $5 billion was already a concession,  Meadows told Fox s  Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo. Democrats, who argue that border officials have yet to spend that entire amount from last fiscal year, feel they have no reason to cave.As of Sunday afternoon, no further talks had been scheduled ahead of Christmas. A flurry of negotiations with Mulvaney, Pence and Schumer made no progress on Friday and Saturday.
                    Government Shutdown
                    By CAITLIN EMMA and JENNIFER SCHOLTESEven senior lawmakers and aides have become resigned to a standoff that lasts through early January. Congressional leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Schumer, have flown back to their states and districts for Christmas.The House and Senate both adjourned Saturday with no plan for reopening the government. The Senate won t return until Thursday, two days after Christmas. Appropriations staffers in both chambers remain on call through Thursday, in case of a deal. Chances are slim, however, and even Shelby acknowledged to reporters on Saturday that he saw almost no possibility of coming together before then.The White House has insisted that a shutdown in late December will cause little heartburn for federal workers, arguing that the next round of paychecks won t go out until Jan. 11. Mulvaney himself said Sunday that  nobody is working without getting paid. But the pressure will begin to build quickly in January for the White House and Congress to strike a deal, with nine federal departments and dozens of agencies shuttered.A total of 380,000 workers have been furloughed, including nearly all of NASA, the National Park Service and federal housing agencies. The effects will be felt across the country: Local and state farm service centers are closed, federal home loan applications are delayed, and law enforcement training is postponed.The shutdown also means a temporary lapse in authorization for the Violence Against Women Act, the landmark law that protects victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault.Funding for some of the act s programs could be affected in the case of a prolonged shutdown: The Department of Justice, which oversees 25 of the law s grant programs, is among the departments shuttered.Pelosi has said that House Democrats will act quickly to reopen the government in January, passing short-term funding bills and daring Senate Republicans to prolong the pain of a shutdown.Mulvaney has repeatedly blamed House Democrats for the stalemate. He argued that Pelosi was hesitant to strike a deal on Trump s border wall, fearing backlash from more liberal lawmakers in her bid to become speaker of the chamber.
                    government shutdown
                    By DAVID COHEN I think she s now in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she s speaker,  Mulvaney said on Sunday.  If that s the case, again, I think there s a chance we go into the next Congress. It s a common talking point for Republicans, who maintain that Pelosi has to walk a tightrope to win the speaker s election on Jan. 3.But even progressive House Democrats had agreed to support $1.3 billion   and possibly even $1.6 billion, depending on the conditions   before the standoff started. It really depends on what s in there and how it s crafted,  Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said last week when asked about the $1.6 billion for a border fence. Pelosi advocates have roundly rejected Republican criticism, arguing that House Democrats have been united in opposing Trump s wall. The sooner the White House recognizes the need to stop the posturing and start serious bipartisan talks, the sooner we can end the Trump Shutdown,  Drew Hammill, deputy chief of staff to Pelosi, said in a statement.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/23/2018 11:44 AM ESTWarning of the dangers of an  explosive, expansive war,  Sen. Rand Paul said Sunday he is  very proud of the president  for withdrawing American troops. The American people are tired of war,  the Kentucky Republican said in response to questions about President Donald Trump s announcement last week that U.S. troops will be pulled out of Syria.Story Continued BelowAppearing on CNN s  State of the Union,  Paul cited  roads, bridges, schools  as things in America on which money now being spent on combat in Syria ( an absolute mess ) and elsewhere could be better spent. He also was sharply critical of military leaders, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who he said wanted to continue fighting  forever  wars without a strategy to end them or win them. Mattis resigned not long after Trump s Syria announcement. I think the burden should be on Gen. Mattis and those who want to stay forever in every war theater around the world, the burden is on them to say, if there s no military solution, why are we still sending more military,  Paul said to host Jake Tapper.

                    By DANIEL LIPPMAN, WESLEY MORGAN, NAHAL TOOSI and QUINT FORGEYPaul said a complicated diplomatic solution will still be needed to resolve the situation in Syria, involving Russia and Turkey, among others. We ve made it toxic for anyone to talk to Russia,  Paul said, adding:  If we don t talk to Russia, we re never going to find a peaceful solution to the Syria mess. Discussing the government shutdown, Paul said he doesn t want to add more to the deficit in order to fund a border wall, but he thinks funding for Trump s border wall could be found in money now being used overseas. Right now we re spending $50 billion a year in Afghanistan. We could easily find $5 billion for a wall if we weren t so busy building and rebuilding Afghanistan,  he said.Speaking later on the same CNN show, former Sen. Rick Santorum said Rand Paul s views were atypical of the Republican Party. It s going to be a problem for him if he doesn t walk this back,  Santorum said of Trump s Syrian withdrawal.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/23/2018 03:44 PM ESTCalling the whole battle  juvenile,  Sen. Bob Corker said Sunday the president could easily have avoided the current fight over funding for a border wall if he wanted to. Speaking on CNN s  State of the Union,  the Tennessee Republican called the battle, which has led to a partial shutdown of the government,  a made-up fight so that the president could look like he s fighting. Story Continued BelowLamenting the  purposely contrived fight,  Corker said  our borders are going to be insecure  no matter who ultimately wins the shutdown fight. It s not just about the money, it s what we are spending it on,  Corker said, saying a wall might not be the most effective solution anyway. He cited security technology the U.S. military has used overseas.The senator said President Donald Trump could have gotten funding for a border wall if he had been willing months ago to accept a deal meant to resolve the status of Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who came to the country as young children and whose status has been up in the air.

I m saddened for the broken relationships with countries that have been with us  the retiring senator said, lamenting the United States being  unreliable.  I am devastated by this,  he said, adding later,  Some devastating decisions are being made. Corker says lawmakers will need to step in. I think it s going to be very important for our country that the United States Senate really dig in and make sure we don t make other colossal mistakes as it relates to foreign policy. Later Sunday, Trump blasted Corker on Twitter. Bob Corker was responsible for giving us the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal, which I ended, yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home,  he tweeted.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/22/2018 08:21 PM ESTThe Trump administration is moving before markets reopen to reassure investors and Congress that President Donald Trump won t fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell despite the president s distaste for Powell s interest rate increases. After a pair of senior Senate Republicans publicly urged the president not to fire Powell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin released an unusual statement on Saturday saying that he d spoken to the president and that Trump has never indicated he will fire Powell. Still, in the same breath the president criticized the Fed chairman.Story Continued Below I totally disagree with Fed policy. I think the increasing of interest rates and the shrinking of the Fed portfolio is an absolute terrible thing to do at this time especially in light of my major trade negotiations which are ongoing, but I never suggested firing Chairman Jay Powell, nor do I believe I have the right to do so,  Trump said via Mnuchin s Twitter account. His tweet follows reports that Trump had discussed with advisers the prospect of dismissing Powell.The message delivered by Mnuchin appears aimed at ensuring that markets don t panic when they reopen on Monday over the prospect of a legal fight over the leadership of the central bank. Implicit in all stock prices and bond prices is a confidence about what the world will look like in the future,  said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.  If this trust disappears overnight, it can have significant implications, not only pushing stock prices lower,  but also sparking new questions about whether inflation will be kept under control.Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street   weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), a former Banking Committee chairman who currently chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Trump needs to be  very careful  how he proceeds with Powell. Powell   a Trump appointee   was confirmed in January by the Senate, 84-13. The Federal Reserve is set up to be independent of the presidency. Although I disagree with Powell at times, I ve been on the Banking Committee longer than most people ever have, and I chaired it. I think the Federal Reserve should remain independent, as much as it can,  Shelby said.Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who is in line to eventually chair the Banking panel, said,  Powell has done nothing to warrant being dismissed.  After a long and dangerous experiment in monetary policy, conducted by others, Chairman Powell has gone a long way to restoring normalcy,  Toomey said, referring to the Fed s decision to keep interest rates at historic lows for nearly a decade.  We should be grateful for that. I have no reason to believe that the president is planning to fire Chairman Powell. He certainly should not do so,  Toomey said.A senior administration official said Trump has privately raged about Powell s decisions on interest rates much as he has complained publicly. Fed policymakers on Wednesday raised rates for the fourth time this year after the president warned them not to do so. But senior officials are strongly cautioning Trump against any attempt to remove Powell both because his legal authority to do so is highly questionable and because markets would likely react very negatively.  It would be an outrageous thing to do and markets would treat it that way,  said one person close to the White House who declined to be identified by name in order to speak freely. 
                    Finance & Tax 
                    By VICTORIA GUIDAFinancial markets have cratered in recent days amid a partial government shutdown, rising interest rates and signs of a slowing economy. Shelby said Trump did not bring up the prospect of firing Powell at a lunch with congressional Republicans on Saturday. Wall Street traders and money managers argue that the president would inject chaos and uncertainty into already fragile markets if he fired the Fed chair because he doesn t like his interest rate decisions, Market agents may disagree on the policy but they respect the person,  David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, said of Powell.  The nation is best served if the president avoids the personalized attacks. Markets want an independent and skilled Fed chair, not a Trump patsy.  It s unclear what specifically Trump can do to Powell. The president can remove a member of the Fed board only  for cause,  which does not include policy disagreements.It s more murky whether Powell could be replaced as chairman. Trump could attempt to nominate a different person for chair but would need the Senate s cooperation. If the president did try to remove Powell without a Senate-confirmed replacement, Vice Chairman Richard Clarida ñ a Powell ally ñ would become acting chairman.Trump s displeasure with the Fed is particularly striking, given that four of the five current members of its board were appointed by him. All of them voted to raise rates in December over the president s protests.The central bank has been gradually raising rates to keep prices from rising too rapidly and to wean the economy off cheap debt that could eventually start to threaten the stability of the financial system.While Fed officials estimate that two more rate hikes could be in store next year, they have also emphasized that more increases aren t guaranteed, given the prospects for slower economic growth.If the Fed raises rates too high, it could lead to a recession. A stone-faced Powell told reporters on Wednesday that  political considerations  do not play into the central bank s decision-making. We re always going to be focused on the mission that Congress has given us,  he said.  We have the independence, which we think is essential to be able to do our jobs in a non-political way.   Nothing will deter us from doing what we think is the right thing to do. Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning   in your inbox.

                    By BRENT D. GRIFFITHS12/22/2018 12:41 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump hinted Saturday that the third government shutdown of 2018 could be longer than anticipated as he and congressional leaders continue to try to find an agreement on funding one-fourth of the federal government while also paying for some of Trump s long-proposed border wall. We are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed Border Security (Gangs, Drugs, Human Trafficking & more) but it could be a long stay,  the president wrote on Twitter.Story Continued BelowThe Senate adjourned Saturday afternoon with no solution to the partial government shutdown and no plans to reconvene until Dec. 27, indicating Washington is settling into a lengthy government shutdown.Trump s comments that it could be a  long stay  contrasted with a video he posted on Twitter on Friday night, where he said,  Hopefully the shutdown will not last long.  Congressional leaders and the president appeared to have a deal to keep roughly 25 percent of the federal government open earlier this week, but Trump reneged on the apparent agreement in search of more money for his border wall, a key campaign promise. House Republicans, at his urging, later passed a funding bill with $5 billion towards the wall, but fellow Republicans, like Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), view the proposal as a non-starter given that it would need 60 votes to pass in the Senate and that would require the support of at least nine Democrats.

                    Updated 12/22/2018 03:27 PM ESTBipartisan talks to resolve the government shutdown made little progress on Saturday as President Donald Trump appeared more dug in than ever on border wall funding, leading Senate Republicans to adjourn with the government closed through Christmas. Both sides are refusing to compromise, with Trump and his allies continuing to demand at least $5 billion for a border wall and Democratic leaders refusing to agree to any money for new barrier construction. Story Continued BelowVice President Mike Pence met with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) Saturday afternoon, but both left without an agreement.  We re talking,  Pence said as he exited Schumer s office. A Schumer spokesman added: Pence  made an offer. Unfortunately, we re still very far apart. But while Pence and Schumer were meeting, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was shutting down the chamber for the holidays, saying the Senate would not reconvene until Thursday, Dec. 27, suggesting that Washington faced a lengthy impasse over Trump s border wall. Members have been sent home for the holidays, and lawmakers and aides said they did not expect any agreement until sometime next week at the earliest. McConnell held out hope for a deal, however:  Anything can happen,  McConnell told reporters as he exited the chamber. Trump canceled his plans to travel to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, Saturday afternoon, citing the shutdown. Due to the shutdown, President Trump will remain in Washington, D.C. and the first lady will return from Florida so they can spend Christmas together,  said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Trump had already delayed his departure for Florida and spent the day huddling with hard-line conservatives at the White House. Over a lunch of short ribs and mashed potatoes, Trump and his allies discussed how best to message the shutdown in what Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) described as a  war room strategy discussion.   We re in a better position now because the president has been tough, and I think he s going to stay tough,  Gaetz said in an interview after the meeting.  I think the president is ready to proceed into January with a shutdown if border security is not a priority. Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) had a slightly different take. Shelby said the president was  exuberant  and indicated that while Trump wants to end the shutdown, he received  mixed messages  from the lunch group on whether to compromise, but he later stated that no deal was imminent.  I don t know if we re far apart, but we re not together,  Shelby said after meeting with Pence and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney at the Capitol.A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.While the Big Four   McConnell, Schumer, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)   have to sign off on any agreement, the package first must be publicly blessed by Trump, who has waffled several times in the negotiations over the past two weeks.Trump is being pulled in opposite directions by House conservatives like Gaetz and establishment Republicans like Shelby, essentially telling both camps what they want to hear. A third attendee at the lunch said Trump won t settle for less than $2 billion in border money. House Freedom Caucus leaders Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), along with Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), also attended the lunch. McConnell and Schumer each took to the Senate floor earlier in the day to jab at each other over the impasse before exiting the Capitol by 3:30 p.m. Ryan and Pelosi were also on site for part of the day but remained holed up in their separate Capitol suites.The Capitol was mostly quiet otherwise, with a handful of members seen roaming around looking for answers themselves or making preparations to fly home for Christmas. I think we ll be back after Christmas,  said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), a senior House appropriator. Simpson said he was preparing to fly to Idaho on Sunday morning. Everybody is sitting here going,  Well, we ve kinda got a four-day break   the weekend, Christmas Eve and Christmas. But we need to end it right after that. This is bad optics,  he added.Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), who talked with reporters mulling about around the Senate chamber, said she was looking for answers herself to when the shutdown would end. Kaptur had just left Ryan s office, where she got a picture with the outgoing speaker. Ryan told her he too was  waiting  for news, Kaptur said.Kaptur then went into Schumer s office unannounced to try and get more details about the current status of talks. After meeting with Schumer, Kaptur told reporters the Democratic leader said it s up to McConnell and other Republicans to work it out with Trump.Just before her comments, McConnell said  productive talks  continued among Trump, Schumer and Pelosi, and he seemed deferential to the Democrats and the president after Trump threatened to veto a Senate-passed clean funding bill.Meanwhile, the outgoing House majority is intent on not disappointing the president. Ousted House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions (R-Texas) told reporters on Saturday that the president simply should not accept less than $5 billion for the wall and take his message to the American people to build political support for his position. I honestly believe that we can and must get the wall,  said Sessions as he wheeled his luggage through an empty Capitol. 
                    Government Shutdown
                    By ANDREW RESTUCCIA and ELIANA JOHNSONOn Friday, Pence, Mulvaney and Jared Kushner, Trump s son-in-law and adviser, offered Schumer a package that would include roughly $1.6 billion in funding for a border barrier, but no money for new construction. Schumer has not agreed and has instead stuck to his guns on flat funding for the Department of Homeland Security at $1.3 billion for fencing. Republicans have also talked about adding hundreds of millions of dollars more for border security, though Democrats have resisted that as well.What exactly to call border security funding remains a point of contention. I talked to four Democrats [Friday] that said:  Look, if you just stop calling it the wall, we re in,   said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.).
                    Congress
                    By BURGESS EVERETT and JOHN BRESNAHANOn the House side, leaders gave members the green light to fly home for the holidays, doubtful that any deal would come together before late next week. Most senators have also gone home and will be given notice to come back if there s a roll call vote. But that might not be necessary: Many in the Senate believe they could voice vote any deal if the president signs off and avoid dragging back all 100 senators from across the country for a roll call vote.Both sides are eager to make it appear the other has caved, so any deal would have to be both spun to conservatives as a win for the president and to liberals as a cave by the White House.The Washington exodus comes despite the fact that 800,000 federal employees, including border patrol and TSA agents, are set to be furloughed or forced to work without pay over the holidays. While three-quarters of the government is already funded, nine federal departments and several major agencies, including NASA, the Food and Drug Administration and the IRS, are affected.The first furloughed paycheck for federal workers isn t set to be processed until Jan. 11, said a senior Republican source. That, in part, has relieved the pressure lawmakers feel to move quickly.Few senior Republicans believe Trump can actually win significant amounts of wall money through this shutdown, though conservatives disagree. Rather, Democrats are likely to play hardball, let the shutdown Trump demanded drag out for days or weeks, then pass legislation to reopen the government   without Trump s border wall   as one of their first moves upon taking the House on Jan. 3.Eliana Johnson contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/22/2018 11:42 AM ESTPresident Donald Trump will stay in Washington amid the government shutdown, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Saturday.  Due to the shutdown, President Trump will remain in Washington, D.C. and the First Lady will return from Florida so they can spend Christmas together,  Sanders said, according to a pool report. Story Continued BelowThe Senate adjourned Saturday afternoon with no solution to the partial government shutdown and no plans to reconvene until Dec. 27.The White House had twice canceled Trump s planned departure to his Mar-a-Lago resort, two White House aides confirmed, as Washington plunged into a partial government shutdown and officials continued negotiating to reach a compromise. The White House had signaled in an email to staff obtained by POLITICO on Friday that the president might depart at noon on Saturday   a day later than originally intended   but officials scuttled that plan when it became clear a quick solution to reopen the government was not in sights. Trump s wife, Melania Trump, and his son, Barron Trump, had taken off on their own for the Winter White House on Friday. They will now return to the White House. On Saturday afternoon, Trump tweeted,  I am in the White House, working hard.  He added,  We are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed Border Security (Gangs, Drugs, Human Trafficking & more) but it could be a long stay. The president later tweeted:  I will not be going to Florida because of the Shutdown - Staying in the White House! #MAGA Trump s decision to stay in D.C. for the time being is a recognition of the poor optics of having the president at his luxury resort while the government is closed   furloughing hundreds of thousands of workers and halting some federal services near the holidays.The president was originally scheduled to leave the White House on Friday afternoon for a two-week-plus trip to Mar-a-Lago. But those plans were scuttled amid the shutdown threat. Please note that we will no longer travel to Palm Beach, FL today.

Democrats, whose ability to filibuster in the Senate amounts to veto power, call that a non-starter. Congressional leaders had been discussing a solution that would fund border security at $1.6 billion, slightly higher than current levels but far short of what Trump is requesting. If Trump ultimately backs such a compromise, it would mark a stark reversal for the president, who had initially signaled his willingness to support a stopgap measure only to double down on his insistence that lawmakers green light $5 billion for the wall. 
                    Congress
                    By RACHAEL BADEEarlier Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration canceled the temporary flight restrictions for airspace around Mar-a-Lago that had been put in place from Dec. 21-Jan. 6 in anticipation of Trump s trip.The president s every movement   from a trip to the nearby Capitol to a flight across the country   requires a huge amount of logistical and security planning. As a result, staffers often need to be given as much notice as possible about the president s schedule. Trump s exact departure time is likely to shift as it becomes clearer when   or whether   the House will have its final vote. White House aides are sensitive to the perception that Trump shirks his presidential duties during his many trips to Mar-a-Lago and his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. They insist that the trips are  working vacations. But Democrats have mocked the president s golfing habits.  Maybe he thinks if the government shuts down, he can golf more comfortably,  House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday.Trump is known to be even more unpredictable during this stints at Mar-a-Lago, where he freely socializes with friends away from White House aides. He s more free and liberated there. He s able to do more things according to his style, on his own timetable   more like he did in the private sector,  a former White House official told POLITICO earlier this year.  He doesn t have the same guardrails. Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning   in your inbox.

                            Vice President Mike Pence, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and incoming White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney depart Capitol Hill on Friday night without a bill that would pay for President Donald Trump s border wall and avert a partial government shutdown. | Alex Brandon/AP PhotoYOUR GOVERNMENT: Shut down. YOUR CONGRESS: Working   We think?THE LATEST   At about 5:50 Friday afternoon, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY.) announced a deal to try to get a deal. Here s what happened  SENS. BOB CORKER (R-TENN.), JEFF FLAKE (R-ARIZ.) and DOUG JONES (D-ALA.) voted yes on the motion to proceed to the House funding bill, basically so they could gut it and create what Corker called a  global agreement  to pass the seven remaining government funding bills. They are ignoring the House bill, which has $5 billion in wall money. And they said no  show votes  between now and the ultimate deal. FLAKE said:  There is no path forward for the House bill. MOST PEOPLE THINK that the deal will include some $1.6 billion for border security money -- the amount in a previously agreed to Senate spending deal. BUT   REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OHIO), the Freedom Caucus leader, is not happy. He told Jake this Friday evening after exiting a meeting on the Senate side of the Capitol:  [$]1.6 [billion] is not going to make it. There s no way. They were there two weeks ago. It s gotta be more than that. -- JAKE ASKED if there was a risk the president would go wobbly:  No, the president knows how important this is. He campaigned on it. The president s been fighting the whole time to get done what needs to get done.  NEW DYNAMIC   VP MIKE PENCE was up in the Capitol, along with Mick Mulvaney and Jared Kushner. Pence and Mulvaney, of course, were bomb throwers in the House. And Kushner has limited experience in Congress, though he did have a recent win on criminal justice reform.BEHIND THE SCENES: BURGESS EVERETT and JOHN BRESNAHAN:  Inside the frantic negotiations that failed to avert a shutdown    The POLITICO ledeall on the shutdownThe 2020 Election.

Trump has been completely unpredictable here.JOINT NANCY PELOSI and CHUCK SCHUMER STATEMENT emailed at 12:23 a.m.:  Regrettably, America has now entered a Trump Shutdown. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. But instead of honoring his responsibility to the American people, President Trump threw a temper tantrum and convinced House Republicans to push our nation into a destructive Trump Shutdown in the middle of the holiday season.  President Trump has said more than 25 times that he wanted a shutdown and now he has gotten what he wanted. Democrats have offered Republicans multiple proposals to keep the government open, including one that already passed the Senate unanimously, and all of which include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security ñ not the president s ineffective and expensive wall. If President Trump and Republicans choose to continue this Trump Shutdown, the new House Democratic majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government in January.  -- TRUMP tweeted a 1 min. 36 second shutdown video at 9:49 p.m. THE SENATE and HOUSE will gavel back in today whether there is a deal, or not. The House will immediately recess and go into recess subject to the call of the chair. WHERE THINGS STAND: Funding for the Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Interior and Treasury departments and agencies like the EPA, FDA and IRS has expired. -- THE HOUSE is expected to pass a bill the Senate already cleared that would ensure government employees get paid once the shutdown ends.A message from AARP:The big drug companies don t see us as people.

From his defense of Saudi Arabia s crown prince over the murder of a dissident journalist to his abrupt decision to pull American troops out of Syria to his demand for a government shutdown, Trump has been angering friendly lawmakers, leading some who typically kept their disagreements to themselves to speak up.-- KEY POINT:  The trend could prove perilous for the president after Democrats assume control of the House in January. Should the House vote to impeach Trump, he will have to rely on an increasingly exasperated Senate GOP conference to prevent him from being thrown out of office.

WSJ-- FT:  Wall Street set for worst December since 1930s as global stocks retreat SCOOP -- MORE TRUMP CHURN? --  Trump Said to Discuss Firing Fed s Powell After Latest Rate Hike,  by Jennifer Jacobs, Margaret Talev and Saleha Mohsin:  President Donald Trump has discussed firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as his frustration with the central bank chief intensified following this week s interest-rate increase and months of stock-market losses, according to four people familiar with the matter.  Advisers close to Trump aren t convinced he would move against Powell and are hoping that the president s latest bout of anger will dissipate over the holidays, the people said on condition of anonymity. Some of Trump s advisers have warned him that firing Powell would be a disastrous move.  Yet the president has talked privately about firing Powell many times in the past few days, said two of the people.  BloombergON THE WORLD STAGE --  Reliable Allies Refuse to Defend a President Content With Chaos,  by NYT s Katie Rogers and Maggie Haberman:  As he lost the public support of those once willing to step forward on his behalf, Mr. Trump grew angry over his news coverage and told people close to him that he would be fine without Mr. Mattis. He rebuffed them for even expressing concern. Mr. Trump also privately groused about having to postpone departure plans for his 16-day trip to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort. On Friday, Melania Trump, the first lady, had already made plans to leave town with the couple s son Barron, according to her spokeswoman. Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, the president s daughter, who are also planning to go to Mar-a-Lago, were preparing to stay with Mr. Trump in Washington, an administration official said. Outside the family, a litany of staffing problems loomed as the shutdown deadline drew nearer. Mr. Trump privately complained that Mr. Mulvaney, who stepped into the vacancy left by John F. Kelly after others turned down the chief of staff position, had given him few options for averting the shutdown.  NYTHOW WE GOT HERE --  A tumultuous week began with a phone call between Trump and the Turkish president,  by WaPo s Karen DeYoung, Missy Ryan, Josh Dawsey and Greg Jaffe:  The Islamic State, according to Trump himself, had been defeated, Erdogan said. Turkey s military was strong and could take on any remaining militant pockets. Why did some 2,000 U.S. troops still need to be there?  You know what? It s yours,  Trump said of Syria.  I m leaving.   The call, shorthanded in more or less the same words by several senior administration officials, set off events that, even by the whirlwind standards of Washington in the Trump years, have been cataclysmic. They ended, for the moment at least, with Thursday s resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

                        The president s posture on illegal immigration has had a chilling effect on legal migrant flows.
                    By TED HESSON12/22/2018 07:33 AM ESTPresident Donald Trump s immigration legacy so far isn t a border wall or fewer migrants crossing the border illegally into the U.S.It s a reduction in how many people enter the U.S. by entirely legal means.Story Continued BelowState Department data show visa issuances have slumped under Trump, according to government information reviewed and analyzed by POLITICO. The number of visas for temporary stays in the U.S. fell 13 percent in fiscal year 2018 compared with two years earlier, the last full year under President Barack Obama. Immigrant visas, which allow a person to apply for a green card, dropped by 14 percent over the same period. And for people with visas, such as H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, there is less certainty about whether they will be renewed because of changes in policy. That s been a bit of a nightmare,  said Sarah Pitney, an immigration attorney with the D.C.-based firm Benach Collopy.  A lot of employers have just started looking for options other than H-1Bs, because H-1Bs have been such an issue in the last year or so.  The State Department doesn t provide detailed information about how many visa applications it receives or denies, so it s impossible to determine how much the decline is attributable to tougher screening and how much to dwindling interest in traveling to the U.S. Either explanation would suggest that Trump s posture had a chilling effect on legal immigration flows. Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning   in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, under Director Francis Cissna, has rained down policy memos and directives aimed at rooting out fraudulent and non-meritorious visa applications, but critics say they ve had the effect of slowing down or blocking legitimate visa applications.The changes amount to  reform by a lot of trimming and shaping,  according to Jessica Vaughan, a policy director with the Center for Immigration Studies, which backs lower levels of immigration.  It s really a lot of small changes that in the aggregate make a big difference. By contrast, arrests by Border Patrol   a proxy for illegal crossings   rose in recent months to the highest levels of the Trump presidency. Border Patrol nabbed 51,856 migrants at the southwest border in November, a 78 percent increase from a year earlier. The arrest levels resemble the higher months of the Obama presidency, a sign that Trump s attempts to limit illegal immigration haven t worked.Despite the surge, illegal immigration remains low compared with the late 1980s through the early 2000s, when border arrests numbered about twice what they do today. But this past year s increase was enough to prompt Trump to fume about a migrant  invasion.  Administration officials implemented a succession of border policies, including the deployment of nearly 6,000 military troops, intended to end the perceived crisis. None of these deterred rising numbers of migrants, principally from Central America, from trekking north. And deportations under Trump remain far below levels under Obama: In fiscal year 2018, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 256,058 people. By comparison, ICE removed 409,849 people in fiscal year 2012, a high-water mark during the Obama administration. The border wall itself remains unbuilt, despite Trump s frequent threats to force a federal government shutdown over what he estimates would be a $20 billion project and the current budget stalemate over the wall in Congress. A spending bill passed in March devoted just $1.4 billion to an estimated 84 miles of new and replacement barriers along the southwest border. During Trump s first year in office, Congress provided only $341 million for 40 miles of replacement fence.When it comes to legal immigration, however, the Trump administration has taken steps that could reshape who enters the country for years to come.Employers are particularly worried about changes to the H-1B visa program, a popular vehicle for tech companies to import foreign talent to the U.S. The program grants 65,000 employment visas each year, plus an additional 20,000 for U.S. master s degree holders. Under Trump, the program   which has come under bipartisan criticism for displacing American workers through a contractor loophole   has been peppered with low-profile reforms that have disrupted the existing process. For example, USCIS issued a policy memo in October 2017 that gave visa officers discretion to scrutinize visa renewals in the same manner as a new petition. That introduced a new element of uncertainty for employers and their workers. A separate memo issued earlier that year declared being a computer programmer in itself didn t qualify as a  specialty occupation  eligible for an H-1B visa   a blow to tech firms seeking foreign workers for such roles. The agency also announced a policy over the summer that allowed visa officers to deny a petition without first requesting additional evidence from the applicant or filing an advance notice of intent to deny.  The net effect of these policies make it much more challenging and expensive for U.S. employers to bring in foreign professional talent,  said Andrew Greenfield, managing partner of the Fragomen law firm s Washington office.  I think that this was the easiest thing for the administration to do to demonstrate its tough stance on immigration, because it just couldn t get Congress to act. 
                    IMMIGRATION
                    By TED HESSONLarge employers have proceeded cautiously, since immigration represents only one aspect of engagement with a president who also has sought to reshape trade pacts and the tax system. Still, they ve made their position known.Business Roundtable, a coalition of high-profile CEOs that includes executives of Coca-Cola, Apple and JPMorgan Chase, sent a letter to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in August that decried  arbitrary and inconsistent adjudications . The unpredictability had caused  considerable anxiety  among employees and threatened to disrupt business operations, the executives said.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than 3 million businesses, also has spoken out. It s not just disruptive for that individual who was planning on staying in the United States, living and working here with his or her family,  said Jon Baselice, the Chamber s director of immigration policy.  The company has to find someone to fill that person s spot. The restrictionist push has started to resonate in places like Des Moines, Iowa, where unemployment stands at 1.9 percent. Lori Chesser, an immigration attorney with the Iowa firm Davis Brown, said she has seen denials of H-1B extensions that have been approved several times before.  The businesses need certainty,  she said.The Trump administration also has slowed the process to obtain a green card. In 2017, USCIS began requiring an in-person interview for every immigrant who moves from an employment-based visa to become a lawful permanent resident.One DHS official critical of the new policy called the move  totally ideological.  The immigrants being interviewed, this person noted, typically have been living in the U.S. for years on student visas and employment visas.  These are people we know,  the official said.  This is so far away from smart, resource-driven, risk-based analysis. Student visas under Trump have fallen, too. The State Department issued roughly 363,000 F-1 student visas in fiscal year 2018, according to a POLITICO analysis of State Department data. That represents a 23 percent decline from fiscal year 2016. The number of foreign students enrolled for the first time in U.S. colleges and universities declined in 2017 for the second year in a row, according to a report released in November. The report, based on an annual survey by the nonprofit Institute of International Education, calculated that new enrollment dropped nearly 7 percent compared with the previous year. Leaders of universities and colleges blame Trump s immigration tactics for the slowdown as the administration has moved to toughen standards for foreign students.  Many of our most successful companies are based on the talents of those international students,  said Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California system and a former Homeland Security secretary to President Barack Obama.  It just seems not wise, to put it mildly, to discourage that kind of international talent from coming to the United States. A new USCIS policy announced in October threatens to saddle international students with an immigration penalty if they remain in the country beyond the term of their visa, a hard-line move to compel students without authorization to depart the country quickly.Trump s national security policies also have served to choke off the flow of foreigners from countries deemed high-risk by the administration. The latest version of the president s travel ban policy   upheld by the Supreme Court in June   places a range of travel restrictions on five majority-Muslim countries   Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen   as well as on North Korea and Venezuela. A POLITICO analysis published in April found visas granted to people from travel ban countries dropped sharply under the policy.

                    By JASON SCHWARTZThe refugee program is another Trump target. The president set the refugee admissions ceiling at 30,000 in fiscal year 2019   a steep decline from the 110,000 in place when he took office. The president s latest plan also shifted refugee processing away from the Middle East and Africa, according to a report to Congress earlier this year.And Trump is hardly done, with some of the most sweeping changes potentially coming in 2019. The administration is expected to publish its so-called public charge rule, which could block immigrants from obtaining lawful permanent residency if they ve received certain government benefits or if they re deemed likely to do so in the future. The measure could reshape the character of legal immigration to the U.S. In addition, it could force hundreds of thousands of foreigners on temporary visas to prove they ll be self-sufficient during their stay   yet another hurdle for employers.The administration also plans to roll back work authorization for roughly 91,000 spouses of H-1B visa holders, a move opposed by the tech lobby. In the longer-term, the administration plans to reform the  optional practical training  program, which allows international students to work 12 to 36 months in the U.S. Such a change could make it harder for employers to recruit international students after graduation.

                    By JESUS RODRIGUEZMeanwhile, the broader crackdown on illegal immigration continues to falter due to funding constraints and legal setbacks. Trump has struggled to convince Congress to adopt his immigration agenda, even with Republicans controlling the House and Senate during his first two years in office. When the Senate engaged in an intense immigration debate in February, a hawkish bill backed by the White House flopped with a majority of senators   including more than a dozen Republicans   opposed.Once Democrats take control of the House in January, Trump will have an even more difficult time pushing his legislative agenda. I think if they try and do that, particularly next year, they ll probably have a battle on their hands on the House side,  said California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations subcommittee for homeland security issues.Still, the president s tough talk on illegal immigration has mollified his base. In the November midterm elections, the president spent weeks slamming a caravan of migrants traveling toward Mexico to the U.S., a strategic move intended to motivate Republican voters. Democrats regained control of the House, picking up 40 seats so far. But immigration proved a top issue for Republican voters. He s all about theater,  said Muzaffar Chishti, a director with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.  He has created the notion that there s a new sheriff in town. Chishti argues that the administration has wagered that it can deter illegal immigration and asylum seekers by making miserable the lives of migrants who are already here   but that it hasn t succeeded.  They tried to separate families,  he said.  To a lot of people that was the ultimate deterrent. No one wanted their kids to be separated. But guess what? Even then people kept on coming.

                    By ANDREW GLASS12/22/2018 07:02 AM ESTOn this day in 1995, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas broke a record set by Sen. Charles McNary of Oregon in 1944 to become the longest-serving Republican leader. His record has since been surpassed by Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, with a tenure of 11 years, five months and 14 days as of Saturday.At the time, Dole had held the post since Jan. 3, 1985   10 years, 11 months and nine days. Dole resigned his Senate seat on June 11, 1996 to focus on his ultimately unsuccessful campaign to deny President Bill Clinton a second term. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi succeeded him as GOP leader.Story Continued BelowThe Constitution makes no mention of the positions of Senate party floor leaders. Rather, the posts evolved during the early 20th century. The first Senate floor leaders were formally designated in 1920 by the Democrats and in 1925 by the Republicans.Senate floor leaders are elected by the members of their respective parties at the beginning of each Congress. Depending on which party is in power, one serves as majority leader and the other as minority leader. The majority leader schedules the daily legislative program and fashions the unanimous consent agreements that govern the time for debate. As issues arise, the leaders often become spokespersons for their party s positions. When several senators are seeking recognition, the majority leader has the right to be called on first by the presiding officer. This enables him to offer motions or amendments before any other senator. Sen. Robert Byrd (W.Va.) called first recognition  the most potent weapon in the majority leader s arsenal.

                    By RACHAEL BADEAfter the 2014 midterm elections placed the Republicans in control of the Senate, McConnell moved up to majority leader. McConnell is the 15th Senate GOP leader and the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the Senate. He is also the longest-serving U.S. senator in Kentucky history.To mark the day that McConnell broke Dole s record   June 12, 2018   lawmakers from both parties acclaimed his leadership skills. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip, said:  We all know he s whip smart. He is an impressive strategist. He understands the Senate better than anyone else here. That takes a remarkable sense of self-confidence and team spirit that not everybody has,  added Cornyn, who would like to replace him as GOP leader should McConnell, 76, give up the post.The milestone elicited kind words even from his Democratic counterpart.  It s no secret we disagree on a whole lot of issues, both political and philosophical, but that doesn t mean we can t or don t work together or that I don t admire the qualities that have helped make him the longest serving Republican leader,  Sen. Chuck Schumer, (D-N.Y.) the minority leader, said on the chamber floor.Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said:  McConnell tries to make the mules plow. He s tougher than a two-dollar steak.

                        Congress
                        With GOP leadership feeling burned, a group of rank-and-file senators stepped up   and still fell short.
                    By BURGESS EVERETT and JOHN BRESNAHAN12/21/2018 11:41 PM ESTCory Gardner didn t like what he was hearing as Senate Republicans met on Friday afternoon. A group of GOP senators that sat with President Donald Trump earlier that day were offering increasingly dour assessments of the odds of avoiding yet another government shutdown this year, this time over Trump s border wall. But the first-term Colorado senator still thought a deal was possible.Story Continued Below Then Gardner s phone rang, and it was Trump on the line.  What I heard from the president was,  We re going to get this done, we re going to get this fixed,   Gardner said.  He s ready to find a deal. So, we talked about it.  After both speaking with the president on the telephone, Gardner and Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) stepped into the Republican cloakroom off the Senate floor and desperately tried to dial Mick Mulvaney, Trump s acting chief of staff and a former congressional colleague. Eventually, Mulvaney answered with Vice President Mike Pence on the line, and the four Republicans talked. At Perdue s request, Mulvaney, Pence and White House adviser Jared Kushner were then dispatched to the Hill to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in a last-ditch attempt to find a deal.A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Gardner and Perdue s efforts didn t head off a shutdown. Yet the episode highlights an essential component of Trump s style of being president, especially when it comes to dealing with Congress: his use of back-channels and personal relationships   often circumventing party leaders   to try to get deals done. Trump employs the tactic far more than any recent president. Sometimes it works, more often it doesn t. And Friday was a case where it didn t work. It happened, to real success, during the bipartisan negotiations over the criminal justice reform package. It happened again on Thursday, when conservative House GOP hard-liners Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan went around Republican leaders and urged Trump to back a bill providing $5 billion for the border wall, although that led directly to Friday s shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) had been ready to postpone the border wall fight until early February and avoid a partial government shutdown. Meadows and Jordan urged Trump to pick the fight with Democrats now, and Trump went along with them   ambushing McConnell and Ryan in the process. Schumer and the trio of Trump administration officials made some progress in a private meeting on a deal to fund the government and modestly boost border security funding. But it came too late. The Senate and House both adjourned relatively early in the evening, and congressional leaders are still hashing things out with the president and his top officials. Lawmakers and aides in both parties are cautiously optimistic that the shutdown will be short, believing there s an emerging consensus around a package of seven annual spending bills, including $1.6 billion in money for fencing. Everyone seems to realize that Trump s dream of $5 billion for concrete wall funding is dead, including Trump himself. But nobody seems quite sure of what, exactly, Trump will sign after this week s frenzied back and forth. On Friday morning, Schumer and McConnell were barely talking. After all, they d already struck a deal to continue government funding until Feb. 8, only to see Trump pull his support for the plan following the revolt by the House Freedom Caucus.  Mitch is not going to negotiate with Schumer because he doesn t know if he can depend on what the president s bottom line will be. So, that s understandable,  said Perdue, who met with Trump and other senators on Friday morning.  But because of that, nobody s talking. 
                    White House 
                    By ELIANA JOHNSON and BURGESS EVERETT In fact, things were so bad and GOP senators so disgusted with the state of play that two of them, Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), couldn t be convinced to even open debate on a doomed House-passed bill that delivered $5 billion for the border wall. The vote stayed open for more than five hours as Perdue and Gardner backchanneled with the administration, and as Schumer spoke to Trump officials and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Eventually, Flake, Corker and Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) voted to move forward on the bill and allow leaders to keep talking. Seemingly minor, the procedural move makes it possible for the Senate to act as quickly as a deal can be struck.  Mitch certainly doesn t want to put us out voting on something that the president has not agreed to. The key is that the president has to agree that he will [sign] this,  Flake said. Flake met with Corker, then with Schumer, McConnell, and finally the two leaders together to move the Senate s funding effort forward. Yet while that procedural fracas was playing out, Republicans were frantically trying to come up with something they could put on the floor. The shuttle diplomacy continued throughout the day. Pence, Kushner and Mulvaney went from Schumer s office to Pence s own hideaway in the Capitol, where Corker came to visit. Then they went to the House side of the Capitol to negotiate with conservatives and GOP leaders, trying to figure out what could pass that the president would sign. McConnell, meanwhile, was somewhat hands-off after Trump s about-face on the stopgap bill. As emphatically as he could, Pence had told senators that Trump would sign the legislation, only to see that backfire. So Pence couldn t sign off any deal with Schumer or House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)   who was even more skeptical   unless Trump publicly backed it first.  That was my belief at the time. That was my belief at the time based on all the representations made. But as you know, things change,  said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) of Pence s comments to the GOP insisting Trump would sign the Senate s short-term spending bill without wall money. When Trump instead did the opposite, McConnell was quietly steaming, according to multiple GOP senators. And by the time he announced on the Senate floor on Friday that the chamber would advance the House s bill only to stall for several hours as leaders worked to strike a deal, he was wearing a button declaring that he was part of the Senate s  Cranky Coalition.  Shortly after 6 p.m. Gardner and Perdue thought that a breakthrough was imminent and both chambers would move quickly. But the shutdown deadline came and went, underscoring the difficulty of scrambling together an agreement after two weeks of chaos.  And rather than force Democrats to block the House bill and allow the traditional shutdown blame game to begin, McConnell instead left the Capitol before 8 p.m. having never held a vote on Trump s preferred legislation.  Constructive talks are underway,  McConnell said as he walked out. Asked if he was participating, he responded:  As I said repeatedly, we need Democratic votes and a presidential signature. 
                    Government Shutdown
                    By ANDREW RESTUCCIA and ELIANA JOHNSON House Republicans were happy that the Senate didn t reject their bill too,  because it took a hot potato off our laps,  in the words of one. The most recent state of play could be framed as the Senate having stalled on legislation to stop the shutdown. Of course, House Republicans passed its $5 billion in border wall funding knowing full well it couldn t pass the Senate. Democrats and even some Republicans seethed that Ryan   who is retiring in two weeks   didn t simply put the Senate s clean short-term funding bill on the House floor. It would likely have passed with support from some Republicans and a lot of Democrats, effectively daring Trump to veto it.  Obviously the $5 billion is not going to pass,  Corker said.  Obviously everybody understands that. So what do we do in the interim, that the Democrats will take and that the president will take?  By day s end that wasn t entirely clear. The House and Senate left much earlier than they usually do during a shutdown, not even pretending to play the normal political games as the clock ticked toward midnight. By 9 p.m., Pence, Kushner and Mulvaney had left too. The day had not resulted in a breakthrough, but the needle had moved. At least a bit.  We independently and together have heard the president say very specific things about what he would or wouldn t do. There s a very reasonable chance that Schumer can find common ground with that,  Perdue said.  We woke up this morning thinking nothing is happening,  Gardner added.  Now I think we ve opened up this door to a deal to be had. James Arkin contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/21/2018 10:50 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump faces a dangerous erosion of support among rank-and-file Republicans thanks to a series of jarring recent moves that have alienated even some close GOP allies.From his defense of Saudi Arabia s crown prince over the murder of a dissident journalist to his abrupt decision to pull American troops out of Syria to his demand for a government shutdown, Trump has been angering friendly lawmakers, leading some who typically kept their disagreements to themselves to speak up. Story Continued BelowThe trend could prove perilous for the president after Democrats assume control of the House in January. Should the House vote to impeach Trump, he will have to rely on an increasingly exasperated Senate GOP conference to prevent him from being thrown out of office.Trump has always focused on pleasing his political base, governing with an eye more toward unifying Republicans rather than the country as a whole. For much of his presidency, the strategy worked: Both his core supporters and Republicans in general supported his withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, ditching the Iran nuclear deal, and confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, to howls of protest from Democrats. More recently, however, cracks are showing between Trump s base and GOP officials, who are rattled by his Syria exit and the ensuing resignation of his Defense secretary, Jim Mattis. The 2020 Election. The New Congress. The Mueller Investigation. Be in the Know.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Going to the base of the base means that Republican senators are going to start disagreeing with you, because that s not their party,  said Matthew Continetti, editor-in-chief of the conservative Washington Free Beacon. One Republican senator said his colleagues feel like they ve been increasingly hijacked by Trump. The senator described the president as increasingly intent on pleasing the hard-line House Freedom Caucus and media allies like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh. Some Republicans find the juxtaposition between what they consider a reckless foreign policy and a reckless border wall fight to be infuriating. Syria is crumbling. And we re talking about a fucking wall,  this senator said.Also aggravating Republicans is Trump s sheer unpredictability, which was evident from his unclear and shifting positions on the budget talks. Earlier this week Trump seemed prepared to accept a short-term spending bill from Congress that did not include billions for a border wall, allowing for holiday vacations to begin as planned. By Thursday, he had abruptly shifted back to a hard-line position, saying he would rather see the government shut down than surrender on the border wall. Usually out of the president it s better to have a steady course. You want to be able to draw a bead on where your leader is going to be in a week or two or three. This has not been a steady course. We need a steady course,  said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.).Trump is still a long way from seeing the Senate GOP turn on him in numbers that could lead to his impeachment and expulsion from office. Republicans will have a 53-47 Senate majority in 2019, and it requires 67 Senate votes to convict a president who has been impeached in the House. That means roughly 20 senators   many of them representing states in which Trump is highly popular   would need to turn on him.But some Republicans say they ve seen a subtle shift in tone of late. Early signs of trouble appeared this past fall, when Trump refused to condemn Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman for the murder of the activist and journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Several Republican lawmakers broke from Trump in saying they were convinced, as the CIA assessed, that Salman had ordered the murder. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who rarely disagrees openly with the president, joined Trump nemesis Sen. Bob Corker (R.-Tenn.) to introduce a resolution condemning the crown prince for the murder. 
                    Cybersecurity
                    By MICHAEL B. FARRELLThe latest indication of Trump s fracturing Republican coalition came over Syria. Trump s announcement that all 2,000 currently deployed U.S. troops would be leaving the country delighted his #MAGA supporters at outlets like Breitbart and Fox News, where the prime-time host Tucker Carlson argued that Trump was simply fulfilling a campaign promise. Just to be clear, many of us are cheered by the departure of Tillerson and now Mattis. Neither could ever seem to grasp that Trump won the presidency nor the dangers of the swamp,  American Conservative Union president Matt Schlapp tweeted on Friday. Schlapp is the husband of Trump strategic communications director Mercedes Schlapp, and both have been intensely loyal to the president since the campaign. It was a different story among some congressional Republicans. In a letter sent to the president Wednesday, six senators called his decision to pull out of Syria  a premature and costly mistake  that  threatens the safety and security of the United States.  Four Republican senators signed the letter: Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, Joni Ernst, and Lindsey Graham. Cotton, Ernst and Graham have all been close Trump allies during his first two years in office. (The conservative Maine independent Sen. Angus King also signed.) We re very concerned  about Syria, Ernst told POLITICO.  I just think it s significant. The actions are significant. And I would just love the president to listen to those military advisers and make sure that we re taking the fight to terrorists overseas, not allowing them to come here. In a closed-door meeting with Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday, Senate Republicans unleashed their fury, with one GOP senator telling the vice president that while withdrawing from Syria may cheer the president s base now, it will hurt him politically when  an American is burned in a cage  at the hands of ISIS, according to a senior GOP aide.  The resignation on Thursday of Defense Secretary James Mattis, who said he was leaving his post because of disagreements with the president over  treating allies with respect  and  being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors,  exacerbated those concerns.

                    By MARIANNE LEVINEIt also earned Trump another rare rebuke from McConnell, who said in a pointed statement Thursday that he was  distressed  by Mattis  resignation and urged the Trump administration to  maintain a clear-eyed understanding of our friends and foes.  I m getting emails from my Republican colleagues with phrases like:  The wheels have come off.  Like:  Going places we didn t think it will go.   said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.).  One of them said:  This is a bridge too far.  It would be nice if somebody would say it besides Bob Corker.  Several conservatives close to the White House have echoed those concerns, saying that they re beginning to worry the president may not make it to 2020. Corker, a retiring GOP senator from Tennessee who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, seethed on Friday that the country had degenerated into a  tyranny of radio talk show hosts.  That said, the president maintains the loyalty of some members of the Senate Republican Conference, who dismissed the concerns of their colleagues and said the week s events shouldn t come as a shock to anybody.  I don t see it as chaos,  said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.).  I don t think the president s strong feelings about a border wall and border security are surprising to anyone. I m a big Gen. Mattis fan. I hate to see him go. But presidential advisers come and go. James Arkin contributed to this report.CORRECTION:  This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Sen.

                    Updated 12/22/2018 04:18 PM ESTThe FBI on Friday sharply rebuked the House Judiciary Committee for pushing to publish more than 3,400 pages of confidential witness interviews, escalating tensions between the Justice Department and GOP leaders.The two sides have long clashed as Republicans have conducted long-running investigations into the FBI s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe, as well as potential anti-Trump bias in the bureau. Story Continued BelowIn particular, the FBI chafed at a tight deadline the committee had provided to review the vast trove of sensitive documents.According to a letter sent Friday to Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, congressional staff notified the FBI on Dec. 19 that they wanted the 3,400 pages reviewed by Dec. 24, which the missive noted is  Christmas Eve  and  during the anticipated Government shutdown. Plus, releasing unredacted interviews could reveal classified information, FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich cautioned in the letter. The 2020 Election. The New Congress. The Mueller Investigation.

It is our shared responsibility   predicated on legal requirements   to protect sensitive information of this nature from public disclosure,  Bowdich wrote. Therefore, we respectfully request that the Committees maintain the confidentiality of the un-redacted interview transcripts pending a complete review by the FBI, the Department, and the Special Counsel s Office, as appropriate,  Bowdich continued, hinting that some of the transcripts may affect special counsel Robert Mueller s Russia probe if published.The letter from the FBI deputy director comes as Republicans prepare to wind down a 14-month investigation into the FBI s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe and GOP allegations that anti-Trump bias in the bureau led to a disproportionate focus on the investigation of the Trump campaign ties to Russia.The investigations were led by Goodlatte and Rep. Trey Gowdy, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, along with a small subset of members from both panels. Democrats have members on the task force as well. The investigatory panel has interviewed numerous senior FBI officials, including former Director James Comey and his inner circle, as well as two FBI officials   Peter Strzok and Lisa Page   whose anti-Trump text messages fueled Trump allies  claims of a conspiracy against the president. They also talked to former Obama administration Justice Department officials. It s unclear if the committees plan to release a report of their findings before Democrats take the House next month.The FBI warned that those discussions were highly sensitive. Based on the information discussed during those closed interviews and included in the transcripts, the FBI believes that the release of un-redacted or inadequately redacted transcripts will result in the disclosure of law enforcement sensitive information and personally identifiable information,  Bowdich wrote.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                        Government Shutdown
                        The president was supposed to leave for his resort on Friday, but had pushed back his departure several times.

                    Updated 12/22/2018 11:42 AM ESTPresident Donald Trump will stay in Washington amid the government shutdown, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Saturday.  Due to the shutdown, President Trump will remain in Washington, D.C. and the First Lady will return from Florida so they can spend Christmas together,  Sanders said, according to a pool report. Story Continued BelowThe Senate adjourned Saturday afternoon with no solution to the partial government shutdown and no plans to reconvene until Dec. 27.The White House had twice canceled Trump s planned departure to his Mar-a-Lago resort, two White House aides confirmed, as Washington plunged into a partial government shutdown and officials continued negotiating to reach a compromise. The White House had signaled in an email to staff obtained by POLITICO on Friday that the president might depart at noon on Saturday   a day later than originally intended   but officials scuttled that plan when it became clear a quick solution to reopen the government was not in sights. Trump s wife, Melania Trump, and his son, Barron Trump, had taken off on their own for the Winter White House on Friday. They will now return to the White House. On Saturday afternoon, Trump tweeted,  I am in the White House, working hard.  He added,  We are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed Border Security (Gangs, Drugs, Human Trafficking & more) but it could be a long stay. The president later tweeted:  I will not be going to Florida because of the Shutdown - Staying in the White House! #MAGA Trump s decision to stay in D.C. for the time being is a recognition of the poor optics of having the president at his luxury resort while the government is closed   furloughing hundreds of thousands of workers and halting some federal services near the holidays.The president was originally scheduled to leave the White House on Friday afternoon for a two-week-plus trip to Mar-a-Lago. But those plans were scuttled amid the shutdown threat. Please note that we will no longer travel to Palm Beach, FL today. Please monitor your e-mail for further updates,  said a second internal White House email sent to staff earlier Friday, which was confirmed by a West Wing aide.The 2020 Election. The New Congress.

Democrats, whose ability to filibuster in the Senate amounts to veto power, call that a non-starter. Congressional leaders had been discussing a solution that would fund border security at $1.6 billion, slightly higher than current levels but far short of what Trump is requesting. If Trump ultimately backs such a compromise, it would mark a stark reversal for the president, who had initially signaled his willingness to support a stopgap measure only to double down on his insistence that lawmakers green light $5 billion for the wall.

                    By RACHAEL BADEEarlier Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration canceled the temporary flight restrictions for airspace around Mar-a-Lago that had been put in place from Dec. 21-Jan. 6 in anticipation of Trump s trip.The president s every movement   from a trip to the nearby Capitol to a flight across the country   requires a huge amount of logistical and security planning. As a result, staffers often need to be given as much notice as possible about the president s schedule. Trump s exact departure time is likely to shift as it becomes clearer when   or whether   the House will have its final vote. White House aides are sensitive to the perception that Trump shirks his presidential duties during his many trips to Mar-a-Lago and his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. They insist that the trips are  working vacations. But Democrats have mocked the president s golfing habits.  Maybe he thinks if the government shuts down, he can golf more comfortably,  House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday.Trump is known to be even more unpredictable during this stints at Mar-a-Lago, where he freely socializes with friends away from White House aides. He s more free and liberated there. He s able to do more things according to his style, on his own timetable   more like he did in the private sector,  a former White House official told POLITICO earlier this year.  He doesn t have the same guardrails. Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning   in your inbox.

There isn t much lobbyists can do in this situation except keep their clients informed about what s going on. The effect of a partial shutdown on corporate America will depend on how long it lasts. If the government shuts down for only a couple of days the weekend before Christmas,  it has actually almost zero practical implication whatsoever  for most clients, said Mike Robinson, a lobbyist at Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas.  For lobbyists and their clients,  the biggest drawback of a funding impasse is that Congress won t be able to address a number of issues that were set to be included in a year-end government funding bill that may now drift into next year or fade entirely,  CGCN Group wrote in a memo to clients this week.  By failing to close the loop on those measures, Congress may be forced to punt a number of urgent issues into next year.  Here s the full memo.PODESTA SUES FORMER CLIENTS:  The Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta has been suing former clients over what he says are nearly half a million dollars in unpaid bills   some of it for work he claims was done after his firm collapsed and stopped paying employees,  POLITICO s Theodoric Meyer reports.  The Podesta Group   an empty shell for more than a year after it imploded amid revelations about its work with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort   has sued 10 former clients in recent months, according to court records. They include name-brand companies such as SeaWorld as well as nonprofits such as Refugee Council USA and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.   At least one former client is counter-suing.  The Podesta Group sued Ajamie LLP, a Houston law firm, last month for failing to pay its final monthly bill last year of $15,000. Ajamie responded by suing the Podesta Group for up to $200,000 in damages, accusing the firm of  failure to perform meaningful work  after it came under scrutiny following President Donald Trump s election for its work with Manafort.  Podesta Group clearly became too busy covering its tracks and propping up its business to work on its client matters, including its  work on behalf of the law firm, Thomas Ajamie, the firm s managing partner, wrote in the suit.

The reason: The tobacco giant Altria taking a 35 percent stake in Juul, according to sources. The firm declined to comment. Juul didn t respond to requests for comment.NEW BUSINESS: Former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) of Kasowitz Benson Torres has registered to lobby for the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, according to a disclosure filing, along with his former chief of staff, Clarine Nardi Riddle, and Nicholas Rendino. POLITICO reported last week that Lieberman would conduct a security assessment of ZTE s products. And Harley-Davidson hired GoBiz Advantage last month to lobby on the electric motorcycle tax credit, according to a new disclosure filing. Harley isn t a big lobbying spender: The Wisconsin company has spent $120,000 on Washington lobbying so far this year and retains only one other firm, Peck Madigan Jones.DELTA CEO URGES ADMINISTRATION TO LOOK INTO QATAR AIRWAYS: Ed Bastian, the chief executive of Delta Air Lines, urged President Donald Trump to look into Qatar Airways  subsidization of Air Italy in a post this morning on the airline s website. Bastian accuses Qatar Airways of  using the tiny, close-to-defunct Air Italy to skirt its promise  not to add flights between the U.S. and Europe.  The move is the latest in a long battle between American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta on one side and Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates on the other. The three U.S. airlines have accused the Middle Eastern ones of violating  Open Skies  agreements through unfair government subsidies, which the Middle Eastern airlines have denied. Nearly a dozen Republican senators urged the administration to look into Qatar Airways  subsidization of Air Italy in a letter earlier this month.All for our Country Victory Fund (Sen.

Mitch McConnell was known as a pro-civil rights, union-friendly moderate as a county executive in Louisville in the late 1970s. As federal transfers grew from around 10 percent of the income of the average Kentuckian in 1970 to 24 percent in 2016, seven percentage points more than the national average, the ideology of Mr. McConnell   moved sharply to the right.

                        Government Shutdown
                    By CAITLIN EMMA and JENNIFER SCHOLTES12/21/2018 12:09 PM ESTEven a partial government shutdown would be painful for taxpayers and federal workers.With the partial government shutdown beginning at midnight Friday, funding is in peril for the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Justice, Commerce, State, Agriculture, Interior, Treasury and Housing and Urban Development, plus agencies like the EPA, FDA and IRS. Cutting off the federal cash flow would freeze many essential services and progress on long-term projects.Story Continued BelowLeft untouched are the departments of Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Labor, Education and Defense   and congressional operations.Five reasons a partial shutdown could hit hard:  Research and training stops cold: For many agencies that have no national security role, shutdowns mean only a skeleton staff is kept on. Just 60 full-time employees out of more than 2,000 at the National Science Foundation would stay at work during a lapse, and the agency would stop issuing payments and reviewing grants, according to the latest posted plans. Likewise, most research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which are housed within the Commerce Department, would grind to a halt. The exception would be real-time modeling used for hurricane tracking and flight planning for the Federal Aviation Administration.At departments like State and Homeland Security, essential training courses for emergency responders who help during disasters, Foreign Service officers and airport security screeners are all canceled during shutdowns. For TSA, which has frequent employee turnover among its frontline workforce, that means a delay in on-boarding thousands of new security screeners ahead of a spring break season that is likely to break another record for most air travel. The 2020 Election. The New Congress. The Mueller Investigation. Be in the Know.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Happily for holiday travel, TSA agents at airports would stay on duty during a shutdown.  Time wasted determining  essential  services: The federal workforce spends thousands of hours prepping for and recovering from government shutdowns. Even employees who aren t  excepted  from a lapse are required to report to work  to commence an orderly shutdown  and sign their furlough letters, unless their supervisors say otherwise.Then there are the case-by-case calls that have to be made about whether cutting personnel or support would pose an  imminent threat to human life.  In the contingency plan EPA released this week, the agency explains it will be evaluating more than 800 Superfund sites, where land has been contaminated by hazardous waste, to decide how to proceed in the case of a shutdown. The agency says it would keep up work if, for example, halting a drainage treatment plan would cause contaminants to release into a stream that provides drinking water to a community.  A blow to morale: Many of the affected departments have yet to make the call on exactly which types of federal employees would be deemed  essential  and stay on as furloughed in a shutdown. But Democratic spending leaders in the Senate predict that letting the seven remaining spending bills lapse would result in about 380,000 positions furloughed and roughly 420,000 federal employees going without pay.Federal workers have gone through enough shutdowns in recent decades for word to get around that they can count on Congress to provide back pay once the shutdown concludes. A drawn-out funding lapse means employees could be on the hook, though, for making mortgage, student loan or car payments before that late paycheck rolls in. And morale is already low at many of the affected agencies.For 2018, the Partnership for Public Service ranked the departments of Homeland Security, Agriculture and State as among the worst large agencies to be employed as a federal worker in the annual list that officials closely watch to track government workforce trends.

                    By RACHAEL BADE  Middle America feels the administrative delays: The administration has tremendous leeway to make the case for certain federal workers to be considered  excepted  from the shutdown and to continue working in the interest of national security, as well as  the safety of human life or the protection of property.  And the Trump administration already used that latitude to lessen the blow of the almost three-day lapse in January. Some federal work just can t be saved from a shutdown, though.At USDA, for example, food safety inspectors would continue to ensure meat and poultry is safe to sell and eat. But a shutdown would shutter the Farm Service Agency, which offers loans to farmers when they can t get commercial credit from a bank, potentially delaying the processing of loan applications as farmers head into planting season this spring.Processing of loans from the Federal Housing Administration and Small Business Administration would be delayed, as well as HUD payments to public housing agencies. And the IRS, about to begin filing season, is expected to furlough about 52,000 employees. However, a government shutdown alone wouldn t force the IRS to delay the start of the tax filing season early next year, a senior agency official has said. Even so, the agency might not start accepting tax returns until February, somewhat later than its usual January time frame.Under the umbrella of the Interior Department, National Park Service sites and wildlife refuges would remain open. But services provided by NPS would stop   meaning no bathrooms, trash collection, road maintenance or visitor information.  The longer, the harder: Some agencies initially coast on money from  multiyear  and  no-year  appropriations that aren t constrained by the current fiscal calendar, or use cash from fees they collect. But those more-flexible funds can dwindle quickly without a regular spending stream.The judiciary, for example, estimated in 2013 that it could operate for about 10 workdays using funds from court filings, other fees and appropriations Congress already allows to be used at any time. Then in fiscal 2018, the judiciary predicted operations could continue for about three weeks without a new appropriation. Bernie Becker contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

Story Continued Below SO, NOT EXACTLY: So it looked at one point   oh, like 24 to 36 hours ago   like this whole government funding issue had been figured out. But no more, of course, and that now puts the federal government on the cusp of a partial shutdown. IRS officials previously said they were confident that a shutdown wouldn t by itself delay the start of the filing season next year or hamstring efforts to implement the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115). But some people closely watching the situation are grumbling about lawmakers  inability to fund the government and the harm it causes civil servants and taxpayers.  The counterpoint: House conservatives, like the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), essentially said concerns about federal workers were overblown.  Why are government employees so sacrosanct? Private sector employees deal with this all the time,  Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) told our Sarah Ferris, noting that employees eventually get paid for the time they re furloughed during a shutdown.  The government s not immune to these things.  Speaking of filing season: The 2019 version will be the first grappling with the widespread changes enacted by the TCJA, and H&R Block has new survey data illustrating the amount of confusion that taxpayers might be in for this first time around. Only one in five respondents said they had changed their withholding after the TCJA passed, and not even half said they felt comfortable making changes to their own W-4 withholding form.  Consumers mostly want to get the same size refund as they have in prior years, while 47 percent actually expect a larger refund. But they haven t taken action to make that happen, and don t even know how,  said Kathy Pickering of H&R Block s Tax Institute.  WELCOME TO FRIDAY   where, to be fair, we only said on Thursday that Congress and the White House were on the cusp of a government funding agreement. Speaking of difficult puzzles to crack, today marks 105 years since the first crossword puzzle, published in the New York World and composed by an Englishman named Arthur Wynne, was published.

You can also reach us on Twitter at @berniebecker3,  @tobyeckert,  @brianfaler,  @aaronelorenzo,  @POLITICOPro and  @Morning_Tax.  THINGS THAT MAKE YOU GO : The House passed that year-end tax bill from Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) on Thursday   pretty easily, in fact, given there had been some chatter about whether they could get the votes or if GOP lawmakers being absent could make life more difficult. (Only three Republicans voted against the measure in the end   Justin Amash of Michigan, Todd Rokita of Indiana and Mark Sanford of South Carolina.) That vote doesn t have much of a shelf life   the Senate isn t going to take it up. But of all the individual planks in H.R. 88 (115)   Johnson Amendment, a couple of tax extenders, TCJA fixes, retirement changes, Obamacare taxes   the House plucked out its suite of IRS changes and put it on the House floor, too, as H.R. 7227 (115) on Thursday. If nothing else, that would give the Senate   now that senators have to head back to Washington   the chance to approve that bipartisan proposal should they choose. Will that actually happen? Brady was somewhat coy about what the Senate might or might not do:  We pre-negotiated the policy on there,  Brady told Morning Tax.  They re calling how or if they can move it.   WORK TO DO! The House bill had about a half-dozen technical corrections for TCJA, including the so-called retail glitch and fixes dealing with net operating losses (NOLs) and repatriation. But as Pro Tax s Brian Faler reports, the Joint Committee on Taxation s 457-page blue book suggests there could be six dozen or more corrections needed, on items ranging from the  kiddie tax  to provisions dealing with bike commuting. Democrats have so far demanded a high price for making fixes to the TCJA, arguing that the bill was rammed through too quickly and without their input. And as Brian notes, the hullabaloo over the passage of the TCJA spilled over to make the blue book unusually controversial this year.  Counterpoint: Big bills can need a lot of fixing! For instance, the Technical Corrections Act of 1988, following closely behind the 1986 tax overhaul and the Revenue Act of 1987, clocked in at 800 pages.  Maybe not a correction, but : Trader hedge funds are not pleased with how Treasury and the IRS crafted regulations on the tax law s deduction for business interest, as Bloomberg s Lynnley Browning reports.  The rules create the worst possible situation,  said one tax lawyer. CLAW THAT BACK: Brussels is ordering Gibraltar to retrieve 100 million euros (around $114 million) worth of tax breaks it handed out in an effort to lure industry, Bloomberg reports. Margrethe Vestager, the European competition czar, said that Gibraltar, a British territory,  gave unfair and selective tax benefits,  after a five-year probe largely focused on interest exemptions. And despite all that, top Gibraltar officials were pretty happy with the ruling.  Although it is a negative decision, its effect is minor whilst at the same time it vindicates our view that there is nothing fundamentally unlawful or wrong with our Income Tax Act 2010,  said Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar s chief minister. NOT SO FAST: A federal judge has tossed out a New York tax on pharmaceutical companies to help fight the opioid crisis, The Wall Street Journal reports. Companies that sold or circulated opioids are to pay $100 million a year for six years under the New York law, for purposes that Judge Katherine Polk Failla called  commendable.  But Failla, nominated by former President Barack Obama, also said the law violated the Constitution by permitting state regulation of interstate commerce. Drug makers have threatened to flee New York because of the tax.  GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION: California looks like it won t adopt the TCJA s tax on global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, for its tax system   moving in the opposite direction of New Jersey and New York. A spokesman for California s Franchise Tax Board told Law360 that the board didn t have any plans to sponsor a measure that would incorporate GILTI or the TCJA s limits on deducting business interest. California s not alone   around 15 states have already declined to include GILTI when conforming their tax codes, while only a handful have decided to adopt the tax. The Council on State Taxation said California would see a dramatic corporate tax increase if it did embrace GILTI.

STATES SCRAMBLE FOR COLORADO RIVER DEAL: Western states are facing a late-January deadline to finalize a historic deal aimed at staving off a water crisis for the millions of people who depend on the Colorado River. If successful, Arizona, California and Nevada s collaboration would represent one of the most significant steps ever taken in the country to adapt to climate change   even as political leaders in the region avoid using the  C  term, Pro s Annie Snider reports this morning. The latest federal forecasts paint a dire picture for the river. Declining water levels as Lake Mead, the reservoir supplying Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, are threatening to trigger mandatory distribution cuts. The states agreed to the principles of a plan to stave off that scenario more than three years ago, but have yet to finalize it. The Trump administration is now trying to push things along, and Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Brenda Burman gave water managers till the end of January to finish up   or the Interior Department will intervene. There s been surprisingly little debate over the idea that the West is facing a future with less water, even from staunchly Republican leaders in the region. Ted Kowalski, who previously served as Colorado s lead negotiator, said community leaders have tried to avoid the political divisiveness associated with climate change, but that there s no denying the region s conditions have been altered.  We ve seen the worst 18-year period in 100 years. Either we re living in an unlucky time or something is different,  he said. Read the story.  HAPPY HOLIDAYS! I m your host, Kelsey Tamborrino. As we close out this year, I want to thank you, ME readers, for spending so many of your mornings with me. Christopher Guith of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce s Global Energy Institute correctly named North Carolina as the state that has supplied the most Christmas trees for the White House Blue Room over the years: 13. Now, for the last trivia question of 2018: Who was the last speaker that was younger than Paul Ryan? Send your tips, energy gossip and comments to ktamborrino@politico.com, or follow us on Twitter @kelseytam, @Morning_Energy and @POLITICOPro.  HOLIDAY PRESENTS FROM ME: You better watch out, you better not cry, ME s handing out gifts and we hope these jokes fly.   For Ryan Zinke, a new sled. He ll have plenty of time to hit the toboggan run at Great Northern Veterans Peace Park when he returns to Whitefish, Mont.   For Andrew Wheeler, a supply of Ritz-Carlton lotion to combat the dry air in the EPA administrator s office.   For Rick Perry, an  I visited all 17 National Labs and all I got was this T-shirt  shirt.   For President Donald Trump, a golden rake to prevent forest fires.   For Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Fireside Chat podcast to tell Americans about the Green New Deal.   For Cheryl LaFleur: [Joke not approved due to lack of quorum.]   For Rep. Elijah Cummings, Scott Pruitt s phone number so he can call him back to the Hill.   For Rep. Frank Pallone, a new climate committee, one that doesn t involve taking E&C s jurisdiction.   For Ra˙l Grijalva, a cookbook of patty melt recipes.   For Joe Manchin, a tightrope to practice walking a fine line as ranking Democrat on the Energy committee. THE STORY OF RYAN ZINKE: The Interior secretary s problems that led to his downfall stemmed from the same issues that also damaged several members of Trump s Cabinet: Like Pruitt and HHS Secretary Tom Price before him, Zinke was a relatively low-profile politician who lacked preparation for the close scrutiny he encountered as a senior administration official. A POLITICO review of Zinke s rapid rise from Montana politics to the Cabinet showed a confident ex-Navy SEAL with charm and ambition who enjoyed flouting the rules   a trait that drew little attention under Montana s largely self-regulating ethics laws, but triggered a swath of investigations in Washington, POLITICO s Ben Lefebvre and Nick Juliano report in this deep dive into Zinke s time before and after heading the department.  And check out a video on Zinke s nearly two years atop Interior.   DOCUMENT DUMP: Zinke may be closing out his time at the department, but his move a year ago to promise to omit Florida from Interior s offshore drilling plan has hit renewed scrutiny. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Thursday that Interior has begun turning over documents related to its decision to exempt the Sunshine State, Pro s Danielle Muoio reports. New Jersey is one of the many states that decried Florida s lone exemption, arguing that an oil spill in state waters would hurt the state s $44 billion coastal tourism industry.  If you have actual evidence that justifies treating Florida differently than New Jersey, then turn it over,  Grewal said at a Thursday press conference.  But if you don t, then exempt New Jersey from offshore drilling as well.  Pro s Zack Colman reported earlier this week that the Trump administration is preparing to unveil its five-year drilling plan in January. SHUTDOWN INCHES CLOSER: The House passed a new stopgap spending bill Thursday evening, this time containing $5.7 billion for border security and about $8 billion in disaster aid. The bill s passage comes as the president made clear Thursday he wouldn t sign any spending bill without border wall funding   increasing the likelihood of a partial government shutdown come midnight. If the Senate rejects the House s funding proposal, which is likely, Democratic leaders say their next step is to urge House leaders to call up the Senate-passed measure, Pro s Jennifer Scholtes reports. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to put the amended House measure, H.R. 695 (115), to a vote today, before government funding runs out.  What to expect: If the government does partially shut down, agencies including EPA and Interior would be affected, while the Energy Department and Army Corps of Engineers wouldn t have to worry. (Congress passed their fiscal 2019 funding levels in September as part of a minibus package.) In preparation, EPA released a contingency plan laying out how the agency will evaluate more than 800 Superfund sites to decide how to proceed in the case of a shutdown, as Pro s Caitlin Emma reports. And in an email set out to staff late Thursday afternoon, Wheeler also said EPA has  sufficient carryover funds  and will remain open the week of Dec. 24 even if the stop-gap measure in Congress goes nowhere, Pro s Eric Wolff reports. Under the umbrella of the Interior Department, National Park Service sites and wildlife refuges would remain open. But services provided by NPS would likely stop.

Mike Lee did not gain any friends Wednesday night when he objected to a public lands package that included permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, fellow Utah lawmaker Rob Bishop told reporters.  There s quite a few people in Utah talking to him today,  Bishop said, though he declined to identify any of them.  A CLIMATE COMMITTEE CHAIR? Rep. Kathy Castor confirmed to ME that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has approached her about leading a select committee dedicated to addressing climate change, as POLITICO reported earlier this month.  We re talking about it,  she said.  It s not official.  The appointment of Castor would place an Energy and Commerce Committee veteran in charge of the panel that advocates want to craft bold Green New Deal legislation. Rep. Jim McGovern, incoming Rules Committee Chairman, said the panel remains a   work in progress.  Pelosi s office did not respond to a request for comment.  7 WORRIED MEN: A group of seven House Republicans   most of whom are departing Congress   wrote to Zinke on Thursday urging him against rushing to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development, Pro s Anthony Adragna reports. The letter follows a BLM announcement that it would issue a draft environmental impact statement next week.  TO THE PRESIDENT: The House approved a bill, S. 2200 (115), Thursday to reauthorize the National Drought Information System program, which tracks drought across the country, as well as a spate of other weather monitoring programs, Annie reports.

TOP NEWS: Mattis breaks with Trump in his resignation letter   Trump reported to order withdrawal of some 7,000 troops from Afghanistan  ON POLITICO: Making sense of Trump s announced Syria withdrawal  MATTIS BREAKS WITH TRUMP IN RESIGNATION LETTER:  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned on Thursday while delivering a stunning rebuke to President Donald Trump, expressing differences on issues including the president s treatment of U.S. allies and the need for a  resolute  approach to Russia,  write POLITICO s Bryan Bender and Connor O Brien.   Because you have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,  Mattis told Trump in his resignation letter.   The full text of Mattis  resignation letter, released by the Pentagon, is here.  Mattis  resignation, effective Feb. 28, reportedly resulted from Trump s Syria and Afghanistan decisions. The Defense secretary made a final attempt on Thursday afternoon to convince Trump to keep American troops in Syria, where they have been fighting the Islamic State, but was rebuffed, reports The New York Times.  And Mattis had to go, as he could no longer serve a president who no longer thinks he needs to listen to anybody, adds Blake Hounshell for POLITICO Magazine.  WHO MIGHT REPLACE MATTIS:  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis  resignation amid deep policy disagreements with President Donald Trump raises the question of who might replace him   and perhaps more importantly, who would want the job,  write Connor and David Brown.  Mattis was one of the few Trump administration officials to still enjoy bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, and lawmakers and allies abroad saw him as a steadying presence in a chaotic administration. It s unclear if his replacement will enjoy that same support in Congress and around the world.   Connor and David run down potential replacements here.  HOW MATTIS TRIED TO CONTAIN TRUMP:  For two years, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis slow-walked and stymied President Donald Trump s most dramatic impulses on military policy,  writes our colleague Wesley Morgan.  The retired four-star general took advantage of Trump s early high regard by expanding the defense budget and pushing more authority down to military commanders in the field...  But in the end, their differences proved too stark to overcome.   LAWMAKERS ALARMED: Congressional Democrats expressed alarm at Mattis  resignation, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York pointing to seeming  chaos  in the Trump administration.  Secretary Mattis was one of the few symbols, the few items of strength and stability in this administration,  Schumer said.  There is chaos now in this administration. This week was one of the most chaotic weeks we ve ever seen in American government.   It s worrisome that he has decided to leave and that Trump seems to have decided to ignore all of his well-informed advisers and just sort of make seat-of-the-pants decisions,  House Armed Services ranking Democrat Adam Smith of Washington state told Morning D.  And it is very troubling for the future of our national security.  Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he s  distressed  by Mattis  resignation.  I am particularly distressed that he is resigning due to sharp differences with the president,  the Kentucky Republican said in a statement.  It is regrettable that the president must now choose a new secretary of Defense.

U.S. REPORTED TO WITHDRAW ABOUT 7,000 TROOPS:  The Trump administration has ordered the military to start withdrawing roughly 7,000 troops from Afghanistan in the coming months, two defense officials said Thursday, an abrupt shift in the 17-year-old war there and a decision that stunned Afghan officials, who said they had not been briefed on the plans,  reports the NYT.  President Trump made the decision to pull the troops   about half the number the United States has in Afghanistan now   at the same time he decided to pull American forces out of Syria, one official said.   Recent Taliban talks covered the fate of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, a U.S. envoy says, via the NYT.  The move will likely undercut leverage the U.S. had with the Taliban in peace negotiations, writes The Washington Post.  And with Mattis out, Blackwater is back. Is the war in Afghanistan about to be privatized? asks Military Times. MAKING SENSE OF TRUMP S ANNOUNCED SYRIA WITHDRAWAL:  President Donald Trump s abrupt announcement that  we have defeated ISIS  in Syria and U.S troops are  all coming back and they re coming back now  raises a series of unanswered questions,  write your Morning D correspondent and Connor.  How will the pullout be implemented and over what time frame? What s the role of Congress? How will it impact the regional cauldron stirred up by Syria s seven-year civil war?   Here s a primer on Trump s decision, which has drawn bipartisan criticism and was reportedly opposed by many of Trump s own national security team.   Also in Syria, Kurdish fighters discuss releasing almost 3,200 ISIS prisoners, reports the NYT.  Trump s decision on Syria is emboldening opponents, writes The Washington Post.  And it s alarming U.S. allies, via the NYT.  Russia s President Vladimir Putin, however, says Trump s move is  the right decision,  via POLITICO s Caitlin Oprysko. HOUSE AND SENATE ON A COLLISION COURSE AS A SHUTDOWN LOOMS:  House Republicans passed a stop-gap spending bill that delivers $5 billion for President Donald Trump s border wall, setting up a standoff with the Senate that significantly raises the likelihood of a government shutdown this weekend,  report POLITICO s Sarah Ferris and John Bresnahan.  House Republicans believe their bill is a starting point for negotiations with the Senate, which unanimously passed a clean funding bill on Wednesday night and quickly left town.   SCHUMER S PLAN B:  If the Senate rejects the funding proposal House Republicans are pushing, Democratic leaders say their main plan is to simply urge House leaders to call up the Senate-passed measure,  via our colleague Jennifer Scholtes.  For his part, Trump told Republican congressional leaders Thursday  I m okay with a shutdown,  via POLITICO s Rachael Bade.  And if there is a shutdown at midnight tonight, the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, as well as much of the rest of the federal government, are fully funded through the end of this fiscal year on Sept. 30. GRAHAM AND CRUZ EXPECTED TO LEAVE SASC NEXT YEAR:  Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas will likely leave the Senate Armed Services Committee next month, according to two Senate aides,  reports Connor.  Their exit, to coincide with an influx of freshman Republicans and new Democrats, could spell another shakeup for the influential committee when the new Congress is seated in January.  PUTIN ISSUES OMINOUS WARNING ON NUCLEAR WAR THREAT:  The world is facing a rising threat of a nuclear war because of the U.S. pullout from arms control treaties and its destabilizing military plans, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday,  via The Associated Press.  Speaking at his annual news conference, Putin warned that  it could lead to the destruction of civilization as a whole and maybe even our planet.    Also Thursday, Putin said he ll respect a Russian-Ukrainian accord governing the joint use of the Azov Sea, via Reuters.  Putin tackled even more issues in his marathon Q&A session, adds Defense News. NEW SPACE FORCE TO RESIDE UNDER DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE:  After months of deliberating how to stand up a Space Force, a sixth branch of the military proposed by President Donald Trump, Pentagon leaders have decided to funnel the new organization under the Department of the Air Force,  reports Defense News. ARMY POISED TO CHOOSE ENGINE FOR FUTURE VERTICAL LIFT:  As we look to 2019, a handful of programs will see some overdue movement in the first part of the year.

HE S GOT LEVERAGE: Remember how President Donald Trump was said to be all on board with working with Democrats on an infrastructure package? Not so fast... after failing to secure border wall funding in a year-end spending deal, he tweeted:  The Democrats, who know Steel Slats (Wall) are necessary for Border Security, are putting politics over Country. What they are just beginning to realize is that I will not sign any of their legislation, including infrastructure, unless it has perfect Border Security. U.S.A. WINS!   Not off to a good start: There s been nonstop talk about infrastructure being a priority for bipartisan cooperation next year. But leaders in both parties have each given ultimatums on what to include in infrastructure legislation that are essentially poisonous to the other side. In addition to Trump s wall/slats, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said Senate Democrats won t support a bill that doesn t address climate change. For both sides, the ultimatums might just be negotiating or messaging positions and could crumble if passing a real bill looks possible. But for now, it s hard to imagine them being farther apart.  Gateway trade shot down: PBS Newshour s Lisa Desjardins reported Thursday that a key group of House Republicans want to trade the border wall for funding for the Gateway project, a top priority for senior Democrats including Schumer. But Democrats scoffed at the idea:  Schumer rejected this the first time the president offered it and would reject it again. How many times do we need to say this?  said Schumer spokesperson Justin Goodman. In case that wasn t firm enough, here s another Schumer staffer:  Let me re re re re re re confirm   not happening.

As our Tanya Snyder writes, he ll be remembered for rescuing the water resources bill, which had languished for years, and for waging an ultimately unsuccessful battle to split up the FAA. Colleagues praised his legislative savvy, his deal-making chops and his bipartisan comity. Even when he and ranking member Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) battled over air traffic control, they remained friends. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) says Shuster is  one of the best legislators that I ve seen.  MT and everybody at Team Transpo wishes him well in his next adventure.  MERRY... SHUTDOWN? In case you missed it, spending talks broke down again Thursday, and it looks like the on-again, off-again shutdown might really be happening. TSA screeners and air traffic controllers are among the essential government personnel that would continue working, but without paychecks until the shutdown s over. DOT s plan for a shutdown is here. And here s DHS  shutdown guidance from March. NTSB CLASHES WITH COUNTY OVER LIMO PROBE: NTSB s investigation into the deadly New York limousine crash that killed 20 people on a birthday outing is not going smoothly. The federal agency says local authorities  lack of communication and failure to fulfill promises is impeding the investigation and has already resulted in  safety-critical evidence being lost.  Your host reports that NTSB wrote a sharply worded letter to the Schoharie County District Attorney last week urging cooperation. DA Susan Mallery told a local TV station that the limo hasn t been released for inspection because it s part of an ongoing criminal investigation, and that it is  absolutely not  the case that evidence has been lost. DRONES  AIRPORT MAYHEM: Two rogue drones caused chaos at London s Gatwick Airport, delaying or canceling flights for tens of thousands of holiday travelers and counting, with disruptions expected to continue into today. As of Thursday evening London time, police and military specialists were still searching for the drone operators and the airport said it would not reopen until officials are sure the drones are gone. POLITICO Europe s Saim Saeed reports it s illegal in the U.K. to fly drones within 1 kilometer of an airport or above 120 meters. Experts say the incident is a preview of what s to come as drones become more pervasive, and our Brianna Gurciullo and Stephanie Beasley write that the incident could put pressure on policymakers to accelerate regulations related to threats from drones.  Speaking of drone regulation: Back on this side of the pond, OMB is done reviewing a long-awaited proposed rule on drone flights over the people, clearing the way for the rule to be issued imminently. Currently, operators need a waiver from FAA to fly their devices over people. Keep an eye on the Federal Register for this one, along with a separate advanced notice of proposed rulemaking on  safe and secure  flights by small drones.  U.S.-GULF CARRIER DRAMA IS BACK: DeFazio, the incoming House Transportation chairman, accused Qatar Airways of trying to  take over international aviation  and subsidizing Air Italy, which is beginning flights to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago in 2019. Qatar Airways holds a nearly 50 percent stake in the Italian airline. DeFazio told the Financial Times he had heard that Qatar Airways  gifted  50 airplanes to Air Italy, but the Italian carrier told FT that the planes were leased. Meanwhile, Delta CEO Ed Bastian asserts in an op-ed today that Qatar is flouting a deal it made with the U.S. government earlier this year. (The CEO of Qatar Airways has denied that.) BYD RESPONDS: BYD Motors, a California-based bus manufacturer that s the subsidiary of a Chinese company and has been wrapped up in a government spending battle over FTA funding, shot back at a competitor with a letter to appropriators last week, obtained by POLITICO. Several organizations, including manufacturer New Flyer, had written to Congress in support of a spending bill provision that prohibits FTA from funding the purchase of trains and buses from Chinese-state backed manufacturers. BYD, which has the support of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, says the proposed ban threatens competition, and that the copmany isn t state-owned or controlled. BYD also specifically took umbrage with a point in New Flyer s letter: that the fact that some rolling stock contains GPS systems, cameras and other sensors means BYD s products contain cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  This is baseless and shameful innuendo,  BYD President Stella Li wrote. Lyft announced Thursday that John Maddox, a former DOT official and founder of the American Center for Mobility, will join the company as senior director for autonomous safety and compliance.

PROGRAMMING NOTE: Morning Education will not publish from Dec. 24-Jan. 1. Our next Morning Education newsletter will publish on Jan. 2.  Story Continued Below BACKLOG OF STUDENT FRAUD CLAIMS GROWS: The Education Department received nearly 35,000 new student loan fraud claims between the end of June and end of September, according to newly released federal data. The Trump administration didn t adjudicate any of those  borrower defense to repayment  claims during that time period, the data show. That pushed the overall backlog of unresolved applications for loan forgiveness to more than 139,000 claims.    The department said in a notice on Thursday it had not approved or denied any more claims because of  ongoing litigation.  A federal judge in California has blocked Education Secretary Betsy DeVos from carrying out her policy of providing partial loan forgiveness to some students defrauded by Corinthian Colleges. But the judge s order, which the Trump administration is appealing, applies only to former Corinthian students seeking loan forgiveness.    Senate Democrats on Thursday urged DeVos to take action on the tens of thousands of outstanding claims by students who attended ITT Tech, which closed in 2016.  Enough is enough,  they wrote in a letter, led by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).  It s time for ITT students to receive the federal student loan relief to which they are entitled.   NEW PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS NUMBERS: The Education Department on Thursday also released updated statistics on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. As of Sept. 30, only 206 borrowers have had their loans, totaling $12.3 million, discharged under the program. More than 32,000 borrowers had their applications denied  due to not meeting program requirements  and another 11,892 were denied for  missing information.  See the full data here.

HOUSE PASSES SPENDING STOPGAP BILL WITH EDUCATION DISASTER AID: House Republicans passed a stopgap spending bill on Thursday evening that includes more than $5 billion for President Donald Trump s border wall amid a standoff with the Senate that s threatening to partially shut down parts of the government starting tonight at midnight.    House leaders also attached an $8 billion disaster aid package that wasn t part of the short-term funding measure the Senate passed on Wednesday. The House-passed disaster aid includes $50 million in education recovery funds for schools or colleges affected by Hurricanes Florence and Michael as well as wildfires and earthquakes in 2018. Read the bill, H.R. 695 (115), here.    Most federal education funding, including the Education Department, is unaffected by the looming partial government shutdown. Congress has passed and Trump has signed a full-year appropriations bill, H.R. 6157 (115), that funds the department through next September. CALIFORNIA REGULATORS REJECT ASHFORD UNIVERSITY, AGAIN: California state regulators have again rejected an effort by Ashford University, a large for-profit college, to obtain approval for GI Bill education benefits. The California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education said it wouldn t approve the college because of  pending lawsuits related to Ashford s advertising practices,  according to a Dec. 14 letter obtained by POLITICO this week under an open records request.   The decision is the latest in a long-running dispute over Ashford s access to veterans education benefits. The Department of Veterans Affairs last year moved to stop GI Bill funding to Ashford, arguing its approval by Arizona state regulators was improper because the school s main campus isn t located there.    The Trump administration put that decision on hold after Ashford challenged the VA in court. The school re-applied for California s approval in November as part of its ongoing negotiations with the VA. But California, for a second time this year, said it couldn t approve the school, which is being sued by the state s attorney general over allegations of misleading students.    Ashford, which is owned by Bridgepoint Education, is the 13th largest recipient of GI Bill funds, enrolling more than 4,000 veterans, according to VA data. The company earlier this year announced plans to spin off Ashford as a nonprofit school and focus on its online program management business.  VA SAYS IT  WILL ASSIST  VETERANS AFFECTED BY MAJOR FOR-PROFIT COLLEGE COLLAPSE: The Trump administration on Thursday vowed it  will assist  student veterans whose education will be interrupted by the collapse of Education Corporation of America, which operated several dozen campuses across the country under brands such as Brightwood Career Institute and Virginia College.     VA is in the process of identifying GI Bill beneficiaries currently enrolled at ECA and informing them of follow-on options,  the agency said in a statement.   Senate Democrats on Thursday wrote in a letter to the VA that the agency should make sure  that student veterans affected by school closures receive accurate information about their options, including transfer opportunities that must not put students at further risk of harm.  Read the letter, led by Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), here. LAWYER THREATENS TO  SUE EVERY UNIVERSITY  THAT FAILS TO GUARD AGAINST ONLINE HARASSMENT: The attorney who represented Christine Blasey Ford on Thursday threatened to sue every university that  does not heed the call  of a federal appeals court ruling this week that said schools must protect against online harassment.   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit issued an opinion Wednesday saying that under Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination, the University of Mary Washington  was obliged to investigate and seek to identify  students who threatened members of a campus feminist group on the now-defunct online messaging system Yik Yak.

IN THE HOPPER: President Donald Trump s farm bill signing ceremony was overshadowed by his own threat to veto a spending bill that would keep the Agriculture Department, FDA and many other agencies open for business after today.    With a shutdown looming tonight, the House and Senate are on a collision course. The House passed its own continuing resolution Thursday night that included $5 billion for Trump s border wall, a proposal with virtually no shot in the Senate.    Food makers and ag groups are split over whether highly refined ingredients should be subject to USDA s new GMO labeling rules unveiled Thursday. Biotech startups are developing genetically modified cannabis, but the sector s regulatory vacuum poses risks.  TRUMP BLOWS UP PLAN TO AVERT SHUTDOWN: Congress was seemingly on a glide-path to extend appropriations through Feb. 8 until Trump declared Thursday he wouldn t sign off on the Senate-passed CR, H.R. 695 (115), which didn t include additional funds for his proposed border wall.  House Republican leaders quickly cobbled together their own CR with an extra $5.7 billion for the wall (along with $8 billion in disaster aid for Southern and Western states decimated by hurricanes and wildfires), and the House passed the stopgap measure 217-185 by dinnertime Thursday.  Who s gonna blink? The House measure is widely expected to be shot down in the Senate, but Trump said he s serious this time about not signing a bill that doesn t include wall funding.     I ve made my position very clear,  Trump said at the farm bill signing ceremony.  Any measure that funds the government has to include border security. Has to.     Democrats had fighting words, too.  The Trump temper tantrum will shut down the government, but it will not get him his wall,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. Pro Budget & Appropriations  Jennifer Scholtes has more here.  What happens to food and ag programs if there s a shutdown? Most agencies would keep at least a skeleton crew of employees working to handle critical functions, while non-essential programs are ground to a halt. During the 16-day shutdown in 2013,  about 85 percent of USDA employees were furloughed.    That number would be far lower this time: An updated breakdown of USDA activities and employment during a funding lapse shows 60 percent of employees would remain active, depending on how long a shutdown lasts.    Trade relief programs would likely halt, just days after USDA announced its second wave of direct payments to commodity producers. So far, only $2.38 billion has been distributed to farmers out of a total $9.6 billion now available, a USDA spokesperson told MA.    Essential activities (or those with mandatory funding) would continue, like food safety inspections, monitoring imports for pests and diseases, wildfire suppression and nutrition safety net programs.  See for yourself: Here s some agency-specific shutdown guidance. (Some of the documents are up to date, others are leftover from earlier this year.) And watch for fresh guidance from USDA or OMB as the midnight deadline gets closer.  HAPPY FRIDAY, DEC. 21! Welcome to Morning Ag, for the last time in 2018!

TRUMP SIGNS FARM BILL, TOUTS SNAP RULE: Despite the GOP s high-profile defeat on adding stricter Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program work requirements to the farm bill, Trump claimed victory on food stamps as he signed it into law Thursday at a White House ceremony (which doubled as a birthday bash for Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, 72, who sported his  lucky tractor tie ).  The president had firmly backed House Republicans in their push for major SNAP changes that CBO estimates would have dropped about 1.5 million recipients from the program. Before he grabbed his pen Thursday, he papered over the legislative setback by hailing the proposed rule USDA released hours earlier, which aims to more strictly enforce existing work requirements under the program, writes Pro Ag s Helena Bottemiller Evich. Trump celebrated the $867 billion legislation, H.R. 2 (115), as  a really tremendous victory  for farmers and ranchers, a pillar of his political base and a segment of the country dealing with growing economic challenges.  Perdue thanked USDA staff for aiding the House and Senate Ag committees with  over 2,000 issues of technical assistance  while the bill was being developed. Referring to lawmakers, he said:  We re going to do our best to implement that bill as you ve intended.   GMO LABELING RULE IS OUT: USDA unveiled its long-awaited GMO labeling rule Thursday morning amid the flurry of news. Food companies and agriculture groups alike praised the agency for delivering on guidelines that create a uniform national standard mandating the disclosure of genetically modified ingredients in food.  Per the final rule, companies can disclose the presence of GMOs via a designated symbol (USDA chose a field), or include a QR code, or use the term  bioengineered,  which USDA says aligns more closely to what the law dictates than  genetically modified organism.  January 2022 is the final compliance date.  Food companies and agriculture groups are split over one key provision: A loophole that exempts highly refined ingredients such as corn syrup and vegetable oil, our Liz Crampton reports. Some businesses (like Nestle and Mars) and consumer groups warn that buyers will remain in the dark about what s in their food, in part because the regulation would exempt a wide range of products.    Companies can choose to disclose GMOs under the highly refined category, but they re given wide leeway. One brand s bottle of canola oil might display a  bioengineered  label while the same product from another company sitting on the same store shelf might not.    Farm groups argue those products shouldn t require bioengineered labels because they don t contain detectable amounts of genetic material. Expect plenty of lawsuits against the rule to focus on that issue.  HIGH HOPES FOR BIOENGINEERED CANNABIS: Genetically modified marijuana could be hugely lucrative one day. Scientists are racing to sequence the cannabis genome, enabling producers to highlight desired traits, make the plant less dependent on pesticides or even develop new medical treatment options, Liz reports this a.m.  It s a risky businesses: There are few regulations guiding the budding sector, leaving plenty of uncertainty for growers and consumers alike. Modified marijuana is still in the R&D stage, but the products could jump from labs to farms within a few years.  Regulatory black hole: There s no framework for studying the safety risks of biotech cannabis for humans and other plants. Cannabis is still illegal at the federal level, so USDA and FDA can t regulate the products like other GE plants. Large agribusinesses like Bayer and Syngenta aren t active in the emerging space yet, leaving startups to dominate. That could change quickly: Tobacco giant Altria invested $1.8 billion this month in Canadian cannabis company Cronos Group.   Roberts contemplating retirement: Senate Ag Chairman Pat Roberts, 82, said he ll consider whether to seek a fifth Senate term in 2020 over the holiday break, POLITICO s James Arkin and Daniel Strauss report.    Grassley talks 2019 priorities: Incoming Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said Thursday that Trump needs to listen to congressional concerns about steel and aluminum tariffs if he wants to ease passage of the new North American trade deal, Pro Trade s Doug Palmer reports.    Getting ag into U.S.-EU trade talks: Grassley had a choice description for the EU s opposition on that front, and said he could move legislation to address the president s ability to levy tariffs for national security reasons under Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1962.    China s fourth major soy buy: China on Thursday purchased another 204,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans, bringing total sales there to at least 2.8 million metric tons this month. The underwhelming sales numbers since Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a trade truce in Argentina have led soybean prices to tumble, Reuters reports.    Scrambling to stave off water crisis: Arizona, California and Nevada have yet to finalize a water-sharing plan to prevent a future drought crisis for the arid Western states reliant on the Colorado River system, as turf battles abound. Pro Energy s Annie Snider has the latest from Las Vegas.    Depleted Kansas water source threatens ag: According to its agriculture department, the state s most important water source, the Ogallala Aquifer, is running dry. That leaves farmers with the difficult choice of scaling back water usage now or facing dire consequences in the future. The New Food Economy has the story.    Brazilian official accused of taking bribes from JBS: Federal police raided the home of Science and Technology Minister Gilberto Kassab over allegations he received up to $13.8 million in bribes from one of the world s largest meatpacking companies, AP reports.    Ag conglomerate behind Halos to pay workers $15 an hour: Wonderful Co., producer of popular brands of mandarin oranges and pistachios, will raise its minimum wage for full-time workers on Jan. 1, the same day the minimum wage for agricultural workers in California rises to $12, The L.A. Times reports. Large operations like Wonderful won t be required to go to $15 until 2022.    Florida citrus production on the rebound: After Hurricane Irma soured production in 2017, Florida oranges are finally making a comeback, though growers are still struggling with citrus greening disease.

QUICK FIX: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis stresses the need to treat allies with respect in a resignation that could mean the end of a moderating voice against President Donald Trump s desire to impose tariffs for national security reasons.   Incoming Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley makes clear that checking Trump s tariff authority is a possible item on his 2019 agenda.   Domestic aluminum producers say it would be a  red herring  for the U.S. International Trade Commission to consider the impact of aluminum tariffs in its economic impact study of the revised NAFTA deal.  MATTIS DEPARTURE LEAVES SPACE FOR MORE 232 TARIFFS: The resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced Thursday could mark a turning point in an effort by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on imports of automobiles and auto parts for national security reasons. Mattis offered lukewarm support for similar tariffs on steel and aluminum, pushing back against global tariffs in favor of targeted penalties on certain countries. Those tariffs ultimately went forward, but his departure means that opponents of the same action on autos could lose a key moderating voice. In his resignation letter, the former Marine general said he would step down at the end of February. That could give him some more time to weigh in on a report examining the national security risks of auto imports that is due to be published the same month. But Trump has 90 days after that point to decide on a specific course of action.  R-E-S-P-E-C-T: In his letter, Mattis provided a possible clue about what he thought of the whole process as he stressed the necessity of maintaining strong alliances. Trump s steel and aluminum tariffs and the threat of new penalties on autos have strained ties with Canada, Japan, the European Union and other close allies.  My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,  he wrote, adding that Trump has the right to have a Defense secretary whose views are better aligned with his own.

Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host wants to thank our readers for staying with us through all the twists and turns of trade policy in 2018. Believe it or not, we expect next year to be even more exciting on the trade front. Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and see you in 2019! But we ll still gladly take any holiday trade tips between now and then: abehsudi@politico.com or @abehsudi.  GRASSLEY TAKES A STAND: Grassley said he will consider legislation to restrict the president s power to impose tariffs next year.  I intend to review the president s use of powers under Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1962, which grants the president broad legal authority to impose tariffs in the name of national security,  Grassley said in a speech on the Senate floor.  I m certainly not opposed to being creative in negotiations with other country. But I strongly disagree with the notion that imports of steel, and aluminum, automobiles and auto parts somehow could pose a national security threat as the president s actions have stated,  Grassley continued.  Tough talk on USMCA passage: Grassley also said Trump needs to listen closely to lawmakers  concerns about steel and aluminum tariffs if he wants to ease passage of his new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.  As long as 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico remain, the U.S. farmers and others facing retaliation, along with the American businesses that rely on those imports, will be unable to realize the full potential benefits of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement,  Grassley said. He also reminded Trump that the Constitution gives Congress authority to regulate trade with foreign countries.  We collectively, meaning the president and Congress, have a responsibility to ensure that U.S. farmers, ranchers and businesses face minimal uncertainty from the updating  of NAFTA, he said.  EU ag exclusion  ridiculous : The senior lawmaker also made clear he wasn t going to accept the European Union s decision to exclude agriculture from potential trade talks with the U.S. next year.  The notion that some people in the EU think there could be an agreement that doesn t address the many ways they block our good agricultural products from being sold in Europe is outright ridiculous,  Grassley said, adding that his top goal as incoming chairman is to work with the Trump administration to open new markets for U.S. goods. Doug has more here.  ALUMINUM PRODUCERS TO ITC: DON T INCLUDE 232 TARIFFS IN REPORT: The primary aluminum industry is urging the U.S. International Trade Commission not to include any effects of the Section 232 tariffs on the material in its report examining the broader economic effects of the USMCA. The American Primary Aluminum Association said in comments filed to the ITC late Thursday that including such effects   which it points out groups like the Beer Institute and Aluminum Association have called for   would be a  red herring,  given that the statute mandating an economic review does not give the commission authority to consider anything beyond the trade agreement.  Congress did not authorize the Commission to review issues ancillary to the USMCA for good reason: the purpose of the report is to inform Congress about the effects of the proposed agreement, not the effects of unrelated matters,  APAA wrote.  Us vs. them: Groups that oppose the steel and aluminum tariffs have urged the ITC to consider their effects when evaluating the new NAFTA because they feel they have been harmed by the penalties, at times more so than they will be benefited by the new agreement. But APAA argues that the tariffs are  having a positive effect on trade among the parties, and positive effects on the domestic economy.   DOJ TARGETS CHINA HACKING: The Justice Department made good on a promise to go after China by unveiling indictments on two Chinese hackers for a long-running economic espionage campaign that resulted in the theft of hundreds of gigabytes of data from companies and government agencies. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the theft benefited Beijing s Made in China 2025 program, which is also being targeted by the Trump administration s Section 301 tariff campaign. The Homeland Security and State departments also warned Beijing to  abide by its commitment to act responsibly in cyberspace  and said the U.S. would  take appropriate measures to defend our interests.   Not good enough: Some experts expressed disappointment that Thursday s actions didn t go further. The response didn t include any sanctions of Chinese companies, which could be a potentially sensitive move as the U.S. and China try to make peace on the trade front before a March 1 deadline. Pro Cybersecurity s Eric Geller has the full story here.  CHINA KEEPS UP THE SOYBEAN PURCHASES: The Agriculture Department on Thursday reported another significant transaction of soybean exports to China with sales of more than 204,000 metric tons. The purchase follows a transaction announced Wednesday that involved 1.2 million metric tons of exports of soybeans to China. Beijing has promised to buy more U.S. farm goods as part of a 90-day trade truce between the countries; it has now bought at least 2.8 million metric tons since Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a temporary cease-fire.  ROSS WELCOMES EU DATA PRIVACY SHIELD RENEWAL: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday praised an EU decision this week that he said will ensure hundreds of billions of dollars in transatlantic trade keeps flowing. EU authorities, in an annual review, concluded that the Privacy Shield framework reached in 2016 between the two trading partners still ensures an adequate level of data privacy protection under EU law. More than 4,200 U.S. organizations and their EU partners use the Privacy Shield program to transfer personal data from the European Union to the United States.  Data flows between the United States and Europe are the highest in the world, and it is in both our interests to adopt policies that strengthen data protection and enable transatlantic commerce,  Ross said. As part of its announcement on Wednesday, the European Commission called for the U.S. government to nominate a permanent official by early next year to oversee data protection complaints brought by EU authorities.   House Republicans passed a spending bill with funding for a border wall, setting up a likely scenario for a government shutdown, POLITICO reports.   The WTO s chief economist is worried that global trade trends point to an economic slowdown in 2019, Bloomberg reports.   Trump s tariff war with China is sending retailers on a buying binge, Reuters reports.   A move by Qatar Airlines to expand service in the U.S. through subsidiary Air Italy could hit turbulence in Congress, the Financial Times reports. THAT S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE! See you again soon!

Story Continued BelowThe House passed a spending bill Thursday night that includes $5 billion for President Donald Trump s border wall, setting up a clash with the Senate and raising the likelihood of a government shutdown.    DHS said it will require certain asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their claims are processed.    USDA said it will move to enforce more aggressively existing work requirements on food stamp recipients.    The Senate all but abandoned efforts to confirm a slate of labor nominees before this Congress ends.  GOOD MORNING! It s Friday Dec. 21, and this is your last Morning Shift of 2018.

SHUTDOWN BACK ON?: House Republicans pushed through a spending bill that includes $5 billion for Trump s wall,hours after the president said he d veto the Senate s  clean  continuing resolution.   House Republicans believe their bill is a starting point for negotiations with the Senate, which unanimously passed a clean funding bill on Wednesday night and quickly left town,  POLITICO s Sarah Ferris and John Bresnahan write.  But the House GOP proposal is D.O.A. in the Senate, where Democrats have vowed to reject any funding for the border wall. Government funding runs out at midnight Friday, meaning a partial government shutdown looks almost certain at this point.  A partial shutdown wouldn t affect the Labor Department, which has already had its funding approved, and nearly 90 percent of DHS employees are considered  exempt  and would continue to work in the event of a shutdown, according to the department s shutdown contingency plan. But most wouldn t receive a paycheck until Congress passed a spending bill. A notable exception would be USCIS, which is funded almost entirely by user fees and therefore can mostly continue operations with workers paid on time. Several agency programs would be suspended, including E-Verify. More here. MIGRANTS PUSHED BACK TO MEXICO:  The Trump administration will compel certain asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico during the course of their asylum hearings,  POLITICO s Ted Hesson reports. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced the new plan on Thursday morning shortly before appearing before a House Judiciary Committee oversight hearing. The Mexican Foreign Ministry said the country will allow migrants with pending cases to remain on a temporary basis and apply for work permits.  The move is almost certain to prompt litigation. In this week alone, federal judges dealt legal setbacks to Trump s asylum ban and to a separate policy that restricts domestic violence as grounds for asylum. An internal planning document for a  remain in Mexico  pilot obtained by POLITICO earlier this month showed administration officials discussed a range of legal and logistical pitfalls around the policy, including how migrants would have access to counsel on the Mexican side of the border. More here. TRUMP ADMIN CRACKS DOWN ON FOOD STAMPS: The Agriculture Department on Thursday released a rule to more strictly enforce work requirements under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, POLITICO s Helena Bottemiller Evich and Catherine Boudreau report.  Under current law, able-bodied adults without dependents may not receive food stamps for longer than three months over a three year period unless they re working or enrolled in an education and training program for at least 80 hours a month. States, however, can waive the time limit when unemployment is high or when there aren t enough jobs available. The proposed rule would tighten the waiver criteria. More here. NOMINATIONS DEAL FALLS APART: A deal to push through a slate of labor nominees appeared all but dead Thursday as lawmakers raced to avert a shutdown.  The obstacle is a standoff between Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah). Murray opposes fast-track confirmation of the labor nominees absent Chai Feldblum, a Democratic member of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission whose term expires at the end of the year, and Mark Gaston Pearce, a Democrat who served on the National Labor Relations Board until this past August. Lee has dug in his heels on Feldblum, calling her  an [LGBT] activist intent on stamping out all opposition to her cause.   Murray  will continue her stance in the next Congress,  an aide told POLITICO, signaling that talks had broken down. Asked whether Lee would budge, a Lee aide simply said:  No,  adding that the discussion would be  booted  to next session. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, told Bloomberg that some labor nominees could still get through in a last-minute deal, though a Democratic aide said it s unlikely. More from POLITICO s Ian Kullgren here.  GADE QUITS: Daniel Gade, a Republican EEOC nominee, told the National Law Journal on Thursday that he withdrew his name from consideration, citing the  political mess  in the confirmation process. (See previous item; Gade is among the nominees whose confirmation is blocked by the Murray-Lee standoff.)  I m willing to serve, but the process of being confirmed should not be so painful that it causes good people to run away,  Gade told the NLJ s Erin Mulvaney.  The EEOC is way too important to leave unfilled at the commissioner level. It s clear there isn t a path forward.  Gade said he offered the White House a resignation letter in November but was told it wasn t necessary. More here. GM: OHIO PLANT S FATE LIES WITH UAW: General Motors, in a written statement Thursday to Reuters, said that whether a Lordstown, Ohio, plant slated for closure next year can be rescued will depend on negotiations with the UAW. The statement came in response  to a Twitter exchange between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who asked Musk to buy the plant (Musk had hinted that he might in an interview on 60 Minutes this month).  Thanks, will consider next year,  Musk responded. More here. SBA BLASTS H-1B LOTTERY PROPOSAL: The Small Business Administration s advocacy office on Thursday ripped a proposed rule to rework the H-1B lottery registration process. In a letter addressed to USCIS Director Francis Cissna, the office urged the agency to postpone the introduction of the new process, which would allow employers to pre-register for the lottery electronically. The office said the new lottery would increase uncertainty and  may just add another layer of bureaucracy to the already complicated process.  (The SBA also noted the 30-day comment period for the proposed rule falls over the holiday season.)  6TH CIRCUIT: IRAQIS CAN BE DEPORTED: The 6th Circuit on Thursday sided with the Trump administration and ruled that a group of roughly 100 Iraqi nationals convicted of crimes can be deported, Mica Rosenberg and Dan Levine report in Reuters. In a split decision, a three-judge panel vacated a lower court ruling that had blocked the Iraqis from being removed. For years, Iraq did not accept Iraqi deportees, but its stance reversed after Trump took office. Read the opinion here. ROBB CRITICIZES JOINT EMPLOYER PROPOSAL: The NLRB s top attorney this week criticized the board s pending joint employer proposal as insufficiently pro-business, Bloomberg Law s Hassan Kanu and Robert Iafolla report.  The current proposal would categorize a company as a joint employer   and therefore liable for labor violations committed by franchisees and contractors   if it has  direct and immediate  control over workers.  Under Robb s recommendations,  Kanu and Iafolla write,  a company found to be a joint employer wouldn t have to bargain with a union unless it controls  all listed essential terms and conditions of employment.

The policy, once ratified, will require Times managers, when possible, to interview at least two candidates who are women or members of traditionally-underrepresented groups   including women, Black, Latino, Asian American, Native and LGBTQ journalists,  the union said in a statement.

IF THE ATTRIBUTION S RIGHT, YOU MUST INDICT   The Trump administration on Thursday blasted China for its campaign of economic espionage against Western businesses, indicting two of Beijing s operatives for hacking into more than 45 companies across a wide range of sectors in a dozen countries and accusing President Xi Jinping s regime of violating a 2015 agreement prohibiting intellectual property theft.  We strongly urge China to abide by its commitment to act responsibly in cyberspace and reiterate that the United States will take appropriate measures to defend our interests,  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said after DOJ indicted the two men in connection with a 12-year-long operation against firms in industries from aviation and telecommunications to energy and manufacturing.  While experts praised the White House for enlisting the support of U.S. allies like the United Kingdom, they also expressed frustration that Thursday s actions were so limited. Many pushed for sanctions on the Chinese firms that benefited from IP theft. Paul Triolo, an expert on China and global technology issues at the Eurasia Group, told POLITICO that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and others in the administration successfully argued against sanctions, citing the effect they would have on trade negotiations.  If Republican lawmakers were concerned about the modest nature of the hacking pushback, they didn t say so. Rep. Michael McCaul, the House Homeland Security chairman who will serve as the ranking member on Foreign Affairs next year, said Trump s moves sent  a clear and direct message that we will punch back when attacked.   The indictment of the two hackers associated with China s APT10 unit vindicated an August report by a mysterious group calling itself Intrusion Truth that unmasked the two men. Meanwhile, two sources familiar with the matter told MC that HP Enterprise was among the managed service providers that fell prey to the hackers, confirming news first reported by Reuters, which said IBM was also hacked. (HPE declined to comment, and IBM did not respond to a request for comment.) And the Chinese government s only response so far was a tweet from its state-run newspaper that tried to change the subject, accusing the NSA of having  invaded important targets of the global internet.

THE CYBER VOID LEFT BY MATTIS   In his resignation letter Thursday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the U.S. must be  resolute  against Russia, illustrating on his way out the harder line he took on Russian election interference and other Kremlin activities than President Donald Trump. As recently as this month, Mattis accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of trying to  muck around  in the U.S. midterm elections.  Mattis made changes on some top cyber issues: He has reconsidered dividing leadership of Cyber Command and the NSA. He has emphasized protecting critical infrastructure. He sought to foster relationships with Silicon Valley. He warned that the U.S. competitive edge in cyberspace was diminishing. And his department offered cyber offensive and defensive tools to NATO.  He s been active on cybersecurity elsewhere, too. In just the last month alone under Mattis, DoD formed a partnership with DHS to counter cyber threats. He established a task force to protect critical information and technology. The Pentagon implemented contract language requiring companies to elevate cyber protections. INNOVATIONS IN ELECTION INTERFERENCE, PART I   Where to start with this wild story out Thursday? Perhaps the headline:  Russian Agents Sought Secret US Treasury Records On Clinton Backers During 2016 Campaign.  And then next you go to the fact that the backchannel communications occurred over unsecure email accounts, according to BuzzFeed. And it s not as if people didn t try to alert Treasury authorities that this was ill-advised: Some analysts warned supervisors that the Russians were conducting  fishing expeditions  and that there might be viruses in emails from the Russian accounts. Read every word.  INNOVATIONS IN ELECTION INTERFERENCE, PART II   Democratic Sen. Doug Jones on Thursday called for a federal investigation into a disinformation campaign during his race last year, carried out by a group of Democratic tech experts who emulated influence tactics Russia used in the 2016 elections. The Washington Post and later The New York Times reported on the efforts this week. The group erected a Facebook page posing as conservatives and schemed to connect Republican Roy Moore s campaign to thousands of Russian accounts, according to the story. One of the people involved said the campaign was meant only as an experiment designed to have no substantial effect, apparently contradicting the group s stated goals in a written report.  THIRD TIME S THE CHARM   The U.S. Air Force recently wrapped up its third bug bounty competition, uncovering 120 security vulnerabilities. The month-long  Hack the Air Force 3.0  competition is the latest effort stemming from 2016 s high-profile  Hack the Pentagon  effort. The new Air Force challenge   administered by HackerOne and the Defense Digital Service   saw $130,000 paid to 191 hackers from around the globe. In all, the three Air Force bug bounty challenges have paid white hat hackers over $350,000 and fixed more than 430 unique vulnerabilities.  A RISK READ, BUT NOT A BRISK READ   The technical standards agency NIST has released an updated version of its Risk Management Framework that incorporates new sections on supply chain, privacy and systems engineering practices. Special Publication 800-73 Revision 2, published Thursday, also refreshes its guidance based on Trump s May 2017 cyber executive order and the latest Office of Management and Budget guidance on IT security. NIST singled out the creation of a new first step in the framework,  Prepare,  which guides organizations through the process of laying the groundwork for risk-based decision-making. The agency hailed the updated document as  the first NIST publication to address security and privacy risk management in an integrated, robust, and flexible methodology.   ENDING THE YEAR ON A HIGH NOTE   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made  significant progress  in updating its cybersecurity programs to address deficiency identified by the Government Accountability Office in June, a federal audit released Thursday concluded. The GAO reported that out of 184 security recommendations from June   such as insulating low-risk systems from high-risk systems, and improving the identification of those risks in the first place   the CDC had implemented just over 100 of them by the first week of August.  Although the GAO cites that  significant progress  in the title of its report, it finds that CDC needs to take further action to fully secure its systems. The announcement follows disappointing reports from earlier in the week regarding federal progress in cybersecurity. House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden praised the  open and collaborative approach  between the GAO and CDC in the attendant press release.  RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY   Federal authorities shut down 15 websites that aid distributed-denial-of-service attacks and charged three people for helping to operate them.   The United States is increasing pressure on Germany to ditch Chinese telecommunications company Huawei.

WITH INCUBATORS, HOSPITAL SYSTEMS TREAD ETHICAL BOUNDARIES: A growing number of health systems are putting their own money behind early-stage tech companies, hoping the products they fund will cut costs, help patients   and, in some cases, earn them money. Their managers say the programs are accelerating the arrival of helpful technology to hospitals, which no longer have to wait for the products to be commercialized. Working with startups directly means clinicians and administrators can customize the technology. In some cases, the deals might bring in a lot of cash to financially pinched health corporations. Early-stage companies benefit, meanwhile, from testing their technology on patients with limited investment and before deploying them widely. Health care systems have wide latitude to set up their venture funds, subject to limitations on the kinds of investments and partnerships for-profit and nonprofit organizations can legally form and what they must disclose, says The Wharton School s Mark Pauly. But critics warn of conflicts of interest: Investors of any kind have an incentive to help a company succeed even if its product is subpar. Recently, Memorial Sloan Kettering came under attack for an arrangement with a precision medicine company that potentially undercut the hospital s objectivity about its product, bioethicists said. Managers of the innovation programs argue that they help hospitals rapidly adopt cutting-edge technology that could benefit patients. And equity or licensing of successful technology could offset losses from taking care of patients, Pauly said. Many health care systems are  badly scrambling to find some other line of business, whether it s outpatient care, insurance ... or some kind of innovative technology.  Pros can read the rest of the story here.  IS FACEBOOK ACTIVITY A SOCIAL DETERMINANT?: Facebook s health care research head Freddy Abnousi co-authored a JAMA viewpoint arguing that the data found on social networks could be useful in addressing the social determinants of health. Abnousi was behind an effort to share patient data with hospitals and medical groups that wanted to build more detailed patient profiles, CNBC reported in April. The proposal was halted after news broke that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica got access to information about millions of Facebook users for the purpose of influencing their behavior. Still, Abnousi and co-authors are doubling down on social media data s value to health researchers. The way users of Facebook and other social media platforms interact with each other could help researchers  identify novel targets  that could  meaningfully influence health outcomes,  especially when combined with EHR data, write Abnousi, the American College of Cardiology, s John Rumsfeld, and Yale s Harlan Krumholz. The authors argue that patients  social network data might offer more important signals than social determinants of health like housing and income. They offer no evidence this is true, however.  eHealth Tweet of the day: Mahek A.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN LOOMING: Senate leaders are expected today to call up the stopgap funding bill the House passed Thursday, which includes $5 billion for President Donald Trump s border wall. A passage vote could happen quickly if they agree to a fast-tracked process, but if they don t, it could be delayed until the weekend. Funding expires at midnight, and there s no guarantee that Trump will sign the bill, even if Congress can clear it.   HHS is funded. But FDA is not. The Food & Drug Administration wasn t covered in emergency funding passed by Congress earlier this year. The agency might have to furlough as much as 40 percent of its staff. SENATE LIKELY TO CONFIRM TELEMEDICINE PROPONENT BRENDAN CARR:  A trio of senators is expected to drop their holds on Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr, POLITICO s John Hendel reports. As the tech team had reported, Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.), was protesting the FCC s decision to halt rural broadband subsidies from the $4.5 billion Mobility Fund; Sens. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) held up Carr s confirmation because they felt an Alaskan telecom company wasn t given adequate rural health subsidies. Carr has been leading an effort to establish a $100 million fund for telehealth and remote monitoring pilot projects, especially those targeting low income and rural Americans.  GRASSLEY NAMES HEALTH POLICY STAFF: Incoming Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley has announced his permanent health policy staff for the next Congress, a mix of personal aides and committee veterans expected to help the Iowa Republican pursue such priorities as hearings into drug pricing, Obamacare, health costs and government oversight, our colleague Dan Diamonds reports.   Grassley tapped Karen Summar, a physician who currently serves as health policy director in Grassley s personal office, as the committee s health policy director. Evelyn Fortier, chief counsel for justice programs on the Senate Judiciary Committee, will become Finance s general counsel for health policy and special projects director.   Four current Finance Committee staffers   deputy health policy director Erin Dempsey, senior adviser Brett Baker, human services policy adviser Ryan Martin and health policy adviser Stuart Portman -- will continue in their roles.  SYNTHETIC DATA MEDICAL RESEARCHERS CRAVE IT: And now the Regenstrief Institute is getting access to the stuff through a partnership with Israeli data company MDClone, whose approach will be applied to data from millions of Indiana patients that Regenstrief manages for health system partners.   The technology works like this: users run a query on a given data set that identifies a collection of individuals of interest. Then it organizes the data into groupings that are statistically similar across all variables of interest. The engine then uses the statistics to create a new data set of  fake  individuals with similar features to the originals. The synthetic dataset can be analyzed like any other, but it doesn t contain information from real people, so it protects privacy. 3M has agreed to buy M*Modal s technology business for about $1 billion. M*Modal sells speech recognition technology for transcribing clinicians  notes and was spun out of Carnegie Mellon University. 3M s health IT business sells software practices can use for clinical documentation or analyzing patient information. Cigna has closed its $67 billion merger with pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts. According to MarketWatch, specialty pharmaceuticals and mental health will be among the combined entities  priorities next year. Smithsonian Institution secretary David Skorton has been named the next president and CEO of the Association of American Medical Colleges. The cardiologist and former president of Cornell starts in his new role July 15. Stephen Katz, the director of NIH s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, died Thursday. He had led NIAMS since 1995, according to NIH, which tweeted a link to Katz s oral history.

It s the last issue of PULSE this year. Let s get to it.  SHUTDOWN LOOMING   As of PULSE press time, Senate leaders were planning to call up the revamped funding bill passed by the House on Thursday   a package that controversially includes $5 billion for President Donald Trump s border wall. The chamber gavels in at noon, and a vote could happen quickly if all 100 senators agree to a fast-tracked process. But if not, the passage vote could be delayed until later in the day or even until the weekend, POLITICO s Jennifer Scholtes notes. More.    Watching the clock: Government funding expires at midnight, and a shutdown is seeming increasingly likely.    HHS is funded. But FDA is not. The Food & Drug Administration wasn t covered in emergency funding passed by Congress earlier this year. The agency might have to furlough as much as 40 percent of its staff. Under a contingency plan, FDA would prioritize emergency response, like addressing food outbreaks, while slowing down its usual regulatory oversight and inspections.  COMING SOON: MICHIGAN s WORK REQUIREMENTS   CMS is expected to approve the state s work requirement waiver as soon as today, according to three people with knowledge of Michigan s request, POLITICO s Rachana Pradhan and Dan Diamond scoop.   The timing is notable: GOP Gov. Rick Snyder is leaving office in ten days, to be replaced by Democrat Gov.-elect Gretchen Whitmer, who opposes the requirements. CMS s looming approval is expected to complicate any future attempt by Whitmer to unwind the work requirements. Whitmer already faced a hurdle because Michigan s GOP-led legislature mandated the requirements this summer. There s also additional time pressure to get this done: Michigan s current Medicaid expansion waiver expires on Dec. 31.    Patient advocates and researchers have expressed concern that the requirements are too onerous and confusing, citing a nonpartisan analysis that as many as 54,000 current Medicaid enrollees may lose coverage.  The proposal would do nothing to boost employment in the state  [and] harm those who are working,  the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, Georgetown s Center for Children and Families and other groups wrote to HHS Secretary Alex Azar in October. Read letter.   Michigan would be the sixth state to get approval for work requirements under CMS Administrator Seema Verma, who in Nov. 2017 announced that the agency was accepting  community engagement  waiver requests. Verma s effectiveness at speeding those waivers through   despite legal challenges in Kentucky and Arkansas   has won her support from state GOP leaders, even as patient groups charge the policy puts vulnerable people at risk.  NEXT-GENERATION ACO RESULTS ARE IMMINENT   CMS on Thursday told program participants that 2017 financial and quality results would be announced today. The Obama-era care coordination program was designed to reward providers for taking on financial risk. Friday before the holidays isn t exactly primetime to tout the results   which may not be a coincidence, given that the Trump administration is prepping a replacement for the next gen program.  THANK GOODNESS IT S FRIDAY PULSE   Where your author appreciated writing this newsletter across 2018 for many reasons. One bonus of the gig: He got to read so much great health care journalism, every day. Among the stories that jumped out: The troubling reports from the border on how migrant children were being separated from parents and placed in HHS custody. Atul Gawande s New Yorker story on why doctors hate their computers, which was among that publication s most read articles. A Reveal News investigation into how disabled patients were essentially turned into one woman s personal servants. Probes into doctors in Texas and New York, which shook up multiple hospitals and shared a common thread   ProPublica s Charlie Ornstein. And PULSE s own colleagues  investigation into the CDC director s stock trades, which led to her resignation. PULSE will return in 2019. Got work or life updates that we need to know? Annual reflections of your own? Send them to ddiamond@politico.com. ** A message from PhRMA: There are wrong and right prescriptions for changing Medicare. Seniors need Washington to focus on the right ones. Cutting costs for everyone except seniors and limiting access to lifesaving medicines are the wrong prescription for Medicare. Making changes that help seniors pay less out-of-pocket are the right prescription for Medicare. **CHECKING IN WITH  PULSE CHECK    Use the holiday break to catch up on our health care podcast, including two episodes from this week:    Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh on his lawsuit to preserve the Affordable Care Act. Listen here.    U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams on his e-cigarette warnings and public health priorities. Listen here.

Last-ditch health bills reach Senate. The chamber may vote today on an eleventh-hour effort to overhaul over-the-counter drug reform and reauthorize HHS s pandemic preparedness authorities, known as PAHPA.   The two seemingly unrelated measures were tied together in the House on Thursday as H.R. 6378 (115), led by Reps. Susan Brooks and Anna Eshoo   an effort to overcome Senate Republican infighting that stalled both bills despite House passage, POLITICO s Sarah Owermohle reports. The new legislation is a so-called four corners agreement, according to a Brooks staffer, meaning it addressed lingering differences in the old House and Senate versions. But it could still face an uphill battle today amid the frenzy over a possible shutdown. Still, organizations are already applauding the House for passing the legislation   again. PAHPA is critical to spurring innovations in medical countermeasures, said biotech trade group BIO. And OTC reform will bring a tangible benefit to Americans, said Elizabeth Jungman, Pew Trusts  director of public health programs. More for Pros. Verma takes another public shot at Obamacare.  The ACA doesn t do a good job of protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions,  the CMS administrator wrote on Twitter, responding to Kaiser Family Foundation s Larry Levitt s discussion of ACA legal challenges.  A family of four is paying $1,500 a month. What good are protections if you can t afford coverage?     It s Verma s latest swipe at a program that she oversees, following her other criticism of the ACA and anti-Medicare for All tweets this fall. Some fellow Trump appointees hailed it as a sign of Verma s forcefulness in conversations with PULSE.    But the tweet didn t sit well with some staff.  To be honest, we can t always keep it straight if we re supposed to tout the law   or slash and burn,  said one HHS official, noting how Verma made sure to praise the ACA during open enrollment.    Looking forward: Verma has been increasingly visible this year, touting her efforts to implement conservative policies   but she s only testified on the Hill once since being confirmed in early 2017. That will likely change after Democrats take control of the House in January, with committee leaders expected to summon Verma to explain her stewardship of the ACA   and her ongoing criticism of it, too. FDA warns Genetech about stem cell treatments. The agency on Thursday said that 12 patients were infected by bacteria after getting injections developed by the California company. It s the latest sign that FDA will be cracking down on unapproved stem cell treatments. More. (An earlier POLITICO story on Thursday briefly confused  Genetech  with industry giant  Genentech.  The two companies are not affiliated.)    Medical experts: This is exactly what we were warning about.  Some prominent people lobbied for deregulation of stem cell tx in 21st Century Cures,  former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf tweeted.  Tip of an iceberg of a business too often selling false hope with poor quality methods. Good regulation will enable the potential of stem cells to be realized with high quality.   FDA speaks up on CBD sales as Farm Bill passes. The agency is readying for new steps in regulating hemp and its main component cannabidiol, Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement released just as President Trump signed the Agriculture Improvement Act   and its provision legalizing hemp   into law yesterday.  We recognize the potential opportunities that cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds could offer,  said Gottlieb, signaling the agency could clear a pathway for interstate sales of products containing cannabidiol, or CBD, the non-psychoactive component of hemp. The agency will host a public meeting  in the near future  to discuss this and more regulatory questions like how the products should be marketed and whether there are safety concerns. FDA also asserted its authority to take enforcement action if CBD manufacturers make false health claims or break retail rules. Smithsonian executive heads to AAMC. David Skorton, a cardiologist who most recently served as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, will lead the Association of American Medical Colleges, the lobbying group for teaching hospitals and medical residents. Skorton previously was president of Cornell University and the University of Iowa. He takes over the AAMC role from Darrell Kirch, who will step down in July. Stephen Katz, 1941-2018. Katz, the longtime director of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases at NIH, passed away because of a stroke on Thursday.  Dr. Katz was a shining example of a dedicated scientist, public servant and compassionate physician,  HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.  We ll remember his outstanding contributions to advancing health.  NIH Director Francis Collins also reflected on the passing of Katz, writing that his NIH contributions were  enormous.  The Lupus Foundation of America offered condolences. By Alice Miranda Ollstein Congress has three simple options to save the Affordable Care Act from federal courts, but likely will not take any of them, Nicholas Bagley and Richard Primus write in The Atlantic. More. There is very little evidence to support the near-ubiquitous recommendations that people with heart conditions cut most salt out of their diets, Aaron Carroll writes for the New York Times. More. In the Washington Examiner, Kimberly Leonard looks at anti-abortion groups  push to oust NIH Director Francis Colllins. More. The erosion of public trust in the press, the government and the pharmaceutical industry across the U.S. is making scientists very nervous about how people will behave during the next pandemic, Bob Garfield and Amanda Aronczyz report for WNYC s On The Media. More. The first major case threatening Roe v. Wade that will reach the Supreme Court s new conservative majority could come from Alabama, where the attorney general is seeking to review a ban on a common method of second-trimester abortions, Mike Cason reports for AL.com. More.** A message from PhRMA: There are wrong and right prescriptions for changing Medicare. Seniors need Washington to focus on the right ones. There s a lot of talk in Washington about changing Medicare to reduce costs. But while many proposals would cut costs for governments and insurers, they won t cut costs for seniors; and even worse, they would limit access to the medicines that could save their lives ñ now and in the future. Cutting costs for everyone except seniors and limiting access to medicines are the wrong prescription for Medicare. On the other hand, making changes that help seniors pay less out-of-pocket are the right prescription for Medicare. **

LAST-MINUTE BILL WATCHING   It s the Friday before Christmas, both chambers of Congress are still in session, and we re barreling toward a shutdown showdown. But with the year almost up, here s a rundown of where we stand on a host of tech- and telecom-related measures:    Bringing IDEAs to fruition: President Donald Trump on Thursday signed The 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience (IDEA) Act, H.R. 5759 (115), into law during a White House ceremony. The measure, led by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), is aimed at modernizing government websites by raising standards for how they function and look.    Open for business: The Senate on Wednesday passed the Open, Public, Electronic and Necessary (OPEN) Government Data Act, S. 760 (115), introduced by Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), which would require that agencies publish public information in a machine-readable format. The bill passed as part of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, H.R. 4174 (115). The House will take up the measure today.    Self-driving, but not self-passing: Senators conceded earlier this week that the SELF DRIVE Act, H.R. 3388 (115), would not be passed in 2018. House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) called it  extremely disappointing that the Senate will not be able to finish its work on self-driving car legislation this year.  The proposal would regulate and create federal safety standards for self-driving cars.    Copy that: The Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act, S. 1010 (115), hasn t advanced in the lame duck. Consumer groups oppose the measure, which would give the president, instead of the Librarian of Congress, the power to appoint the Register of Copyrights. The Electronic Frontier Foundation warned that it would  turn the Register into a pawn of the President.

Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) is gearing up to chair Senate Commerce starting in 2019.  We want to hit the ground running,  Wicker, a veteran panel member whose agenda includes data privacy and broadband, told John this week, citing plans to  notice some hearings at the subcommittee and full committee level.  So what s on his mind?    Deputizing Thune on telecom: Don t expect Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) to vanish from the tech and telecom discussions. The outgoing panel chairman made his interest in chairing Senate Commerce s telecom subcommittee known earlier this year, eyeing the satellite TV reauthorization legislation Congress is likely to tackle next year.  I imagine he d have a pretty good chance,  Wicker remarked with a chuckle.    Staying aloof on antitrust: The Commerce panel in recent years has frequently deferred oversight of mergers and acquisitions to the Judiciary Committee, and Wicker shows no sign of changing that.  I have not made it a practice to comment about mergers,  Wicker told John when asked about the $26 billion T-Mobile-Sprint merger (which Mississippi-based C-Spire has begun slamming in recent weeks). Wicker said he prefers to defer to the antitrust regulators.  GET IN LINE   Members of the House Tech Accountability Caucus are joining a growing list of lawmakers requesting a formal sit-down with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, according to a letter obtained by MT.  The scope and intimate degree to which you shared private data is concerning,  the group   led by Reps. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.) and Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.)   wrote to the Zuckerberg on Thursday. The letter comes just days after an explosive New York Times investigation detailed Facebook s data-sharing arrangements with over 100 tech firms.  FCC: GRAY-RAY A-OKAY   The FCC on Thursday approved Gray Television s $3.6 billion deal for Raycom Media, clearing the way for the companies to close the transaction in January. The broadcasters agreed to sell off TV stations in nine markets where their footprints overlap, and pledged to do so without the controversial sidecar arrangements that drew criticism in the failed Sinclair-Tribune deal. Gray will own 124 stations across 92 markets, covering 24 percent of U.S. TV households, although the UHF discount   which counts only half the reach of some stations   brings that down to about 17 percent. The Justice Department signed off on the deal last week.  SPECTRUM ANALYSIS   The Commerce Department s National Telecommunications and Information Administration is calling for comments on its  development of a comprehensive, long-term National Spectrum Strategy.  The action is the latest step toward fulfilling President Donald Trump s call in October for a national strategy on wireless airwaves.  As President Trump has made clear, meeting demand for spectrum and unlocking the promise of these technologies requires thoughtful planning and a long-term outlook,  said NTIA chief David Redl.  THE LATEST NET NEUTRALITY HEAD COUNT   Reps. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Penn.) and Brenda Jones (D-Mich.) became the latest Democrats to sign onto the discharge petition to force a House floor vote to restore the Obama-era net neutrality rules. While the deadline for filing the petition has passed, net neutrality advocates have been pushing to add support for the movement ahead of the next Congress, when Democrats will retake the chamber. The two lawmakers bring total signatories to 182.   John Giannandrea, a former chief of artificial intelligence at Google, has been promoted to senior vice president of machine learning and artificial intelligence strategy at Apple, which he joined in April.

WHITE,  MAYA PARTHASARATHY and  ALEXANDER NIEVES 12/21/2018 09:15 AM ESTTHE BUZZ: Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom will transfer title and control of the wine and hospitality businesses under his company, the PlumpJack Group, to a personal friend and certified public accountant, he announced Thursday. The story from POLITICO Pro California s Angela Hart:  --  Newsom, who owns 22 wineries, upscale restaurants and resort hotels in Napa Valley, San Francisco, Lake Tahoe and other locations, will also disclose his tax returns and personal and business holdings each year, spokesman Nathan Click said. Story Continued Below --  His businesses will be handled by Shyla Hendrickson, an attorney, certified CPA and family friend to the Newsoms. Hendrickson will manage the businesses through a blind trust. Asked by reporters during his gubernatorial campaign whether he intended to sell his businesses, Newsom said he  can t do that.   --  These are my babies, my life, my family,  he told reporters.  --  Newsom, 51, takes office Jan. 7. He built his businesses with early financial backing from family friend and oil fortune heir Gordon Getty, who remains an investor in and co-owner of some of Newsom s businesses. He opened his first wine shop in San Francisco in 1992. Until now, Newsom has had limited his involvement in day-to-day operations at the PlumpJack businesses. He said previously that he d  look at the budgets  once a year or so, and until now was involved mainly in high-level decisions such as new acquisitions.  --  An outspoken critic of President Donald Trump s decision not to disclose his taxes, Newsom says he will release his 2018 returns next year and every year thereafter. Past returns show the Newsoms have earned millions from their businesses. Newsom and his wife Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a documentary filmmaker, made more than $1.7 million in 2015. From 2010 to 2016, the Newsoms averaged $1.4 million per year.  -- CRITIC OF TRUMP --  Newsom has said that criticism surrounding Trump and his businesses factored into his decision to put his business holdings in a blind trust.  I recognize, particularly in this environment with President Trump, that people rightfully have more scrutiny than ever on these conflict issues,  Newsom said in October.  They have the right to expect and demand that we do the right thing.   --  Newsom will also issue an executive order prohibiting state executive branch agencies from doing business with PlumpJack entities, and will divest from all common stock he owns in publicly traded companies, Click said. Read the full story here.  THE TAKEAWAY -- Newsom s willingness to illuminate his business interests contrasts with Trump s refusal to release his tax returns   something that Sacramento is again targeting with a bill that would compel presidential candidates to release their returns if they want to appear on the ballot. Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed the last one, but lawmakers are hoping that Newsom   who revels in drawing distinctions from Trump ñ may yield a different result.  BUENOS DÕAS, Good FRIDAY morning.

MATTIS RESIGNS IN PROTEST via POLITICO s Connor O Brien and Bryan Bender: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis breaks with Trump in resignation letter:  You have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned,  the defense secretary told him on Thursday. Read it here,  HE SAW IT COMING? --Months before he was tapped to be secretary of defense, Mattis   then a distinguished fellow at Stanford s Hoover Institution   made no secret of his issues with Donald Trump s views on key issues like NATO, the border wall, and a Muslim ban.  -- In a rare interview with POLITICO s Carla Marinucci in 2016 at Stanford, Mattis let loose, saying of Trump s border wall proposal and Muslim ban that our allies must  think we have lost faith in reason.  And he called Trump s view of NATO  kooky.   -- AND THIS:  History is very compelling. Nations with allies are stronger than nations without allies. It s simple arithmetic. But calling them freeloaders, or railroading them or ignoring them ... is simply not the way to restore America s options so that we can resolve a lot of these issues using diplomatic tools and not bleed ourselves to death.

THE BATTLE IS ON --  Activist Kimberly Ellis announces bid for chair of the California Democratic Party amid leadership turmoil,   by LATimes  Melanie Mason and Christine Mai-Duc:   Bay Area progressive activist Kimberly Ellis is making another run at leading the state s Democratic Party, she announced Thursday. Ellis burst onto the state political scene in 2017 when she narrowly lost the chairmanship to then-Los Angeles Democratic Party Chairman Eric Bauman. Story.  IN A FACEBOOK POST announcing her campaign to head the party, Kimberly Ellis tells CADems:  Right now, we need a leader who will work to heal and unify all sides; a leader who reaches out and refuses to hold grudges. We need a leader who fights for the voiceless and resists the urge to punch down.  Read it here. --  Brown sues to save California sentencing laws,   by AP s Don Thompson; Outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown sued Thursday to protect one of his signature actions in office, a voter-approved measure that allows most prison inmates to seek earlier release and participate in rehabilitation programs. His administration filed a lawsuit challenging a pending 2020 initiative that seeks to toughen criminal penalties as part of an effort to roll back reforms adopted by voters within the past decade.

Brown admits that he was booed at a local rodeo, but says he generally gets along well with the community, even welcoming visitors who stop by the ranch when they see him sipping a glass of wine outside his barn.  They are very friendly people, when they re not in a crowd,  Brown said. Story.  -- GEORGE SKELTON:  When Jerry Brown retires to his ranch with the elk and rattlesnakes, what will he miss?  What s there to do up there?  What do you do anywhere?  he replied.  I have several thousand books.  Story. -- UNSEATED? New census data out this week has California s population growing by about 160,000 people between 2017 and 2018   and an analysis by the firm Election Data Services suggests that trend could end up costing California a House seat after the 2020 census. A separate POLITICO analysis found that, if reapportionment were conducted today, California would barely hang onto its 53rd House seat. But that can change in the next two years.  -- The outcome here depends on the accuracy of the 2020 census; a recent California Legislative Analyst s Office report found that, despite fears of an undercount as the Trump administration looks to ask about citizenship, it was unlikely that an undercount would be severe enough for California to forfeit a seat or a significant sum of federal money. But Kimball Brace of Election Data Services said it could be a photo finish:  You are very close,  he said,  and need to get as many people counted as possible.  -- WAITING GAME --  Migrants must wait in Mexico during immigration proceedings under Trump policy  by POLITICO s Ted Hesson:  [Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen] Nielsen said in a written statement that migrants who arrive at the border  illegally or without proper documentation could be returned to Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings.  Aliens trying to game the system to get into our country illegally will no longer be able to disappear into the United States, where many skip their court dates,  she said in the statement.  Story.  -- SHUTDOWN LOOMS --  Trump rushes into shutdown threat over wall  by POLITICO s Sarah Ferris and John Bresnahan:  President Donald Trump will not sign the stopgap funding bill approved by the Senate, Speaker Paul Ryan warned Thursday afternoon, a move that dramatically increases the risk of a partial government shutdown. It would be the third shutdown of Trump s presidency, all of which would come under GOP control of the White House, Senate and House.  Story.  -- THE IMPACTS --  Muir Woods off-limits?

                        government shutdown
                        Roughly 800,000 federal employees are affected by the shutdown, and hundreds of thousands of them could face furloughs over Christmas week if a deal isn t reached quickly.
                    By JOHN BRESNAHAN, BURGESS EVERETT and SARAH FERRIS12/21/2018 08:45 AM EST
                    Updated 12/22/2018 12:00 AM ESTAn array of federal departments shut down on midnight Friday after a last round of negotiations between the White House and congressional leaders failed to break the impasse over funding President Donald Trump s border wall. It marks the third time this year that the government shut down, although this latest  lapse in appropriations  affects only about one-quarter of the vast federal bureaucracy. Roughly 800,000 federal employees are affected by the shutdown, with half of of them facing furloughs over Christmas week if a deal to fund their agencies and departments isn t reached quickly.  Trump and Democratic congressional leaders launched into a round of fingerpointing over who was to blame for the debacle, although even senior Republicans acknowledged that Trump has shifted his positions repeatedly in the negotiations that preceded the shutdown.Story Continued Below  We re going to have a shutdown. There s nothing we can do about that because we need the Democrats to give us their votes,  Trump said in a video posted on Twitter late Friday.  Call it a Democrat shutdown, call it whatever you want.    The shutdown, hopefully, will not last long,  Trump added. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) countered that the shutdown was the result of a Trump  temper tantrum  and insisted they had offered the president  multiple proposals to keep the government open,  but to no avail.  Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. But instead of honoring his responsibility to the American people, President Trump threw a temper tantrum and convinced House Republicans to push our nation into a destructive Trump Shutdown in the middle of the holiday season,  Schumer and Pelosi said in a statement.   President Trump has said more than 25 times that he wanted a shutdown and now he has gotten what he wanted.  The shutdown will hit a number of Cabinet departments, including Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, State, Transportation and Treasury. NASA and the Food and Drug Administration are also affected. But the full impact of the shutdown won t be felt over the weekend, and both Monday and Tuesday are federal holidays for government employees.Discussions are expected to continue Saturday, although a breakthrough doesn t appear imminent. Both the House and Senate will be in session, although no votes are scheduled at this time.Vice President Mike Pence, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner shuttled between congressional offices on Friday night as the talks dragged on, surrounded by a phalanx of U.S. Capitol Police officers, Secret Service agents, and White House aides. Will there be a resolution to everything, before midnight? Probably slim,  Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said as he left the sit-down with the White House officials. That meeting broke up around 8:30 with no resolution   as had earlier talks   and neither the White House nor congressional leaders have announced any further talks on Saturday.The Senate earlier voted to advance a House-passed spending bill, if only to keep talks going between Republicans and Democrats over Trump s demand for $5 billion in new money for his wall.  The Senate has voted to proceed to the legislation before us in order to preserve maximum flexibility for productive conversations to continue between the White House and our Democratic colleagues. I hope Senate Democrats will work with the White House,  said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on the floor following one of the longest votes in the chamber s history. McConnell was wearing a button on his suit reading  Cranky Coalition  as he made his announcement.But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a key player in the budget fight, countered that Trump was never going to get that much money   or any money   for his wall and floated several other plans to break the logjam. Those offers were quickly rejected by the White House. As we said to President Trump a week ago, his wall does not have 60 votes here in the Senate, let alone 50 votes,  Schumer said.  We are willing to continue discussion  on a proposal that does not fund the border wall. Senators said the next vote in the chamber will only occur when there s a deal between Trump and congressional leaders.Pence, Mulvaney and Kushner   at the president s request   came to the Capitol on Friday afternoon as the shutdown clock ticked closer. The trio first huddled with Schumer in the New York Democrat s office. Mulvaney and Pence then met with Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), leading to some optimism that political disaster could be averted. But any hope of an agreement appeared dashed by the early evening. With the likelihood for an agreement fading, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) headed home, saying no further votes were expected in the Senate Friday. There aren t going to be any more votes tonight,  Cornyn said as he left the Capitol.  You can take that to the bank. Earlier in the day, GOP Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) met with McConnell and Schumer and struck a procedural agreement that would prevent the Senate from voting on anything other than a bipartisan spending deal. Flake is opposed to the House GOP bill that adds $5 billion for the border wall, saying it has no chance of getting any Senate Democratic support.Flake changed his vote on the procedural motion from  no  to  yes,  and Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) was the only Democrat who voted to proceed.The vote was held open for more than 5 hours, an extraordinary action in the Senate. There is no path forward for the House bill. The only path forward is to a bill that has an agreement between the president and both houses of Congress,  Flake warned on the floor.  The next time we vote will be on the agreement, not another test vote. Friday s talks centered on a proposal to boost border security funding by $1.6 billion, but that money could not be used for Trump s border wall, according to lawmakers and aides. The provision   part of the Homeland Security Department s spending package   would be attached to six other appropriations bills funding the government through Sept. 30. A multi-billion dollar package of disaster aid would also be attached, and there could be as much as $1 billion for added security at U.S. ports of entry, said several sources familiar with the talks.Trump   who reversed his support for a stopgap funding bill to avert the shutdown since it lacked wall money   would have to publicly commit to backing the package, said the sources.Ryan and House GOP leaders would also have to bring the measure up for a vote and allow some of their members to vote for it, the sources added. The proposal was similar to a border security package that Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had offered earlier to Trump. Pelosi has been involved in the discussions, although Schumer was  taking the point  in Friday s discussions, said Democratic aides. Leader Schumer reminded them that any proposal with funding for the wall will not pass the Senate,  said a Schumer spokesman following the meeting with Pence, Mulvaney and Kushner.Still, the burden is on Trump to say exactly what he will sign, which wasn t precisely clear when Senate Republicans met with him earlier in the day.And House Republicans didn t appear all that interested in what Democrats were offering. Ryan and other House GOP leaders had to scramble the day before to get more money for Trump s wall following a revolt by conservative hardliners, who were upset after Senate Republicans agreed to postpone the border-wall fight to early February. We re trying to figure out a way to solve this. Try and figure out what the president s priority is, what we need for border security and then try to bridge that gap with Leader Schumer,  said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who is close to Senate GOP leaders. Though Trump has made clear he won t sign a bill that doesn t include a major boost in border security, Republicans said they thought a deal could still be struck.Some Republicans said it was up to Schumer to negotiate directly with Trump and get buy-in from Pelosi, as well as the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, which caused the rebellion against a clean spending bill in the first place.Democrats have offered to support $1.3 billion in funding for fencing, though Republicans believed they might be able to convince Schumer to go up to as much as $1.6 billion, the bipartisan number originally negotiated in the Senate. House Democrats have, so far, rejected that. Shelby said he directly asked Trump to reconsider the $1.6 billion funding deal in the Thursday afternoon sit down with McConnell and Trump. We never reached a number, but the president said to us, he doesn t want to shut down the government,  Shelby said. He added that Schumer was consulting with Pelosi. After a GOP lunch on Friday, Republicans said that in a private meeting with senators, Trump took a hard-line but did not give a specific number on what amount of border wall funding might satisfy him. I don t believe a strong sense came out of the meeting,  said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).  Mostly a nuclear option and shutdown is acceptable to him, would be the two takeaway points, I think. And the wall matters and will be beautiful when built. Early Friday, Republicans rejected Trump s proposal to get rid of the filibuster through the  nuclear option  to fund the border wall, something McConnell has repeatedly said would not happen. Mitch, use the Nuclear Option and get it done! Our Country is counting on you!  Trump tweeted on Friday morning.Republicans hold 51 Senate seats and need at least nine Democrats to pass most legislation, including funds for the border wall. Yet changing the filibuster rules in the waning days of GOP unified control would offer limited short-term gain and major long-term pain whenever Democrats take over on Capitol Hill. And conservatives have historically wielded the filibuster to slow down progressive legislation.But there are insufficient votes to change the Senate voting rules to a simple majority. Flake and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said they won t vote for a rules change, and neither will Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.).Before the deal-making began in earnest Friday, Trump expressed succinctly what was on everyone s mind: That congressional Democrats and the White House appeared to be in an intractable impasse. We are totally prepared for a very long shutdown,  Trump told reporters. And 10 days after declaring he d be  proud  to take the blame for any shutdown in a fight for border security, he said it was now  totally up to the Democrats.

DEADLINE DAY -- You better watch out. A shutdown is coming to town. A divided Congress has less than 16 hours to find consensus on a spending bill that can pass both houses and win President Donald Trump s approval to avoid roughly a quarter of the federal government shuttering just days before Christmas. To their credit, the House and Senate each passed a spending package to extend government funding through Feb. 8. But the House didn t vote on the measure that unanimously passed the Senate earlier this week. Instead, it added $5 billion for a border wall and $8 billion in emergency disaster aid. The former won t pass the Senate, where Republicans need Democratic votes. Story Continued BelowTRUMP SIGNALS LENGTHY SHUTDOWN -- The president is encouraging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to  fight for the Wall and Border Security as hard as he fought for anything.  And he not only reversed himself on a willingness to delay the border wall fight until February but also on owning an increasingly likely shutdown.  If enough Dems don t vote,  he claimed this morning,  it will be a Democrat Shutdown!   Shutdown today if Democrats do not vote for Border Security!  he added in a subsequent tweet. Senate Democrats aren t giving Trump $5 billion for his wall, so a shutdown seems inevitable. And if there is a partial government shutdown, Trump said it  will last for a very long time. That means Congress could be at an impasse until Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is elected speaker in January, when Democrats will control the House. But it s hard to see any outcome where Trump gets his $5 billion from a new House Democratic majority barring a major concession. Related:  With spending bill stalled, federal agencies prepare to cease operations at midnight Friday,  by The Washington Post s Lisa Rein, Damian Paletta and Brady Dennis: https://wapo.st/2QGPwZu HOW WE GOT HERE -- McConnell spoke to the president Tuesday night about a plan to delay the border wall fight and fund the government into early February. He believed he had Trump s blessing to move forward, and his chamber passed a bill via voice vote Wednesday night. But conservatives in the House loudly pushed for a fight in their final days in the majority. And the president listened. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) called Trump on Thursday morning, telling him now is their best chance to fight and that conservatives will have their back. Enough said.Trump summoned House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other GOP leaders to the White House, where he directed them to change course.  I m OK with a shutdown,  Trump told them.  The hard-liners had defeated leadership once again, and Washington was barreling into another crisis of its own making with no endgame in sight,  Rachael writes.  As Washington peers over the abyss of its third shutdown in two years, some Republicans see signs of a broken institution. Thousands of federal employees could be furloughed or forced to work without pay. And House Republicans as of Thursday night were embracing the chaos.

I was sorry to learn that Secretary Mattis   will soon depart the administration,  McConnell said.  But I am particularly distressed that he is resigning due to sharp differences with the president on these and other key aspects of America s global leadership.  In a week when Trump announced he would withdraw U.S. forces from Syria and reports surfaced that he was preparing to pull troops out of Afghanistan,  the rapid-fire developments prompted rare warnings from within Mr. Trump s own party that his foreign policy could be leading toward dangerous instability on the global stage,  The New York Times  Nicholas Fandos writes. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) signaled that  we are headed towards a series of grave policy errors  that will endanger the country, damage U.S. alliances and empower American enemies. Even Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), an ally of the president, warned that  we are setting in motion the loss of all our gains and paving the way toward a second 9/11.   Privately, even senior Republican leaders expressed alarm about the potential instability ushered in by Mr. Mattis s departure,  Fandos writes.  The defense chief had been viewed as a reliable, calming presence among lawmakers of both parties on Capitol Hill, who have enthusiastically provided funds and authorization in the last two years to build up the military under his direction.

The House on Thursday easily passed the legislation, 358-36, sending it to the president desk s. The bill is a win for Trump and an often-divided Congress. Trump repeatedly nudged McConnell to take up the bill in the lame duck, and it easily passed the Senate despite opposition from some Republicans.  The final House vote follows an intense, yearlong lobbying effort from an unexpected group of allies including Trump s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Kim Kardashian, the American Civil Liberties Union, liberal Democrats, conservative Republicans and the Koch network,  Heather writes.

Roberts, 82, survived a serious primary challenge in his last reelection fight in 2014 and had to stave off questions about his residency in Kansas,  James Arkin and Daniel Strauss note. He won reelection by double digits that year.Roberts said he isn t worried about potential challengers. Though Democrat Laura Kelly was elected governor last month, Kansas hasn t sent a Democrat to the Senate since the 1930s.  I m 24-0 in terms of times I ve had somebody on the ballot in opposition to me,  Roberts said.  Sometimes they have been lesser candidates but 24-0 is a pretty good record.  If Roberts retires, potential GOP candidates include Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, outgoing Gov. Jeff Colyer and Rep. Roger Marshall. Democrat Barry Grissom, a former U.S. attorney, is also eyeing a run.

Story Continued Below THE TARIFF MAN KILLED THE MARKET   Markets took yet another 2 percent tumble on Thursday amidst shutdown threats, more grumbling about the Fed hike and a general fear of total Washington dysfunction. But it s worth pulling back the lens a few weeks to when the current slide into bear market territory began. And that day was Tuesday, Dec. 4 when Trump issued his infamous  I am a Tariff Man  tweet. The Dow was rising heading into that day on hopes for a deal with China. The blue chip index closed down nearly 800 points after the tweet. Since then, the Dow is down nearly 3,000 points, or nearly 12 percent. Since hitting its recent and all-time high of 8,109 in August, the Nasdaq is now down 1,581 points, or 19.5 percent, just short of bear market territory, which would be a 20 percent decline. The S&P is off about 16 percent since hitting an all-time high in September. But like the Dow, the recent sell-offs in the Nasdaq and S&P also trace to Dec. 4. Plenty has happened since the Tariff Man tweet, including the recent Fed tantrum and the shutdown threat, but it s worth remembering how this most recent leg down began and why the China issue is so central to 2019.  SPEAKING OF THE SHUTDOWN   It certainly seemed more likely Thursday night after Trump caved to MAGA voices in conservative media and said he would reject the CR passed by the Senate.   From our Sarah Ferris and John Bresnahan:  House Republicans passed a stop-gap spending bill that delivers $5 billion for   Trump s border wall, setting up a standoff with the Senate that significantly raises the likelihood of a government shutdown this weekend.  Read more.  SHUTDOWN IMPACTS   The direct economic impact of shutdowns, especially limited ones, are generally pretty small. Federal workers will eventually get paid. Most essential government functions continue. But there is a psychological impact that markets clearly took into account on Thursday. Sentiment is already highly negative and yet another Washington food fight, this one at Christmas time, is not at all good for the famous animal spirits. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis quitting and roasting Trump on the way out won t help either (more on which below) given he gave comfort to many in DC and on Wall Street as a serious adult running the Pentagon. He was also a skeptic of invoking national security to impose tariffs. Via Bankrate.com s Senior Economic Analyst, Mark Hamrick:  A shutdown would further aggravate the frustration Americans already feel about the inability of their federal government to successfully achieve the most basic of functions.  It would pile on after the president has repeatedly verbally trashed numerous departments and the fundamental missions of the federal government serving the American people. A shutdown would add, for many, further demoralizing injuries to insults.  Via S&P Global Ratings:  If a shutdown were to take place so far into the fourth quarter, some economic activity would not have time to bounce back. This could worry investors as well as consumers, potentially increasing market volatility on the back of a Fed rate hike and snuffing out some economic activity this quarter.  BOTTOM LINE   There are finite, explicable reasons for recent declines (adjusting to future interest rate policy and potential trade war impacts) then there is existential fear about an unstable president and a dysfunctional government. And it makes it entirely possible that markets will fall straight off the cliff.  ASIA SLIDES; OIL PLUNGES   Reuters:  Global stocks were sailing into Christmas on a sea of red on Friday, as the threat of a U.S. government shutdown and of further hikes in U.S. borrowing costs inflamed investor unease over the economic outlook.  The S&P 500 was heading for its worst quarter since the dark days of late 2008   Oil prices slid just over 4 percent overnight, bringing Brent s losses since its October top to 37 percent. The dollar had suffered its biggest one-day drop on the yen since November 2017 as investors stampeded to safe havens.  Read more.  WHY MARKETS DID WHAT THEY DID   Thanks for your responses to our question about why markets tanked during the Jay Powell presser. Via Thomas Ruppel of Fulton Weeks:  Starting to wonder whether it has as much to do with FRB concern about asset values as with core mission of inflation and employment, irrational exuberance being the dark side of animal spirits. So Mr. Powell might not mind those values getting to more fundamentally-based levels. (Which means he is actually feeling the market, Mr. T.)   LOOKING AHEAD TO 2019   Via Ed Clissold, Chief US Strategist, Ned Davis Research:  The weakness in the stock market in 2018 will likely spill over into early 2019, but the market should transition to a cyclical bull in the first half of the year. The timing of the transition will depend on our indicators and models, but the most likely window is the second quarter. Second-half gains should take the popular averages to new highs. Our year-end 2019 target for the S&P 500 is 2950, or 9% above current levels.  Via Peter McTeague sees the S&P going lower in 2019:  We are at/past peak fiscal stimulus, peak global central bank easing, and peak earnings.   Typically gridlock is good for stocks, but maybe this gridlock isn t the same as others, and also we are very late cycle.   TWEET DU JOUR   Wash. Post s @AaronBlake:  Since Trump signed the GOP tax cuts into law 363 days ago, the Dow is down 1,800+ points -- more than 7%.

MATTIS QUITS   Adding to potential fears on Wall Street, our Connor O Brien and Bryan Bender:  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, citing a litany of differences with   Trump -- over how to treat allies and the need for a more  resolute  approach to Russia -- resigned on Thursday, ending a nearly two-year stint in which he went from a darling of the cabinet to an opponent of the president on a host of issues.   Because you have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,  Mattis wrote in his resignation letter to Trump, released by the Pentagon.  Read more.  HOUSE ADVOCATES REELING   Our Katy O Donnell:  The surprise announcement this week that Pam Patenaude, deputy secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, would be leaving office next month has left housing advocates reeling.  Patenaude, a widely respected policy expert with over 30 years of experience in the industry, was seen as a steady hand as the No. 2 to HUD Secretary Ben Carson, whose own friends admitted he had no relevant housing experience when he took the job. Patenaude s successor, Federal Housing Administration Commissioner Brian Montgomery, is also a well-known figure in housing circles. But among low-income housing advocates, Patenaude in particular was seen as a rare ally  More for Pros here.  GRASSLEY WARNS TRUMP ON TARIFFS   Our Doug Palmer:  Incoming Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley(R-Iowa) said   Trump needs to listen closely to congressional concerns about his steel and aluminum tariffs if he wants to win approval of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.  I urge the administration to consult with Congress, as intended by the Trade Promotion Authority [law], to ensure a clear path forward for U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement,  Grassley said during a speech today on the Senate floor outlining his priorities for 2019.  Grassley pledged to push quickly for approval of the new deal, which updates the 25-year-old NAFTA pact.  But I can t do it without a strong commitment from the administration that we will work together,  he said. The Iowa Republican, who served twice as chairman of the Finance committee during the 2000s, praised many of the changes the Trump administration made to the older agreement.  Read more.  MNUCHIN CHIDES MARKETS FOR FED REACTION   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Fox Business:  I think the market reaction is completely overblown. If you look at the U.S. growth versus Europe versus the rest of the world, the U.S. is still going to grow significantly higher.    [T]he market was clearly expecting them to have a rate hike. That was priced into the bond market and into the Fed funds market. I think that the market was disappointed in the chairman s comments, but I would say if you look at the specifics, you can t just look at the headline, which was two more rate hikes, you have to look at the 17 dots on the dot plot.   GRADING 2018 CALLS   Goldman s Jan Hatzius looks back at his forecast for the year. And he did pretty darn well, getting nine of ten big picks right and missing only on the housing slowdown:  The US economy grew well above trend, the unemployment rate came down further, and wage and price inflation accelerated on net, all consistent with our expectations. However, we underestimated the slowdown in housing activity.  The Fed delivered four hikes, in line with our forecast of a year ago and above both market pricing of two hikes and a dot plot median of three hikes.   In light of the sharp tightening in financial conditions since October, we have recently had to cut our funds rate call for 2019. We now expect a pause in the early part of the year, although we disagree with the emerging consensus that the FOMC is done hiking.  DOW SINKS AGAIN   AP s Marley Jay:  Stocks went into another slide Thursday in what is shaping up as the worst December on Wall Street since the depths of the Great Depression, with prices dragged down by rising fears of a recession somewhere on the horizon.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 464 points, bringing its losses to more than 1,700 since last Friday. The broader S&P 500 index continued its slump, too, and is down 10.6 percent this month alone, with six days of trading to go.  This is the classic shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later market,  said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Stocks usually end the year with a flourish, and December is usually the best month of the year for the market. But this month has been dismal. Without a decent rally, this could be the worst December since 1931.  Read more.  MARKETS SPENT 2018 CORRECTING INVESTOR MISTAKES   WSJ s James Mackintosh:  Wall Street forecasters had an unusually good first nine months of the year, as the S&P 500 soared to just above their average forecast for the year. Since then it s all gone horribly wrong, and the prediction of strategists that the S&P would stand at 2875 by New Year s Eve now looks completely out of reach. Those with a historical perspective can think of this as just another normal year. But it also gives us a way to think about whether the selloff of the past three months might be the start of something much worse.  Here s what history tells us. The S&P has had a shockingly bad fall from its peak and assuming it doesn t recover the loss from peak to year-end has been worse in only a handful of years, almost all notable for recessions or crashes. On the other hand the actual loss from the start of the year, currently 6%, doesn t stand out as especially bad. And the fall from the start of the year to the lowest point during the year has been worse in almost half the years of the past half-century. It just happens that we are currently at the lowest point in the year, which is unusual as the festive season gets into swing.  Read more.  Just how bad will it get?   Bloomberg s Vildana Hajric, Sarah Ponczek, Lu Wang and Elena Popina:  While it feels like it won t stop, someday it will. To get a handle on when equities might bottom out, analysts and investors turn to everything from valuations to technical analysis and history. Right now, they re struggling to frame a cheerful message.    Going strictly by technical analysis of lines on charts, the message is grim. Tuesday s session saw the obliteration of a level that had held for 10 months, the intraday low on the S&P 500. Below that, barriers thin out. The S&P 500 moved quickly from one round-number milestone, 2,500, to another, 2,450, in just a few hours on Thursday.  Read more. WILL A LONG SHUTDOWN HURT JOBS DATA?   Reuters  Kanishka Singh:  White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Thursday that a  really long  government shutdown could be negative for jobs data in the short term.  If the government were to shut down for a really long period, then there are estimates that could have a negative impact on the jobs numbers in the short term,  Hassett told CNBC in an interview.

WELLS FARGO MOVES JOBS OVERSEAS   Reuters  Imani Moise:  Wells Fargo & Co. has been hiring overseas after pledging to eliminate thousands of jobs, according to a Department of Labor investigation.  The department determined American employees who have been laid off in Wells Fargo s customer account management unit after Sept. 28 will be eligible for government aid under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. The program provides weekly income and training to help workers displaced by global trade find new jobs. The bank  has shifted to a foreign country the supply of a service like or directly competitive with the service supplied by the workers,  the TAA determination said.  Read more.

He made his fortune by transforming an old-fashioned business into a giant ATM, an overhaul aided by one of the hottest plays on Wall Street: collateralized loan obligations.

In 2019, Politico will grow its sales team by 15 percent to 171 people, said Bobby Moran, the publisher s chief revenue officer. (The company already expanded the sales team by 18 percent this year.)

Story Continued BelowNew data this week shows Illinois is certain to lose a congressional seat after the 2020 census, and that s prompted a political parlor game of how redistricting might play out.With Democrats in control of state government, observers expect consolidation of districts now held by GOP lawmakers. Two possibilities: the 15th and 16th districts could merge, forcing incumbents John Shimkus and Adam Kinzinger to compete. Or the 13th and 18th districts might combine, which would have incumbent Republicans Rodney Davis and Darin LaHood going head to head.Those current districts are all located in central and southern Illinois, which is seeing population declines. Chicago is safe even with its population dip because it s surrounded by suburbs that are growing.  You wouldn t want to take away (a congressional seat) from an area that s gaining in population,  said Bob Bradley, professor emeritus at Illinois State University and an expert on the subject.As Gov. Bruce Rauner predicted, results of the midterms will make the post-2020 round of redistricting easy   for Democrats, that is. Starting next month, the blue party will control the governor s mansion and both chambers of the General Assembly. And in the House, Democrats have a supermajority.  They re going to make sure there are no Democratic seats in jeopardy,  says Bradley.Not since President Lincoln was in office will Illinois have so few members in Congress. In the mid-1800s, the state had 14 congressional seats. It currently has 18 and will lose one after reapportionment. According to Election Data Services, Illinois lost 45,116 residents between July 1, 2017, and July 1, 2018, second only to New York. Illinois eked out the last seat (#435) allotted to Congress. Earlier Census estimates pointed to the state possibly losing a second seat in 2020. Aside from losing a voice in Congress, there s one other drawback, Bradley notes,  It means we become less important to select the president because we also lose an electoral vote.  Link to Election Data Services census numbersGov.-elect J.B. Pritzker has hired a diverse group of advisers to help lead his administration, including three high-profile names who will serve as deputy governors: former state Comptroller Dan Hynes, outgoing state Rep. Christian Mitchell and corporate attorney and former state Board of Education chief Jesse Ruiz.Budget director is Alexis Sturm, who currently works as director of cash management and bond reporting in the state comptroller s office; senior adviser is Nikki Budzinski, a former labor campaign director on Hillary Clinton s 2016 presidential campaign; and director of Illinois Department of Commerce is Erin Guthrie, who currently works for Uber Midwest in Chicago.The group is skilled and smart and Hynes, a moderate Democrat, is seen as someone offering fiscal balance to a left-leaning Pritzker.No word on their salaries, but as Sun-Times  Tina Sfondeles points out, that information will be made public within weeks.

Bruce Rauner says he s not giving up on  reforming  Illinois and he explains why he talked to others about running for governor. My personal commitment to save Illinois began over eight years ago, and I want you to know it has never wavered or diminished,  he writes in a portion of the letter obtained by POLITICO.  This has never been about me. This has always been about reforming our broken system to save our state. Some people have mistakenly taken my eight-year effort to recruit highly qualified candidates, committed to major reform and with unique capabilities to win, into all races -- including the most recent governor s race -- as a sign that I was not really committed to win this election. In fact, just the opposite is true. I have poured my heart and soul and a massive portion of my financial resources into one thing: winning to save our state. I have never backed down and will never give up, even if I am not the candidate on the ballot. He continues:  The election outcome was heartbreaking, but we can never give up our work to save our state for our children and our grandchildren. I hope we can find ways to continue to work together. I look forward to following your future careers and supporting you in the years to come.

                    Updated 12/21/2018 08:44 AM ESTPresident Donald Trump warned Friday that  there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time  if the Senate fails to pass a spending bill that includes border wall funding, laying the groundwork to blame Democrats for a pre-Christmas shutdown that would shutter wide swaths of the government.Trump pushed the government to the precipice of a partial shutdown on Thursday, insisting in a meeting with lawmakers that he would not sign legislation to keep the government open unless it included $5 billion for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.Story Continued BelowAcceding to the president s demand, House Republicans on Thursday rejected a short-term funding bill passed by the Senate that included just over $1 billion for border security   not a wall   and instead approved legislation that met the president s demands for border wall funding. The House bill now goes to the Senate, where it is almost sure to fall short of the 60 votes it would need to pass.Still, Trump on Friday morning urged McConnell to push hard for border wall funding, which would need some Democratic support to pass. Democrats, who will hold the majority in the House next year, are all but certain to refuse to budge on funding the president s border wall. Senator Mitch McConnell should fight for the Wall and Border Security as hard as he fought for anything. He will need Democrat votes, but as shown in the House, good things happen,  the president wrote on Twitter.  If enough Dems don t vote, it will be a Democrat Shutdown! House Republicans were great yesterday! A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Trump also pushed McConnell to change longstanding Senate rules, if necessary, to pass wall funding, writing on Twitter that the majority leader should  use the nuclear option and get it done.  The president has long pushed for an end to Senate filibuster rules requiring legislation to clear a 60-vote threshold to pass, a step McConnell has vowed never to take. The Democrats, whose votes we need in the Senate, will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED,  Trump warned.  If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don t want Open Borders and Crime! That the House was able to pass Trump s preferred funding legislation at all required a herculean effort from GOP leadership, which had to wrangle a lame-duck Congress with many members, including some who will be out of office in a matter of days, already at home.At one point this week more than 50 House lawmakers were absent for a vote, making it unclear whether the GOP had enough members in Washington to pass the president s border wall demands. Friday morning, Trump celebrated the lawmakers who returned to town to push his wall funding over the House finish line. No matter what happens today in the Senate, Republican House Members should be very proud of themselves,  he wrote on Twitter.  They flew back to Washington from all parts of the World in order to vote for Border Security and the Wall. Not one Democrat voted yes, and we won big. I am very proud of you! Earlier this week, the White House had appeared ready to accept legislation to keep the government open without border wall funding. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders signaled that the administration would find alternate sources for border wall money and the president said he would ask the military to build the border wall.But as the deadline grew closer, the right flank of the Republican party mounted a final push to fund the president s signature campaign promise now, before Democrats seize control of the House and likely install Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as speaker. Members of the arch-conservative House Freedom Caucus delivered blistering floor speeches calling on the president to fight for the wall now, while conservative media figures similarly spurred the president to demand wall funding, suggesting anything less would amount to a capitulation.

                    By RACHAEL BADEOpponents of the president have long ridiculed his border wall proposal as an ineffective and overly simplified solution to the complex issue of illegal immigration. Trump has been lambasted, too, for his promise that Mexico would pay for the wall, a promise the president has dubiously claimed he kept by renegotiating NAFTA on terms he says are more favorable to the U.S.Trump defended his wall proposal Friday morning, suggesting he has the technological expertise to stop immigrants from entering the U.S. illegally. Democrats, the president claimed, are  lying  when they argue that a border wall would be ineffectual. The Democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a Wall, calling it old fashioned. The fact is there is nothing else s that will work, and that has been true for thousands of years,  he wrote on Twitter.  It s like the wheel, there is nothing better. I know tech better than anyone, & technology on a Border is only effective in conjunction with a Wall.  Properly designed and built Walls work, and the Democrats are lying when they say they don t. In Israel the Wall is 99.9% successful,  the president continued.  Will not be any different on our Southern Border! Hundreds of $Billions saved! Missing out on the latest scoops?

We wish all of our loyal readers a joyous holiday season and a happy, healthy new year. Story Continued BelowNO SEPARATE SPACE FORCE? The Pentagon is reportedly recommending  an armed force within the Department of the Air Force,  rather than a separate military branch dedicated to space. The full details of the draft legislative proposal   including how it would interface with the re-established U.S. Space Command or a new Space Development Agency   aren t clear. But the growing prospect that the Space Force will be subordinate to the Air Force, as reported by Defense News on Thursday, is a sign that long-running opposition inside the ranks to a fully independent service has carried the day after months of deliberations.Trump may still have his say, however. The White House has spent considerable time drafting a separate presidential directive that makes it pretty clear President Donald Trump is still gunning for a sixth branch of the military. So we ll be watching for how Trump responds, and how Vice President Mike Pence, who was briefed on the proposals at the Pentagon this week, couches the final plan that is headed to Congress next year. The administration could very well embrace it as their own like the roll out this week of the Space Command, which was originally Congress  idea. Pence said earlier this week that Trump s Space Force directive will be out any day. But keeping it under the Air Force is likely to go over better on Capitol Hill, where there s deep skepticism about the bureaucratic bloat likely to come with a new branch of the armed forces   including from Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, who s in line to chair the House Armed Services Committee. Indeed, what the Pentagon is reportedly proposing sounds like the Space Corps first raised by GOP Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, who now chairs the strategic forces subcommittee on the panel. Smith has also expressed openness to that approach. Rogers is a confidante of Trump s and may now have some cajoling to do. All the Pentagon would say Thursday is that  we are moving forward with our legislative proposal for Space Force.  The White House was mum.ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR SPACE? Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) also introduced a bill to establish an assistant secretary of defense to take the lead in strengthening the Pentagon s space mission.  Establishing the assistant secretary is a prerequisite to creating a robust military approach to space,  Cruz said in unveiling S. 3774, which has been referred to the Armed Services Committee.The legislation calls for the office to  submit to the congressional defense committees a plan to establish a separate, alternative acquisition system for defense space resources, including for acquisitions with respect to space vehicles, ground segments relating to such vehicles, and satellite terminals.  In other Cruz news, POLITICO Pro reported Thursday that he will step down from the Armed Services Committee in January, along with Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.WELCOME TO POLITICO SPACE, our briefing on the policies and personalities shaping the new space age in Washington and beyond   publishing each Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

The Space Frontier Act not only ensures that the United States will remain the global leader in space exploration, but reduces regulatory barriers to allow a vibrant commercial economy to flourish in space,  said Cruz, who teamed up on the bill with outgoing Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. The bill  takes the critical step of continuing the operations and utilization of the International Space Station through 2030,  Cruz added. It also  enacts meaningful reforms to modernize our nation s launch and re-entry regulations, and streamlines nongovernmental Earth observation regulations.  He called on the House  to take swift actions to pass our bill and send it to the President s desk to be signed into law.  From the archives: our interview with Cruz in June.SHUTDOWN COUNTDOWN: With scant signs of a deal to avert a partial government shutdown before today s deadline, NASA is preparing to go into sleep mode and issued new guidance to employees late Thursday outlining who works and who stays home.  In previous shutdowns, we have maintained personnel to support the International Space Station and its crew, and currently operating space missions, such as satellites, spacecraft, landers, rovers, to ensure they re safe and secure,  explained Megan Powers, an agency spokeswoman.Nature has a good rundown of what the shutdown will mean not just for NASA but other federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NASA HACKED: Intruders pilfered Social Security numbers and other personal information on an unknown number of NASA employees who worked for the agency between July 2006 and October 2018, according to an internal memo issued this week.  NASA is still conducting an investigation, but what I can tell you is that on Oct. 23, 2018, NASA cybersecurity personnel began investigating the potential compromise of two NASA servers,  agency spokeswoman Karen Northon said.  One of the servers contained personally identifiable information on current and past NASA employees and these data may have been exfiltrated.  She added that  the agency is continuing its efforts to secure all servers, and is reviewing its processes and procedures to ensure the latest security practices are followed. Gaps in cybersecurity are not new for NASA. In May, the Government Accountability Office called for  urgent action  to plug holes in its cybersecurity operations, while the agency s own inspector general concluded at the time that NASA s cybersecurity nerve center had fallen short, citing the  agency s failure to develop an effective IT governance structure, the lack of necessary authorities, and frequent turnover.  Its last significant known breach was in 2016, when hackers stole the information of more than 2,000 NASA employees and managed to wrest control of a Global Hawk drone. MILESTONE: Dream Chaser gets NASA approval. The space agency has approved for full production the reusable space plane built by Sierra Nevada after a  critical design review.  John Curry, the company s program director, called it  a major indication we are on the right path,  while co-owner and CEO Fatih Ozmen said,  We are one step closer to the Dream Chaser spacecraft s first orbital flight.  The Dream Chaser, selected by NASA to provide cargo services under its Commercial Resupply Service-2 program,  is slated to service the International Space Station as early as late 2020,  the company added.  Production includes both the uncrewed Dream Chaser winged vehicle and the cargo module, which remains attached to the winged vehicle during orbital operations.  I M MOVING TO MARS : That s the title of a four-part series of documentary shorts premiering Jan. 3 on Topic.com. It s produced by the Dutch Mars One project that intends to prepare two dozen volunteers to permanently colonize Mars beginning in 2032   or at least that s the vision.The series profiles five of 100 men and women selected from 4,227 applicants. They hail from all walks of life   from architect to janitor   but have one thing in common: they re all stargazing dreamers. The prospect of moving to Mars is  giving me kind of something to look forward to,  beyond  the mundanities of life,  says would-be Mars inhabitant Kay Radzik. Another, Peter Degan-Portnoy, says he s eager for the one-way trip to overcome his biggest fear:  to get to the end of my life and feel as though I haven t done all that I could do. How serious is the enterprise?  The group will eventually be pared down to 24, and then those candidates will begin ten years of training,  it says.  Finally, in groups of two men and two women, half of these space pioneers will fly to Mars. None will return.  But Mars One is not building any hardware and its  funding model is based on the commercial value of that adventure, donations, and several other revenue sources,  according to its website, which estimates the endeavor will cost $6 billion. Radzik put it mildly:  Mars has a 24-hour day. It has gravity. It has water. It has...some challenges. STOCKING STUFFERS: For all you procrastinators there may still be time to get your hands on some last-minute gifts for the space geeks in your life. How about a desk model of SpaceX s Falcon 9 rocket? Or a pair of  Space Voyager  Vans? For the kiddos, Lego also makes model kits for NASA s Mars Rover and the Saturn V rocket, according to Florida Today, which has a rundown of some out-of-this-world gift ideas. National Geographic is also making and checking its list for map lovers and travelers, which includes posters printed from high-resolution satellite imagery.

                            House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Speaker Paul Ryan speak after meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesWHERE WE ARE   THE GOVERNMENT is going to shut down at midnight.   DEFENSE SECRETARY JIM MATTIS resigned, essentially saying that, after four decades of military service, much at the highest levels, he has made the determination that he cannot represent PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP S worldview. Allies and members of Congress were shaken by the announcement   THE PRESIDENT is pulling the military out of Syria and mulling a plan to withdraw thousands of U.S. troops from Afghanistan against the wishes of military brass, and policymakers.  THE MARKET is near free fall. The S&P is down nearly 17%, erasing a meaningful portion of the gains since the election.Happy Friday. FIRST IN PLAYBOOK -- NANCY PELOSI will sit down with MSNBC s JOY REID on Jan. 4 at her alma mater, Trinity Washington University, for a town hall that will air at 10 p.m. that evening. The vote for speaker is Jan. 3. THE STEP BACK -- ANDREW RESTUCCIA,  Trump stuffs political grenades in Washington s Christmas stocking: The president s moves on a border wall and military operations stun the political establishment, cost him a defense secretary   and trigger  one of the most chaotic weeks that we ve ever seen in American government.  WHAT WE EXPECT TODAY -- THE SENATE will gavel in at noon, and, at some point thereafter, will begin consideration of the stopgap funding bill that the HOUSE passed. It will fail in the Senate -- there is zero doubt about that. THERE IS A CHANCE the Senate will keep the $8 billion in disaster money in the bill, but that does not solve the core problem that the president had: he wants more border money. AT THIS MOMENT, SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER (D-N.Y.) and INCOMING SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI (D-CALIF.) have no incentive at all to negotiate with Republicans. Zero. Schumer and Pelosi were in agreement with SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY.) that they needed to pass a short-term spending bill until Feb. 8. So now, it s incumbent upon Republicans -- who decided to abandon that plan -- to figure out how to keep government open, or reopen it when it s closed.RIGHT NOW, there are a few off ramps that we see (in no particular order)   -- DISASTER AID ONLY   FIRST, SPEAKER PAUL RYAN, who is in the last days of his tenure in Congress, could put the Senate-passed stopgap with disaster relief and no increase in border money on the floor. There were around 400 lawmakers who voted yesterday.-- UPTICK IN BORDER FUNDS   IF RYAN WON T PUT THAT ON THE FLOOR -- a possibility, considering the backlash to legislation without an uptick in border money -- Ryan and McConnell could try to strike some deal that would increase the $1.3 billion of border money to the original offer of $1.6 billion or something thereabouts. This would be tough, because the president already rejected that offer, so why would Schumer put it back on the table without some give on the GOP side? -- A SHORT SHUTDOWN   It s only Friday Dec. 21. On Sunday Dec. 23, two days before Christmas and there s no deal in sight people might get damn tired of being in D.C. If there are a bunch of absences, the number for passage in the House gets lower, and the governing coalition could get skewed. Ryan might be convinced to ditch Jordan and Meadows just before Christmas Eve. And who knows how Trump will react. Mar-a-Lago is nice this time of year.-- A LONG SHUTDOWN   There seems to be a significant chance that a shutdown could last until Jan. 3, when PELOSI takes over as speaker. That would be a long, grinding shutdown. But the president could make it less painful, and less dangerous for the homeland. -- TRUMP FOLDS?   THIS SEEMS THE LEAST LIKELY. The president is dug in, and needs something to reopen government.IF THE GOVERNMENT REMAINS SHUTTERED, Congress is going to have to stay in session in some way, shape or form.

He ended it by announcing the exit of the man U.S. allies see as the last guardrail against the president s erratic behavior: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose resignation letter was a scathing rebuke of Trump s worldview. At perhaps the most fragile moment of his presidency   and vulnerable to convulsions on the political right   Trump single-handedly propelled the U.S. government into crisis and sent markets tumbling with his gambits this week to salvage signature campaign promises. The president s decisions and conduct have led to a fracturing of Trump s coalition.  Hawks condemned his sudden decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. Conservatives called him a  gutless president  and questioned whether he would ever build a wall. Political friends began privately questioning whether Trump needed to be reined in.  WaPo-- RACHAEL BADE:   I m okay with a shutdown : Inside the chaos of the House GOP s last days WHERE THE PRESIDENT STANDS -- (@realDonaldTrump) at 10:13 p.m.:  Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall.

We must also maintain a clear-eyed understanding of our friends and foes, and recognize that nations like Russia are among the latter.  So I was sorry to learn that Secretary Mattis, who shares those clear principles, will soon depart the Administration. But I am particularly distressed that he is resigning due to sharp differences with the President on these and other key aspects of America s global leadership.  It is regrettable that the President must now choose a new Secretary of Defense. But I urge him to select a leader who shares Secretary Mattis s understanding of these vital principles and his total commitment to America s servicemembers.  -- NYT S HELENE COOPER:  Mr. Mattis had repeatedly told friends and aides over recent months that he viewed his responsibility to protect the United States  1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary as defense secretary to a mercurial president.   Officials said Mr. Mattis went to the White House with his resignation letter already written, but nonetheless made a last attempt at persuading the president to reverse his decision about Syria, which Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday over the objections of his senior advisers.  Mr. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, was rebuffed. Returning to the Pentagon, he asked aides to print out 50 copies of his resignation letter and distribute them around the building.  NYT   The letter--  Mattis departure sends shock waves abroad as allies question U.S. approach to global crises,  by WaPo s Isaac Stanley-Becker, Pamela Constable and Joanna Slater:  In volatile regions of the world that bear the imprint of decades-long American influence, there was fresh concern about the consequences of an increasingly inward-looking United States.

POLITICOTHE LATEST ON AFGHANISTAN --  Trump Orders Big Troop Reduction in Afghanistan,  by WSJ s Gordon Lubold and Jessica Donati:  A day after a contested decision to pull American military forces from Syria, officials said Thursday that President Trump has ordered the start of a reduction of American forces in Afghanistan. More than 7,000 American troops will begin to return home from Afghanistan in the coming weeks, a U.S. official said.  The move will come as the first stage of a phased drawdown and the start of a conclusion to the 17-year war that officials say could take at least many months. There now are more than 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.  WSJA message from AARP:

Fuentes, the 36-year-old deputy White House chief of staff, had a plan. Mr. Fuentes told colleagues that after his mentor, John F. Kelly, left his job as chief of staff at the end of the year, he would  hide out  at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House, for six months, remaining on the payroll in a nebulous role. Then, in July, when he had completed 19 years of service in the Coast Guard, Mr. Fuentes   an active-duty officer   would take advantage of an early retirement program. The program, referred to as temporary early retirement authority, had lapsed for Coast Guard officials at the end of the 2018 fiscal year, and, according to people briefed on the discussions, Department of Homeland Security officials began pressing Congress in November to reinstate it.  Administration officials said they had been told that Mr. Fuentes discussed the program with officials at the Department of Homeland Security, and after reporters raised questions with lawmakers of both parties, a provision to reinstate it was abruptly pulled from a House bill on Wednesday.

The extraordinary unofficial line of communication arose in the final year of the Obama administration   in the midst of what multiple U.S. intelligence agencies have said was a secret campaign by the Kremlin to interfere in the US election. Russian agents ostensibly trying to track ISIS instead pressed their American counterparts for private financial documents on at least two dozen dissidents, academics, private investigators, and American citizens.  BuzzFeed-- UPDATE    Ex-Senate aide gets 2 months in prison for lying to FBI,  by Josh Gerstein and Matthew Choi:  In a recent court filing, prosecutors accused [former Senate Intelligence Committee security director James] Wolfe of regularly sharing sensitive information with  multiple young, female reporters.  Wolfe in his guilty plea admitted to lying about his contacts with four reporters.  None of them are named, but one appears to be Ali Watkins, a New York Times journalist who formerly worked for BuzzFeed and POLITICO. Wolfe conceded that he initially denied any personal relationship with any of these reporters to the FBI, but after being confronted with photographs of himself and Watkins, he acknowledged having a personal relationship with her for several years.

Ruiz, Nick Kulish and Kim Barker:  The Justice Department is investigating possible misuse of federal money by Southwest Key Programs, the nation s largest operator of shelters for migrant children, according to two people familiar with the matter. The inquiry could upend shelter care for thousands of children, escalating government scrutiny of the nonprofit even as it remains central to the Trump administration s immigration agenda. The charity operates 24 shelters to house children who were separated from their parents at the border or arrived on their own. ... The inquiry comes after a New York Times report this month detailing possible financial improprieties by Southwest Key, which has collected $1.7 billion in federal grants in the past decade, including $626 million in the last year alone.  NYTKNOWING JIM JEFFREY --  A  Never Trumper  bets on Trump, and loses,  by Nahal Toosi:  James Jeffrey, President Donald Trump s special representative for Syria engagement, probably should have seen it coming. In August 2016, the well-respected veteran diplomat signed an open letter denouncing then-presidential candidate Trump as a danger to America.  In our experience,  Jeffrey and dozens of fellow  Never Trumpers  wrote,  a president must be willing to listen to his advisers and department heads [and] must encourage consideration of conflicting views.  Trump, they argued, is  erratic  and  acts impetuously.  This week Trump blindsided his national security team, including Jeffrey, by announcing that he will be pulling U.S. troops from war-torn Syria. Just two days earlier, Jeffrey had delivered a high-profile speech forecasting a sustained U.S. role in the Arab country. And with that, the 70-something Jeffrey became the latest in a long line of Trump administration officials to be undermined and even humiliated by the president they serve.

Limbaugh, like Ann Coulter, Breitbart and several Fox News hosts and guests, were uncharacteristically critical of Trump for wavering on his threat to shut down the government if he didn t get $5 billion for his border wall.    As he obsessively monitored mounting criticism from the right that cast him as an inept negotiator who is being rolled by Congressional Democrats, Trump came to second-guess his earlier decision,  POLITICO s Eliana Johnson and Burgess Everett report. Trump  seethed and panicked about the stream of invective he s hearing from allies on television,  they write, adding that he did  personal damage control to assuage an angry Rush Limbaugh. Story Continued Below  So it appears a handful of conservative hosts and commentators helped convince the president of the United States to potentially shut down the government, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees working without pay or furloughed, all in an effort to get taxpayers to fund a border wall that Trump repeatedly promised would be paid for by Mexico.    This is government by infotainment,  tweeted Philadelphia Inquirer/Daily News columnist Will Bunch, who, borrowing from Neil Postman, suggested  America [is] literally amusing itself to death. GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO MORNING MEDIA: Of course the other major story yesterday was Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigning after Trump announced a U.S. withdrawal from Syria. As POLITICO s Andrew Restuccia writes,  Trump stuffs political grenades in Washington s Christmas stocking.  Speaking of, this newsletter is going dark next week for the holidays. See you in the new year! Daniel Lippman (dlippman@politico.com/ @dlippman) contributed. Subscribe. Archives.DURING THE OBAMA YEARS, writes New York Magazine s Jonathan Chait,  conservative media promoted a series of government shutdown threats out of the belief that they could be used to make Obama give them policy concessions.  Now, he writes,  they re not going along with the plan of pretending the wall is getting built, and instead they re demanding Trump shut down the government to get the wall. COVERING THE CHAOS:  At perhaps the most fragile moment of his presidency   and vulnerable to convulsions on the political right   Trump single-handedly propelled the U.S. government into crisis and sent markets tumbling with his gambits this week to salvage signature campaign promises,  The Washington Post s Philip Rucker, Robert Costa and Josh Dawsey write.   Inside the Oval Office on Thursday,  they write,  Trump was in what one Republican close to the White House described as  a tailspin,  acting  totally irrationally  and  flipping out  over criticisms in the media. CALLING  BULLSHIT  ON LIVE TV: Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono suggested Thursday night on MSNBC that Trump changed his mind because of  some right-wing loud people yelling at him on Fox News.  Hirono added that  any effort on his part to blame the Democrats will be such bullshit that as I said before I would hardly be able to stand it.  LACHLAN MURDOCH NAMED  MISINFORMER OF THE YEAR : Media Matters, the progressive watchdog that closely monitors conservative media, named 21st Century Fox executive chairman Lachlan Murdoch today as its 2018  Misinformer of the Year,  a distinction that has gone in the past to Mark Zuckerberg, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and his father, Rupert Murdoch. The Murdoch son was selected for his role overseeing Fox News.    The Murdochs  Fox News, a uniquely destructive force in American public life that ushered in an era of post-truth politics, has been unleashed under President Donald Trump,  writes Media Matters senior fellow Matt Gertz.  The network now functions as a propaganda outlet for his administration, embracing any level of extremism, deceit, and bigotry necessary to promote the president s message while scorning basic principles of journalistic ethics.

EX-SENATE AIDE GETS 2 MONTHS FOR LYING ABOUT PRESS DEALINGS:  Former Senate Intelligence Committee security director James Wolfe was sentenced on Thursday to two months in prison for lying to the FBI about his interactions with journalists,  POLITICO s Josh Gerstein and Matthew Choi report. THE DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING TO AVOID relegating some 2020 candidates to an  undercard  primary debate, as was the case for Republicans when they had a sprawling field in 2016.  Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez announced on Thursday that the party would split up candidates by random selection and host debates on consecutive nights if there were too many candidates,  writes POLITICO s Alex Thompson.  The DNC plans on hosting 12 debates during the primary cycle, beginning in June 2019. Thompson writes that  there are still more details to be sorted out in the coming months such as sponsors, final dates, and locations.   My main wish for presidential debates is NO LIVE AUDIENCE. The audience disrupts, the candidates pander to it, it eats time and makes the debates less substantive and serious.

POLITICO s Ben Schreckinger looks back on how it all began by talking to former Trump social media manager Justin McConney, who initially posted the tweets.    The moment I found out Trump could tweet himself was comparable to the moment in  Jurassic Park  when Dr. Grant realized that velociraptors could open doors,  recalled McConney, who was the Trump Organization s director of social media from 2011 to 2017.  I was like,  Oh no.    McConney, who left the Trump Organization last year, warned that the president needs to up his social media game in gearing up for 2020.  He needs to return to engaging directly with his fans again,  said McConney, who suggested he use the  Stories  function on Instagram.  He should be live streaming from the Oval Office,  McConney said.David Shribman, executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for the past 16 years, is stepping down.

                        Trump gave a green light to his party s hard-liners, and the House Republican majority ends with Washington barreling into another crisis of its own making.
                    By RACHAEL BADE12/20/2018 11:19 PM ESTHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows picked up the phone early Thursday morning and dialed up a frustrated Donald Trump for yet another pep talk.The president was agitated over suggestions in the conservative media that he was caving on his border wall campaign promise. He had just taken to Twitter to downplay the importance of securing new wall funding before Christmas and suggested he d fight for the wall next Congress   GOP leadership s preferred strategy to avoid a shutdown.Story Continued BelowBut Meadows, who is close with the president and was recently in the running to be his next chief of staff, urged Trump to make a stand now before Democrats took the House in January   just as he had the night before and multiple times earlier in the week. Stick to your guns, the North Carolina Republican told the president, according to a source familiar with the conversation. We conservatives will have your back. And now is the last best chance to fight.Never mind that half the Senate had left town for the holidays having voice-voted passage of a temporary funding bill without wall money, all while Democrats sang Christmas carols on the floor. And never mind that House GOP leaders were already twisting arms in their caucus to support a proposal they thought the White House wanted.A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Not four hours later, the president hauled Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other GOP leaders to the West Wing and instructed them to change course. And they did. I m OK with a shutdown,  Trump told the group, according to two sources in the room.The hard-liners had defeated leadership once again, and Washington was barreling into another crisis of its own making with no endgame in sight. It s the quintessential ending to the fractious eight-year House GOP majority, which was dominated by knife fights between GOP leaders and conservatives. Since Republicans took power on a tea party wave in 2010, hard-liners have tried to force their more pragmatic-minded leaders further right   ultimately driving one speaker, John Boehner, out of town and threatening to do the same to his replacement, Ryan.When Trump came to Washington, these conservatives found a more willing partner in a powerful position. And over the past two years, they ve perfected a strategy of circumventing GOP leadership by appealing to Trump and his instincts to please the base.They squashed Ryan s initial Obamacare repeal bill because it wasn t conservative enough. They trampled the speaker s attempt to craft a moderate GOP immigration proposal with a fix for Dreamers. And now, they re ending two years of Republican hegemony over Washington by cheering Trump to shutter a quarter of the federal government just days before Christmas if he doesn t get his wall.  There is a bad case of Potomac fever up here in Washington, D.C. They forget what they promised the American people,  Meadows said late Wednesday night on the House floor.  Mr. President, we re going to back you up if you veto this bill  But more importantly the American people will be there, they ll be there to support you. Meadows would not comment on his Thursday morning exchange with the president. But his success   and that of the conservatives aligned with him   speaks for itself. By the time Trump called the Republican lawmakers to the White House, GOP leaders said little to push back on their right flank. They d won this round.
                    congress
                    By SARAH FERRIS and JOHN BRESNAHANAs Washington peers over the abyss of its third shutdown in two years, some Republicans see signs of a broken institution. Thousands of federal employees could be furloughed or forced to work without pay. And House Republicans as of Thursday night were embracing the chaos.Outgoing Rep. Carlos Curbelo said his colleagues should know better.  Until a centrist coalition emerges that puts the breaks on this car and turns it around,  he said,  it s only going to get worse.  Unfortunately, some people around here put their career and their positions of power above the interests of the institution and the country,  said the Florida moderate, who lost his reelection.  And until that changes, until we have statesmen and states women, this will continue going on. He jabbed at Meadows as well:  Our Freedom Caucus colleagues, they probably know that their relevance is going to be completely diminished next Congress, so this is kind of like a last gasp, but we know how this ends. Perhaps senior Republicans should have seen this coming. When Trump signed their previous $1 trillion spending bill last spring, he chided Congress for sending him a document that didn t include much wall money and warned he d never sign a similar bill again.It s why GOP leaders devised a strategy this summer to pass several mini appropriations packages, hoping smaller doses would be easier for Trump to swallow. The strategy would also minimize the impact of a shutdown, should Trump take it that far, since multiple agencies would already be funded.When the end of the fiscal year approached in late September, just days before the critical midterm elections, GOP leaders begged Trump not to veto a short-term spending bill that extended funding for seven agencies to December 7. A shutdown before the election, they said, would crush their already dimming prospects.They got their wish. Trump backed down again. But as part of the agreement, GOP leaders promised once again that they d fight for Trump s border wall after the election   even to the point of a shutdown.He wasn t the only one they made that vow to. Conservative Rep. Andy Biggs had approached a Republican leader about putting a wall funding bill on the House floor just before the election, convinced it would turn out the base. The leader   he wouldn t say who   told him Republicans would fight after the election.  What they said was,  We will have that fight, that debate, after the midterms,   the Arizona Republican said.  Where is the fight? Yet something clearly changed in leadership s calculus. Senior Republicans, wary of a shutdown, thought perhaps they could get the president to punt on his border wall fight again. They found the perfect excuse when President George H.W. Bush died in early December. And they moved the new deadline   Dec. 21   to just days before Christmas.As the new deadline approached, both parties were eager to escape for the holidays. During a Tuesday evening phone call, Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell discussed a plan to extend government funding into early February, delaying the border fight yet again. The Kentucky Republican told associates that he believed he received Trump s blessing for the plan, sources familiar with the negotiations say. But White House officials were later unsure.Trump s lack of public support didn t matter to the Senate. After Vice President Mike Pence assured Republicans that Trump would sign the funding bill with no wall money, the upper chamber passed the measure by voice vote late Wednesday night.But even before the Senate vote, House GOP leaders knew they had a problem. A majority of Republicans opposed any bill that didn t have wall money. A tentative whip check Wednesday night showed broad GOP opposition   not only from Freedom Caucus-types but more traditional Republicans who typically align with the leadership.At the Capitol Hill Club that night, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney started buttonholing his former colleagues to gauge their thoughts on the spending proposal. The former lawmaker who once cheered shutdowns was now on the other side of the coin   but he quickly learned at the GOP hangout that his old friends hate the Senate-passed bill.By the next morning, during a closed-door Republican conference meeting, the objections reached a crescendo. House Budget Committee Chairman Steve Womack, a staunch leadership ally who hasn t spoken up in conference during eight years in Congress, stood to encourage leaders to fight for the wall. War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things,  he read from a John Stuart Mills passage.  The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. Texas Republican Roger Williams quoted legendary Texas Christian University coach Dutch Meyer, whom he said his deceased father used to parrot in times of hardship:  Fight  em until hell freezes over. Then fight  em on the ice!  At one point, McCarthy tried to argue that he wanted to have a vote on the wall funding last week. Someone in the room shouted  bullshit!  Conference is in full rebellion,  one lawmaker texted.  I ve never seen a conference meeting like that,  said another.It was in the middle of this GOP venting session that the president called Ryan. The president had just spoken with Meadows again. And after watching Fox News and other conservative commentators  criticism of the strategy late into the evening, he was having second thoughts about delaying the border fight.
                    White House
                    By ANDREW RESTUCCIAHe then turned his ire on GOP leaders publicly. When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership,  Trump wrote on Twitter, just after the conversation with Ryan.  Would be done by end of year (NOW). It didn t happen! We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good! That s when about a dozen House GOP lawmakers were summoned to the White House to try to hash out a plan. Freedom Caucus co-founder Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) agued that the House had to push for $5 billion in wall funding because they told voters they would. Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Missouri) warned of potential consequences to a wall-fueled shutdown in suburban districts like her own, where the party suffered a serious bloodbath on Election Night.Republican Study Committee Chair Mark Walker, a new conservative member of the leadership team, encouraged the president to frame whatever happened as a sincere attempt to protect the American people. The North Carolina Republican also noted that Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi might try to rub it in their faces if the House couldn t get the votes to pass a stop-gap with wall money.Shahira Knight, a top Trump aide, interjected several times to float a more pragmatic approach. The White House legislative affairs chief suggested that House Republicans should perhaps go for a lower number that had a greater possibility of passing the Senate.Meadows disagreed, arguing that $5 billion was possible, according to two sources in the room.At one point, someone warned that a shutdown would benefit Democrats. But Trump said he was fine with that. He blessed the change in strategy, noting that his fans want the wall   and so did he. He was embracing it. He was at peace with it,  said one source in the room of Trump s mood.  I think he was trying to go along with the McConnell-Ryan strategy  and it wasn t natural for him. He is more of a rabble rouser . We asked him today,  Mr. President, are you sure you re 100 percent committed to this?  He was a kid in a candy store. That was it. Ryan left the room, walked outside to a group of reporters and delivered a very different message than he, McConnell and McCarthy initially settled on. The president said he will not sign this bill,  Ryan said.  So we are going to go back and work on adding border security to this. The House passed a bill with wall funding Thursday night but it s going nowhere fast in the Senate. Congress has until Friday at midnight to prevent a shutdown, the third in Trump s presidency and all under GOP control of Congress.Eliana Johnson and John Bresnahan contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    By ANDREW RESTUCCIA12/20/2018 10:13 PM ESTAt least by the standards of President Donald Trump s Washington, things were calm when the city awoke Wednesday morning. A budget showdown with Congress appeared headed for an anticlimactic deal. With a new White House chief of staff installed, Trump s Cabinet and staff shuffling seemed done for now. The outside world was relatively quiet.Story Continued BelowThirty-six hours later, a series of startling Trump actions and their reverberations had turned a peaceful pre-holiday stretch into what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proclaimed  one of the most chaotic weeks that we ve ever seen in American government. By Thursday afternoon, Trump was warning that he would shut down the federal government over his demand for $5 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. He announced a U.S. withdrawal from Syria that shocked allies and many of his senior officials, and is also reportedly preparing for a major drawdown of troops from Afghanistan. By Thursday evening, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had announced his resignation in a pointed letter implicitly critical of Trump s policies.Critics were horrified.  This is scary,  the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, said of Mattis  resignation. Longtime GOP allies of the president, including Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, trashed his Syria decision. Other Republicans were angry that they might need to delay holiday vacations for a budget fight they consider impulsive and unwinnable.

Trump, after all, was simply delivering on longtime promises. I thought the Trump presidency might be mortally wounded 48 hours ago, but his base may have saved him from himself   and congressional Republicans,  said conservative Iowa radio host Steve Deace.It s unclear how long that goodwill can last, however.Even some stalwart Trump allies are privately expressing new levels of concern about the president s erratic behavior. Many Trump defenders in Congress, for instance, are foreign policy hawks who see Trump s planned Syria exit as a dangerous capitulation to Iran and Russia. (Some noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom Trump has long shown a curious admiration, expressed personal approval for the decision.)Meanwhile, a Congress in which Senate Democrats have the effective veto power of the filibuster is highly unlikely to give him $5 billion for border security. That suggests an inevitable abandonment of his demands for wall funding. He s listening to his political instincts and putting his campaign promises above everything else,  said Republican strategist Alex Castellanos  Trump s political instincts are reliably on-target, but only if that target is his base. They don t reach beyond that. Yet Trump seems more confident than ever in his own gut instinct. He is now surrounded by advisers who applaud his impulses, instead of fighting against them. The departures of Mattis and chief of staff John Kelly, a former Marine general who sought to rein in the president s behavior, leave almost no one at senior levels of his government perceived as trying to check his behavior. Trump s incoming acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has already signaled that he will not try to constrain Trump. This is a sad day for America because Secretary Mattis was giving advice the President needs to hear,  Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska said in a statement on Thursday night.  You always had the feeling that the combination of John Kelly and Jim Mattis, that at least there was a group of individuals who could serve as a check on the president in terms of his worst instincts,  said Leon Panetta, who served a secretary of Defense and CIA director in the Obama administration and as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. Now you begin to get a sense   and the Syria decision is probably the best example of it   that the president is operating by his own instincts and tweets out whatever policy he wants to implement without any kind of discussion with the key people in his administration,  Panetta added.

                    By WESLEY MORGANAt the same time, Trump s Cabinet is quickly emptying out. The Senate will now be tasked with confirming new leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department, the Justice Department and the Defense Department in the coming months. Nearly lost amid other uproars was new drama at DOJ, where two revelations that might normally have dominated the news went nearly unnoticed.First, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump s pick to lead the department, William Barr, had sent an unsolicited note to the agency earlier this year decrying special counsel Robert Mueller s investigative decisions. Hours later, it emerged that Trump s acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, had rejected the advice of DOJ ethics officials that he recuse himself from overseeing Mueller s probe. But the focus Thursday was on spending bills and U.S. troop deployments abroad. Trump officials noted that the president has long telegraphed his interest in pulling out of Syria.  We ll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon,  he declared at a March rally. But the timing of the decision nonetheless blindsided many in the administration as well as members of Congress. Graham, a staunch Trump ally, lambasted the move, calling it a  disaster  and   in the ultimate insult to Trump   deemed it an  Obama-like decision. Meanwhile Democrats called his about-face on the spending talks   earlier this week Trump had signaled that he would accept a short-term spending measure without border wall funding   a reckless step toward a holiday government shutdown. President Trump is plunging the country into chaos,  Schumer told reporters.Yet Trump will likely shrug off dire warnings from Democrats so long as his base is happy. And on foreign policy in particular, it is far from clear that Trump voters will share the alarm over his Syria and Afghanistan that pulsed through Washington foreign policy circles this week. It s why he got elected,  said Mark Perry, a military historian and journalist who has chronicled Mattis  tenure at the Defense Department.  I defy a Democrat to run against Donald Trump and tell the American people that we ought to stay in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria and see how many votes they get.

                    By SARAH FERRIS and JOHN BRESNAHANStephen Miller, Trump s top policy adviser, struck a similar note during a Thursday evening CNN interview. The media that s having this hysterical reaction to James Mattis retiring is the same media in many cases, the same politicians in many cases, who cheered our nation into a war in Iraq that turned out to be an absolute catastrophe,  he said.  This president got elected to get our foreign policy back on the right track after years of being adrift. By Thursday night, White House aides felt whipsawed by the rush of news emanating from the Oval Office as they, too, toggled between the announcement of Mattis  departure, a potential government shutdown, the sudden removal of U.S. troops from Syria, and the soon-to-be reign of the White House s third chief of staff.One of the few top aides who seemed genuinely happy this week also happens to be leaving soon: John Kelly, who was smiling and joking as he attended meetings and walked around the West Wing.The mood in the White House by Thursday afternoon felt far different than one year prior, when aides were tired but elated by the passage of a Republican tax reform bill. Trump signed the legislation into law on Dec. 22, allowing him to close the year with his only major legislative win.Now he is headed toward the likely gridlock of a divided Congress. But few observers expect him to seek compromise. We ve had past presidents that have made campaign promises but that ultimately recognized that the reality of the situation demands that they change their position,  Panetta said.  This is a president that doesn t allow reality to interfere with whatever the hell he wants to get done.  Nancy Cook and Eliana Johnson contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                        government shutdown 2018
                        Republican senators say they ve done their job, and now it s up to Trump and the House to figure something out.
                    By BURGESS EVERETT12/20/2018 03:18 PM ESTBob Corker could only laugh at Republicans  predicament as President Donald Trump vowed not to sign the Senate s stopgap spending bill. He laughed harder still when Ted Cruz walked by and insisted the party must fund the border wall. The retiring GOP senator seemed almost punch-drunk on the chaos of the last few days as Trump again threatens a shutdown over border wall funding that Democrats simply won t give him. But Corker said there was little to do other than sit back, watch the shutdown circus and keep a good sense of humor.Story Continued Below  Well, why not?  Corker responded when asked about his laughter.  You can t make this stuff up. Y all have fun.  The Foreign Relations chairman s colleagues might not have been in such good spirits, but Senate Republicans seem sanguine about their decision to pass a stopgap spending bill that the president now says he won t sign. Most of them have already left for the holidays, though they re prepared to return at short notice if needed to vote on critical government funding legislation.The 2020 Election. The New Congress.

In their view, they ve done their job and now it s up to the House and the president to work something out. In theory, the Senate could come back Friday to vote on a bill providing Trump with his $5 billion for the border wall; it would almost certainly either be defeated or the wall funding would be stripped out. But the Senate GOP seems unworried about the day ahead and the potential for a partial shutdown in 24 hours. More than half of the 51-member conference has skipped town and they were all caught flat-footed by the president s news. During lunch, a handful of GOP senators learned of the president s decision over Twitter, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) left the room quickly to talk to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). The rest of the Republicans trickled out, relatively unworried about the path ahead.   Who knows, this could all change in 30 minutes,  said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a shutdown battle veteran, looked at his watch when asked how he was feeling about a potential shutdown:  It s only 2 clock. Quite a bit of even this day left.  Still, he said he might be more worried in a day.  It s hard to come up with politics that are worse than shutdown politics. Unless it s shutdown at Christmas politics,  Blunt said. Cruz (R-Texas), who had evidently hit Corker s funny bone, was tut-tutting his party for ignoring him. He wanted the GOP to pass legislation through budget reconciliation to evade Democratic filibusters and fund the wall, which would have required the support of 50 GOP senators and all manner of parliamentary tactics. But he said such an attempt would have been better than being at the political whims of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).

                    By SARAH FERRIS and JOHN BRESNAHAN  The Democratic obstruction we re seeing right now, that handwriting was on the wall. It was clear it was coming anyway. Unfortunately, my suggestion wasn t followed,  he said. Schumer came to the floor to say no matter what tactics Trump uses now, he won t get what he wants.  If President Trump vetoed a short-term spending bill, he would no doubt compound the serious errors he s made throughout this budget process,  Schumer said.  Most importantly, it would not move the needle an inch towards the president getting his wall.  The political maneuvering fell flat with Corker, who is far more concerned with the president s decision to abruptly pull U.S. forces out of Syria. The fighting over the border wall was entertaining enough to him, but not necessarily worth coming back to D.C. for.  I may not see y all for a while,  Corker said. So he s not coming back even if the Senate votes again?  I doubt it. Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning   in your inbox.

                        criminal justice reform
                    By HEATHER CAYGLE12/20/2018 02:06 PM ESTThe House overwhelmingly passed a major overhaul of the nation s criminal justice laws on Thursday, marking a bipartisan achievement for lawmakers in both chambers and President Donald Trump in the waning days of the 115th Congress.  The bill cleared the House 358-36 after passing in the Senate earlier this week. Trump, who used his bully pulpit to prod reluctant Senate GOP leaders to take action on the legislation, is expected to sign the bill into law by Friday.Story Continued Below The final House vote follows an intense, yearlong lobbying effort from an unexpected group of allies including Trump s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Kim Kardashian, the American Civil Liberties Union, liberal Democrats, conservative Republicans and the Koch network. A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.  We have an incredible coalition of the unusual suspects,  said New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the lead Democratic sponsor in the House. Jeffries worked for months with Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), Kushner and others to keep the bill alive, even as former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and some Senate Republicans worked behind the scenes to tank it.   If you have a situation where Democrats and Republicans, progressives and conservatives, the left and the right, the ACLU and the Koch brothers, Doug Collins and Hakeem Jeffries  along with Trump are all on the same page, this should happen now,  Jeffries said.  The overhaul is a huge victory for a Congress that has struggled to pass major bipartisan bills in Trump s first two years.  And the bill s passage comes as Congress is teetering on the brink of yet another government shutdown. House Republicans were in disarray Thursday over whether to pass a simple funding bill or dig in and fight for Trump s $5 billion border wall with government funding set to expire Friday.  The criminal justice bill passed the Senate on an 87-12 vote Tuesday, just days after some senior senators were declaring the legislation dead until the next Congress.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was reluctant to bring up the bill for a vote given the deep divisions within his conference. McConnell, who ultimately relented after repeated pressure from Trump, supported the bill in the end.  The legislation increases funding for educational and vocational training for prisoners in a bid to reduce recidivism rates. The bill also equalizes sentencing for drug offenses involving crack cocaine and powder cocaine. The change is retroactive, meaning it would reduce the sentences for thousands of prisoners currently in jail on crack convictions.

                    By JASON SCHWARTZ The bill also makes some changes to mandatory minimum laws for drug offenses, including giving federal judges discretion to make exceptions on a case-by-case basis. And the legislation reduces the three-strike penalty from life in prison to 25 years.   This will keep our communities safer, and provide hope and a second chance, to those who earn it,  Trump tweeted earlier this week.  In addition to everything else, billions of dollars will be saved.

                    By ELIANA JOHNSON and BURGESS EVERETT12/20/2018 01:56 PM EST
                    Updated 12/20/2018 05:15 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump reversed his position on a possible government shutdown Thursday amid rising anger from his conservative base on several fronts.As Trump obsessively monitored criticism from the right casting him as an inept negotiator being rolled by Congressional Democrats, he came to second-guess his earlier decision to sign a bill that would keep the government funded through Feb. 8. He has alternately seethed and panicked about the stream of invective he s hearing from allies on television, lashing out at aides and flailing for a solution, according to three people close to the president   and even doing damage control with an angry Rush Limbaugh. Story Continued Below The president is ginning for a fight   he wants to fight, he needs to fight,  said one person close to Trump shortly after the president told House leaders earlier Thursday that, in a dramatic change of position, he would not sign a stopgap bill passed by the Senate last night. This is a political issue where there s a line in the sand,  the person added, noting that  Build the Wall!  was a signature Trump 2016 campaign chant that is hard for his base to forget.Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what s driving the afternoon in Washington.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.In recent days Trump has endured some of the harshest commentary of his presidency from typically staunch allies, who say that he is capitulating to Democratic opposition. The conservative commentator Ann Coulter said on Wednesday that Trump will have had a  joke presidency  if he doesn t build his long-promised border wall. Filling in for Fox News  Sean Hannity that night, the conservative commentator Dan Bongino said of the Trump base:  They want their wall and they want it now. Mark Meadows, the Trump ally who chairs the House Freedom Caucus and was a lead candidate for White House chief of staff, said Wednesday morning that the short-term funding bill the president is considering would be a  Christmas present  to his Democratic opponents. Meadows and his fellow House conservatives have come out against any spending bill that does not include billions of dollars for a border wall.Before a bill signing on Thursday afternoon, Trump gave White House reporters a definitive statement:  I ve made my position very clear: any measure that funds the government has to include border security,  Trump said. Lobbying via cable news works,  said a former senior White House official.  He was all set to sign before last night s barrage from House conservatives. The government spending showdown is just one of several issues drawing anger from Trump s party, along with his abrupt announcement of a U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria and his support for a criminal justice reform bill passed by the House and Senate this week. For good measure, the stock market   which Trump monitors closely   continued its steady decline Thursday deeper into negative territory for the year, a move some market analysts attributed to uncertainty over the budget talks.Trump hardened his position Thursday after earlier signaling that he would accept a deal that does not include the $5 billion in border spending he had personally demanded just a week ago. Senate Democrats, who adamantly oppose funding a wall, can use their filibuster power to block any budget action.The shift came as conservatives are roiled over multiple issues   including the criminal justice reform bill s Senate passage, which law-and-order Republicans have assailed as a  jail break  for violent offenders. GOP Senators and conservative commentators have also piled on Trump for his plan to pull U.S. troops from Syria, which critics called a concession to Russia and Iran. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who generally defends Trump, called it an  Obama-like decision    a grave insult to a president who often defines himself against his predecessor.The maelstrom of criticism has sent the president into a tailspin a day and a half before a fourth of the government is set to shut down, second-guessing a slate of recent decisions and searching frantically for solutions. When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership. Would be done by end of year (NOW). It didn t happen!  Trump tweeted Thursday morning, in a signal of the firmer stance he would later adopt. 
                    government shutdown 2018
                    By BURGESS EVERETTGraham had also urged Trump to stand strong on the border wall.  I thought he had a good position. You shouldn t take these things on if you re not going to see it through. I thought $5 billion was a reasonable amount given the caravan. I respect their decision to try and avoid a government shutdown, but I think long-term this hurts,  Graham said of the wall. As for the Syria decision, Graham was even more firm in a letter to Trump along with other senators in both parties:  Reconsider your proposal.  On Thursday morning, Limbaugh, the influential talk radio host, complained that Trump had backed criminal justice reform even as he prepared to cave on wall funding. How in the hell does this get passed with no controversy, no opposition, no problem? I mean, Washington came together to pass this thing in like 10 minutes,  Limbaugh said of the criminal justice bill on Wednesday.  Meanwhile, $5 billion, a measly $5 billion   when compared to the size of the federal budget for border security   is an impossibility. Somebody needs to explain to me how this happened. By Thursday afternoon, Limbaugh announced that Trump had sent him a message assuring him he would stand firm. The president has gotten word to me that he is either getting funding for the border or he s shutting the whole thing down,  Limbuagh said, according to multiple reports.Trump set the tone in a televised Oval Office meeting with his Democratic opponents last week, in which he demanded the $5 billion and said he would be  proud  to take responsibility for a government shutdown forced by his border-security spending demands. Many Republicans cringed at the performance, deeming it more emotional outburst than tactical move. Rarely do you put all your chips in the middle of the table. The president speaks out of frustration often, but that doesn t tell you where he s going to end up. But it certainly tells us where his intent, impulse and instinct is,  said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who backs a bill providing $25 billion in border wall funding.Since then, Trump has been torn between immigration hawks urging him to stand strong, like Meadows and presidential adviser Stephen Miller, and more conciliatory members of his legislative affairs team, who have pushed for compromise.The White House dispatched Miller to last Sunday s talk shows, where he repeated Trump s maximal demands. Two days later, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders said he might scrounge and redirect spare billions for the wall from across departments and agencies   an idea critics said would be illegal and which had White House lawyers studying the issue.As the president backed down on his insistence for $5 billion for the border wall this week, Republican leaders responded to his lessening demands. Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-Ky.) offered Democrats a bill delivering $1.6 billion in fencing and an additional $1 billion for border security. But that too was rejected by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). By the end of the week Trump was talking about the wall having  slats  rather than a concrete barrier, a line echoed by his staff on TV.But hard-core conservatives in Congress were in no mood for a climb down. You ve got a bunch of House Republicans who have a foot out the door like [outgoing House Speaker] Paul Ryan, whereas the House Freedom Caucus willing to fight with adverse consequences because they re in the minority anyway and don t feel the responsibility to govern,  said the source close to Trump. The current budget dispute has its roots in a mammoth spending bill Trump grudgingly signed in March, which did not fund his border wall. The president fumed afterwards as conservatives, including Trump pal Sean Hannity, panned him for signing it. In September, GOP leaders asked him to back down again and kick the wall fight until after the November election, vowing to battle with Democrats for his priorities.But by the time the shutdown fight came, House Republicans couldn t muster the votes to even send a border wall bill to the Senate and there appeared no other option but to concede the fight to entrenched Democratic opposition. The border wall will not make America more secure. It s possible that his own advisers have made that clear to the president. And he has decided this is not a fight worth having in this moment,  said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).There s little reason to think that Trump s hand will grow stronger over time   especially with Democrats poised to assume their majority status in the House next month. The President has no leverage,  the Fox News host Brian Kilmeade told White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on  Fox & Friends  yesterday.
                    Media 
                    By JASON SCHWARTZConway argued that Democrats have mischaracterized the budget debate, short handing Trump s position as being all about a physical wall when his demands include numerous other border security measures. First of all, let s not all acquiesce to the ridiculous soundbite that this is about a wall. They re trying to make a wall a four-letter word when the president has been talking about border security all along,  Conway said.Democrats say it doesn t matter how the White House spins it: No wall money will be allocated. We are resolutely against the border wall. I don t see any way we could get it,  Schumer said in an interview.  All this talk about reprogramming? He needs Congress to go along and we won t. Trump also happens to love suspense, leading some to believe that he is simply creating drama while still planning to sign a short-term spending bill without wall funding. He s scheduled to go to Mar-a-Lago on Friday, and past GOP leaders are warning him that a partial government shutdown over the holidays won t improve his position, either. Shutting down on Christmas is not clever,  said Newt Gingrich, the Republican former House Speaker who oversaw a six-week government shutdown from November 1995 to January 1996.  I think they can go into the new year and continue to fight,  he added.  I m not so sure from his standpoint that if he ended up with five or six more two-week deals that he d care. But while some members of Congress, like Trump, are eager to start their vacations, some hope the budget fight doesn t drag into the holidays and beyond. It s time to get this done,  said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), a close Trump ally.  I d just as soon stay here [this weekend] and just wrestle this thing out. Missing out on the latest scoops?

A QUICK REVIEW: This morning, a House Republican Conference meeting went haywire, with southerners complaining about not having disaster money in the stopgap bill to keep government open until Feb. 8, and conservatives wanting the fight they ve been promised on the border wall.Story Continued BelowPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, backed up by his allies in the House Freedom Caucus, MARK MEADOWS of North Carolina and JIM JORDAN of Ohio, is signaling they are ready to fight for border wall money as part of this year-end government funding package.THE PRESIDENT TWEETS -- @realDonaldTrump at 10:28 a.m.:  When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership. Would be done by end of year (NOW). It didn t happen! We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries -- but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good! NYT S MAGGIE HABERMAN (@maggieNYT):  Source close to White House says potus is in  tailspin  this AM about the CR. SPEAKER PAUL RYAN, MAJORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY, MAJORITY WHIP STEVE SCALISE, MEADOWS and JORDAN are among the big names meeting with TRUMP.THIS SHOULDN T EXACTLY BE A SURPRISE. A number of Republicans promised the president they d fight to fund a border wall. And the president believed them. Jordan and Meadows ran alongside Trump on this message, and now they re itching for the fight.THIS IS, IN SOME WAYS, the most fitting way to end this wild, wild two-year congressional session. Since January 2017, two pairs of Republicans have been whispering in the president s ear, giving him divergent views of how to govern: Meadows and Jordan, and Ryan and McCarthy.WE EXPECT Republicans to go back into HC-5 -- their basement meeting room -- at some point today to discuss strategy. SARAH FERRIS and JOHN BRESNAHAN:   I think we re going to put $5 billion for the wall in,  Jordan told reporters.  I m talking to [Steve] Scalise and Kevin [McCarthy]... That s definitely the mood of the conference... I think that s where it s headed, toward $5 billion for the wall.     The issue erupted Thursday during a raucous closed-door meeting. Rank-and-file Republicans pressed leadership to take a harder line against the Senate s recently passed spending bill by demanding money for the border wall, as well as emergency disaster aid for wildfire and hurricane recoveries.

That might or might not pass the House -- attendance is down big time, with 52 people missing the last vote this morning. If the bill does clear the House, it will go to the Senate, where it will not go anywhere. Then there will be a choice: Enough Republicans get on board with Democrats to pass the stopgap, or keep the government shut down until Jan. 3, when NANCY PELOSI will be able to open it up. THE GOVERNMENT SHUTS DOWN at midnight tomorrow evening. Good Thursday afternoon.THE INVESTIGATIONS   CNN S LAURA JARRETT:  Exclusive: Whitaker told he does not need to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller investigation :  Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker has consulted with ethics officials at the Justice Department and they have advised him he does not need to recuse himself from overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller s Russia investigation, a source familiar with the process told CNN Thursday.   Whitaker is expected to inform senators, many of whom have raised ethics concerns given his past criticism of Mueller s investigation, about this development later Thursday, the source said.  CNN -- REBECCA MORIN:  Rosenstein: AG nominee s memo had  no impact  on Mueller probe  -- L.A. TIMES  DEL QUENTIN WILBER (@DelWilber):  [Rod] Rosenstein hints at more news today in the Mueller probe. In response to question about who is overseeing Mueller probe, DAG Rosenstein said there would be more on that  later today.  -- CNN S JEREMY HERB and MANU RAJU:  House Intelligence panel votes to send Roger Stone transcript to Mueller  MORE SYRIA FALLOUT -- WAPO S ANTON TROIANOVSKI in Moscow:  Putin backs Trump s move to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, says Islamic State dealt  serious blows  :  Russian President Vladimir Putin praised President Trump s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, describing the American presence there as illegitimate and the Islamic State as largely defeated on the ground.    Putin was tougher on Trump on the issue of arms control. He said there are currently no negotiations with the United States on extending a soon-to-expire nuclear arms control treaty, raising the risk of a situation that would be  very bad for humanity.   WaPo-- FOX NEWS  JENNIFER GRIFFIN (@JenGriffinFNC):  Sr U.S. defense official tells me: The President made the decision to pull out of Syria last Fri Dec 14 after speaking with Turkish President Erdogan, who told Trump Turkish forces were planning to enter Syria to go after the Kurdish PKK and warned U.S. troops to get out of the way. SPY GAMES -- ERIC GELLER:  Trump administration, U.S. allies condemn China for brazen cyberattacks :  The Chinese government broke its promise to stop hacking U.S. businesses and stealing their trade secrets, the Trump administration declared Thursday, ratcheting up tensions between two of the world s cyber superpowers and adding fuel to a trade war that has spooked global markets. To emphasize the point, the Justice Department on Thursday indicted two Chinese hackers for a long-running economic espionage campaign that resulted in the theft of hundreds of gigabytes of data from companies and government agencies.  POLITICO ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA --  N. Korea says it won t denuclearize unless U.S. removes threat,  by AP s Kim Tong-Hyung in Seoul:  The surprisingly blunt statement jars with Seoul s rosier presentation of the North Korean position and could rattle the fragile trilateral diplomacy to defuse a nuclear crisis that last year had many fearing war.    The statement suggests North Korea will eventually demand the United States withdraw or significantly reduce the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, a major sticking point in any disarmament deal.  APIMMIGRATION FILES -- TED HESSON:  Migrants must wait in Mexico during immigration proceedings :  The Trump administration will compel certain asylum seekers to remain in Mexico during the course of their asylum hearings, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said today. Nielsen said in a written statement that migrants who arrive at the border  illegally or without proper documentation  could be returned to Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings.   The announcement came as the secretary was set to testify at an oversight hearing before a House Judiciary Committee this morning. Democrats were expected to grill Nielsen over the death of a 7-year-old girl in Border Patrol custody last week.  POLITICO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION -- THE GUARDIAN S EMILY HOLDEN:  Trump conservation pick triggers question of  favoritism or connections  :  The White House s nominee to head a top U.S. conservation agency lacks her predecessors  experience, while her political connections raise potential conflicts of interest    Aurelia Skipwith, who started her career at the agrochemical giant Monsanto, has been nominated to lead the interior department s Fish and Wildlife Service   But Skipwith s record shows no background in conservation before she joined the Trump administration less than two years ago   While in law school, she worked with two consulting firms which were founded or co-founded by her fiance [Leo Giacometto], a politically well-connected Montanan who runs in the same circles as the outgoing interior secretary, Ryan Zinke.  The GuardianWAPO S DARRYL FEARS, JULIET EILPERIN and JOSH DAWSEY:  Zinke was a rising star in Washington. Then he joined the Trump administration :  [Ryan Zinke] was a one-term congressman who had blazed a political trail in his home state. His star was so bright that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) lobbied against his Cabinet appointment, thinking Zinke was almost a sure bet to defeat Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who was reelected this year. To some liberal conservationists, Zinke appeared to be a conservative who could bridge the partisan divide. The Senate confirmed him with 68 votes. But Zinke was anything but bipartisan. His zeal in carrying out President Trump s vision of  American energy dominance  by boosting coal and gas production on public lands angered Democrats who supported him, and his tendency to overstep the limits of his power at Interior worried Republicans and the president.  WaPo 2020 WATCH -- ALEX THOMPSON:  Perez nixes  undercard  debates for 2020 primary :  With the prospect of upwards of 20 Democrats running for president in 2020, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez announced on Thursday that the party would split up candidates by random selection and host debates on consecutive nights if there were too many candidates, opting not to try and fit them all on one stage or sort debate appearance by polling numbers.   The DNC Chairman also told reporters that the DNC would be hosting twelve debates during the 2020 primary with the first two being held in June and July of 2019.

                    Updated 12/20/2018 02:52 PM ESTFirst there was Rush, Breitbart, Drudge and Ann Coulter, all going at President Donald Trump over his apparent retreat on demands that the spending bill include $5 billion for his long-promised border wall.That was bad enough.Story Continued BelowBut then there was Fox News. Even its prime-time programming   normally Trump s strongest bulwark of support   didn t spare him. Guest-hosting for Sean Hannity on Wednesday night, frequent Trump cheerleader Dan Bongino led the show with a segment on the wall, declaring that members of Trump s base  want their wall and they want it now. The criticism may have added up: Under intense pressure from conservative media, Trump now appears to be reversing his reversal, with House Speaker Paul Ryan declaring Thursday afternoon that the president will not sign the Senate-passed bill because of  legitimate concerns for border security. It was a remarkable turn of events for conservative media, which has by and large excused nearly every bit of trouble that s cropped up around Trump since he took office. But the wall   an issue Trump himself whipped to prominence during his presidential campaign   may have proven a bridge too far. Particularly once Trump s favorite network, Fox News, got into the act.Your guide to the media circus   weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The story it linked to did not mince words, relaying frustration on the right that Trump s  move has not only broken a campaign promise, but also undermined his credibility as a dealmaker. On Thursday morning,  Fox & Friends  did not hold back either, opening its 6, 7 and 8 a.m. hours with a smash cut that included Rush Limbaugh criticizing Trump and House Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows lobbying for Trump to veto the funding bill.At one point, guest host Jedediah Bila said,  This is going to be a problem for Republicans. I think a lot of people who voted for President Trump counted on him on this particular issue. I think their feet were to the fire and you see a lot of people around the country saying,  Wait, hold on a second; you told us that you weren t afraid to shut down the government, that s why we like you. What happened? You just gave in right away.  Fellow guest host Ed Henry tried to argue that Trump had a bad political hand and the border was safer than under President Barack Obama, but host Brian Kilmeade wasn t having it.  I don t know, it seems like chaos,  he said.

                    By SARAH FERRIS and JOHN BRESNAHANThe criticism on Fox followed a day of wallopings across conservative media. Most prominently, Ann Coulter ripped Trump across multiple platforms on Wednesday, including calling him  gutless  on Twitter and in a Breitbart column. Speaking to The Daily Caller, she declared that she would not vote for him in 2020 and his administration will  just have been a joke presidency who scammed the American people. Her criticism apparently stung enough that Trump seems to no longer be following her on Twitter. But Coulter was hardly alone. Limbaugh inveighed on his show,  Trump s gonna get less than nothing    a quote that quickly became the headline leading Breitbart, spurring more furious reactions.On Thursday morning, The Drudge Report seemed almost to be taunting Trump, with a banner headline declaring,  Pelosi Holiday Cheer   Dancing at Bar After Wall Win,  set below the now famous picture of Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi walking triumphant   sunglasses on   out of her showdown meeting with Trump last week in the Oval Office.On Twitter, some of the president s critics actually were taunting him and his supporters. On Wednesday night, Fox News prime-time host Laura Ingraham tweeted,  It was supposed to be a  big beautiful wall  with a  big beautiful door.  Now it s just an open door with no frame. Unreal. #BorderDisorder #GOPFail. On Thursday morning, George Conway, a frequent Trump critic and husband of top adviser Kellyanne Conway, replied,  Be careful, Laura, he might unfollow you!

So what we re going to do is go back to the House and work with our members.  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, according to a pool report, that  border security  means  steel slats or a wall. The Mexican government will temporarily authorize migrants who have received a notice to attend a hearing before a U.S. immigration judge to wait in Mexico, according to an announcement on the Mexican Foreign Ministry website.The new policy will almost certainly be subjected to legal challenges. The Trump administration has experimented with a range of strategies to discourage illegal immigration and asylum-seekers, only to see the plans derailed by federal courts.A San Francisco-based federal judge on Wednesday issued a preliminary injunction against a November Trump proclamation that sought to bar migrants who cross between ports of entry from seeking asylum. Earlier in the day, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., struck down administration policies that blocked victims of domestic violence and gang violence from seeking asylum.Mexico said Thursday that it will allow migrants to be returned to its territory  for humanitarian reasons and in a temporary fashion.  The country s foreign ministry said the setup adhered to Mexican law and international refugee commitments.During a press conference at the Mexican embassy in Washington, Jose Antonio Zabalgoitia, a Mexican diplomat, affirmed that Mexico will accept migrants with pending asylum applications. However, he said the U.S. must return rejected applicants to their home countries, not to Mexico. Let s not make migrants a ping-pong ball,  he said.Human rights groups blasted the decision. Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International, called it a  stark violation of international law  and said asylum-seekers would be vulnerable in Mexico. Make no mistake   Mexico is not a safe country for all people seeking protection,  she said in a written statement.  Many people seeking asylum in the United States face discrimination, exploitation, sexual assault, murder, or the possibility of being disappeared while traveling through Mexico or while forced to wait for extraordinarily long times in Mexican border towns.

                    By JASON SCHWARTZThe State Department announced Tuesday that the U.S. will commit $5.8 billion to support development in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as part of a broader plan to address regional migration.The deal came just weeks into the new administration of Mexican President AndrÈs Manuel LÛpez Obrador, who has pressed for the U.S. to invest at least $20 billion to address the forces propelling people to the U.S. from Central America.Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee were not informed of the new policy to keep asylum-seekers in Mexico before the DHS announcement, an aide told POLITICO. We were [definitely] blindsided,  the aide said.The push to keep third-country migrants in Mexico will not apply to unaccompanied minors, Nielsen said during the congressional committee hearing Thursday.Despite the announcement of the new policy, Nielsen faced a broad range of questions during the hearing Thursday.Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) grilled the secretary about Jakelin Caal, a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who died in Border Patrol custody on Dec. 8.  Jacky did not have to die,  Jackson Lee said.Nielsen defended her department s response to the situation. She said the girl was provided medical care as soon as U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel were alerted to the problem.

                    By SARAH FERRIS and JOHN BRESNAHAN This is exactly why we try to encourage migrants to go to a port of entry,  Nielsen said.  Unfortunately, they arrived in the middle of night, in the middle of nowhere. Trump administration officials grappled in recent weeks with legal and logistical questions around keeping migrants in Mexico during asylum proceedings, according to an internal planning document obtained by POLITICO earlier this month. The hurdles included a range of due process concerns, such as ensuring migrants have access to counsel while they wait on the Mexican side of the border as well as devising a system for them to receive updates on their cases.The undated document outlined a  remain in Mexico  pilot program at the San Ysidro port of entry in Southern California and nearby Border Patrol areas of operation. Whether the pilot proceeded remains unclear.The planning document doesn t delve into any standards for housing or safety conditions in Mexico   what could emerge as an issue as more migrants begin to amass at the border.The arrival of thousands of Central Americans in Tijuana last month illustrated how quickly conditions could deteriorate in Mexico. An open-air migrant encampment turned into a squalid mess in late November when rain storms swept through the area. The DHS planning document called for the construction of courtrooms with video conference capability in the San Diego area, among other resources.Officials also weighed the possibility that migrants could use legal maneuvers to remain in the United States.Among the concerns raised was what might happen if a migrant files a petition challenging his or her detention while in the United States for a hearing, which could potentially lead to a release.Sabrina RodrÌguez contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

The Trump administration policy that turned away asylum seekers who claimed to suffer domestic or gang violence was mostly struck down Wednesday, another legal setback to the White House s attempts to deter migrants from trekking to the U.S.-Mexico border. Story Continued Below  The Federal Reserve raised interest rates, and some economists worry it will hurt wage gains.   Several labor nominees appear unlikely to advance before Friday, threatening to leave the EEOC without a quorum next year.    The Senate passed a stopgap spending bill late Wednesday to prevent a partial government shutdown and kick the can on border wall spending by seven more weeks.  GOOD MORNING!

Our first Morning Shift newsletter of the new year will publish Jan. 2.   POLICY LIMITING ASYLUM STRUCK DOWN: A federal judge on Wednesday quashed most of a Trump administration policy that blocked migrants who claimed to suffer domestic or gang violence from obtaining determinations of  credible fear  of return to their home country   the first step in an asylum claim, POLITICO s Ted Hesson reports. U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered the Trump administration to provide new credible fear hearings for the 12 plaintiffs in the case and, in a related order, demanded that deported plaintiffs be brought back to the U.S. at no cost to them. More from Hesson here.  RISING RATES, LESS RAISES: The Federal Reserve raised its main borrowing rate on Wednesday for the fourth time this year, brushing aside calls from President Donald Trump to hold off on further interest rate hikes, POLITICO s Victoria Guida reports. Though the move comes as the central bank underscores the growing number of jobs amid a low unemployment rate, Josh Bivens, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, told Morning Shift the hikes have begun to slow the economy and  give workers less leverage.    As unemployment has gotten low, we have finally started to see a small uptick in wage growth,  Bivens said.  I think that s going to be short lived if they keep on the path of interest rate hikes.  The Fed indicated Wednesday that fewer rate hikes might be on the way next year based on expectations for slower economic growth, according to Guida. More from POLITICO here. EEOC S UNCERTAIN FUTURE: It s looking unlikely that senators will be able to advance several labor nominees before the end of the 115th Congress, POLITICO s Ian Kullgren reports. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) on Wednesday blocked the confirmation of Chai Feldblum, a Democratic nominee to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, queuing up a Democratic blockade of all HELP Committee nominees unless Feldblum and Mark Pearce, a Democratic nominee to the NLRB, are confirmed.  Without Feldblum s confirmation, the EEOC will lack a quorum next year. More here.  SENATE STOPGAP: The Senate passed a plan late Wednesday night that would avert a government shutdown and sidestep the spat over border wall spending until Feb. 8, POLITICO s Jennifer Scholtes reports. The continuing resolution would also extend current spending levels for nine departments and various agencies, as well as authority for DHS  E-Verify program for checking the immigration status of U.S. workers and the EB-5 visa program for foreign entrepreneurs who make substantial investments in the United States. The House is expected to vote the package today. More here and here.  Related:  McConnell moves to avert shutdown disaster,  from POLITICO. DIGITAL NEWSROOMS ORGANIZE: The number of digital media outlets that have unionized is trending upward, Paul Farhi reports for the Washington Post. Vox Media, Vice and HuffPost are just a few of the outlets that have voted to unionize since 2015.   Such agreements have created a rising tide of compensation at other digital companies,  Farhi reports. Unions have gained too. The Writers Guild of America East has grown by about 1,500 new members since the unionization efforts began, he writes. The effort has been aided by the fact that areas like New York and D.C., home to many of those digital outlets, don t have  right-to-work  laws. More from Farhi here.

POLITICO s Jennifer Scholtes and Caitlin Emma lay out some of the reasons:  It could hurt already-low morale at the affected agencies:  A drawn-out funding lapse means employees could be on the hook, though, for making mortgage, student loan or car payments before that late paycheck rolls in.   Administrative delays: Loan processing at  the Small Business Administration would be slowed. More here.  MORE WORKERS LIGHTING UP: The number of workers using drugs in the U.S. increased by double digits between 2015 and 2017 in five of 16 major industry sectors analyzed by medical testing company Quest Diagnostics. Marijuana was the most common drug detected among those tested, and some industries including construction, manufacturing and transportation saw at least a 20 percent increase in positive tests for marijuana between 2015 and 2017, according to the analysis. The number of workers testing positive for cocaine last year is also higher in most sectors compared with 2015. Read the report here. WILL THE WALL STOP THE DRUGS? As more states have moved to legalize marijuana, significantly less has been entering the country between ports of entry where President Donald Trump s border wall would stand, David Bier at the libertarian Cato Institute writes.   Drug smuggling activity now primarily occurs at ports of entry, where a border wall would have no effect,  Bier explains in a report released Wednesday.  By weight, the average port inspector seized 8 times more cocaine, 17 times more fentanyl, 23 times more methamphetamine, and 36 times more heroin than the average Border Patrol agent seized at the physical border in early 2018.

INSURERS ENTER INTEROP DEBATE, TO TENSION: The data-sharing wars are getting some new blood: payers. The companies that dole out the money believe that gaining more access to clinical data will help them adapt to value-based care. But they feel the price of obtaining such access is too high. That s why they   and ONC, plus HL7   have been trying to standardize data transmission through their da Vinci Project. Somewhat skeptical are providers, who aren t sure they want to give payers all that access.  The equivalent would be if I asked you to hand over your [phone] so I could look through it,  said Robert Tennant, director of health IT for MGMA. Tennant s not alone   and the tension might define how value-based care evolves. Pros can read the full story here.  WILKIE QUESTIONED: VA Secretary Robert Wilkie endured his time under the Congressional spotlight Wednesday, offering strong assurances that he opposed privatization of the system, and saying as a veteran   and son of a veteran   he understands the importance of the system for vets  culture and well-being. In response to questioning from Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), who chairs the Veterans  Affairs subcommittee overseeing the EHR changeover, Wilkie said that interoperability he believed could be achieved through the Cerner implementation would be key to the VA s ability to make its new community care program work   and by extension, key to preventing privatization.  The success of the EHR systems ensures that VA will stay at the center of veterans  health care, that VA will be the central node no matter what a veteran decides to do,  he said.  That s one of the answers when it comes to the issue of privatization.     What s the holdup on a permanent CIO?: The mystery about the lack of a permanent CIO for the Department of Veterans Affairs is gaining some clarity. The nominee for the post   Jim Gfrerer   has been held up by New York s Democratic senators, despite a favorable vote from the Veterans  Affairs Committee. First, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand put a hold on Gfrerer over an unrelated VA issue. That hold has been lifted but, according to one Senate source, Chuck Schumer is currently preventing a vote on Gfrerer. Schumer s office did not respond to a request for comment. The delay comes as several members from both parties have complained about the lack of senior permanent leadership at the VA. The Veterans Health Administration is still leaderless four months after Wilkie took office, as is the Office of Information and Technology, which is led by acting CIO Camilo Sandoval.    Meanwhile: The Veterans Affairs Department awarded Optum two major health projects Wednesday, including providing telephone-based lifestyle coaching covering diet, exercise, stress and alcohol use, to eligible veterans. OptumServe, the federal unit of UnitedHealth Group s health IT division, will also provide medical disability exams to veterans and separating service members in some regions starting in 2019.  eHealth tweet of the day: Catherine Rampell @crampell  Facebook has lately taken to showing me ads for *wedding gowns *maternity clothes *egg-freezing services *cat toys In other words, the four possible paths for women in their 30s, according to advertisers   THURSDAY: As we creep ever closer to the end of 2018   and the beginning of 2019   any feedback about how we ve been doing (and what we should be keeping an eye on next year) would be welcome.

ELSEWHERE IN CONGRESS   : Meanwhile, the rest of Congress had a busy Wednesday:    Shutdown watch: Senate leaders have introduced a short-term funding fix to keep the federal government running for seven more weeks   until early February. While that averts a nightmare before Christmas, it sets up a potential three-way donnybrook between President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and presumptive Speaker Nancy Pelosi early in 2019.    Privacy eruption again: Democratic lawmakers singed Facebook after yet another deep-dive investigation into the social network s privacy practices Wednesday, our Tech colleague Steven Overly reports. Their rhetoric signals the party s commitment to a federal privacy law and tougher FTC enforcement authority, both of which could have the tangential consequence of regulating a lot of currently lightly-overseen health apps and gadgets. (Our health-focused primer on the potential consequences of a federal privacy law here.) PATCHING UPDATES: Some notes on fixing gadgets that needed patching up:    NIST guidance: The National Institute of Standards and Technology is extending the deadline to comment on a security analysis regarding mobile and wearable devices used by first responders. The notice noted that with an anticipated increase in the use of such devices, attention is needed to their cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The new deadline is February 6. The document is here.    Medtronic correction: Medical device manufacturing giant Medtronic is updating the software in one of its ventilators beginning Wednesday. The ventilator s USB drive and graphical user interface needed enhancing, and the company is updating the devices with the new software. The announcement is here. BUSINESS NOTES: Big changes in some businesses:    Aledade, Blue Cross North Carolina team up: Startup Aledade and Blue Cross and Blue Shield North Carolina are teaming up to support Accountable Care Organizations for independent physicians in the state. The pair say they will be encouraging data sharing, and Aledade will be using claims data from the insurer. It s a bit of a reunion for some of the key personnel at each firm: Insurer CEO Patrick Conway was the longtime head of CMMI; his counterpart at Aledade, Farzad Mostashari, is of course a fellow Obama administration alum from his days leading ONC.    Cerner alum snags new job: Former Cerner president Zane Burke is now CEO of startup Livongo Health, the company announced.

IN THE HOPPER: President Donald Trump will sign the farm bill during a White House ceremony today at 2:30 p.m., as the administration introduces its proposal to clamp down on state waivers for SNAP work requirements.    Shutdown defused? In the blink of an eye, the Senate passed a continuing resolution to keep the lights on at the Agriculture Department, FDA and many other agencies through Feb. 8. The House is planning to take up the CR today, and Trump is expected to sign off on it.    Another big soy sale to China: USDA announces another sale of soybeans, as the short-term truce offers growers a tiny bit of temporary shelter from the trade war.  USDA UNVEILS CRACKDOWN ON SNAP WAIVERS: Republicans are getting their way in a push to add more stringent work requirements on SNAP. This morning, USDA announced a proposal aimed at limiting states  ability to waive existing work requirements for certain food-stamp recipients   essentially giving the House GOP some of what they sought in the farm bill. Not coincidentally, it s happening the same day as the White House farm bill signing ceremony, reports Pro Ag s Catherine Boudreau.  The target of USDA s plan: Under current law, able-bodied adults without dependents, or ABAWDs, can t receive SNAP benefits for more than three months during a three-year period, unless they re working or enrolled in an education or training program for 80 hours a month. But states can waive that time limit when unemployment is high or there aren t enough jobs available. USDA said that in 2016, the most recent year data is available, nearly 74 percent of the ABAWD population was not working. Still, ABAWDs make up a just a sliver   2.8 million   of the nearly 40 million Americans who receive SNAP benefits.  Reining in waivers: The proposed rule would tighten the criteria states must meet when applying for the waivers. An estimated 755,000 of ABAWDs would lose SNAP benefits over three years if the proposal is implemented. The plan is projected to save $15 billion over a decade, according to USDA. Democrats, such as Sen. Debbie Stabenow, aren t happy about the backdoor approach. The final farm bill, H.R. 2 (115),  pointedly didn t mandate stricter work requirements or tighten eligibility criteria for the food stamp program because such language wasn t expected to pass both chambers.  HAPPY THURSDAY, DEC. 20! Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host learned D.C. now has more than 700,000 residents for the first time since the 1970s. (Looking forward to cramming onto the Metro with approximately all 700,000 of you soon!) Send news and tips to rmccrimmon@politico.com and @ryanmccrimmon, and follow the whole team @Morning_Ag.  CONGRESS SET TO PUNT SHUTDOWN FIGHT TO FEBRUARY: The White House and Congress, hurtling toward Friday s government funding deadline, seem to have found their off-ramp. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced a continuing resolution, H.R. 695 (115), that would extend temporary funding through Feb. 8   punting the spending battle over Trump s proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall until Democrats control the House. The Senate cleared the measure by voice vote Wednesday night, reports Pro Budget & Appropriations  Jennifer Scholtes.  Glide-path: The House is expected to vote on the CR today. Nancy Pelosi, the incoming speaker, said Democrats would support it. And Trump appears likely to sign it, despite previous threats to shutter federal agencies if he doesn t receive the $5 billion he s seeking to build the border wall, our POLITICO colleagues report.    The 7-week stopgap doesn t include disaster aid for communities devastated by wildfires and hurricanes in recent months   an omission that rankled some Southern members who said their states couldn t wait until February for help.    Tax extenders left in the dust: The CR also doesn t include legislation to renew a slate of expired tax provisions   like credits and deductions for certain biofuel producers. Congress will likely adjourn for the year without any more action on tax legislation, per Pro Tax s Brian Faler.  Fed watch: The Federal Reserve raised its main borrowing rate Wednesday to between 2.25 and 2.5 percent, despite Trump s recent barrage of tweets urging Chairman Jerome Powell to hold off on further rate hikes, writes Pro Financial Services  Victoria Guida.    On the other hand, the central bank lowered its 2019 forecast from three expected rate hikes next year to two, with economic growth expected to slow to 2.3 percent. Powell reiterated the forecast for raising rates next year is highly fluid. CHINA MAKES THIRD MAJOR U.S. SOY BUY: Another 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans are headed across the Pacific as a result of the ninth-largest daily sale since USDA began keeping track in 1977. It s China s third purchase since Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a short-term ceasefire at the G-20 gathering in Buenos Aires, your host reports.  For context: China has bought about 2.63 million metric tons of U.S. beans over the last week, but they ve got tons of catching up to do to come anywhere near normal purchase levels. By this point last year, U.S. exporters had sold 21.5 million tons of soybeans to China for delivery in the 2017-18 marketing year beginning Sept. 1.  Sales targets:  To restore the previous trading arrangement, we d have to be in the 30 to 35 million tons on an annual basis,  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said last week after the initial resumption in sales.  But nobody buys their yearlong supply in one month.    Way too high  expectations: Ag commodity market veteran Ken Morrison said it s  neither prudent or good politics to suggest U.S. tonnage to China will return to pre-tariff levels anytime soon.    Morrison, a former trader at Cargill who now writes Morrison on the Markets, noted that Brazil is rapidly growing and selling more soybeans, while Chinese demand for soy could be lower as African Swine Fever and other factors have reduced the country s pig inventory.    Perdue and others who suggest the benchmark for normalized trade is a return to U.S. shipments of 30-35 [million metric tons] annually are setting the bar and expectations way too high,  he told MA.  TRADE AID UPDATE: Bill Northey, USDA undersecretary for farm production and conservation, said it could take  a week to two weeks  before government checks for the second half of 2018 production start landing in producers  hands.   It takes a few days here once we got the announcement on Monday to be able to get them posted in the Federal Register and to start cranking through the various approval processes,  Northey said on AgriTalk.  Some [payments] will certainly get into accounts yet this year, some won t probably get into accounts until 2019.

Japan is also set to raise support for its domestic beef producers, per FAS.

POLITICO s Nancy Cook has an early look at how Mulvaney is likely to approach the toughest job in Washington.    Cummings moving to ramp up oversight: Rep.

TIS THE STOPGAP SEASON: Senators late last night passed a seven-week stopgap spending measure, H.R. 695 (115), by voice vote to avert a partial government shutdown at week s end. The bill would fund the government through Feb. 8 for nine agencies, including Interior and EPA. It heads to the House today, where it is expected to pass.  See you in January: Senate Energy Chairman Lisa Murkowski s bid to pass a broad western public lands bill, including a permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, came up short thanks to an objection from Sen. Mike Lee, but she won a commitment from Senate leaders to take it up as one of the first orders of business in the new Congress.  This will be an opportunity to study every single page that you want because you ll have an opportunity to vote on this thumbs up or thumbs down when we return in January,  she said on the floor. Murkowski said she made  some significant offers  but they were summarily rejected by Lee and others despite the broad bipartisan support for the underlying lands package. Murkowski said 43 members of the chamber had at least one provision in the package.  What happened: After the chamber cleared the short-term CR, Murkowski asked consent to pass the lands package but Lee objected, citing the fact he d just seen the 600-plus page bill earlier that morning and that Utah was treated unfairly in the measure.  This hurts,  he said of the bill s impact to his state.  Why are we just receiving this just now?  Lee has objected to any permanent reauthorization of LWCF for months.  I don t believe it was a coincidence that I wasn t informed  that a permanent LWCF provision was included in the bill, Lee said.  Republican friendly fire: Sen. Cory Gardner said the Senate offered Lee a chance to address his concerns through votes Wednesday.  I m pretty doggone upset about this,  he said, pounding his fist on his Senate desk.  Why can t we have a vote? Why can t we let people who don t like [LWCF], vote no. People who like it, vote yes.   Quotable: House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop isn t sure about a land package s path to passage in the House as a stand-alone bill, as Pro s Anthony Adragna reports.  I know packages are dumb. They re bad but it s going to be worse next year. We won t get as much. We ll get more stuff we don t like next year,  he said.  I m not holding up what I have just because I don t get everything that I wanted to originally.   WELCOME TO FRIDAY EVE! I m your host, Kelsey Tamborrino. There are competing claims as to which president was first to place a Christmas tree in the White House, with some crediting Franklin Pierce and others Benjamin Harrison, so we ll give the trivia win to Bracewell s Frank Maisano, who named both.

ONE-ON-ONE WITH BOBBY RUSH: The likely next chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy talked the select committee on climate change, the possibility of an infrastructure bill in the first 100 days of the next Congress and his other priorities in a Q&A with Pro s Eric Wolff. Here are some key takeaways:   On his top priority:  I want to fight the good fight to keep our jurisdiction from being diluted to the point we have no jurisdiction at all. They seem hellbent on getting rich on Energy and Commerce and eating off the skeleton of what it used to be.    On supporters of a select committee on climate change:  Where were you when the going was tough? Where were you when we were the voice in the wilderness? Where were you then? And so I really think that it s foolhardy, it s unnecessary. The last time we had a select committee, the only thing that came out of it was Sen. [ Ed] Markey was able to use it as an arrow in his quiver to help get elected to the Senate.     On his policy focus:  I know a lot of my time is going to be spent on climate change. I don t have right now what kind of policies.   I don t like this whole idea of FERC and FCC having these kind of fights. We want to be telling FERC that they don t put their hand on the scale.   HOYER: CLIMATE PANEL UNLIKELY TO HAVE SUBPOENA POWER: House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer says a climate panel next Congress is unlikely to have subpoena power.  I don t think that they think they need subpoena power. They re going to have experts who are, I think, dying to come before them,  he told reporters Wednesday.  I don t think the question of subpoena power is going to, in any way, undermine their ability to move forward.   Progressives panned the prospect.  If true, this decision is an insult to the thousands of young people across the country who have been calling on the Democratic Party leadership to have the courage to stand up to fossil fuel billionaires and make sure our generation has a livable future,  said Varshini Prakash, spokeswoman of the Sunrise Movement, in a statement. In a tweet, Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded that  a weak committee misses the point & endangers people.   INTERIOR SCUTTLE: Bishop told reporters Wednesday he hasn t been in touch with the White House about the soon-to-be vacant Interior slot. He declined to say who he preferred for the role, but added,  There are a lot of people who would be good fits. I think I know almost all of [the candidates].  His counterpart, Rep. Ra˙l Grijalva, thought Bishop might be the best fit out there:  Although we are deeply divided and in opposition to each other on his view and my view in terms of Interior, he s been there and he s been a formidable foe,  Grijalva told ME.  We go in different directions but it s not a personal hatred or meanness about it.  As for the odds he d become secretary, Bishop quipped:  Don t bet your retirement on that.   TAX TALK: The CR signals the likely end to any hope of passing a year-end tax bill, H.R. 88 (115)   a priority for coal companies. They have  been fighting a bid to prevent an automatic 55 percent decline next year in an excise tax on coal, which will blow a hole in the budget of a program providing benefits to coal workers affected by lung disease related to mining,  Pro Brian Faler s reports.  CARBON TAX TALK: Sens. Jeff Flake and Chris Coons introduced carbon tax legislation Wednesday as a companion bill to the House version of the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act introduced last month.  With the administration s recent climate assessment and skeptical response from the president, Republicans need to be at the forefront of addressing climate change,  Flake said in a statement. Read the bill text and the one-pager.  FOR YOUR RADAR: House lawmakers last night approved the Water Infrastructure Improvement Act, H.R. 7279 (115), by a vote of 351-10, Pro s Annie Snider reports. The bill is aimed at helping communities balance multiple, court-mandated water upgrades. HAPPY HOLI-FERC: Today is the last meeting of another drama-filled year at FERC   Neil Chatterjee retook the chairmanship, a controversial chief of staff got more controversial, Rob Powelson resigned, and Bernard McNamee was narrowly confirmed. The meeting seems set up to be a short one, but there are a handful of interesting items afoot, particularly in the natural gas space.  There are four gas certificate items on the agenda, and two look like potentially new approvals: Dominion s Sweden Valley pipeline project and Venture Global s Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal.

WATCHDOGS STILL REVIEWING  LOST DATA  AT FERC: While the Energy Department s inspector general didn t find any gaps in FERC s unclassified cybersecurity program during the fiscal year that ended in September, according to a report on Wednesday, watchdogs are still studying a  security incident  from 2017. FERC promptly initiated a review but the IG s office  found that FERC was still in the process of reviewing the impact of the incident and completing its analysis.  FERC management said the  incident  was pretty sophisticated.  Due to the size and complexity of the incident, FERC management assigned multiple subject matter experts from each of the affected program offices to provide detailed analysis of the lost data,  FERC Executive Director Anton Porter wrote in a letter to the IG.  DOJ FILES SUIT ON CONSERVATION EASEMENTS: The Justice Department filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking to stop Georgia-based promoters of a conservation easement tax scheme from operating in the state. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges the scheme focused on donations of conservation easements and corresponding tax benefits from those donations, as well as  grossly overvalued  appraisals. According to the DOJ, the promoters  organized, promoted, and sold at least 96 conservation easement syndicates  resulting in more than $2 billion of tax deductions from overvalued and improper qualified conservation contributions.

PROGRAMMING NOTE:  Morning Tax will not publish from Dec. 24-Jan 1. The Morning Tax newsletter will resume publishing on Jan. 2. Story Continued Below LET S CHAT AGAIN IN FEBRUARY: The White House and Congress appear on the cusp of avoiding a government shutdown just days before Christmas, an outcome that makes plenty of people in and around Washington happy. (Not everyone, of course.) For the IRS, that means that the tax collector can continue its work getting ready for tax filing season without the threat of losing the vast majority of its workforce. But the agency isn t totally in the clear. The stopgap spending bill, H.R. 695 (115), that the Senate passed Wednesday and the House is expected to pass as soon as today would run through Feb. 8   presumably within just a couple weeks after the start of the filing season, a time when lots of taxpayers who expect a refund are trying to file as quickly as possible.  Still: Keeping people from getting their tax returns because of a shutdown could easily cause some public relations problems, and the timing of a shutdown isn t likely to have more or less of an effect on the IRS s ability to implement the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115). But John Koskinen, the former IRS commissioner, told Morning Tax that it would likely be more disruptive if a shutdown had occurred in the run-up to the filing season.  In some ways it would be better for a shutdown after the filing season started because that would mean all the IT and other preparations were completed,  Koskinen said, even as he noted that shutdowns are  an inefficient and costly way to resolve political issues  and  create a backlog of work to be made up  no matter when they occur. Koskinen, who was a senior official at the White House Office of Management and Budget during the shutdowns in the Clinton administration, also said he could see arguments both for and against allowing refunds should a funding lapse occur in February. The key question to whether refunds would still be sent out is whether allowing them protects life and/or property, the former commissioner said. Property clearly wouldn t be at risk, Koskinen said, but there s a case to be made that certain taxpayers could see their health at risk if they can t get refunds for basic necessities.  Who s here, who s at home: For reference s sake, the IRS s contingency plan for a potential shutdown this month would put around seven in eight employees on furlough, as Tax Notes  William Hoffman noted. About a third of those are information technology staffers who play a key role in getting the agency ready for the filing season.  WELCOME TO THURSDAY, where we ve been thinking about it for a few days   and decided to come down against human extinction.

TO VOTE OR NOT TO VOTE: As it currently stands, the House also is scheduled to vote today on Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady s year-end tax bill, which cleared the Rules Committee late Wednesday. Brady (R-Texas) told reporters that it still made sense to pass H.R. 88 (115) because, among other things, there was Senate interest in some of the bill s provisions.  In the House, we want to be on the record in support of them,  Brady said about proposals to revamp the IRS and retirement savings provisions, restore tax extenders on biodiesel and railroad maintenance, and give tax relief to disaster victims. Still, Brady also noted that it s fair to question whether the House will follow through, given that the Senate had already made it pretty clear that it was getting out of town once it finished with government funding and wouldn t be dealing with any tax legislation, as Pro Tax s Brian Faler noted. And to be clear, there s plenty of people on and off the Hill who don t expect the House will end up going through with the vote.  Looking to next year: In any event, most groups and people looking for action on the tax front have already shifted their focus to next year. Take the TCJA s retail glitch, which gives restaurants and other shops that were supposed to be able to immediately write off renovations an expensing calendar of up to 39 years.  I m not so naive as to think that it will be easy, but if there are corrections allowed at any point, we believe we ll be at or near the front of the line,  said one source closely watching the issue, with Democrats expected to ask for a lot in exchange for tax law fixes.  There is only so much we can do to overcome the politics of the tax bill, so we are primarily focused on keeping the issue at the front of the pack and emphasizing that it, in and of itself, is not political.  GRADING TCJA: The reviews of the TCJA after a year are continuing to pour in   and, as you might expect, they re kind of mixed. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters on a conference call on Wednesday that they re quite pleased with the tax law s impact on the economy.  The idea that we re on a sugar high for one year, and then it s all going to go back to where it was next year, is just not consistent with literature. And the people who said we couldn t have 3 percent growth last year are saying it about next year, and I that they re as incorrect now as they were last year,  Hassett said.  The dissenting view: Andrew Schwartz and Galen Hendricks with the Center for American Progress counter that  despite the current strength of the macroeconomy, the fiscal damage from the TCJA is already extensive. The 116th Congress should pursue real tax reform that eliminates the law s costly and ineffective provisions and instead prioritizes a fairer tax code that benefits workers rather than corporations and the wealthy.   SEEKING SOME SPINE: The Great Democracy Initiative is out with a new paper this morning that argues that progressives and the center-left need to push for more fundamental changes to the U.S. tax code, instead of fiddling around the edges with approaches like scrapping tax breaks. A more fully progressive system, argues the paper from Jeremy Bearer-Friend, an NYU law professor and former tax counsel to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), would favor labor over capital, be a regulatory counter to big business and spur  a reinvigoration of public funding at the scale of the New Deal.  The paper s specific proposals include taxing pass-throughs as traditional C corporations, treating capital gains the same as ordinary income, repealing the tax law s deduction for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) while hiking its base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT), and allowing the IRS to fill in key information on taxpayers  tax forms. KEEP THE WHISTLE IN THE POCKET: Whistleblowers shouldn t be granted protection for coming forward on matters of tax avoidance and evasion, the Council of the EU s legal service says in an internal document. Europe had been interested in shielding those kinds of whistleblowers in the aftermath of the Panama Papers, as our Laura Kayali reports. But the legal service says the current legislative proposal on whistleblowers is too unwieldy, and should be split into separate chunks. Standalone legislation on fiscal matters would be unlikely to get the unanimous backing from EU countries that it would require, Laura notes. OREGON, MAN: The Oregon legislature is going to look once more into repealing its gigabit tax break, as the Oregonian reports. The tax incentive actually went on to the books without any opposition, as the state was trying to woo Google Fiber, which ended up not coming to Portland. But Comcast has saved about $15 million because of the preference, while Frontier Communications has gotten about $2.5 million in tax savings.  The tax break exempts internet providers from an unusual Oregon tax methodology, which includes some nontangible assets   like a company s brand   in calculating their property tax valuations,  the Oregonian notes.

TOP NEWS: GOP hawks and many others slam Trump s surprise order to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria  ON POLITICO: Trump again insists the military will build his border wall   Senate passes a short-term spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown at midnight Friday GOP HAWKS SLAM TRUMP S SURPRISE SYRIA WITHDRAWAL:  GOP senators leveled blistering criticism at Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday for President Donald Trump s decision to withdraw from Syria, with multiple Republican senators expressing outrage and frustration,  report POLITICO s David Brown, your Morning D correspondent and Burgess Everett.  Pence was dispatched to the Hill as the administration began absorbing a torrent of condemnation from hawkish Republicans, who blasted the White House s announcement that the U.S. and its allies have defeated the Islamic State in Syria and that some of the 2,000 U.S. troops battling the terrorist group will begin coming home.   If Obama had done this, all of us would be going nuts because it s such a bad idea,  said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a member of the Armed Services Committee.  The job of the Congress is to hold the executive branch accountable. He s the commander in chief, but he needs to be held accountable for his decisions. And I want hearings as soon as possible,   KEY DEMS BLAST THE MOVE AS WELL: Key Democrats were also quick to criticize the withdrawal.  The hasty, disjointed manner in which this announcement was made demonstrates an administration in disarray and provides further evidence of President Trump s inability to lead on the world stage,  SASC ranking Democrat Jack Reed said in a written statement. And Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said she, too, was trying to get a handle on where different administration officials stood on the issue.  I m very disappointed,  she said.  What I heard when I was in Syria, was that while the fight against ISIS was going very well, that there were ISIS fighters who were going underground.  And we also cede influence to Iran and Russia and [President Bashar al-] Assad in Syria in a way that would not be good for the United States,  she added.  Graham and Shaheen join four other colleagues to urge Trump in a letter to reconsider  a premature and costly mistake  by withdrawing.   IT S TIME FOR OUR TROOPS TO COME BACK HOME : In a video message posted to Twitter, the president declares  we have won against ISIS  and  we ve beaten them and we ve beaten them badly.   And after pulling out of Syria, might Afghanistan be next? asks The Associated Press.  MATTIS REPORTED LOSING HIS INFLUENCE:  President Trump s decision to abruptly withdraw troops from Syria is a clear rebuke to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, the last remaining member of a retinue of military men Trump once fondly called  my generals,   writes The Washington Post.  Mattis had argued that the counterterrorism mission in Syria is not over and that the small U.S. presence in Syria should remain, said current and former U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal policy discussions.   Indeed, Trump s move breaks with his own national security team,  notes POLITICO s Nahal Toosi. For example, just last week, Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, told reporters such a withdrawal would be  reckless.   RUSSIA, THOUGH, BACKS THE WITHDRAWAL, WHILE KURDS ARE LEFT IN THE LURCH:  A decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria creates prospects for a political settlement of the crisis there, TASS news agency reported the Russian Foreign Ministry as saying on Wednesday,  via Reuters.  All State Department officials in Syria are reported to be evacuating, adds Reuters.  On Thursday, Turkey s defense minister said Syrian Kurdish militants  will be buried in their ditches when the time comes,  via Reuters.

POMPEO TO GIVE CAIRO ADDRESS ON U.S. MIDEAST ROLE:  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo plans to deliver a speech about America s role in the Middle East during a visit to Egypt next month, a State Department official told POLITICO,  via Nahal.  The address, which is still in the planning stages, would come as President Donald Trump struggles to settle on a coherent policy toward the region.  TURKEY STICKS WITH RUSSIA S S-400, DESPITE PROPOSED PATRIOT BUY:  Turkey has not changed its decision to buy S-400 missile defense systems from Russia but welcomes a U.S. State Department approval of the possible purchase of a rival Patriot system from the United States, two Turkish officials said on Wednesday,  via Reuters.  One official described the State Department decision as good signal for Ankara s troubled relations with Washington, and Turkey was now waiting for the next U.S. step.   And despite the possible buy, Russia also said it was pressing ahead with the S-400 deal, adds Reuters. RUSSIA SAYS IT WON T SHOW U.S. THE MISSILE AT HEART OF INF DISPUTE:  Russia said on Wednesday it would not let the United States inspect a new nuclear-capable cruise missile at the heart of a dispute between Washington and Moscow that risks unraveling a landmark arms control treaty,  via Reuters.  TREASURY ROLLS OUT NEW RUSSIA SANCTIONS:  The Trump administration rolled out a new spate of sanctions on Russian entities on Wednesday, targeting the country s hacking in international organizations and the two Russian nationals who allegedly carried out an assassination attempt on a former KGB spy in the United Kingdom last March,  reports POLITICO s Matthew Choi.  UKRAINE PLANS TO SEND WARSHIPS BACK TO DISPUTED WATERS:  Ukraine plans to again send its warships into the Sea of Azov, a top Ukrainian official said, a move that could set the stage for another clash with Russia,  via the AP. SENATE VOTES TO AVERT SHUTDOWN:  The Senate passed a short-term spending bill on Wednesday night to avoid a partial government shutdown, kicking a fight with President Donald Trump over border wall funding until next year,  report POLITICO s Burgess, Eliana Johnson and Sarah Ferris.  The legislation was passed by voice vote and will keep the government open until Feb. 8, provided the House will pass it.  TRUMP AGAIN INSISTS MILITARY WILL BUILD BORDER WALL:  President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the U.S. military will construct his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, insisting that it will be built  one way or the other  while seemingly walking back threats to shut down the government if Congress fails to appropriate for the wall by the end of the week,  writes POLITICO s Caitlin Oprysko.  And following the delayed announcement of the death of a 7-year-old girl, the Trump administration says Congress and the media will now be notified within 24 hours of any border death, via POLITICO s Rebecca Morin. PENTAGON: NO LOCATION SET FOR U.S. SPACE COMMAND: The Pentagon has not yet decided where it will base the new U.S. Space Command, a spokesperson said Wednesday, via our colleague Jacqueline Klimas. The president ordered the re-establishment of the Space Command on Tuesday.  AIRMEN SUE FOR BEING BOOTED OUT FOR HIV DIAGNOSIS:  Testing positive for HIV was difficult enough. Getting forced out of the military by the Air Force because of the diagnosis proved even harder,  writes The Washington Post.  So say two U.S. airmen who filed suit on Wednesday against Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, arguing that the Pentagon s decision last month to discharge them from the military owing to their HIV status violates the constitution s equal protection clause and federal law.  PYONGYANG REFUSES TO UNILATERALLY GIVE UP NUKES:  North Korea said Thursday that it will never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons unless the United States first removes what Pyongyang called a nuclear threat. The surprisingly blunt statement jars with Seoul s more rosy presentation of the North Korean position and could rattle the already fragile diplomacy between Washington, Seoul and Pyongyang to defuse a nuclear crisis that last year had many fearing war,  writes the AP.  Still, South Korea seeks smaller military drills with U.S. amid North Korea talks, reports Reuters. SENATE APPROVES TRUMP S COUNTERTERRORISM PICK: The Senate Wednesday approved by voice vote the president s counterterrorism nominee after months of delay, reports our colleague Martin Matishak:  Lawmakers greenlighted Joseph Maguire to be the next director of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), which is responsible for the government s national and international counterterrorism efforts.

Mr. President, we re going to back you up,  Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said last night.  If you veto this bill we ll be there.  The House is expected to take up a short-term spending package today that would fund the rest of the government through Feb. 8. The Senate passed the package last night via voice vote, but senators are hanging around today to see what happens in the House, where conservatives see the current border wall fight as their last chance to secure funding for Trump s wall.  Do we actually think we re going to build a border security wall when Nancy Pelosi is speaker of the House?  Freedom Caucus co-founder Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) asked last night as he introduced an amendment to add $5 billion in wall funding to the bill.  This is our last best chance.  Even with conservative opposition and the possibility of dozens of Republicans skipping votes, however, the spending package would likely pass with Democratic support.Story Continued Below But a poor showing among House Republicans would be an embarrassment for House Speaker Paul Ryan in what could be his final vote -- and it could embolden Trump to force the government shutdown that he threatened as recently as last week,  Sarah warns. The bill includes some money for border fencing by maintaining the current $1.3 billion budget. But it doesn t include disaster aid for those impacted by wildfires and hurricanes. And no one knows whether Trump will sign it.  I don t know what s going to happen [today],  Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) said.  I don t think anybody knows what s going to happen [today].

Sen. Lindsey Graham said he was  personally offended  having to read about the decision in the news instead of hearing it from Trump or his aides. Graham said Congress will hold the administration accountable.  If Obama had done this, all of us would be going nuts because it s such a bad idea,  he recounted telling Pence.

Thanks for reading Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill, on this Thursday, Dec. 20.WEDNESDAY S MOST CLICKED: Marianne s report on the Senate s passage of bipartisan criminal justice reform was the big winner. CONFIRMATION WATCH -- Former Attorney General William Barr, the president s pick to lead the Justice Department, sent DOJ an unsolicited 20-page memo earlier this year blasting special counsel Robert Mueller s inquiry into potential obstruction of justice. Mueller s probe reportedly includes whether the president obstructed justice by asking then-FBI Director James Comey to stop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn and later firing Comey. The June 8 memo to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein says the president acted within his authority.  Mr. Barr s reasoning is likely to be closely scrutinized in confirmation hearings before the Senate, where Democrats and some Republicans have already promised to press him on how he would handle the Russia investigation, as well as on his expansive views of executive power,  The Wall Street Journal s Sadie Gurman and Aruna Viswanatha write.  When Mr. Barr was selected, White House officials said they believed he would be easily approved by a GOP-controlled Senate.  Barr wrote that Mueller s approach is  grossly irresponsible  with  potentially disastrous implications  for the executive branch.

Incoming Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) sent more than 50 letters to multiple agencies and departments, the Trump Organization and the president s personal attorneys requesting documents on a series of scandals that have plagued the president and his administration. Cummings is seeking information on the administration s handling of hurricanes Irma and Maria, its family separation policy at the border, the revocation of security clearances from former officials who have criticized the president and more.  While the documents are not subpoenas, Cummings  letters lay the groundwork for a much more aggressive oversight of the executive branch in the next two years,  Rachael and Bres write.  Democrats have long complained that House Republicans have turned a blind eye to allegations of misconduct, misuse of official funds and other alleged conflicts of interest. Cummings, a veteran of oversight battles, is planning to hold the administration s feet to the fire.

Our organizations represent millions of Americans who have been directly impacted, have had family members directly impacted, or are deeply disturbed by the intent and consequences of  the ban, the groups write in a letter to be released this morning.

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) that would make lynching a federal crime.  The proposal outlines the specific act of lynching -- a mob killing without legal authority -- and would add lynching to the federal list of hate crimes,  CNN s Eli Watkins reports.  Mississippi GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith presided over the session, a position some noted with irony due to a comment she made about attending a  public hanging  that led to widespread anger during her election bid this fall.

Wednesday was the third time Republicans blocked the measure.

Story Continued Below POWELL GIVES MARKETS A SAD   Fed Chair Jay Powell evidently wasn t  feeling the market  on Wednesday as the central bank s quarter point rate hike and reduction in expected hikes for 2019 to two did not please Wall Street, where the Dow closed down another 1.5 percent to 23,323, it s closing low for the year. The index is now off 5.6 percent for 2018. The S&P is now off 6.2 percent. The Nasdaq is down 3.9 percent. Things started off OK with the Dow up around 100 points as Powell started his press conference. The Fed s statement, mostly in line with expectations, avoided caving to Trump while leaning into the idea of a more dovish stance next year. (Here s exactly how it changed, via CNBC.) The projections took down estimates for 2019 growth a bit to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent and also reduced the  dot plot  consensus for hikes next year to two from three. But things began to go south hard and fast during the second half of Powell s presser, perhaps in part because he said the central bank will not change its plans to continue to reduce the size of its balance sheet, something that President Trump has been complaining about in recent interviews and tweets. Powell for his part, had a couple of opportunities to reject the idea that Trump s comments play any role in Fed decisions. And he took them.  To CNBC s Steve Liesman    Political considerations play no role whatsoever in our discussions or decisions about monetary policy   Nothing will deter us from doing what we think is the right thing to do.   To our Victoria Guida    I know, and everyone who works at the Fed knows, that we are going to do our jobs the way we ve always done them.   Richard Bernstein Advisors  Rich Bernstein emails on the late sell-off    This still seems to me like a  run  on the equity market based more in fear than on fundamentals. Washington DC in general needs to fully understand that without an FDIC for stocks their main mission should be to calm investors every way they can or the volatility could be a self-fulfilling prophecy by raising too much uncertainty, stymying business activity, and causing a recession.  That s partly a message to the Fed but it s mostly a message to Trump on China.  YIELD CURVE FLATTENS   Via MarketWatch:  Long-dated Treasury yields fell after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates .. The 10-year Treasury note yield was down by 1.5 basis points to 2.808%. The 2-year note yield rose by 1.2 basis points to 2.664%, while the 30-year bond yield saw the most decisive move, slipping 4.8 basis points to 3.029%.  Read more.  Victoria s take is here    The Fed   raised its main borrowing rate on Wednesday, ignoring repeated calls from   Trump to hold off on further interest rate hikes. Though the move is sure to frustrate the president, it comes as the central bank continues to underscore the strength of the economy, particularly the growing number of jobs, even with unemployment below 4 percent.    Powell and other central bank policymakers have emphasized in recent months that the number of rate hikes next year is highly uncertain because the central bank doesn t know what will happen with the economy The central bank kept a line in its statement indicating that there is an equal chance that the economy will heat up or cool down   Pantheon s Ian Shepherdson    The FOMC did the minimum expected of it   That wasn t enough for the stock market, where investors appear to have been hoping to see a more substantive change in the Fed s tone. That didn t happen.   Lazard Asset Management s Ron Temple    I believe the Fed made the right decision for the wrong reasons. With its more dovish outlook, the Fed is too attentive to short-term market moves and not enough to the benefits of running a high-pressure economy. .   POWELL (SORT OF) THREADS THE NEEDLE   ManuLife s Megan Greene:  Had the Fed been more dovish, it would have been confirmation bias for investors worried about growth next year. If it had been more hawkish, investors would have worried the Powell Put was dead and the Fed would kill off yet another recovery.  Jay Powell had a really difficult job today and he did a decent job, but the markets overreacted to his comments a few weeks ago about rates being just under the range of estimates for neutral (market based probabilities suggested only one rate hike was priced in for 2019 and a rate cut was priced in for 2020). A repricing was going to be hard to avoid.  Megan also makes the economic bear case in an FT op-ed:  My view is that 2019 will see global synchronisation, but not in a good way. This year economists anticipated a global acceleration in growth. I expect a synchronised slowdown in the year to come.  MM SIDEBAR   The sudden change in market mood from  this is sort of dovish and what we expected  to  this sucks, sell everything  was really puzzling. Usually you can hang such a move on a specific word or phrase from a Fed press conference. Not on Wednesday. Have a theory on what happened? Email me on bwhite@politico.com.  SENATE CLEARS SPENDING BILL   Via our Burgess Everett, Eliana Johnson, and Sarah Ferris:  The Senate passed a short-term spending bill that keeps the government open through Feb. 8 and avoids a shutdown at week s end. The House is expected to pass the bill, which denies   Trump funding for his much-sought after border wall. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate will remain in session on Thursday pending House action on the spending bill.  Read more.  SPEAKING OF TRUMP THE DOW MAN   A close reader emails:  Really liked your tariff man vs Dow Jones construct today. In the same vein, if [Trump] would restore the previously in place aluminum and steel exemptions for Canada and Mexico, he would relieve $15 billion in tariffs and counter tariffs that would be an immediate boon for steel and aluminum consumers like Ford, GM and Boeing while also letting Iowa pork farmers to try to reclaim markets in Mexico that they are losing to Eastern Europe   FED EX SOUNDS GRIM   This certainly didn t help markets on Wednesday, via Bloomberg s Thomas Black:  FedEx Corp. plunged the most in three years as a darkening view of demand for shipping services outside the U.S. prompted the company to slash its profit forecast and pare international air-freight capacity. The courier cut its outlook just three months after raising it, reflecting an abrupt change in FedEx s view of the global economy.   The peak for global economic growth now appears to be behind us,  Raj Subramaniam, a FedEx veteran who was named this month to take over the Express cargo airline, said on a conference call with investors and analysts. FedEx s gloomier view sharpened concerns that the world s economy is weakening amid rising trade tensions, especially between the U.S. and China -- which the company cited as another source of trouble.

KRANINGER GIVES UP CFPB NAME CHANGE   Our Katy O Donnell:  Kathy Kraninger, the new director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is reversing the name change that her predecessor, Mick Mulvaney, tried to impose on the agency, according to an internal email Wednesday.   I care much more about what we do than what we are called,  Kraninger wrote in the all-hands email, which was originally obtained by the consumer group Allied Progress.  As of December 17, 2018, I have officially halted all ongoing efforts to make changes to existing products and materials related to the name correction initiative.   Read more.  MM SIDEBAR   Smart move. This was pure trolling on Mulvaney s part when he did it and an obvious waste of time and resources. MM never stopped calling it the CFPB though we noticed many lobbying groups dutifully followed Mulvaney s smarmy directive. Wonder if they will change back?

DRIVING THE DAY   Looks like we may avoid a shutdown unless Trump gives in to heat from the right and declines to sign whatever stop-gap bill Congress sends him without any wall funding   Index of Leading Indicators at 10:00 a.m. expected to be flat   House Financial Services has an unironic hearing at 10:00 a.m. on  The Perils of an Ignored National Debt.   FSOC ISSUES REPORT   FSOC on Wednesday evening released its 2018 annual report. Among other items, FSOC  recommends that agencies continue to monitor levels of nonfinancial business leverage, trends in asset valuations, and potential implications for the entities they regulate in order to assess and reinforce their ability to manage severe, simultaneous losses in those markets.   MORE ON THE FED   From Mohamed A. El-Erian on Bloomberg Opinion:  Resisting unusual pressure from both politicians and notable market participants   Powell and his colleagues on the Open Market Committee on Wednesday raised interest rates by 25 basis points and slowed the path for future hikes by less than markets had hoped. In doing so, the central bank reaffirmed that its focus remains firmly domestic and economic.  But the markets  reaction suggested the move was seen as heightening concerns about a policy mistake, rather than responsible policy making. This, and what s likely to play out over the next few weeks, illustrates a bigger phenomenon: the threat that the Fed and other central banks are increasingly in a no-win situation, due to factors mostly outside their control.  Read more.  TAX CUTS BOOSTED GROWTH, BUT AT WHAT COST?   Jason Furman in the WSJ:  It has been nearly a year since   Trump signed sweeping tax changes into law. The macroeconomic data already rule out some of the more extravagant claims about immediate jumps in wages and capital. But the more serious debate over the tax cuts  long-run impact is still far from decided.   [F]iscal policy including the tax cuts, increased federal spending, and increased state and local government spending has clearly added to growth and jobs in 2018.    [O]ver the past year the data clearly show that tax cuts increase deficits. This might seem obvious, but with so many people, including the Treasury secretary, arguing otherwise, it is important to make the point again. In 2018 the deficit rose to $779 billion, or 3.8% of GDP a nearly unprecedented figure for a period of economic expansion and no major wars.  Read more. STOCKS SKID TO 15-MONTH LOW   AP s Marley Jay:  Stocks gave up a big rally and took a dive in afternoon trading Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates again and signaled it s likely to keep raising them next year. The market finished at its lowest level since September 2017.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average swung from a gain of 381 points right before the Fed s decision was announced at 2 p.m. Eastern time to a closing loss of 351 points. The index is down almost 9 percent in December.  Read more.  TRADERS NOT A FAN OF THE FED S MESSAGE   Bloomberg s Emily Barrett:  Traders seemed to agree that they didn t like what they heard from the Federal Reserve at its final meeting for the year, but exactly what caused most offense in markets was less clear. Stocks dropped and Treasuries rallied after the central bank defied pressure to refrain from raising rates, while investors dialed backed their pricing of the future interest-rate path. Fed officials also maintained a generally upbeat view of the economy even as they trimmed their own projections for future rate increases. Observers offered several possible explanations for the risk-off response in markets.  Markets Snubbed? Some thought that the written statement from the Federal Open Market Committee didn t sufficiently address mounting market strains, which have seen U.S. stocks hammered and bond yields tumble in recent weeks.  The Fed is indicating that it s listening to the markets, it has respect for the markets, but it s not going to be ruled by the markets,  said Greg Staples, co-head of Americas fixed income at DWS, following the decision.  Read more.  PROLONGED ECONOMIC EXPANSION POSES MARKET RISKS   WSJ s Andrew Ackerman:  Financial regulators identified vulnerabilities in the U.S. markets from the prolonged economic expansion and said cybersecurity and a  no deal  British exit from the European Union were top potential risks to the financial system.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council of senior regulators, in a report released Wednesday, cited potential risks tied to nonfinancial corporate borrowing, including weak underwriting standards in markets such as leveraged loans. Though firms continue to service their debt burdens with low delinquency levels, corporate debt continued to grow faster than gross domestic product in the past year and the ratio of corporate debt-to-GDP is at a record high  Read more. CURRENT-ACCOUNT DEFICIT WIDENED IN Q3   WSJ s Josh Zumbrun and Eric Morath:  The U.S. current-account deficit, a measure of the nation s trade and financial flows with other countries, widened to a 10-year high in the third quarter, providing the latest evidence that the administration s policies are proving insufficient at meeting their stated goal of taming trade deficits.  The overall current-account deficit climbed to a seasonally adjusted $124.8 billion in the third quarter, up from $101.2 billion in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The quarterly deficit was the largest since global trade collapsed during the recession a decade ago.  Read more.  GOLDMAN S 1MDB REVIVES  TOO BIG TO JAIL  DEBATE   NYT s Peter Eavis:  Should corporations be charged for crimes their employees commit? That nettlesome question has come back to the fore as law enforcement authorities take aim at Goldman Sachs for its involvement in a vast scandal at a Malaysian investment fund.  The Malaysian government on Monday filed criminal charges against Goldman, accusing the bank of making false and misleading statements when it raised money for the fund, called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. The immediate consequences of the Malaysian charges against Goldman subsidiaries are likely to be limited, but the action will stir up discussion about how United States prosecutors should proceed and whether they should bring criminal charges against Goldman.

BERKSHIRE REDUCES HOME CAPITAL INVESTMENT   WSJ s Colin Kellaher and Jacquie McNish:  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has mostly exited its investment in Home Capital Group Inc., some 18 months after Warren Buffett s investment vehicle threw the Canadian alternative lender a lifeline. Home Capital on Wednesday said Berkshire s stake in the company will fall below 10 percent upon completion of the company s 300 million Canadian dollar ($223 million) buyback offer, which will reduce its shares outstanding by about 22.7 percent.  Berkshire in June 2017 agreed to acquire a 38.39 percent stake in Home Capital as part of a rescue package that included a credit line of C$2 billion, which the lender has since repaid.  Read more.

Chicago could get its third skyscraper observatory and all I can say is I hope y all enjoy it cuz I m not going up. Story hereRichard Porter was the fourth person Gov. Bruce Rauner approached to run for governor. The Chicago attorney who also serves as an Illinois RNC National Committeeman told POLITICO it wasn t so gauche as to be an outright ask.Story Continued Below I would have described it as more of an aside in a strategy conversation focused more on how he could win (rather) than an offer,  Porter said of their telephone call. Rauner also approached state Sen. Karen McConnaughay, Cubs owner Todd Ricketts and then-GOP attorney general candidate Erika Harold.Rauner  was in to win,  Porter said.  He was never a quitter. To the contrary. He was always focused on finding the best path to winning. And if that meant he should fall on his sword, then he was willing to do that   and give millions of his money away to boot. I think Rauner s comments on this have been misunderstood. Porter s referring to political watchers who say Rauner s courting of others was a desperate act by a candidate who thought he d lose. But Porter says Rauner just wanted to be assured of a win.Toni Preckwinkle withdrew her objections to Susana Mendoza s petitions yesterday, setting the stage for a head-to-head matchup. Two new polls show Mendoza and Preckwinkle leading the pack of candidates and there s some head-to-head information, too.A Chicago Federation of Labor survey conducted Dec. 4-9 by ALG Research, a firm that s polled for Democrats Rahm Emanuel and Hillary Clinton, shows Preckwinkle beating Mendoza 21 percent to 16 percent. They re followed by Bill Daley (9 percent); Willie Wilson (8 percent); Garry McCarthy (7 percent); Dorothy Brown and Paul Vallas (tied at 6 percent); Amara Enyia (5 percent); and Gery Chico (3 percent).But in a one-on-one matchup, Mendoza, the state comptroller, beats the County Board president 45 percent to Preckwinkle s 39 percent. Sun-Times has details on the ALG poll here In a separate survey initiated by Preckwinkle s team and conducted by another Democratic polling firm, Tulchin Research, Preckwinkle leads with 22 percent in a race with 12 candidates. Mendoza is second with 12 percent; Daley and Vallas (tied with 10 percent); McCarthy (8 percent); Wilson (7 percent); Enyia (6 percent); Lori Lightfoot and Chico (tied at 3 percent); LaShawn Ford (2 percent); and undecideds (19 percent).In this hypothetical runoff, Preckwinkle edges Mendoza 42 percent to 39 percent with undecideds at 19 percent. And against Daley, Preckwinkle gets 49 percent to his 31 percent with 20 percent undecided. Tulchin poll hereWelcome to POLITICO s Illinois Playbook. Have a tip, event, announcement, endorsement?

SUBSCRIBE to Illinois Playbook: http://politi.co/1NTMQid  Fireworks were expected Tuesday night for the 44th Ward aldermanic forum. The event was sponsored by Neighbors for a Better Lakeview, named as a dark money group funded by the Cubs to unseat Ald. Tom Tunney. The forum gave a fair shake to Tunney and challengers Austin Baidas, Elizabeth Shydlowski and Patrick Shine. Organizers controlled the questions mostly standard fare about taxes, leadership and staying independent when the mayor s a force. But there wasn t a single question related to the Cubs. After nearly an hour-and-a-half, a frustrated audience member yelled out,  Ask about the Cubs! C mon! This is ridiculous! Organizers quickly moved the forum to closing statements. Tunney, who was last up, finally addressed the elephant in the room:  We have worked tirelessly with the Cubs and Ricketts family to renovate that area while respecting residents and other small business  rights.  The crowd, which was well-attended by Tunney supporters, cheered and the event wrapped up. Facebook video here  Daley starts the ball rolling on a series of televised mayoral debates. Candidate Bill Daley wrote a letter Wednesday to eight television station managers, noting that with Election Day just 10 weeks away, there s  little time to waste  in getting the ball rolling on a series of mayoral debates.  The people of Chicago deserve to hear how mayoral candidates will address the issues, so they can decide which candidate best represents their voices and can deliver on promises,  Daley wrote. Sun-Times  Fran Spielman has the story here.  Every candidate in this West Side race might get knocked off the ballot (once again)   except the sitting alderman, by Blockclub s Mauricio Pena. Story here  How I wound up chauffeuring a mayoral hopeful for a day, by Chicago magazine s Ali Barthwell:  Watching her work, it s easy to feel impressed, even a little intimidated, by Amara Enyia. Not in that way that most white men mean  impressed  when they talk about meeting an intelligent and thoughtful woman of color. I just mean she s really damn impressive,  Barthwell writes. Story here  Following up on our list of potential candidates for the state Senate seat being vacated by Kwame Raoul: Watch for Curtis Tarver II, who was just elected to the House seat held by retiring state Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie. Other names batted about: Reclaim Chicago s Robert Peters and Adrienne Irmer, who lost to Tarver in the House D-25 primary race.  Does Ald. Marty Quinn still have an in with House Speaker Mike Madigan? Sun-Times  Fran Spielman wonders in a story here. Plus, ABC/7 s Craig Wall says the teen candidate running against Quinn got a call from the FBI about those fraud allegations. Story hereSome surprises in the Chicago Federation of Labor s endorsements for municipal elections. For now, at least, it s staying neutral on the mayor s race (see its poll above). It s endorsing Melissa Conyears-Ervin in the competitive city treasurer race (that seems like an oxymoron) and incumbent Anna Valencia for city clerk. The labor union is backing most incumbents, though in a surprise move it isn t weighing in at all in the 14th Ward race that has embattled veteran Ald. Ed Burke facing four challengers. Here s the full list, and following are more standouts:20th Ward: Endorsing veteran school council member and chairman Jeanette Taylor. She s among 15 candidates vying for the seat of outgoing Ald. Willie Cochran. He s going on trial for bribery charges (ignore how casually that sentence is stated).22nd Ward: Endorsing Michael Rodriguez for seat being vacated by Ald. Ric Munoz.25th Ward: Remaining neutral for the seat being vacated by Ald. Daniel Solis. There are five candidates.31st Ward: Endorsing Felix Cardona Jr. over incumbent Ald. Milly Santiago.35th Ward: Remaining neutral in race that has incumbent Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa facing three challengers.39th Ward: Endorsing Joe Duplechin for seat being vacated by retiring Ald. Marge Laurino.43rd Ward: Endorsing Derek Lindblom over incumbent Ald. Michele Smith.45th Ward: No resolution on endorsement for seat held by Ald. John Arena.47th Ward: Endorsing Michael Negron for seat being vacated by Ald. Ameya Pawar, who s running for city treasurer.49th Ward: Remaining neutral in race where incumbent Ald.

WBEZ shines a light on test that fair housing organizations use to expose housing discrimination, a practice that dates back to the 1960s housing campaign led by Martin Luther King Jr. in Chicago. The test works like this: Fair housing groups send two people to visit the same landlord. The volunteers are similar except for one detail   a white man and a black man, perhaps, or a woman with a Section 8 voucher and a woman without   and they report back on how they were treated. Natalie Moore has the story here.  As police cover-up verdict looms, civil rights lawyer asks why bosses weren t charged, by WBEZ s Chip Mitchell: Attorney Locke Bowman says there s  every reason to suggest that the commanding officer was an active participant in the creation of the narrative at odds with the videotape.  But there have been no charges against police bosses in the alleged cover-up of Laquan McDonald s killing. Story here  Ride in Elon Musk s LA tunnel was  a little bumpy,  Chicago alderman says. Not yet smooth sailing for O Hare project either, by Tribune s Mary Wisniewski: Ald. Gilbert Villegas (36th) was one of a group of Chicago officials this week who got to test-ride a Los Angeles transportation tunnel built by Elon Musk. He still has  a lot of questions  about how a similar tunnel could be built in Chicago. Story here  More than $100 million in infrastructure improvements is planned for the metro-east levee system. The work will help protect about 288,000 people, 4,000 businesses and more than 56,000 jobs in the region from flood waters, reports Belleville News-Democrat s Joseph Bustos. Story here  Illinois declines in population for fifth year in a row with more than 45,000 fewer residents, by Tribune s Angie Leventis Lourgos:  Illinois suffered the second-largest numeric loss of any state, following only New York, which was down 48,510 residents but has a much larger overall population of more than 19.5 million, according to the data. Other states that declined were West Virginia, Louisiana, Hawaii, Mississippi, Alaska, Connecticut and Wyoming. No other states in the Midwest had losses.  That s according to the latest Census Bureau data released Wednesday. Story here  Short-term senator gets committee leadership pay.

                    Updated 12/20/2018 10:03 PM ESTHouse Republicans passed a stop-gap spending bill on Thursday that delivers $5 billion for President Donald Trump s border wall, setting up a standoff with the Senate that drastically raises the likelihood of a government shutdown this weekend.By a 217-185 vote, House Republicans pushed through the measure, which extends the deadline for government funding until Feb. 8. It includes nearly $8 billion in emergency disaster aid for California, Florida and several other states.Story Continued Below House Republicans believe their bill is a starting point for negotiations with the Senate, which unanimously passed a clean funding bill on Wednesday night and quickly left town.  The House has now passed a bill. The Senate passed a bill,  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).  Now we find where the common ground lies.  But the House GOP proposal is D.O.A. in the Senate, where Democrats have vowed to reject any funding for the border wall. Government funding runs out at midnight Friday, meaning a partial government shutdown looks almost certain at this point.  The bottom line is simple: The Trump temper tantrum will shut down the government, but it will not get him his wall,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters shortly before the House vote. Schumer was joined by House Minority Leader Pelosi (D-Calif.), who is adamantly opposed to the wall. House Republicans teed off on Pelosi after the House vote, noting repeatedly that she had told Trump at last week s epic White House meeting that there weren t enough votes to pass any bill with $5 billion in wall funding.  All I know is that just one week ago, Nancy Pelosi was in the Oval Office and she said the House can t pass a funding with border security wall dollars on it,  crowed Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, a group of hardliners on immigration.  We just got 217 votes for that bill.  But the House vote capped a chaotic day for Trump and House Republicans, a day when - once again - the Freedom Caucus dictated to GOP leaders what they can do. And the sudden, acrimonious resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis rattled Republicans and Democrats alike, as one of the most highly respected officials in Trump s administration decided he could no longer work for a capricious president.Trump declared earlier in the day that he wouldn t sign any funding bill that didn t include money for his signature border wall, a position that dramatically increases the risk of a partial government shutdown. Trump s declaration ended several days of confusion over what the president wanted. The Senate on Wednesday passed a short-term funding bill to keep the government open until Feb. 8, but it included no wall funding. But Trump finally showed his hand after an Oval Office meeting with GOP House leadership and key members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. The meeting with McCarthy, Jordan, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) and two members of the House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), among others, was held to settle an internal GOP battle over the border wall and a potential government shutdown.   I ve made my position very clear,  Trump said as he signed a five-year farm bill.  Any measure that funds the government has to include border security. Has to. Not for political purposes, but for our country, for the safety of our community.  Following Trump s decision, Ryan and other House GOP leaders were forced to change direction on the border wall. The House leadership had earlier backed the Senate bill, but after Trump s declaration, they moved forward with a bill to provide $5 billion for the border wall.  Republican leaders then added the $8 billion in disaster aid to sweeten the pot for members. Jordan and Meadows had led a revolt on the House floor on Wednesday night after GOP leaders did not fund Trump s border wall, a demand that was taken up by conservative commentators in the media. All of this proved too much for Trump to resist, leading to an embarrassing setback for Ryan, McCarthy, Scalise and other top House Republicans.   The president informed us he will not sign the bill that came from the Senate last evening because of his legitimate concerns for border security,  Ryan told reporters after the hour-long meeting with Trump at the White House.  So what we re going to do is go back to the House and work with our members.  Ryan, McCarthy and Scalise had been urging Trump to avoid a shutdown and agree to a stopgap funding measure that would keep the government open until Feb. 8. The party leaders initially argued that Senate Democrats will never approve Trump s demand for another $5 billion in wall funding. After the meeting, McCarthy changed direction and embraced Trump s position.  We had a great discussion with him now,  McCarthy said.  The president said that what the Senate sent over is just kicking the can down the road. We want to solve this problem, we want to keep the government open.  Meadows and Jordan argued that once Democrats get control of the House on Jan. 3, Pelosi and her colleagues will never approve any money for the president s border wall project so they had to act now.  Meadows, along with more than a dozen other conservatives, took to the House floor Wednesday night in a series of protest floor speeches demanding more money for the wall.  [Trump] believes that his request is reasonable and certainly something that should be supported by the vast majority of Americans, and certainly by the vast majority of Congress,  said Meadows, who had been in the mix to become Trump s chief of staff.  At this point, I don t see a vote from a clean CR [continuing resolution] that has come over from the Senate being something that will have even close to the majority of the majority.  Meadows   who privately appealed to Trump for support, a move that undermined Ryan and McCarthy   also said he didn t want a stand-alone bill with wall funding.  There s no leverage there, so I can t imagine that would be a tactic anyone would use,  Meadows said. House Republicans moved quickly Thursday night, one sign of progress during an otherwise ugly day for the party leadership. Even so, Sessions warned members of the rules panel to  stick around  through the evening.
                                  We re gonna get it passed and send a clear message that we stand with the president in securing our border,  Scalise said, despite the fact that hours earlier he d been pushing a short-term spending bill with no border wall money.  What I ve always said is we need to support the president and give him the tools to keep the country safe.  Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) said he s personally heard from GOP leaders that the bill will pass. It helps, Byrne said, that many of the missing GOP lawmakers on Thursday lean moderate.   The question is, what happens when it goes over there?  Byrne said of the Senate, which he said seems to be missing half its members.  The Alabama Republican then deadpanned that he s begun looking for a place to get a Christmas meal in Washington. Senators, meanwhile, learned of the news about Trump s hardline decision on the border wall via Twitter, where it was read aloud in a sparsely attended GOP lunch. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately left to talk to Ryan, according to Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.  Johnson said at least half the conference had gone home and they have been given notice that they may be called back to D.C. But he s preparing to head back to Wisconsin.  It s kind of a ghost town around here,  Johnson said. Earlier on Thursday, Pelosi reveled in what she described as  sort of a meltdown  among House Republicans, but said Democrats would be open to some potential sweeteners GOP leaders are considering, like disaster aid. Even though the House approved a bill to give Trump border wall money, Schumer and other Senate Democrats will never allow it move forward in that chamber. That s why McConnell (R-Ky.) was able to push through a short-term funding bill late Wednesday night with no opposition. The stopgap funding bill initially proposed by House GOP leaders did include some money for border fencing: it maintains current spending at a level of $1.3 billion, just shy of the $1.6 billion that the Senate had sought in a funding deal. Trump had initially demanded $5 billion, though he had since appeared to retreat on that figure. The seven-week funding bill also had no disaster aid money, which upset a number of members from affected states. Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.) said a group of lawmakers from the Southeast states would oppose any funding bill that didn t include at least some disaster aid for farmers hit by coastal storms this fall.   Absolutely not,  Scott said firmly, when asked if he would support the bill in its current form.Rachael Bade, Burgess Everett, and Nancy Cook contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/20/2018 04:27 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to shut down the government over funding for his border wall. But as the question of money for his campaign proposal once again roils Congress, one man thinks he may have found a solution: crowd-funding.Brian Kolfage, a 37-year-old Florida resident who was severely wounded in the Iraq war, has started a GoFundMe campaign to complete Trump s signature pledge. The campaign has raised more than $7 million in the three days since it started, with an overall goal of $1 billion.Story Continued BelowThe haul so far makes Kolfage s effort one of the largest GoFundMe campaigns of the year, currently fourth on the site. The Florida veteran s fundraising page ranks ahead of the nearly $4 million raised for the March for Our Lives in Washington, the anti-gun violence rally organized by students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, but trails the largest campaign for the year, the Time s Up legal defense fund, which has raised more than $22 million.Trump initially told congressional leaders that he would accept nothing less than $5 billion for his wall in a bill to keep most of the federal government open. Estimates for the total costs of a wall have varied   even Trump has changed his mind on an original vision for a continuous stretch along the entire border   but it usually falls somewhere in the $12 billion to $20 billion range. A staff report written for Senate Democrats argued that the price could be as high as $70 billion.In a statement on the campaign s site, Kolfage said the $1 billion is the current max for GoFundMe, but he is working to increase it. He added that if the roughly 63 million Americans who voted for Trump were each to donate $80, they would be able to raise the $5 billion the president is asking Congress for.  Democrats are going to stall this project by every means possible and play political games to ensure President Trump doesn t get his victor [sic],  Kolfage wrote.  They d rather see President Trump fail, than see America succeed. However, if we can fund a large portion of this wall, it will jump-start things and will be less money Trump has to secure from our politicians.

                    By BURGESS EVERETT, ELIANA JOHNSON and SARAH FERRISA representative from GoFundMe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kolfage says that he is in touch with the Trump administration to secure a point of contact for the potential donations and a legal firm to make sure Uncle Sam cannot use the money for other means. There s also a pledge that all the donations will be held until the legal aspects are worked out   and that they will be refunded if the campaign does not come close to its goal.Americans crowd-funding their own government is not as unusual as it might seem. The Treasury Department has a way for citizens to make unconditional gifts to the government. Among other things, one can donate to help pay down the national debt   in fiscal year 2018, just shy of $776,000 was raised this way. The National Park Service has its foundation for donations; businessman and philanthropist David M. Rubenstein has donated more than $18 million to improvements for national monuments like the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument.Perhaps the most notable crowd-funding campaign in U.S. history was the one that raised the money to erect a pedestal for the Statue of Liberty.  Let us not wait for the millionaires to give us this money,  implored Joseph Pulitzer in March 1885 in the New York World, his newspaper. More than $100,000 was raised, much of it from donations of less than a dollar.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                        Growth surge ripples across key presidential states.
                    By MARC CAPUTO, STEVEN SHEPARD and SCOTT BLAND12/19/2018 06:28 PM EST
                    Updated 12/19/2018 06:43 PM ESTMIAMI   A handful of presidential battleground states experienced a population explosion over the past year, altering the landscape in at least three key states that stand to play a pivotal role in the 2020 election.Those population shifts are poised to have a tangible impact in 2020   with demographic shifts cementing Florida s premier swing-state status, vaulting Arizona onto the list of 2020 swing states and perhaps putting Nevada further out of reach for President Donald Trump s reelection campaign.Story Continued BelowBoth the year-over-year changes and the longer-term trends this decade point to a transformed electoral map in 2020   shaped both by population shifts and the Trump-enhanced realignment that has come to define modern politics. The population shifts could have even more material impacts after 2020, when the decennial reapportionment process will remake the House of Representatives in 2022 and the Electoral College for the 2024 presidential election.New Census Bureau estimates released Wednesday of the fastest-growing states between 2017 and 2018 report Nevada is roughly tied for first for the greatest population growth by percentage over the past year (with Idaho, at 2.1 percent). But right behind were Arizona   where Democrats won a Senate election last month for the first time since 1988   at 1.7 percent, and Florida, which is already the nation s largest swing state and grew at a 1.5-percent clip over the past year.While Florida was fifth in growth rate, more U.S. residents moved there than to any other state over the past year. It has the third-highest population of 21 million, the second-highest number of total new residents and 132,000 residents who came from elsewhere in the country.The race for 2020 starts now.

More people means more campaigning, more money, more advertising, more of everything,  Ingoglia, a state representative, said.The numbers   especially the net domestic migration data   could also mean more pressure for Democrats, who saw their hopes of saving Sen. Bill Nelson and winning the governor s mansion for the first time in 20 years dashed by historic turnout for Republicans that was likely fueled by a wave of retirees from the Midwest and parts of the Northeast. The more older, whiter voters who move here from higher-tax, higher-regulation states, the more we win,  Ingoglia said.The new census data released Wednesday don t show the race, age and home state of the new U.S. residents picked up by Florida last year, but they do show that New York lost the most residents (48,510) and Illinois the second-highest number (45,116) between July 1, 2017, and July 1, 2018.Puerto Rico continued to hemorrhage people, losing nearly 130,000 people, or 3.9 percent of its population. Puerto Rico has seen a steady decline in population over the last decade,  Sandra Johnson, demographer and statistician for the Census Bureau, said in a written statement.  Hurricane Maria in September of 2017 further impacted that loss, both before and during the recovery period. A disproportionate number of hurricane evacuees moved to Florida from the island, and Democrats hoped they would be a crucial component in fueling a blue wave. But Puerto Rican turnout appeared to lag behind the statewide average   and Republicans ultimately lost only one of five statewide races, for agriculture commissioner. 
                    Congress 
                    By BURGESS EVERETT, ELIANA JOHNSON and SARAH FERRIS The big issue is they left the island, and they came here   but they either didn t register to vote or not enough of them voted,  said Matt Isbell, a Florida Democratic data analyst. We ve been getting a ton of migration from the Midwest especially, and a lot of them fit the profile of Republican voters,  Isbell said.  And it s balancing out the growth with Democrats. Though demoralized by the statewide losses last year, Democrats have more hope in Florida for 2020. Democratic voters in the state tend to show in greater force in presidential elections   although 2016 was an exception   and this year Democrats came closer than ever before in statewide midterm elections; three of the races for state office were so close they went to recounts. Democrats also picked up a net of two congressional seats, five state House seats and one state Senate seat. Population growth and demographic change has also roiled the existing political landscape in the West. In Arizona, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema notched the party s first Senate victory in three decades, and Democrats will actually control a narrow majority of the state s House seats   five out of nine   in the new Congress. And Democrats are already on a winning streak in Nevada, where changing demographics have propelled the party to victories that include three consecutive presidential elections, two straight Senate races, three out of four congressional seats and unified control of state government starting in 2019.In Texas, where Democrat Beto O Rourke came up short in his bid to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, the closeness of the race reflected both O Rourke s strong campaign, and the population growth in the state. In many of the state s most competitive House races   Democrats picked up two seats in Texas last month   excitement around O Rourke and Democrats, along with the population boom, led to roughly the same number of votes cast in the midterms as in the 2016 presidential election.
                    Congress
                    By RACHAEL BADE and JOHN BRESNAHANFlorida is currently the largest Electoral College prize seriously contested by the two parties, 29 electoral votes, trailing only California (55 electoral votes) and Texas (38 electoral votes). And while those Electoral College numbers are fixed through the 2020 election, Florida is poised to become even more influential in the next decade.According to a POLITICO analysis, Florida would pick up an additional House district if the end-of-decade reapportionment were conducted today, the new Census Bureau data suggest. But, if the current trends hold for the next two years, Florida could end up adding two seats instead of one, bringing it to 29 House districts beginning in 2022   and 31 electoral votes starting in 2024.The states that would gain House seats if reapportionment were held today are all in the South and West: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, Oregon and Texas, which would gain two seats. (Texas could end up with three more seats if it keeps growing rapidly over the next two years.) And the states that would lose seats   Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia   form an almost-contiguous band that stretches from the Northeast through the Midwest. Other states on the cusp of losing a House seat (and thus a vote in the Electoral College) in the next decade, if the current trends continue: California, Ohio and Alabama. If California loses a House seat   for the first time ever   it would signal the end to an era of almost meteoric growth, particularly in light of the continued, national migration to the Sun Belt.Shepard and Bland reported from Arlington, Va.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/19/2018 07:09 PM ESTOutgoing White House chief of staff John Kelly tried and failed to bring a military discipline to the West Wing. Mick Mulvaney doesn t plan to try.Mulvaney will approach the job far differently than Kelly, according to six sources close to the Trump aide and Republicans close to the White House. Most notably, he intends to give Trump more leeway to act as he chooses   a recognition that trying to control Trump is a futile approach. Story Continued BelowMulvaney will adopt a much larger role in politics and messaging, and plans to take a more laissez-faire approach to some quirks of the Trump White House that irked Kelly   like nonessential staffers attending meetings, or the president frequently reaching out to longtime friends, Republican lawmakers and advisers for advice or dinners in the White House residence.At one point, Mulvaney told an ally he thought Kelly did a disservice to the president by constantly saying  no.   I did not take that as a sign that Mick would never push back, but he definitely had a feeling that Kelly pushed back too often and did not help the president fulfill his agenda,  said the source close to Mulvaney.
                                The result could be an even more freewheeling White House.Already, Mulvaney has spent the past few days at the White House, shadowing Kelly as he goes about his day and meeting behind closed doors with top communications staff like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. And Mulvaney is expected to travel to Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort to be with the president for a few days over the holidays. My agenda is simple   utilize the same strategy that has brought success at the two other agencies I ve run for President Trump: quiet competence,  Mulvaney said in a statement to POLITICO.  All of my energies as Acting Chief of Staff will be spent to assist the President as he makes   and keeps   America great. To back him up when he begins in January, Mulvaney plans to bring with him to the White House four staffers from the Office of Management and Budget, which he s overseen for the past two years, including his well-liked chief of staff, Emma Doyle, and deputy chief of staff, Daniel Hanlon, according to an internal OMB email obtained by POLITICO. Doyle is expected to serve as deputy chief of staff, though no formal announcement has been made. Mulvaney s scheduler and body man will also accompany him to the West Wing. Emma helped Mick staff and run two agencies, and Dan has been with him for eight years. They re going to the West Wing to help translate Mick s style to the staff and vice versa, not to invade the place and start firing people,  said a source familiar with Mulvaney s plans. Initially, Kelly tried to rein in Trump s long-standing habits and make sure conversations, calls and appointments ran through him during his first few months in the White House, though Kelly insisted he wasn t trying to constrain the president. Eventually, Kelly backed down from trying to instill such military-style discipline in a White House that has largely resisted it.
                    White House 
                    By DAVID BROWN, GREGORY HELLMAN and BURGESS EVERETT My guess is that Mulvaney will be slightly more tolerant of people coming to meetings when they should not be there,  said one Republican close to the White House.  He is a less of a disciplinarian than Kelly. That applies, too, to members of Trump s family, including senior aides Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. The president s daughter and son-in-law frequently clashed with Kelly, who reportedly derided them as two New Yorkers  playing government.  One source close to Mulvaney stressed that he would likely not stand in the kids  way and viewed part of his new job as acting chief of staff as trying to help other aides accomplish what they d like to get done.A former administration official scoffed when asked about that approach:  Everyone gets along with the kids in the beginning. On messaging, aides expect Mulvaney to play a much more public role than Kelly. The retired four-star general shied away from media appearances and tended to wade into policy only on discrete matters like immigration or military affairs. But as a former House member, Mulvaney feels comfortable in front of the camera and interacting with reporters. He will likely appear more frequently on Sunday news programs and even show up at the White House press podium, as he did during the brief government shutdown last winter.

                    By KATY O DONNELL Mulvaney definitely has conservative credentials, but he also brings close knowledge of the Hill and its politics. He can also clearly communicate the administration s message to the public. That will all be important for Trump,  said Paul Winfree, former deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy and the director of budget policy at the White House, whose time in the administration overlapped with Mulvaney s.The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.Mulvaney entered the Trump orbit during the presidential transition, recommended for the slot at the OMB by House Speaker Paul Ryan; Trump s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus; and the conservative Heritage Foundation. The first time Mulvaney met Trump personally was in Trump Tower during the transition for a 15-minute interview, said another source close to Mulvaney. Trump did most of the talking at that session, and Mulvaney landed the job.Eliana Johnson contributed to this report. Missing out on the latest scoops?

Several senior Trump officials have publicly stressed that point, including national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and other senior Trump State Department officials who focus on Syria and Iran.Trump administration officials, joined by senior Republicans in Congress, were scrambling Wednesday to change the president s mind, insisting that removing U.S. troops from the Arab state could undermine his own  maximum pressure  campaign against the Islamist regime in Tehran, which the White House has accused of empowering anti-Israel militant forces in Syria.

Several Republican Iran hawks in Congress, however, spoke up in dismay at the news.Taking troops out of Syria will  be seen by Iran and other bad actors as a sign of American weakness in the efforts to contain Iranian expansion,  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a national security hawk and top Trump ally, said in a statement listing several reasons not to leave.  When the U.S. pulls out of Syria, we are basically turning the country over to the Russians and to Iran, and primarily to Iran,  warned Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), another foreign policy hawk. In a pair of Wednesday tweets, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu   who has repeatedly warned of creeping Iranian influence in Syria   was more sanguine. Netanyahu said that Trump had informed him of the decision on Monday, and that he and Pompeo  made it clear that they have other ways of expressing their influence in the area.  We will study [the decision s] timetable, how it will be implemented and ñ of course ñ its implications for us. In any case we will take care to maintain the security of Israel and to defend ourselves in this area,  the Israeli leader added.Pressed on why Trump was ignoring his advisers, a senior administration official told reporters Wednesday afternoon that Trump was merely fulfilling campaign promises about bringing troops home.  The issue here is that the president has made a decision. He gets to do that. That s his prerogative,  the official said. Since its start in 2011, the bloody conflict in Syria has expanded and drawn in outside players including the United States, Russia, Israel, Iran, Turkey and others, as the death toll has risen toward half a million people. The conditions today in Syria are different than 2011, or even during the 2016 presidential campaign.

                    By DAVID BROWN, GREGORY HELLMAN and BURGESS EVERETTThe U.S. officially has 2,000 forces there help local fighters battle the Islamic State, a small but strategic contingent that American officials and Trump-allied lawmakers paint as giving the U.S. at least some leverage in protecting its allies and pushing forward peace talks. It s been enough of an argument to convince Trump to keep some U.S. troops in Syria so far, despite his own conflicting impulses and mercurial nature. At times the president has wanted to completely withdraw troops from Syria. But he s also been willing to launch airstrikes against the Syrian regime of Bashar Assad over its use of chemical weapons, while insisting he wants to eliminate the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. But the U.S. troops have, if not intentionally then effectively, served another major purpose: counterweight to Iran and its influence operation in the country. Tehran has devoted significant military resources to shore up the Assad regime, giving Assad, who s also gotten a boost from Russia, an edge over rebels and other forces trying to end his brutal rule. Iran s presence has given the country s proxies   among them the anti-Israel Shiite militia Hezbollah   more room to maneuver, build bases and keep weapons. The cover offered to these groups has greatly aggravated Israel, a major U.S. ally that Trump has vowed to protect. The country has launched numerous airstrikes designed to curb Iranian and Iran-affiliated forces in Syria. The U.S. forces in Syria   even a relatively small number   are seen as a buffer of sorts to Israel as Iran slogs forward. Iran s moves in Syria also concern America s Arab allies, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who fear the growing power of the Shiite Muslim-led theocracy in Tehran. Trump has made countering Iran one of the biggest and clearest parts of his foreign policy. The Republican president has pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal   another step he took against the advice of several top aides. He has imposed a massive number of sanctions on Tehran and is pressuring other countries to stop importing Iranian oil. The Trump administration has demanded, among other things, that Iran withdraw all of the forces under its command from Syria, a demand Trump aides have repeatedly echoed. Just this Monday, U.S. Special Representative for Syrian Engagement James Jeffrey said of the Iranian presence in in Syria:  We see no reason to tolerate this. We see no reason for this to be there. ... Our position is that they need to go.  Three months earlier, Bolton suggested that the U.S. military presence in Syria could be indefinite because of Iran.  We re not going to leave as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias,  he is reported to have said in New York.

                    By BURGESS EVERETT, ELIANA JOHNSON and SARAH FERRISPompeo, meanwhile, has conditioned future U.S. assistance to Syria on the departure of Iran.  If Syria doesn t ensure the total withdrawal of Iranian-backed troops, it will not receive one single dollar from the United States for reconstruction,  he said in October. The secretary of state ignored reporters  questions about Syria during a brief public appearance Wednesday.These Trump aides and other supporters make clear that the U.S. has multiple interests in trying to bring peace to Syria. The fight against terrorist groups in the country is not yet over, despite Trump s claims. Remnants of the Islamic State are still fighting, and there are worries that the group will return as an insurgent force, even if it lacks control over any territory. Similarly, there are concerns about Russia s increased influence in the country if the U.S. withdraws completely, a concerning prospect given Russian President Vladimir Putin s revanchist aspirations. But given the president and his administration s fixation on the Iranian threat, Trump s willingness to consider a full withdrawal is especially startling. There is a growing sense among observers of the region that Tehran is more committed to Syria than Russia.  The Iran hawk wing of the U.S. government s foreign policy establishment ought to feel betrayed by this decision,  said Charles Lister, an analyst with the Middle East Institute. In his comments Wednesday, Rubio pointed to another concern should the U.S. leave:  America looks unreliable,  he said.  Our partners in the region now view at America as a nation that s looking to get out, not looking to stand by our commitments.  They will compare us to Vladimir Putin, who has stuck by Assad the whole time. They will compare us to Iran, who has stuck by Assad at all times. And they will compare the United States to that and say  America is unreliable.  Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    By BURGESS EVERETT and ELIANA JOHNSON12/19/2018 01:25 PM EST
                    Updated 12/19/2018 03:02 PM ESTJust hours before the Senate passed major reforms to the criminal justice system, Mike Lee and Tom Cotton were still bickering. At a private party lunch, the two young Republican senators argued one last time: The libertarian-leaning Lee defended a bill the hawkish Cotton had derided as a  jailbreak  for violent felons, while Cotton accused Lee of overseeing a sloppy process that included last-minute revisions to the bill, according to multiple sources familiar with the interaction.Story Continued Below  It got a little heated, on his part,  Lee said.Asked to respond, Cotton laughed and replied:  He thought that was heated? He needs to toughen up.  The dispute neatly encapsulated why Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was so reluctant to put the bill on the floor in the first place and publicly split his party. But even the skeptical GOP leader could not ultimately stop the bill: President Donald Trump supported it, and McConnell himself wound up voting for it. The legislation passed 87-12 on Tuesday night after a bipartisan coalition handily dispatched a trio of Cotton s amendments intended to kill the bill. The House is expected to pass the bill this week.The whopping vote margin in the Senate masked a yearslong struggle inside the Republican Party that dated back to the presidency of Barack Obama. It brought together a mix of veteran lawmakers in Congress and political neophytes in the White House, with a coalition that was set to crumble without action in the last days of the 115th Congress.A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Though less sweeping than the bipartisan efforts under Obama to rewrite prison and sentencing laws, Trump s expected signature serves as a cathartic coda for the effort s supporters   one that is being celebrated as a rare bipartisan victory in an era when the parties are bitterly divided against each other and the government is regularly on the brink of a shutdown. For months, criminal justice reform seemed to be on life support. As its prospects grew dimmer and dimmer, the outgoing Senate majority whip, John Cornyn, began taking arrows from the bill s supporters for refusing to lean on McConnell to put the bill on the floor. Cornyn was in a bind: He s a longtime advocate for overhauling federal prisons and sentencing programs, but he also is his party s chief vote-counter. Lee and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) insisted their legislation had overwhelming GOP backing, but Cornyn s whip cards showed the support level was simply not where McConnell wanted it.  Cornyn knew it would be counterproductive to make a public push for the sphinx-like McConnell to take up a bill that divided his party. So Cornyn kept trying to shift the bill to be ever-so-slightly more conservative while holding onto its Democratic support. He also kept his own endorsement of the effort to himself. Even Grassley wondered aloud what Cornyn was waiting for at such a critical moment.  I had a responsibility not to put the leader in the box by talking publicly about what I was doing, but working quietly behind the scenes trying to build support,  Cornyn said in an interview in his ornate Capitol Hill office.  He never was the bill s biggest fan. I think he still has reservations about it,  he said, adding that  it s important that we re able to trust each other. And it s important for us to be able to act confidentially.   Cornyn kept his powder dry on endorsing the bill until McConnell announced last week he would put it on the floor, after repeated public and private prodding from Trump. Lee was unenthusiastic when asked about Cornyn s role in securing the bill s passage, instead noting his personal whipping operation, a rare effort by a rank-and-file senator to keep his own competing tally with Republican leadership.  The suggestion the last few weeks that my whip count was exaggerated? I think this helps prove it was wrong. I was very, very careful in my whip count. I was very precise,  Lee said. 
                    Congress 
                    By BURGESS EVERETT, ELIANA JOHNSON and SARAH FERRIS In the end, though, it was a fragile coalition that pushed the bill across the finish line, many of its members feeling urgency due to their own political circumstances. Cornyn is term-limited from his job as whip, Grassley is leaving his Judiciary Committee post to lead the Finance Committee, and Democrats are about to take the House, where they could likely pull any bill to the left.Of the 30 bills his panel will have gotten signed into law by Trump this Congress, Grassley said,  This will be the most significant one.  Cotton and Lee, meanwhile, were the two GOP young bucks fighting over the merits of the bill in public, on the Senate floor and in the party lunches. But the old bulls battled too, albeit over strategy: Cornyn was pressing for a narrower, prison-only reform that he thought more politically feasible, while Grassley held out for sentencing reforms, part of an agreement he struck with Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in the beginning of the Trump administration. Critics like Cotton slammed many aspects of the prison reform legislation anyway. But Cornyn argued that pushing that proposal was the more pragmatic path.  I m an art-of-the-possible guy,  Cornyn said. By insisting on sentencing reform,  I felt like we were heading down a path where we weren t getting anything done.  But those focused on sentencing reform enjoyed something of a trump card: the president s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Kushner had harbored an interest in the topic for years, but he began getting serious about it last year. In October 2017, he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, both White House officials, invited Lee, Durbin and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) to dinner. Whitehouse and Cornyn had just introduced a prison reform bill that lacked the more sweeping changes sought by Grassley, Lee and Durbin. But Durbin and Lee told the couple that they weren t going to go for a prison-only reform bill: It needed to get rid of harsh mandatory minimum sentences for some nonviolent crimes. And, the bipartisan duo said, they needed Grassley.  We worked for a year so he could accept it and be the lead sponsor. It made all the difference,  Durbin said.  We had a good bill, but it was not destined to pass and become law without Grassley s leadership.   When Cornyn and Whitehouse introduced their prison-only bill in 2017, Grassley refused to give his support. Even when the House passed prison reforms in the spring, Grassley, Durbin and Lee stood firm: They wanted sentencing reforms in the bill. There s a  lot of injustice in the judicial system. And we have to have a fair judicial system. And I have to admit I was awakened to that because of the arguments that Lee and Durbin put forth over a long period of time,  Grassley said.  In the interim, Grassley began accruing major credibility on the right by helping to confirm lower-court judges and then playing a central role in confirming Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in October. On criminal justice reform, he had chips to cash in with McConnell.  Chuck Grassley can be very persuasive,  said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).  Chuck Grassley has been a very loyal, effective soldier.  Kushner was persuasive too, spending hours talking to the bill s supporters, from Cornyn to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), about building support for the effort. 
                    White House 
                    By SARAH FERRIS, BURGESS EVERETT and ELIANA JOHNSON Inside the White House, Kushner hosted numerous roundtables with supporters and opponents alike. He made emotional pleas to lawmakers, invoking the challenging conditions his father faced in federal prison, where he served 14 months after pleading guilty to a series of nonviolent offenses.  Jared has not been shy that this arose out of a personal experience. It s been helpful because people see that because it s a personal issue for him, it gives him a ton of credibility on the legislation, so it s something that he had not shied away from,  said a White House official. At several points, his White House colleagues dismissed him as naÔve, waving off the possibility that his efforts could turn into law. But it was Kushner who was key to enlisting the support of the law-and-order president, a feat he accomplished by bringing a parade of criminal justice reform supporters through the Oval Office, from celebrities like Kim Kardashian West and her husband, Kanye West, to Trump-supporting evangelicals who backed the bill.  Durbin, meanwhile, was tasked with keeping Democrats together even as the bill shifted away from them. The No. 2 Senate Democrat had spent untold time and energy working on the issue, and he was willing to be pragmatic to get it done even if his party s fortunes would improve with a Democratic House takeover.  This is something that Durbin, who s a real hero on this, has worked on for five years. He s built up a trust with our colleagues,  Booker said.  We re putting our reputations on the line endorsing this bill.  In the end, every Senate Democrat supported the bill. But for several weeks they mostly kept quiet as the the Republicans fought among themselves. None of the work by Kushner, Cornyn, Lee, Durbin or Booker would matter unless McConnell would put the bill on the floor. And the GOP leader kept telling Trump that he didn t have time to bring it to the floor, with a government funding deadline to meet and nominees to confirm. Before the election, McConnell had promised Cornyn, Grassley, Lee and other supporters that he would do so if he could be showed the bill could easily pass the Senate. That vow produced the competing whip counts between Cornyn and Lee, as each sought to deliver the majority leader an accurate picture of the vote count.  Even as advocates said support was growing, McConnell was unmoved and Trump generally kept quiet about the bill. Advocates for the bill said the president was playing a more subdued role on it than most other issues but was ready to put pressure on McConnell if he felt it was needed. On Dec. 7, Trump unleashed a tweet asking McConnell to make good on his word:  Go for it Mitch!,  the president urged the GOP leader. Three days later, McConnell indicated to Cornyn that the bill would come to the floor, the end of a yearslong saga to finish work on one of the few issues that seems to unite most in both parties these days.   He s a man of his word,  Cornyn said of McConnell. And every bit of pressure from Trump helped, too:  We all see his tweets. Missing out on the latest scoops?

U.S. officials began informing partners in northeastern Syria of their plans to begin an immediate pullout of American forces from the region where they have been trying to wrap up the campaign against Islamic State, the people said.   A pullout of Syria is still widely opposed by top officials in the White House and the Pentagon, and U.S. military officials have refused to say what a withdrawal will could look like.

Soon after, posts began appearing on WeChat, China s largest social network, that defended China and attacked Pence.    The Chinese government exercises strict control over content posted to WeChat and all other online platforms, and citizens know that running afoul of government censors can have serious consequences. But right now Beijing is happy to let people freely express their anger on WeChat   so long as it s directed at the current U.S. administration and Trump in particular.

                    By BURGESS EVERETT, ELIANA JOHNSON and SARAH FERRIS12/19/2018 10:12 AM EST
                    Updated 12/19/2018 11:09 PM ESTThe Senate passed a short-term spending bill on Wednesday night to avoid a partial government shutdown, kicking a fight with President Donald Trump over border wall funding until next year.The legislation was passed by voice vote and will keep the government open until Feb. 8, provided the House will pass it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate will remain in session on Thursday pending House action on the spending bill; on Wednesday evening conservatives in the House urged the rejection of the legislation because it shorts the border wall. Story Continued Below We have to see what the House does with what we just sent them,  McConnell said. Senators have been urged to stay in D.C. on Thursday by party leaders.But the House is expected to vote on the package Thursday   a full day ahead of the deadline   and there it will likely have broad support from both parties, according to multiple aides. With Trump softening his demands for $5 billion for the wall in the waning days of the GOP Congress, McConnell (R-Ky.) worked to avoid a political blunder four days before Christmas. Democrats and some Republicans had advocated for longer-term deals on all the government departments except for the Department of Homeland Security, but Trump s demands for $5 billion in border wall funding have made broad funding deals difficult. Instead the chamber decided to defer the fight until next year, when Democrats will take over the House.  It s good that our Republican colleagues in the Senate finally realized that they should not shut down the government over a wall that does not have enough support to pass the House or Senate,  said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Still the night was not without drama. Several Western senators held up the spending bill until late Wednesday evening trying to get a public lands bill passed, but Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) blocked passage of it over a dispute over his state s treatment under the measure. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said she had commitments to bring the bill up next year, but Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said he was  doggone upset  that Lee didn t allow the bill to pass on Wednesday as senators prepared to pack it in for the year. But eventually, the spending bill passed without any dissent by voice vote. The quick vote was evidence that few in the Senate wanted to fight about the border wall late into the holiday season with the president sending mixed messages about what he would sign and if he was still  proud  to shut the government down. It has been a week of about-faces for the White House that have induced whiplash on Capitol Hill. Though Trump declared he would absorb the blame if he didn t get the wall funding he has been demanding, it now appears he is willing to sign a short-term funding measure. Leaving lunch with Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the president would sign the bill if it remained clean.  He s not happy about having to do this, but he d be especially unhappy if there were other things people were asking for,  he said. Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to the president, told Fox News on Wednesday morning that the  president is not going to back down  from his fight for border security, but she declined to rule out Trump signing the stopgap spending bill.  We ll see what the Senate and the House present to the president,  she said. Though White House aides insist the president is not backing down, their public statements appear to be easing the way for him to keep the government open even if he doesn t get the money he wants for a border wall. Conway gave the latest indication of that on Wednesday.  The [continuing resolution] to keep the government going until Feb. 8 is what they re looking at now, but that does not change whatsoever two important facts. One, that this president believes his first and solemn duty is to keep us safe, and that includes enhanced border security,  she said.  And second, it does not change the fact that this border is so porous that all it s done is gotten worse since those Democrats voted for border security 12 years ago. So this president is not going to back down from that.  Her statement came after White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that the president had instructed his Cabinet secretaries to search for spare money within their agencies that could be repurposed for a border wall   a move that is unlikely to produce funds amounting to the $5 billion Trump is seeking. Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) rejected an offer from McConnell on Tuesday because it provided $1 billion more than they were willing to accept for border security, deeming it a  slush fund.  With effective veto power over any deal and no appetite to hand Trump a political win, Democrats have not budged in recent days in their demands that Homeland Security funding stay flat, and in their insistence that they will give no more than $1.3 billion for border fencing. Pelosi declared support for the short-term package on Wednesday, calling the failed talks a  missed opportunity.

It seems like political spite for the president may be winning out over sensible policy, even sensible policies that are more modest than border security allocations which many Democrats supported themselves, in the recent past,  McConnell said, needling Democrats for their  allergy to sensible immigration policies.  When the latest funding bill is approved, Congress will have delayed the border wall fight three times since September. The punt sets up yet another confrontation for early next year, when Pelosi is expected to take over the House majority as speaker and will start with yet another immediate funding deadline upon her. But there s no reason to expect Democrats to give in next year: In fact, without a GOP Congress there s almost no chance Trump will get more border funding, absent a broader deal on immigration. Pelosi will take the mantle in January with a fresh chance to unite her caucus around defying Trump. She and her lieutenants have repeatedly said they will try to jam Senate Republicans with funding bills stripped of new wall funding, pressuring McConnell to put them on the floor or risk a funding lapse on the GOP s terms. 
                    White House 
                    By BEN WHITERep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), who will become House majority leader in January, suggested the House would pass a bipartisan six-bill package early next year that also freezes funding for the Department of Homeland Security   yet another punt on a broader immigration fight.  We re not going to get Homeland done,  Hoyer told reporters Tuesday when asked about next year.  The wall s not going to be resolved.  This week s bill will not include any emergency disaster relief for communities ravaged by wildfires in California or struck by Hurricane Michael in Florida, according to multiple aides. Lawmakers from both California and Florida had been pushing hard for billions of dollars for disaster aid in a year-end spending deal, something that GOP spending leaders in both the House and Senate had vowed to deliver. Money was also expected to go to Indonesia, where an earthquake and tsunami killed more than 2,100 people this fall. The short-term funding bill will also postpone into the next Congress a monthslong fight over reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. The domestic violence law will be renewed until Feb. 8, without the dramatic overhaul that many House Democrats have sought. The National Flood Insurance Program   a debt-ridden program drained by a string of natural disasters in recent years   will also be extended through that date. Missing out on the latest scoops?

PROGRESS ON SPENDING A BAD SIGN FOR AV START: Congress and the White House yawed between deal and no deal on a government spending bill Tuesday, but but right now a deal looks promising by the Friday deadline.  If an agreement sends lawmakers home by the end of this week, it will be a likely death knell for the driverless car bill that Senate backers had hoped to squeeze in before the end of this Congress. There have been no signs that Democrats with objections to S. 1885 (115) were won over by a new offer sent up over the weekend, and opponents of the legislation seem content to let the clock run out.  It s not looking good at the moment,  Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) told our Tanya Snyder.  Harbor funding at issue: Also wrapped up in debate over the spending bills: harbor maintenance funds. Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) tried and failed to attach a provision to Senate Republicans  minibus Tuesday (which actually held them up from filing the package), but he told Tanya he s going to continue pressing the issue. The language would  loosen up  some of the $9 billion in harbor maintenance fees that Congress has failed to appropriate.  I ll keep trying to fight that battle,  Shelby said.  Fight goes on over Chinese rolling stock: One other contentious provision apparently still not settled is House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy s attempt to secure an exemption for BYD, a Chinese bus manufacturing company with a plant in his district, from language in the spending bills which prohibits FTA funds from being used to buy rolling stock from Chinese-state owned manufacturers. Several groups have urged lawmakers to fight off McCarthy s efforts. The latest was the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which wrote to members of Congress this week asking them to maintain the funding ban and  strongly oppose efforts to establish loopholes that benefit individual Chinese SOEs.

(MT can t help but wonder if hamburgers were on the menu.)  A NEW GIG FOR DENHAM? A month and a half ago, Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) was in the running to be the top Republican on the House Transportation Committee. Now, facing down the end of his tenure in Congress after losing in the midterms, he might get to stay in government after all: he s a candidate for Interior Secretary, his office confirmed Tuesday night. Pro Energy s Ben Lefebvre reported over the weekend that Denham is one of a handful of candidates, including several other congressional Republicans. LESS AND LESS QUIET: TSA Administrator David Pekoske said Tuesday that he d responded to criticism of the Quiet Skies monitoring program by making changes intended to ensure the agency was only collecting useful and relevant information, our Stephanie Beasley reports. Though, he added that the agency had no plans to eliminate the program, which has drawn criticism for tasking air marshals with monitoring U.S. citizens who have not committed any crimes nor appeared on any federal watchlists. TSA previously disputed media reports that Quiet Skies was a secret surveillance program, noting that it was established in 2010. However, Pekoske said that he d made changes to the program  probably three or four months ago,  which was shortly after news reports began to emerge.  Further clarification: TSA officials told The Boston Globe that some of the behaviors air marshals had stopped monitoring include whether the passenger was fidgeting in the airport or made trips to the bathroom in flight.  Any routine passenger behaviors on a plane that would be seen as a normal behavior we are no longer capturing,  David Kohl, director of the Federal Air Marshal Service, told the paper.  BUDGET TALKS: Pekoske also weighed in on the DHS funding battle that could thwart lawmakers  efforts to avoid a shutdown this Friday.  We re certainly hoping that there is no shutdown,  he said at a media event Tuesday. He added that he hoped Congress would fulfill TSA s fiscal 2019 budget request sooner than later. TSA has requested 200 new 3D computed tomography machines and  a couple hundred more  credential authentication technology machines, among other items, according to Pekoske.  We re looking to do a pretty significant technology refresh of all the major equipment at the checkpoint over the next several years,  he said. TSA is unlikely to get that additional tech funding under a short-term spending bill. SPEEDING UP SAFETY EXEMPTIONS: NHTSA finalized a rule Tuesday aimed at expediting petitions by car manufacturers for temporary exemptions from vehicle safety standards, your MT host reported. The most important change highlighted by the agency is that it will no longer wait until it determines that a petition is complete before it publishes summary notices for public comment. Two companies have pending petitions (being  evaluated for completeness ) and one of them is General Motors, which wants temporary exemptions from 16 safety standards for the autonomous vehicles it s developing.  V2X REQUEST: DOT is asking for public comments on the integration of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications technology into transportation. Specifically, the agency wants to know how current and future communications tech could be associated with the  connected vehicle environment.  The issues addressed in the request range from  the use of alternative and emerging communications technologies to support V2X, to the challenges associated with achieving interoperability while accommodating technological change.   VW S ACCOMPLICE: A German automotive engineering company will plead guilty to a felony charge in the United States for helping Volkswagen cheat federal emissions tests, Tanya reported Tuesday. IAV GmbH will pay a $35 million fine and serve two years of probation for its role in designing the defeat device software which reduced vehicles  emissions controls if it detected that the vehicle wasn t undergoing emissions testing. A hearing to approve the plea deal is set for Jan. 18.

QUICK FIX: USTR remains quiet on when it will launch trade talks with Japan and the European Union.   President Donald Trump s love of the stock market could force him to back down on tariffs on China.   Plus, the White House continues to sell the new North American trade pact as a way to pay for Trump s border wall.  USTR MUM ON JAPAN, EU DEAL LAUNCH: The public comments are in. The hearings are over. Now, all that s left for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to launch trade talks with the European Union and Japan is to lay out its negotiating objectives for the two trade deals. The 2015 Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities And Accountability Act requires USTR to publish its negotiating objectives at least 30 calendar days before beginning trade talks. If that happened this week, talks could begin in mid-January   as many expected when USTR gave Congress 90 days  notice of its intention to begin negotiations on Oct. 16. But with the Christmas holiday rapidly approaching, it s possible the objectives may not emerge until January, which would push the first round of talks into February at the earliest. USTR spokesman Jeffrey Emerson on Tuesday shed little light on the subject.  Will let you know as soon as we can,  he said in an email. Some trade observers speculated USTR might proceed first with Japan and publish its EU negotiating objectives at a later date. In both cases, U.S. farm groups are clamoring to be part of the negotiations. However, the terms that Trump struck for the talks seem to leave agriculture out of the negotiations with the EU, and shield Japan from having to make major new concessions to open its agricultural market.  IT S WEDNESDAY, DEC. 19! Welcome to Morning Trade, where one of your hosts is getting ready travel to Miami for the holidays. Any news or tips for navigating the airport madness? Let me know: srodriguez@politico.com or @sabrod123.  TRUMP THE  TARIFF MAN  FACES STOCK MARKET CATCH-22: Trump s continuing obsession with a soaring stock market could force him to cut a trade deal with China and rein in his commitment to tariffs. That outcome would be welcomed by free-traders inside and outside the White House hoping the current fight with China reaches a landing next year.  I think Trump the Dow Jones Man is ultimately going to eat Trump the Tariff Man,  said one former senior administration official intimately familiar with the president s stock market obsession, citing Trump s recent agreement to hold off on increased tariffs after a dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  What he agreed to after that dinner had basically been on the table for two years. He knew he had to give Wall Street something,  the former official added. POLITICO s Ben White has more.  WHITE HOUSE CONFIDENT USMCA WILL BRING IN BILLIONS: Trump appears to be unbowed in his determination that the renegotiated U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement will bring in a huge amount of revenue that he can use to pay for his long-promised border wall   a project estimated to cost at least $25 billion. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Tuesday that the White House believes the USMCA will bring in enough funding to  pay for the wall four times over.   A lack of specifics: Asked whether the White House had done the math, Huckabee Sanders said only that  we know will have additional revenue that comes in through the USMCA.   Twenty-five billion from the USMCA into the Treasury?  a reporter replied.  We think there will be more than that that comes in,  Huckabee Sanders said.  Fact-check: The White House did not respond to an emailed request to explain how exactly the new trade agreement, once passed, would bring in billions in new revenue. Free-trade agreements historically lead to a loss of revenue for national governments, because they waive tariffs that had previously been paid by importers. However, in the case of the USMCA, most tariffs have already been waived under NAFTA for the past 25 years, suggesting implementation of the new pact could have little impact on tariff revenues.  LAWMAKERS PRESS FOR ACTION ON STEEL, ALUMINUM TARIFFS: A bipartisan group of House members on Tuesday urged U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to strike a deal to lift steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as possible to end the retaliation those countries have imposed on billions of dollars of U.S. exports. Lighthizer has previously said he hopes to negotiate a deal to lift the duties, but his office did not respond Tuesday to a request for information on the status of that effort.  Up in Ottawa, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said she is optimistic the tariffs would be dismantled because they are a  contradiction  of a key USMCA provision requiring automakers to use a certain proportion of North American steel to qualify for duty reductions under the pact.  So I do feel the Canadian case, which has always been very strong, is only getting stronger,  Freeland said.  Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch and ranking member Ron Wyden once again urged the Commerce Department to make changes to its tariff exclusion process, arguing it is causing unnecessary delays and economic hardship for American companies and manufacturers. Megan has more on that here.  AFL-CIO CALLS FOR U.S.-EU LABOR SECRETARIAT: A proposed trade deal with the European Union should establish a bilateral  labor secretariat  to monitor the impact of the agreement on workers, wages, local communities and company investment decisions, Celeste Drake, trade policy specialist for the AFL-CIO, said Tuesday at an International Trade Commission hearing on the economic impact of eliminating tariffs on EU goods.  Without such a working group, the long-term impacts of the deal could only be evaluated by general measures such as  increased trade flows,  which don t reflect quality of life for ordinary families,  Drake said. She also called for a stripped-down trade agreement focused mainly on reducing tariffs and setting high bars for labor and environmental protections. Instead of trying to establish rules for regulating banks, food safety, pharmaceutical products and other areas where consumer and corporate views often clash, the agreement should create cooperative bilateral mechanisms   that include representation from unions and civil society groups   to address trade irritants and alleged non-tariff barriers, Drake said.  TILE AND GLASS PRODUCERS URGE LONG TARIFF PHASE-OUT IN EU DEAL: U.S. manufacturers are asking USTR to push for the longest possible phase-out of tariffs on tile and glass products from the European Union in talks on a trade deal.  Immediate or too rapid tariff elimination would seriously threaten the domestic industry s ability to adapt to new competitive conditions,  William Foley, CEO of Libbey Inc., the biggest U.S. glass manufacturer, said at the ITC hearing. Germany, France and Italy already account for about 17 percent of U.S. glass imports, while the entire EU accounts for more than 26 percent of U.S. glass imports, he added. Drake called for a phase-out of at least 20 years. Eric Astrachan, executive director of the Tile Council of North America, said his member companies were particularly concerned about increased competition from Italy and Spain if current duties of 8.5 percent and 10 percent, respectively, on ceramic tiles were immediately eliminated.  It is not an exaggeration to say that duty-free treatment for EU tile producers would be an existential threat  to U.S. producers and more than 500,000 employees, Astrachan said.  CHINA CHALLENGES U.S. TARIFFS AT WTO: China made its first request at a Tuesday meeting of the WTO s Dispute Settlement Body for a panel challenging U.S. tariffs, which Beijing said  further worsen the global economic and trade environment  and  damage global industrial supply chains.  China further warned that unrestrained unilateralism  would bring destruction to the world economy.  The U.S., in a statement, forcefully countered Beijing s points and blocked China s request, calling it a threat to the system that China was using the WTO s dispute settlement system as a shield for a trade-distorting policies not covered by WTO rules. The U.S. has filed a formal WTO dispute against China s technology licensing procedures but has argued that a range of other practices involving forced technology transfer, ownership restrictions and cybertheft aren t covered by international trade rules and are fair game for justifying tariffs on more than $250 billion worth of imports. The U.S. also called China s panel request hypocritical for calling the U.S. measures unilateral. Beijing unilaterally retaliated with its own tariffs on roughly $110 billion worth of U.S. imports in a way that could be considered inconsistent with WTO rules.  ICYMI: MEXICO HIKES MINIMUM WAGE: Mexican President AndrÈs Manuel LÛpez Obrador s administration will double the minimum wage along its northern border with the U.S. in 2019. The daily minimum wage in the border zone will rise to about $8.80 a day, from about $4.40 a day. The national minimum wage will also increase to $5.10   a 16.2 percent raise.

Republican lawmakers on Tuesday were closing in on a stopgap temporary funding plan to push the fight over border wall funding (and the risk of a government shutdown) into January or February.    Rising rates. Federal Reserve policymakers are expected to hike interest rates today.   A multiyear investigation by NPR and Frontline found  government regulators failed to act on evidence that coal miners were exposed to toxic dust that can lead to advanced black lung disease.    An association of CEOs urged DHS Tuesday to back off its plan to impose new procedures on H-1B visa applications.  GOOD MORNING!

SHUTDOWN AVERTED?: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that there will be no partial government shutdown on Friday, POLITICO s Sarah Ferris, Burgess Everett, and Eliana Johnson report.  The American people don t like it,   McConnell told reporters. Also, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders indicated the president might accept less than the $5 billion he s previously demanded. More here.  RISING RATES: When the Federal Reserve s Federal Open Market Committee meets today, it will likely raise interest rates, POLITICO s Victoria Guida reports.  With the job market still growing at a steady clip and wage gains finally starting to pick up, the Fed has been raising interest rates to keep prices from rising too rapidly and to wean the economy off cheap debt that could eventually start to threaten the stability of the financial system,  Guida explains. Average hourly earnings were up 3.1 percent over the previous year  in November, matching gains in the previous month, signaling that rising wages may continue as the labor market heads towards full employment. More from POLITICO here. REGULATORY FAILURE: Mine safety regulators failed for decades to recognize and address  clear signs of danger  to workers spelled out in government data, Howard Berkes, Huo Jingnan and Robert Benincasa report for NPR and PBS  Frontline. The news organizations  analysis of 30 years  collected data found that in 15 percent of dust samples coal  miners were exposed to excessive silica levels that violated federal health standards.   OSHA introduced during the Obama administration sweeping new regulations reducing silica exposure in the construction, maritime and general industry sectors. The rules survived industry court challenges and took effect in June. But because mining isn t regulated by OSHA and is instead overseen by the Mine Safety and Health Administration, miners don t fall under those protections. And a similar rulemaking at MSHA to limit silica exposure in metal and nonmetal mines, but not coal, has been shelved by the Trump administration.  Underground coal operators are required to collect an increased number of coal dust samples, use a continuous personal dust monitor to measure dust levels in real time, and notify miners more quickly about the results,  an MSHA spokesperson told Morning Shift in an emailed statement. Read the NPR/PBS report here. CEOS OPPOSE VISA OVERHAUL: Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs, urged DHS Tuesday to reconsider proposed changes to the H-1B visa process that, they say, will leave employers insufficient time to file petitions. The association urged the agency to resolve uncertainty in its proposal about when new electronic registration requirements will go into place, and to hold off implementing the rule in the meantime. The proposed rule ,published at the beginning of this month, would allow companies applying for the H-1B visa lottery to pre-register electronically with USCIS, and would change the selection process to favor beneficiaries with advanced U.S. degrees. Read more about the proposal here and read the comment letter here.  WORKPLACE DEATHS JUST SLIGHTLY DOWN: Data released yesterday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that fatalities in private mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction increased 26 percent in 2017 over the year prior. The total number of U.S. work-related fatalities, however, declined slightly, by 43 deaths. A 25 percent uptick in unintentional overdoses on the job prompted OSHA s Acting Assistant Secretary, Loren Sweatt, to reaffirm  the importance of this administration s efforts to tackle this crisis.  More about the data here; read Sweatt s statement here.  IMMIGRATION MIDTERM BUST: Matt Barreto, co-founder of the polling firm Latino Decisions, argues in a New York Times op-ed that based on his own research and that of others, Trump s tub-thumping on immigration didn t stir his base in 2018 the way it did in 2016.  The net gain that Republicans thought they could count on from whites disappeared,  Barreto writes, and 50 percent of voters now agree that the president and Republicans use such rhetoric  to divide Americans.  Nationwide data indicate  no evidence of a surge in white Republican votes for anti-immigrant candidates.  Read the op-ed here.  CHILD LABOR ENFORCEMENT: Two key labor lawmakers pressured DOL s Wage and Hour Division Tuesday to increase enforcement following a recent GAO report that found that the majority of child worker fatalities occurred in agriculture. Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.) questioned why, given that statistic, the agriculture sector was only the fifth-most cited by the agency, and requested in a letter to Acting WHD Administrator Bryan Jarrett that Wage and Hour provide a  comprehensive  enforcement strategy. Read the letter here and the GAO report here.  SECRETARIES TO SWITZERLAND: Maybe DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will get to keep her job another month. President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that the once-beleaguered secretary will travel in the presidential delegation to the World Economic Forum Davos-Klosters, Switzerland from Jan. 22 to Jan. 25.

THE INTERIOR NAME GAME: Republicans are eagerly awaiting President Donald Trump s decision on who will replace Ryan Zinke at the helm of the Interior Department   a decision he s said he would announce this week   but there s no consensus on who they think it should be. A Republican close to the administration told POLITICO it was Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt s job if he wanted it, but added the likely acting secretary and ex-lobbyist isn t keen on stepping into the limelight and would prefer to run the show from behind the scenes. If not Bernhardt, the source named outgoing Sen. Dean Heller and Rep. Rob Bishop as potential replacements. Other names that ve come up: Idaho Gov. Butch Otter, who s third term comes to an end at the beginning of January, and Rep. Jeff Denham, who POLITICO also reported this weekend. A spokesperson confirmed to ABC10 that the administration approached Denham about the role. ME reported earlier this week that Republicans on the Hill were offering kind words for Heller, who they see as easily confirmable. But greens are already digging into his past statements: The Center for Western Priorities, tweeted a 2014 comment from Heller to the Reno Gazette-Journal editorial board, where he said:  If I had it my way there would be no federal lands in the state of Nevada.  Meanwhile Sen. John Barrasso, who had a conversation with Trump on Sunday, is pressing for a Westerner to get the job   not really a controversial stance given the vast amount of federal land in the West that Interior controls.  I certainly want somebody from the West with a major understanding of the issue of public lands,  Barrasso said, though he didn t have any idea about the timing of a decision.    AND ALTHOUGH ZINKE IS ON HIS WAY OUT, one of the outgoing secretary s final moves could be to help the Trump administration shore up its plan to open up the Atlantic Coast and potentially a portion of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico to offshore oil and gas exploration, Pro s Zack Colman reports. Industry sources with knowledge of the discussions tell Zack the administration is putting the finishing touches on the plan, though one remaining point of deliberation is how much, if any, of the Eastern Gulf should be opened to drilling after the existing moratorium expires in 2022. Zinke met with the president on Monday in the Oval Office to go over the details of the five-year offshore leasing plan, which is expected to be announced in January.  WELCOME TO WEDNESDAY!

Wheeler and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue met with farmers about a new Trump administration proposal to redefine  waters of the United States.  (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)MANCHIN VS. MANCHIN: When Sen. Joe Manchin returns next session as top Democrat on the Energy Committee, his reputation for finding himself in the thick of things will only increase, POLITICO s Burgess Everett and Anthony Adragna report. As ranking member, Manchin has a prime opportunity to shape big-ticket legislation, particularly if his party takes back the majority in 2020 and makes him chairman. He will have to decide if he ll take a conservative Democratic approach or embrace his party s left wing.  Sen. Manchin, by his very nature, wants to be in the middle of where the action is,  said GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito.  He s going to continue to do that very aggressively whether it s through the committee, whether it s through the president. I think he s agnostic: However he can get into the middle of things, he s going to be in the mix.  Read the story.  SHUTDOWN AVERTED? Lawmakers seem to be coalescing around a short-term stopgap spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown Friday that would keep the government funded into January or February, Pro s Caitlin Emma reports. The measure includes money for Interior and EPA.  Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby said it s unclear if Trump would sign a short-term funding measure, but added,  I think the White House is more amenable to working something out than a lot of people thought they would.  (More on how the GOP got Trump to back off a shutdown threat here.)  YUCCA DUMPED: Sen. Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the panel on energy and water appropriations, doubted Tuesday that funding talks would include new funds for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste project, Pro s Darius Dixon reports.  HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL: The top Senate Energy Republican and Democrat both expressed optimism Tuesday they d complete a public lands package   assuming some sort of vehicle comes along to help move it. Sen. Maria Cantwell, after expressing some reservations last week, called the package  more or less  complete, while Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she believed there was a desire to get it done. But with Congress now leaning toward a CR, it s unclear if there s a path for it.  LET S MAKE A (NOMINEE) DEAL: Murkowski and Barrasso expect a flurry of executive confirmations before Congress ultimately leaves town for the year.  There s a whole bunch of nominees, not just in our accounts, but others I think the leader would like to get wrapped up,  Murkowski told reporters. Barrasso said to expect EPA chemicals office nominee Alexandra Dapolito Dunn s inclusion in that package since no objections to her selection have been raised.  GREENS CALL FOR McNAMEE RECUSAL: Four environmental groups   the Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, Natural Resources Defense Council and EarthJustice   are officially pressing for newly installed FERC Commissioner Bernard McNamee to recuse himself from two matters that deal with supporting coal and nuclear power plants and defining grid resilience. The motion filed with FERC by lawyers representing the groups argues McNamee s prior work at the Energy Department precludes him from participating as a  decisionmaker on the same case in which he previously participated on behalf of a separate entity,  Darius reports.  QUOTES GREEN GROUPS WON T LIKE: He may have written an op-ed calling for action to address climate change, but Barrasso still isn t embracing the scientific consensus that human activity is driving the problem.  Certainly human activity is contributory but I can t tell you what percentage. No one can,  he told ME.  We need to do all we can in a way to make sure energy is produced as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without doing it in ways that raise costs.  And Barrasso, whose Republican Policy Committee released a report bashing the Green New Deal last week, called it unrealistic.  It s impossible for them to accomplish what they want,  he said.  There is a huge gap between the energy the country uses and what can be produced right now with renewable sources alone.   GRIJALVA CLEARED: Rep. Ra˙l Grijalva, the incoming chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, was quietly cleared last week by the Ethics Committee of misusing funds by entering into a settlement with a former aide, who accused him of creating a hostile workplace related to alcohol use, Anthony reports. According to a letter obtained by POLITICO, the committee  unanimously voted to dismiss the allegation.  THE END OF  END USE : DOE s Office of Fossil Energy is set to publish a policy statement in the Federal Register today that would stop the practice of reporting  end use  for exports of domestically produced natural gas, including liquefied natural gas, under the Natural Gas Act. As a result, DOE will revert to requiring authorization holders to report the country to which the gas  was actually delivered  rather than where it ends up.  STATES MERGE FOR TRANSPO EMISSIONS PROPOSAL: Nine states and the District of Columbia announced on Tuesday their intent to create a regional market-based proposal to shrink greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. While the finer details are scarce, the low-carbon proposal would cap and reduce carbon emissions from the combustion of transportation fuels, likely through a  cap-and-invest  program. Proceeds from the program would be invested into more resilient transportation infrastructure, according to a statement from the participating states.  Ken Kimmell, president of the Union for Concerned Scientists, called it  one of the biggest steps that Northeast and mid-Atlantic states have taken to tackle climate change.  But it s also notable which states did not sign on, including New York, which is a participating member of the Transportation and Climate Initiative but was not included among TCI members who endorsed the plan. The announcement comes one day after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo set a goal for a carbon-neutral electric system by 2040.  JIM ROGERS, ENERGY LEADER: Jim Rogers, one of the utility industry s most influential leaders, died Monday at the age of 71. Rogers, who was Duke Energy s chairman and CEO until 2013, was perhaps the first major utility executive to publicly say climate change was a problem that the energy industry would need to address, even as he headed a company that owned a large fleet of coal plants.  A onetime journalist, FERC staffer and Enron Pipeline Group executive, Rogers was as the forefront of the utility sector consolidation, even with his last deal that merged Duke and Progress Energy   and the controversial CEO shuffle that ensued. In 2015, he published the book  Lighting the World,  calling for a strategy to bring clean-energy sources to spread electrification to the world s poor.  He was not afraid to tackle the hard questions with a personable style that brought people together for positive solutions,  Lynn Good, Duke s chairwoman, president and CEO, said in a statement.

WILKIE ON DECK: VA Secretary Robert Wilkie and the department he leads are about to get more scrutiny from Congress:   MISSION Act implementation hearing: The Senate and House veterans  affairs committees are holding a joint hearing this afternoon on the implementation last year of the bipartisan MISSION Act, which was aimed at expanding and consolidating private sector care for veterans. The hearing comes on the heels of a ProPublica/PolitiFact report stating that Veterans Choice, the MISSION Act s predecessor, has done a poor job providing care to veterans while enriching the companies that administer it. The program was reported to have overhead costs of 21 percent compared to 13 percent for Medicare Advantage and 8 percent for the DoD s Tricare program. MISSION is supposed to streamline the VA s community care programs and potentially close inefficient VA hospitals and clinics. The VA s Cerner EHR implementation is part of the story, since one of its key objectives is a fully interoperable system that allows veteran care to transfer easily among VA, DoD and community providers. Wilkie himself, along with other senior department officials, will be testifying.   Scheduling software, Cerner v. Epic: The VA seems intent on using Cerner s scheduling software despite money and time sunk into an Epic program that has shown promise in a pilot in the Columbus, Ohio, VA hospital, according to Jim Banks, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs subcommittee on technology modernization. If that s the case, he said in a letter released Friday to Acting Deputy Secretary James Byrne, the VA needs to explain to Congress how the new scheduling system will mark an improvement over VistA s platform, and how its results will be measured. He also asked the VA to answer a series of other questions including details on the stand-alone cost of the Cerner scheduling package. The Epic module should be maintained in the short run, Banks said, because of its performance:  by all accounts it is functioning well.  Community health systems in Columbus have joined the VA s Open API pledge, so linking their schedules could be a good test of interoperability, Banks writes. Details in the letter.   Senators call for OIG investigation: Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Brian Schatz, meanwhile, want multiple sets of investigative eyes on the VA. The Senators, who previously called for (and received) a Government Accountability Office investigation into the so-called Mar-a-Lago crowd s influence at the department, are sending a letter today to the department s Office of Inspector General requesting a similar investigation.  We believe the VA Inspector General must conduct its own parallel investigation because it has intimate knowledge of the VA, and access to documents, personnel, and other sources of agency information that may not otherwise be available to GAO,  they write. It s all part of intensified legislative interest in the department. Outgoing Rep. Tim Walz, the ranking member of the House Veterans  Affairs Committee, has pressed the department on the same subject last week. He sent a letter to Wilkie asking for more documents, with the intention of setting up his colleagues for more investigations in 2019.  eHealth tweet of the day: Paul Kedrosky @pkedrosky  Briefly messed around with the much-touted K Health  artificial intelligence  medical diagnosis app. Fed it the textbook symptoms of Ebola, and it suggested I had upset an stomach that will clear up in a week or so.

DATA-SHARING DEEP AT HOSPITALS: About 7 in 10 hospitals participated in at least one nationwide health information exchange in 2017, and about the same percentage continued to use faxes and mail, according to an ONC report Tuesday. Two-thirds of respondents say they  often  or  sometimes  send data via mail or fax.  FDA APPROVAL FOR INCONTINENCE APPS AND IMPLANTS: Medtronic has secured approval for a device and app that can control implants for overactive bladder, fecal incontinence and similar conditions. Medtronic s InterStim system relies on an app, accessible on a Samsung touch screen device, that patients use to control Medtronic s implantable devices. Doctors can also log into the platform to see patients  stats. FDA has approved the combined therapy system: the Samsung mobile device, the app, and the implantable device.   PDMP UPDATE: A couple noteworthy updates from prescription drug monitoring programs nationwide:   Michigan: Law enforcement in Michigan would like easier access to the state s PDMP, testifying in favor of legislation currently in the state s Senate in its lame duck lesson, the Lansing State Journal reported earlier this week. It s the second time lawmakers have considered encouraging greater access for law enforcement in the past couple weeks; a state audit from Oregon earlier made a similar suggestion. The idea is a controversial one; civil liberties and provider groups have criticized the idea, arguing that the matter is best addressed by the medical system first. We wrote about it this summer.    Minnesota: Minnesota is enabling EHR integration of PDMP data, EHR Intelligence reported. A lack of such integration is a common pain point for doctors having to log into a separate program to access the relevant data. NEW PAPER EXAMINES ACO MANAGEMENT PARTNERS: A new paper in the Milbank Quarterly takes a look at the burgeoning industry of management companies for accountable care organizations, citing firms like Aledade and Evolent Health in a wide-ranging examination of what the companies do and why providers choose to affiliate with them. The authors focused on two Medicaid ACOs, finding that tensions typically emerged over power and financial issues. Technological prowess varied ñ with one partner delivering the goods, and the other exaggerating its capacities   but the authors focus more on age-old issues of status and money as the key driver for success (or failure) of the better-care, lower-cost organizations.

IN THE HOPPER: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was hopeful that President Donald Trump would agree to stave off a partial shutdown Friday night, when funding for a quarter of the government expires. But how Hill leaders and the White House will get past the spending deadline needs to be resolved, though a short-term spending bill looks like it could be the play.    The Congressional Black Caucus is championing several farm bill wins, particularly new scholarships at historically black land-grant schools.    See you next month? The White House wants to schedule the next round of trade meetings with China for January. We ve got more on that, plus two sharp takes on the interest rate increase the Federal Reserve is expected to finalize today.  SEEKING A SHUTDOWN ESCAPE ROUTE: With three days left until funding runs out for the Agriculture Department, FDA and many other agencies, the top Senate Republican sounded confident Tuesday that Trump would back away from his shutdown threats and sign off on a short-term stopgap plan. McConnell credited the White House for being  flexible  about Trump s demand for U.S.-Mexico border wall funds, and declared that a shutdown could be avoided ahead of the holidays, our POLITICO colleagues report.  The likeliest off-ramp appears to be a short-term spending bill that would avert a shutdown and punt the Friday spending deadline into January or February, Pro Budget s Caitlin Emma reports. That strategy is something Democrats  would very seriously consider,  said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Stay tuned for more developments today.  More market-moving news possible today? The Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates today, but what it will do next year is a mystery to Wall Street, reports Pro Financial Services  Victoria Guida. Between Trump s trade war and a potentially weakening economy   not to mention Trump s barrage of tweets aimed at Fed Chairman Jerome Powell   the central bank s plan for raising rates in 2019 is anyone s guess. A pause in rate hikes, which can weigh on farm profitability and the value of large farm assets, could provide a bit of temporary relief for some ag producers.  Trump, tariffs and the Dow: Free-traders inside and outside the White House are hoping that Trump s love for new highs on Wall Street will temper his commitment to trade battles and help bring the current fight with China to a soft landing next year. POLITICO Chief Economic Correspondent Ben White explores that here.  HAPPY WEDNESDAY, DEC. 19! Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host wants to know how many MA readers are asking for an air fryer for Christmas? I m unconvinced it ll rival the Instant Pot. Send news and tips to lcrampton@politico.com and @liz_crampton. Follow the whole team @Morning_Ag.  CBC TOUTS FARM BILL WINS: The Congressional Black Caucus outlined nine provisions its members helped secure in the final farm bill, H.R. 2 (115), many of which are focused on investments in the country s 19 historically black land-grant universities. The legislation, which the president is expected to sign Thursday, includes $80 million a year in mandatory and discretionary spending for new scholarships at those universities. The bill also would strip a decades-old provision that limits those institutions to carrying over only 20 percent of federal funding not used during the calendar year. That stipulation doesn t apply to predominantly white land-grant universities, CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond (D-La.) said in a call with reporters. He was joined by Reps. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) and Alma Adams (D-N.C.), both on the Agriculture Committee, and Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas).  What we were able to accomplish in this year s farm bill is the latest example of what the CBC does,  Richmond said.  We use the legislative process to right historical wrongs.   Farm inheritance: The farm bill also provides owners of heirs  property   or inherited land that lacks a clear title   access to the credentials needed to participate in USDA programs like loans, grants and other supports, the CBC said. It s estimated that between 40 percent and 60 percent of land owned by black farmers was passed down without a will or transfer of title.  The legislation also allocates funding to nonprofit organizations that provide legal assistance to families trying to resolve title issues, with priority given to disadvantaged farmers and ranchers.  Socially disadvantaged farmers: Fudge also highlighted how the bill would direct GAO to study loans given to socially disadvantaged farmers through both the Farm Credit System, which oversees a network of agricultural banks, and other commercial lenders. The research will seek to determine where improvements can be made. Grants to organizations that work with farmers of color and veterans also would be boosted. WHITE HOUSE EXPECTS JANUARY CHINA TRADE MEETING: The Trump administration aims to schedule face-to-face trade discussions with Chinese officials in January, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Bloomberg on Tuesday, Pro Trade s Megan Cassella reports. Details are TBD but the White House is determined to use the 90-day negotiating window  wisely, to try to resolve this,  Mnuchin said. He said the two sides have had several phone conversations since Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed Dec. 1 to a temporary truce in the trade war, allowing time for a broader deal to take shape. Mnuchin told Bloomberg that any deal the White House accepts would be  enforceable and verifiable and have specific dates on it.   Trump bound for Davos: The president plans to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, at the end of next month, Pro Trade s Doug Palmer reports. In light of the planned January talks with China, keep in mind that Xi skipped the forum last year, and it s not clear if he will attend next month. If he does, it could create an opportunity for another important juncture as the two sides try to resolve the tariff fight.  Sugar sour on U.S.-EU trade talks: Formal trade talks between the U.S. and the EU are expected to kick off early next year, and U.S. sugar producers want no part of it. A trade adviser for the American Sugar Alliance told the U.S. International Trade Commission on Tuesday that sugar producers want to be left out of a proposed trade agreement over fears that increased imports would hurt American growers, Doug reports.   A look at Trump 2020 machine: Trump s reelection operation will make the unique move of combining RNC efforts with those of the campaign   both entities will merge their field and fundraising programs to form a joint enterprise called Trump Victory, POLITICO s Alex Isenstadt reports.    Animal antibiotics on the decline: Antimicrobial drug sales for food-producing animals dipped significantly last year, according to an annual report FDA released Tuesday. Total domestic sales and distribution for all antimicrobial drugs was about 10.9 million kilograms in 2017   down 22 percent from nearly 14 million kilograms in 2016.    Report finds minimal pesticide residue: Nearly all of the food samples tested by USDA had pesticide residues below safety standards set by EPA, per a report published this week. Just over half of samples had no detectable amounts of pesticides. Fresh and processed fruits and vegetables accounted for most of the products tested.    BP settlement rebuilding oyster reefs: Money from the BP oil spill settlement is being used for projects to restore oyster reefs destroyed by overharvesting, oil spills, drought and a lack of freshwater. Scientists estimate 80 percent of the Gulf s oysters have been lost in recent decades. NPR has more.    Regulatory hurdle for Impossible Burger: FDA will need to sign off on a key ingredient Impossible Foods uses to make its plant-based burger before an uncooked version can be sold directly to consumers, Bloomberg reports.  The additive  soy leghemoglobin, which is used for meat-like flavor, taste and texture, will need pre-market approval.    China gets tough on illegal hog slaughter: China will begin cracking down on illegal hog slaughter and build more large-scale slaughterhouses, as the country struggles to contain outbreaks of African Swine Fever, Reuters reports.    Opioids in rural America: Here s part two of DTN Progressive Farmer s series on opioid abuse in rural and agricultural regions of the country.    Movers and shakers: Ruthann Geib, the American Sugarbeet Growers Association s longtime VP of government affairs, will retire at the end of the year. The group promoted Scott Herndon to vice president (he ll also retain his general counsel role), and hired Zack Clark, formerly of the National Farmers Union, as director of government relations.

The Senate majority leader emerged from a lengthy party lunch after a flurry of mixed signals from the White House to declare there will be no partial shutdown on Friday evening, when a quarter of government funding expires. The GOP majority may have to settle for a short-term delay, but McConnell said the White House is now  flexible.  on border wall funding, just one week after Trump said he d be  proud  to shut down the government in a fight over border security,   White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who has indicated a thaw the administration s shutdown stance, hasn t said where additional money would come from to reach Trump s full $5 billion demand for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, but administration officials have hinted it could come from the military s budget.  She has, though, cited  options  for the funding, adds Reuters.  And the president has suggested as much in a tweet, writing,  If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall. They know how important it is!   Remember, however, if there is an impasse and a shutdown, it would be only a partial one. The Departments of Defense and VA, as well as much of the rest of the federal government, are fully funded through the end of this fiscal year on Sept. 30. MCSALLY TAPPED FOR ARIZONA SENATE SEAT:  Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has appointed GOP Rep. Martha McSally to the Senate seat being vacated by GOP Sen.

McSally, who lost a race for Arizona s other Senate seat to Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in 2018, will be competing to serve out the rest of the term won by the late Sen. John McCain, who passed away earlier this year.

PENCE HEADS TO PENTAGON FOR SPACE AND CYBER BRIEF: Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to visit the Pentagon this morning to receive a briefing on space operations and cyber defense. Afterwards, he s set to greet Defense Department employees. TRUMP RE-ESTABLISHES U.S. SPACE COMMAND:  President Donald Trump on Tuesday ordered the Pentagon to establish a new U.S. Space Command as another step toward his goal of establishing a separate military Space Force,  reports our colleague Jacqueline Klimas.  Vice President Mike Pence said the new command, like other major warfighting headquarters, will include troops from all the branches of the military. It will be tasked with confronting the growing threats to American space assets from Russia and China, he announced at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where the command is set to be based.   Meanwhile, the Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) program is still running behind, but the Pentagon s top acquisition official sees  dramatic  improvement, writes Defense News. FLYNN SENTENCING DELAYED:  YOU SOLD YOUR COUNTRY OUT :  Michael Flynn s sentencing for lying to the FBI was postponed on Tuesday after a federal judge suggested all sides wait until President Donald Trump s former national security adviser was finished cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller s probe,  report POLITICO s Darren Samuelsohn and Matthew Choi.  The surprise outcome came after an unexpectedly contentious hearing, in which U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan repeatedly admonished Flynn, telling him,  Arguably, you sold your country out,  drawing gasps and head shakes from members of Flynn s family sitting in the courtroom.  U.S. AND TALIBAN TALK PEACE   AFGHANISTAN SIDELINED:  While U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad held talks with a high-level Taliban delegation in one hotel in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday, representatives of the Afghan government stewed in another, waiting for a summons to hold indirect talks with the Taliban officials,  reports The Wall Street Journal.  By late evening, the government officials were still waiting, said a person attending the latest round of discussions aimed at paving the way for a negotiated settlement of the 17-year Afghan war.   Yet, 9/11 hangs over the Taliban talks and assurances the militant group has changed, writes NBC News.  FRAGILE YEMEN CEASEFIRE TAKES HOLD:  Heavy fighting between Yemen s government and Houthi rebels subsided Tuesday, suggesting the two sides are adhering to a deal struck as part of a U.S.-backed diplomatic push to end the nearly four-year war,  writes the WSJ.  Children as young as 10 fight, kill and die in Yemen s war, adds The Associated Press. PUTIN: RUSSIA HAS ENOUGH MISSILES WITHOUT VIOLATING TREATY:  President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday rejected the U.S. claim that Russia developed a new cruise missile in violation of a key nuclear treaty, arguing that Russia has no need for such a land-based weapon because it already has similar missiles on its ships and aircraft,  via the AP.  But Putin also said Russia can easily make intermediate-range missiles if the U.S. quits the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, via Reuters.  Furthermore, there s nothing to stop Russia and the U.S. from holding talks with other countries about joining the treaty, Putin added, also via Reuters. TRUMP URGES KOSOVO TO SEIZE THE CHANCE FOR PEACE WITH SERBIA:  U.S. President Donald Trump urged his Kosovan counterpart Hashim ThaÁi to seize the chance to seal a permanent peace deal with Serbia,  via POLITICO s Andrew Gray.  In a surprise intervention in faltering talks between the Balkan states, Trump held out the prospect in a letter of a White House meeting with ThaÁi and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic if they reach a deal. Vucic received a similar letter from Trump, his media adviser said.   Britain eyes a more lethal force in its newly revealed defense modernization review, writes Defense News.  And hacked EU cables reveal a world of anxiety about Trump, Russia and Iran, adds The New York Times. U.S. ENVOY VISITS SOUTH KOREA AMID STALLED TALKS:  U.S. officials will try to expedite humanitarian aid to North Korea, a U.S. envoy said on Wednesday, as Washington and Pyongyang struggle to find a breakthrough in stalled talks aimed at ending the North s nuclear program,  reports Reuters.  Additionally, the U.S. will review sanctions and the travel ban on U.S. citizens to ensure aid reaches North Korea, the U.S. envoy said, also via Reuters. U.S.CLEARS POSSIBLE SALE OF PATRIOT MISSILES TO TURKEY:  The U.S. has approved the possible sale of Patriot missiles to Turkey for $3.5 billion, the State Department announced [Tuesday] in a move that could break the standoff over Ankara s planned purchase of a Russian missile system,  reports our colleague David Brown.  The State Department, by notifying Congress that it had approved the sale of the Patriots, is making a counteroffer that could break the impasse.   We ve put an offer on the table. It s now for Turkey to decide,  a State Department official said.   START OF LIGHT-ATTACK COMPETITION DELAYED:  If the Air Force moves forward on a proposed initiative to buy light attack planes, it won t happen by the end of 2018,  writes Defense News.  The service intended to put out a final request for proposals this month for a potential light attack aircraft program, but the date has now slipped into 2019, an Air Force official confirmed Tuesday.

Story Continued Below DEFINE  REAL : President Donald Trump s push for a further middle-class tax cut was born about two weeks before this year s midterms   and, as it turns out, then put out to final pasture about six weeks after Election Day. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Bloomberg in an interview that the administration s main tax focus right now is fixing glitches and mistakes from last year s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115).  I m not going to comment on whether it is a real thing or not a real thing,  Mnuchin said in a roundtable interview Tuesday at Bloomberg s Washington office.  I m saying for the moment we have other things we re focused on.   About that focus: Mnuchin said he was already working with Congress on some of those fixes, including the so-called  retail glitch,  a drafting error that forces retailers and restaurants to write off renovations over as much as 39 years. Republicans had intended to allow those restorations to be written off immediately, but recent history suggests that the GOP will have to pay up to Democrats for any TCJA fixes. Democrats won an expanded low-income housing tax credit to correct the so-called grain glitch earlier this year, and that was when they were in the minority in both the House and the Senate. With Democrats set to take back control of the House in about two weeks, there also have to be questions about just how quickly any tax law fixes can move.  THE DAY IN TAX: The House Rules Committee will take up Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady s third version of a year-end tax bill this afternoon, setting up a potential vote on Thursday   though that could be the end of the road for the measure, given the decidedly lukewarm interest in the Senate. Brady proposed reviving a couple of tax incentives in H.R. 88 (115), but about two dozen other  extenders  are waiting in the wings. Our DataPoint team has a look at them. View the graphic here.

MORE TCJA: On this day last year, the House voted for what turned out to be the first of two times to approve the final version of the tax law. (Remember how the House had to pass the final version twice, because of Byrd Rule issues?) A year later, Bloomberg Tax has a nice rundown of all the regulatory work that could be coming in the next few weeks. (FDII, repatriation, full expensing and much, much more.) Bloomberg Tax s Lydia O Neal also takes a look at one particular set of rules that isn t sitting well in certain pockets of industry   the guidance for the tax law s limits on deducting business interest, with which debt-financed manufacturers in particular aren t pleased.  Odds and ends: House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) released his six-part documentary series on passing the tax law. Meanwhile, The Washington Post s Robert Costa and Mike DeBonis examined how Ryan is getting mixed reviews even from among his allies on his way out.  SHUT THE FRONT DOOR: The Donald J. Trump Foundation will cease operations under an agreement struck with Barbara Underwood, New York s attorney general, who had filed suit against the charity in June. Underwood s suit alleged that the charity had given illegal assistance to Trump s 2016 campaign and  was little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits.  The agreement, under which the Trump Foundation will have to file a list of recommended charities to receive its remaining funds, is a   significant victory  for Underwood s office, our Laura Nahmias notes. The attorney general s lawsuit against the Trump Foundation will continue. A TAXING BREXIT: Not that the U.K. doesn t already have a lot to worry about as it tries to leave the European Union, but an advocate for banks says financial institutions could flee in large numbers if Brexit doesn t reduce their tax burden. Part of the issue is that London banks have long since been planning to shift some operations and staff because Brexit will make it harder to do business on the continent. Still, a PwC analysis for UK Finance found banks in London faced effective tax rates a touch above 50 percent, far higher than in Frankfurt, New York, Shanghai and Dubai. GOING BIG PICTURE: States combined to collect more than $1 trillion in revenue in fiscal 2018, according to a new report from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center   the first time that threshold has been crossed, and an increase of close to 8 percent over 2017. And yet, TPC also found some real reasons for concern within that recent spike: The growth was uneven among states, for instance   but more importantly, it also doesn t seem sustainable, having  resulted from the timing of tax payments in response to the debate and eventual congressional approval of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  The Tax Foundation has its own look at state tax trends out this morning, noting that all but five states have accounted for the TCJA in their tax systems and that states aren t slowing down in their search for new revenues streams   such as gambling, online sales or legalized marijuana.  While most states now conform, at least in part, to the new federal tax law, many important considerations from how to handle the international provisions to what to do with the revenue were postponed and will continue to dominate the tax conversation in 2019 and beyond,  Jared Walczak wrote.  Speaking of which: The tax departments in both New Jersey and New York are hoping to release guidance dealing with the TCJA s GILTI provision, or global intangible low-taxed income, by the end of the year, according to Tax Notes. Senior officials from both states said at a conference in New York this week that they were searching for ways to offer some relief to companies, after the two neighbors brought the GILTI provision into their own corporate tax systems. Walczak told Morning Tax that New Jersey and New York s approach to GILTI is especially important, given their importance in international trade and business. One of the big issues for New Jersey, New York and other states trying to offer guidance on GILTI, Walczak added, is that they have not incorporated the deduction for Foreign-Derived International Income   meaning those states could conceivably tax a broader portion of multinationals  income than the federal government.  Speaking of which, part two: D.C. s city council voted Tuesday to legalize sports betting.  FUN WITH ROLE REVERSALS: A powerful Senate tax writer in Oregon is pushing for a measure that would force big companies, like local favorite Nike, to disclose what they pay in taxes. The chairman of the Senate committee in charge of taxes says such a move would  make Oregon companies less competitive, and that s what you re doing by opening up their books to competitors.  But here s the twist: the first lawmaker is a Republican, and the second a Democrat, as the Oregonian reports. The Republican, Bruce Boquist, is introducing the legislation after public employee unions, Nike and Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, struck a deal to keep a similar proposal off the November ballot. Boquist says the data is needed for the legislature to write good tax laws, though there might be other motives at play, too.  After striking that deal, the unions, Nike and a handful of other businesses worked together to defeat conservative ballot initiatives, re-elect Brown and raise billions of dollars in business taxes in 2019,  the Oregonian notes.

                    By CAITLIN OPRYSKO12/19/2018 09:25 AM ESTPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said the U.S. military will construct his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, insisting that it will be built  one way or the other  while seemingly walking back threats to shut down the government if Congress fails to appropriate for the wall by the end of the week.Trump also doubled-down on his claim that Mexico is paying for the wall s construction by virtue of a recently renegotiated trilateral trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. That claim has been met with skepticism by many who have argued increased revenues via international trade do not constitute the president making good on his guarantee that Mexico would pay for the wall.Story Continued Below Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA! Far more money coming to the U.S. Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall!  Trump wrote on Twitter Wednesday morning. In our Country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but when it comes to Border Security and the Military, the Democrats fight to the death,  the president wrote in an earlier tweet. Pointing to an increase in defense spending this year agreed to by both parties   in exchange for a boost in domestic spending, a concession to Democrats   Trump added:  One way or the other, we will win on the Wall!  The 2020 Election. The New Congress. The Mueller Investigation. Be in the Know.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Trump s flurry of tweets is the latest indicator that the White House has softened its stance on a possible shutdown Friday, a marked difference from the president s Oval Office meeting with Democratic leaders a week ago, where he declared he would be  proud  to shut down the government if Congress provided anything less than $5 billion in funding specifically for the border wall. Asked Wednesday if the Defense Department had any comment on Trump s plan to use the military to build the border wall and if it would be possible to reallocate funding for it, Pentagon spokesman Col. Rob Manning said,  at this time, we continue to work by, with and through our partners in the region.  In response to a follow-up email from POLITICO, Manning said his initial response had been sent in error but did not comment on Trump s border wall plan.On Tuesday, the White House said that it had begun to look elsewhere in the federal budget for money to go toward a wall while saying that it would wait and see how spending negotiations in Congress play out before making a decision on how to act.And counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway on Wednesday told reporters that Trump would be open to punting the issue to next year with a stopgap bill.But even as Trump vowed on Twitter that a border wall would come to fruition, she seemed to downplay even that promise in an interview on  Fox & Friends  while chiding members of both parties in Congress for dragging their feet on the issue. First of all, let s not all acquiesce to the ridiculous sound bite that this is about a wall,  Conway said. Democrats  are trying to make a wall a four letter word when the president has been talking about border security all along as have the Democrats, until he became president. Pointing to bipartisan criminal justice overhaul legislation that passed in the Senate on Tuesday night, Conway argued that  when people want to come together on behalf of the American people they do it through criminal justice reform, through opioid legislation. That s why the Democrats are completely disingenuous when they walk away from border security. 
                    White House 
                    By BEN WHITE Fox & Friends  host Ainsley Earhardt pushed Conway on the wall issue, asking why there had been so little progress on one of the president s signature campaign promises and suggesting that backing down from a shutdown battle amounted to a softening of Trump s stance on the issue. Conway replied with criticism of Congressional Republicans, who have been somewhat split on the issue of meeting Trump s border-wall demands. The president is not softening his stance. He has a responsibility to keep the government moving and he has responsibility to get border security. If he could do it by himself, he would have done it already,  she said.  We are relying on a Congress that has proven many times with tax reform and deregulation, obviously two Supreme Court justices, they are willing to come up and make a move.

The Senate overwhelmingly passed the bill Tuesday, 87-12, capping more than a year of negotiations to create more rehab programs and ease mandatory minimum sentences for some drug-related crimes. The legislation seemed dead in the lame duck, but the president s persistence paid off. Trump eventually nudged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) into taking up the bill, even though the measure divided the GOP Conference. McConnell ultimately voted for it. The legislation   provides incentives for some federal inmates to earn time credits if they participate in certain programs, reduces the three-strike penalty to 25 years from life in prison, reduces the disparity between sentencing for crack and powder cocaine and would ease mandatory minimum sentencing,  Marianne explains.  The bill faced vehement opposition, particularly from [Sen. Tom] Cotton, who said it would allow for the early release of violent criminals.  Story Continued BelowTrump tweeted that he looks forward to signing the bill.  America is the greatest Country in the world and my job is to fight for ALL citizens, even those who have made mistakes,  he said.  This will keep our communities safer, and provide hope and a second chance, to those who earn it. In addition to everything else, billions of dollars will be saved.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) signaled that lawmakers will likely pass a bill that expires  early February.  Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said the goal is a long-term agreement.  But if not, and if it s a short-term CR, then we ll see what can ride on that, and what the president will sign,  Thune added. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), meanwhile, is optimistic that Congress can avoid allowing part of the government to shutter. The Senate majority leader emerged from a lengthy party lunch after a flurry of mixed signals from the White House to declare there will be no partial shutdown on Friday evening, when a quarter of government funding expires,  Sarah, Burgess and Eliana Johnson write. McConnell also said the White House is  flexible  on border wall funding, despite the president previously threatening to shut down part of the government if Democrats refused to meet his $5 billion wall funding request. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested Trump could accept less than $5 billion.  She said on Fox News that the administration would work with Hill leaders on passing a bipartisan bill providing $1.6 billion in fencing and would try to move more money around within the government to fund the border wall,  they note. Sanders said the White House is  disappointed  the Senate hasn t sent it anything.  When they do something, we ll make a decision about whether we re going to sign it,  she told reporters.

After ushering through a Republican tax bill last year and negotiating increases in military spending, Ryan will also see passage of criminal justice reform be signed into law before he retires. But his legacy isn t all good, even from Republicans  standpoint.  [H]is repeated promises to sweepingly address the solvency and growing costs of two mandatory government programs -- Social Security and Medicare -- never happened, even though Republicans controlled all levers of government for the past two years,  The Washington Post s Robert Costa and Mike DeBonis note.The deficit has also ballooned to $779 billion since he became speaker. And thanks to the GOP tax cuts, some economists say, the deficit is projected to near $1 trillion next year. Republicans also lost 40 seats in the House this year, handing Democrats the majority and subpoena power for the next two years after very little oversight, if any, of the Trump administration.  Big issues dear to Ryan such as immigration and poverty will remain for future lawmakers to solve,  they add.  Ryan and his allies are   making the case that the pointed critiques ignore the political reality of the Trump era, in which traditional conservatives like Ryan have been forced to seek wins where they can and otherwise play defense against Trump s bad impulses,  they continue.  His farewell address, to be delivered in the Great Hall of the Library of Congress, will seek to highlight those victories and acknowledge how and why he fell short elsewhere, said an aide familiar with his planned remarks.

Ra˙l Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the incoming chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, misused funds when he made a settlement with a former female aide in 2015 who accused him of being drunk on the job.  It was first reported last fall that Grijalva arranged for a top staffer to be given a  severance package  worth $48,395 after she threatened a lawsuit alleging Grijalva was often drunk at work and created a hostile work environment,  The Hill s Miranda Green writes. Grijalva said he preferred to fight the allegations in court but was advised by his legal counsel to settle.  It s been a bane on my family,  he said of the drinking claims.  Politically, it s used against me whether it s the midterms or anything else. I don t know if this necessarily makes it go away, but it does minimize the lies and for that I m happy.  More: http://bit.ly/2EujLvv TAX LAW PROVISION HAUNTS GOP -- Republicans wanted to ax Obamacare s individual mandate to raise revenue for their $1.5 trillion tax cuts. That was all a federal judge in Texas needed last week to declare the entire Affordable Care Act null and void.  The result is a tricky political problem for Republicans, who now bear the blame for erasing even the law s most popular provisions -- while Democrats have an opening to continue making health care a prime issue in 2020,  Bernie Becker reports.  Republicans appear particularly concerned about being blamed for ending the pre-existing condition requirement.  More: https://politi.co/2ECwqNP  The Affordable Care Act has a lot of provisions people are very familiar with, but also a lot of things critical to some populations that are not as well-known,  said Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), whose reelection campaign heavily focused on defending popular patient protections.  With the sweeping ruling   all of those are placed in jeopardy, and people face real uncertainty.  Indeed, as Joanne Kenen and Alice Miranda Ollstein report, Friday s court ruling  shows how hard it is to relitigate parts of Obamacare without harming measures that benefit virtually every American, including people who don t even buy insurance from the Obamacare markets.

Joe Manchin s (D-W.Va.) upcoming term may be his last. And after winning reelection in a state the president carried by more than 40 points in 2016, he has two choices, according to Burgess and Anthony Adragna:  Be a MAGA conservative Democrat or embrace his party s ascendant left wing.  He may, however, do both. The conservative Democrat is trying to repair his relationship with Trump post-campaign and also fend off criticism from progressives who say he s too friendly with the coal industry to be the top Democrat on the Energy Committee.  It s classic Manchin: Committing to work with everyone, no matter how much they might be at odds,  they write.  [T]he former governor has said he doesn t want to run again for his Senate seat and so will no longer have to worry about backing Trump s agenda to boost his reelection chances. And as ranking member on the energy panel starting next year, Manchin has a prime opportunity to shape big-ticket legislation, particularly if his party takes back the majority in 2020 and makes him chairman.

Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), who succeeded the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) but signaled that he wouldn t serve beyond this year. Though some Republicans were opposed to McSally, she had Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in her corner. McConnell  privately contended that McSally s experience running statewide and her fundraising network from this year s campaign would give her the best opportunity to hold the seat during the 2020 special election,  Alex Isenstadt and James Arkin report. The winner of that race will also have to run for a full term in 2022 after serving out the final two years of McCain s last term,  they add. The 2020 special election will be one of the most competitive Senate races in the country. Potential challengers include Grant Woods, a former McCain chief of staff and state attorney general who recently became a Democrat; retired astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.); Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.); and Rep.-elect Greg Stanton, the former Phoenix mayor who won Sinema s seat in November.

Story Continued Below HOW DOW MAN COULD EAT TARIFF MAN   I write at some length here about how free-traders inside and outside the White House are counting on President Trump s love for stock market rallies to overcome his love of tariffs to help force a deal with China on trade next year:  Trump loves two things very much: tariffs and a rising stock market. It s becoming increasingly clear he can t have both    I think Trump the Dow Jones Man is ultimately going to eat Trump the Tariff Man,  said one former senior administration official intimately familiar with the president s stock market obsession, citing Trump s touting of a recent agreement to hold off on increased tariffs after a dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  What he agreed to after that dinner had basically been on the table for two years. He knew he had to give Wall Street something.   WHAT IS THE PAIN THRESHOLD?   Both markets and Trump are fixated on the Federal Reserve this week with the central bank expected to raise rates by another quarter point today. But no matter what the Fed does, investors early next year will pivot to the showdown between Trump and the Chinese. And pressure from Wall Street could push Trump to cut a deal. Here s what Stephen Moore, visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation and an outside Trump adviser, told me:  The question is, what is Trump s pain threshold? And what is China s pain threshold? It s almost like two cars zooming toward each other. Which one is going to turn first?    If the stock market fell another 1,000 points it would give him pause. He does love a bull market and hate a bear market. But he also feels this is the fight of our lifetime.   ONE SHOT AT A WIN   Here s what Brown Brothers Harriman s Scott Clemmons told me:  There is room from the Chinese to yield some ground in terms of open markets and for a negotiated settlement where both sides get to take a victory lap   There is a risk that Trump could turn back into Tariff Man and prolong this. But it s one of the few areas where the White House could get a big win in the first half of 2019. And if it goes on it s really going to start hitting people in the pocketbook.   WHO IS GORDON HARTOGENSIS?   Gordon Hartogensis may soon be in charge of a big government agency facing down a $54 billion pension crisis. But nobody has ever heard of him and he has little experience in the field. He is, however, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s brother in law. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao is his sister-in-law.  In the latest POLITICO Money podcast, POLITICO s Ian Kullgren discusses his new piece looking into Hartogensis, a little-known and retired multi-millionaire, and how he came to be the Trump administration s nominee to head the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation.  HERE COMES THE FED   Big day today in Fed Land per our Victoria Guida:  When Federal Reserve policymakers meet on Wednesday, they re likely to raise interest rates, as they ve been signaling for months. But the certainty for the central bank and Wall Street ends there.  With markets facing turbulence, the economy showing some signs of weakening and   Trump s trade wars creating jitters throughout corporate America, all the predictions about what the Fed will do next year have gone out the window. Trump s relentless campaign of pressure on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to halt the rate hikes has further clouded the picture.  Read more  StanChart s Steven Englander    FOMC expectations are changing daily. So far, economic data have been reasonably strong, so investors are trying to gauge how the FOMC will balance asset market fears and softening growth abroad against still-robust incoming economic data.  Investor perception is that the FOMC will back off sharply from the hawkish stance of September/October, but there is a recognition that the Fed is reluctant to make big policy shifts based on asset markets and foreign growth   Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America    This will be the most critical meeting of the tightening cycle, as it may indicate that the end of the cycle is near   So the dot-plot will be critical... we will be looking for a change to maybe 2 hikes next year    We will also be looking to see if the phrase  further gradual rate increases  is removed, and something about data dependence added   If these dovish elements are included, the stock market will likely be very happy. If not, expect severe disappointment  TRUMP GOING BACK TO DAVOS   The White House announced Tuesday that Trump will go back to the World Economic Forum in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, from January 22 to January 25.

MNUCHIN SPREADS BLAME FOR ROCKY MARKETS   Bloomberg s Saleha Mohsin, Jesse Hamilton, and Craig Torres:  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin blamed volatility in equity markets partly on high-speed trading and the effect of the Volcker Rule, adding that he planned to conduct an inter-agency review of market structure.   Over a longer period of time the market reflects various different economic components but a normal trading day now is a 500-point range. A lot of that has to do with market structure, and that s something we re going to take a look at,  Mnuchin said in a roundtable interview Tuesday at Bloomberg s Washington office.  Read more.  TRUMP FOUNDATION TO SHUT DOWN   Our Laura Nahmias:  Trump s personal charity will shut down and disperse whatever funds it still has under a new agreement announced Tuesday by New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood.  The agreement to shut down the Trump Foundation is a significant victory for the attorney general s office, which sued the charity in June, alleging the president and several of his children used it for their own political benefit. That lawsuit, which seeks millions of dollars in restitution, will continue, even as the foundation agrees to cease existence.  Read more. S&P FLAT AMID SHUTDOWN THREATS   Reuters  April Joyner:  The benchmark S&P 500 stock index ended little changed in a choppy trading session on Tuesday as the possibility of a partial U.S. government shutdown raised investor jitters ahead of a highly anticipated meeting of the Federal Reserve.  The Dow Industrials and the Nasdaq posted slight gains, however, as shares of Boeing Co and the group of internet-focused momentum stocks known as FAANG rose. The S&P 500 had risen as much as 1.1 percent earlier in the session but gave up most of its gains after U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Democrats had rejected his spending bill proposal.

Ask someone how  the Dow  is doing and, even if they don t know the answer, they ll know what you re talking about. Ask them about the bond market and you ll most likely get a blank stare. When it comes to the economy, however, bonds are far more important than stocks.  Read more.  IS A RECESSION ON THE HORIZON?   AP s Josh Boak:  Fears of a recession have been mounting with the U.S. stock market appearing to be headed for its worst December since 1931   during the Great Depression. Wall Street s sustained slump has been fueled by investor concerns about lower corporate profits, higher corporate debt, a festering trade war between the United States and China and a broader global slowdown.  So is a U.S. recession imminent? Not necessarily. Plenty of economic gauges suggest that far from being derailed by a stock market that s set to suffer its first annual loss in a decade, the $20 trillion U.S. economy is barreling forward. Employers are hiring, consumers are spending ahead of the holidays and economic growth has been brisk, thanks in part to President Donald Trump s deficit-financed tax cuts.  Read more.  And there may be a new way to spot a forthcoming financial crisis   WSJ s Paul J. Davies:  A more realistic way to model financial risk is emerging. It could help big banks and regulators spot potholes, even if it can t stop people falling into them. The previous method for modeling the financial world was shown to have huge blind-spots during the 2008 crisis. People didn t behave in the rational ways economists had assumed and supposedly freak events appeared with alarming frequency. Investors and regulators have been hunting for alternatives ever since.   Read more. MNUCHIN HINTS AT FANNIE-FREDDIE CHANGES   Bloomberg s Saleha Mohsin, Elizabeth Dexheimer and Craig Torres:  The Trump administration wants to work with Congress on freeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from government control, though it s considering pursuing some changes on its own, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday.   I would like to get them out of conservatorship,  Mnuchin said during a roundtable interview at Bloomberg s Washington office.  My preference would be to do something that has bipartisan legislative support.  Fannie and Freddie rose after Bloomberg reported the Treasury Secretary s comments. Mnuchin didn t specify on what Treasury might do unilaterally, though he indicated that securing Senate confirmation of a new Federal Housing Finance Agency director will be key to the administration s efforts.

SMALL FED MOVES, BIG MARKET IMPACTS   WSJ s Nick Timiraos and Rachel Louise Ensign:  In a world of low inflation and slow recuperation from the financial crisis, even small interest-rate changes can have outsize effects on markets and the economy. That is a key lesson that Federal Reserve officials have learned as they prepare another short-term rate increase at their policy meeting this week. With markets unsettled and the economy slowing, the officials are wondering whether they should slow the already-anemic pace of action.  The Fed has moved its benchmark short-term rate up to a little over 2% since 2015, remarkably little action when considered against history. In the early 1980s, for example, it moved in even larger increments in a matter of weeks to boost already double-digit rates. Even in the 2000s, when the Fed moved rates up at a  measured pace,  the sum of its actions over three years amounted to more than 4 percentage points of increases.  Read more.  BANKS CATCH A BREAK   WSJ s Michael Rapoport and Andrew Ackerman:  Banks received a reprieve on Tuesday from a new accounting rule that requires them to book losses on soured loans more quickly. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved a measure, proposed in April, that will allow banks to take three years to phase in the impact of the new accounting rule on their regulatory capital.  The rule, which publicly traded banks must adopt by 2020, will require lenders to book all expected losses from their loans as soon as the loans are issued, and that could require some banks to significantly boost their loan-loss reserves, which would reduce regulatory capital.

                            President Donald Trump walks toward a group of reporters to answer questions while departing the White House on Nov. 29. | Win McNamee/Getty ImagesHEADS UP   THE FEDERAL RESERVE will announce whether it will continue to hike rates today at 2:30 p.m. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP has urged the Fed to lay off another hike, but the FT puts it this way:  Fed officials have signalled they will boost rates by a quarter point at the meeting, and holding fire would look skittish, according to analysts and strategists. It would send a markedly downbeat signal about the economic outlook; it might indicate the Fed is overly influenced by market turbulence; and it would trigger claims that the president is influencing policy.  FTGOVERNMENT FUNDING UPDATE   We are basically 65 HOURS from a government shutdown, and here are the dynamics after a day of reporting on Capitol Hill:-- TRUMP: A BIT PLAYER   THE WHITE HOUSE HAS CLEARLY DECIDED it wants to be on the sidelines for this fight. Democrats offered them two pathways in the Oval Office last week, and the administration hasn t responded to either of those. And yesterday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders took the position that they ll have to see what the Senate can produce, and then TRUMP will decide what to sign. IT S A CURIOUS STANCE, but they clearly want some space from this deal and to set up the public position that the president has no choice but to sign whatever Congress produces late Friday. It s a massive shift from last week, when the president was saying he d own a shutdown, and he was looking to deal.SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS have told us the following things: A shutdown is inevitable because the president will hold strong; he wants a seven-bill omnibus with $1.6 billion in border security and he ll declare that a victory; he wants a short-term spending bill to interrupt the beginnings of the Democratic House; he will not accept a short-term spending bill; he ll see what the Senate produces. All of these answers have come from the same institution: the Trump White House.-- THE SENATE is talking, but not getting too far. MITCH MCCONNELL and CHUCK SCHUMER discussed a seven-bill deal that would fund government for a year, but it included a $1 billion pot of money that Trump could use for his immigration policies. That money could not be used to build a wall, but Democrats say it could be used for things like detention beds, so they aren t much interested in approving it.AS FRIDAY draws closer and closer, a stopgap spending bill is becoming more and more likely. The Senate is likely to decide on this today. The short-term spending bill under discussion would provide funding through sometime in FEBRUARY. For Democrats, this is better than January, when NANCY PELOSI will be trying to get her majority stood up. BUT   It practically guarantees a funding showdown in the second month of the new Democratic House majority. In February, the optics are better all around. This time, a shutdown would interfere with Christmas.-- THE HOUSE is basically just watching at this point. There is some concern that attendance will stink this week but the GOP whip operation is somewhat confident that they will have people in town through Friday. The real problem will be if TRUMP continues to sit on his hands, some HOUSE REPUBLICANS will decide they aren t going to walk a plank for a president who can t say what he supports, senior Republicans tell us. HOUSE REPUBLICANS are meeting at 9 a.m. Thursday. They have their first votes of the week this evening.HOUSE DEMOCRATS will clearly view anything that doesn t include wall money a victory. A stopgap funding bill until February isn t ideal, no question about that. But the ground shifts massively toward Democrats  favor next year.-- THE WHITE HOUSE has indicated they are asking Cabinet secretaries to find money that can be reprogrammed for building a wall. The dig-in-the-couch-cushions strategy is fun, don t get us wrong. But it s not tethered to reality. Sure, some agencies can reprogram money, but only up to a certain amount until Congress needs to approve it.THE LEADALLS   -- SARAH FERRIS, BURGESS EVERETT and ELIANA JOHNSON:  GOP talks Trump off the shutdown ledge -- WAPO S ERICA WERNER, DAMIAN PALETTA and SEUNG MIN KIM:  Trump backs off demand for $5 billion for border wall, but budget impasse remains ahead of shutdown deadline -- NYT S JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS and KATIE ROGERS:  White House Signals Retreat on Shutdown Threat -- WSJ S KRISTINA PETERSON and REBECCA BALLHAUS:  White House Signals Flexibility on Border-Wall Funding as Shutdown Looms STEVEN SHEPARD:  Poll: Voters would blame Trump, GOP for shutdown A message from AARP:The big drug companies don t see us as people.

SPOTTED: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meeting with Nancy Pelosi in her office in the Capitol Tuesday. WAPO S BOB COSTA and MIKE DEBONIS,   He was the future of the party : Ryan s farewell triggers debate about his legacy :  Speaker Paul D. Ryan is using his final weeks in Congress to leave a lasting image of a brainy conservative warrior for lower taxes, free markets and a more muscular America abroad   in public appearances, a taxpayer-funded online video series and a farewell address set for Wednesday. But after two decades in the House and three years as speaker, the Wisconsin Republican s long-term legacy is already a matter of fierce debate inside his own party. While Ryan shepherded a broad GOP tax bill last year and negotiated major increases in military spending, his repeated promises to sweepingly address the solvency and growing costs of two mandatory government programs   Social Security and Medicare   never happened, even though Republicans controlled all levers of government for the past two years.  Ryan often spoke of the imperative of fiscal discipline, especially during the eight years of the Obama administration. But the nation s red ink has grown since Ryan became speaker, soaring from $438 billion in 2015 to $779 billion this year. And many economists blame the tax cut as a culprit as next year s deficit is projected to hit nearly $1 trillion.

Sanger and Steven Erlanger:  Hackers infiltrated the European Union s diplomatic communications network for years, downloading thousands of cables that reveal concerns about an unpredictable Trump administration and struggles to deal with Russia and China and the risk that Iran would revive its nuclear program. In one cable, European diplomats described a meeting between President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Helsinki, Finland, as  successful (at least for Putin).  Another cable, written after a July 16 meeting, relayed a detailed report and analysis of a discussion between European officials and President Xi Jinping of China, who was quoted comparing Mr. Trump s  bullying  of Beijing to a  no-rules freestyle boxing match.   NYTJOANNE KENEN and ALICE MIRANDA OLLSTEIN:  Obamacare s secret base: America s middle class BIG NEWS   MARIANNE LEVINE --  Senate approves Trump-backed criminal justice overhaul :  The Senate overwhelmingly passed Tuesday the biggest overhaul to the criminal justice system in decades, giving a win to President Donald Trump and a bipartisan group of advocates and lawmakers. Tuesday s vote caps more than a year of negotiations to create more rehabilitation programs and ease mandatory minimum sentences for some drug-related crimes. The bill, which passed 87-12, has brought together many unlikely allies, including a group backed by the conservative Koch Brothers, the American Civil Liberties Union, the White House and senators from both sides of the aisle.  POLITICO-- TICK TOCK --  The bill that wouldn t die: The unlikely story behind the criminal justice overhaul,  by CNN s Jeremy Diamond and Alex RogersTHE INVESTIGATIONS   -- DARREN SAMUELSOHN and JOSH GERSTEIN:  Mueller appears victorious in mystery subpoena dispute :  A federal appeals court on Tuesday ordered a mystery corporation owned by a foreign country to comply with a subpoena that appears to be from special counsel Robert Mueller. The three-page opinion released by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is the latest twist in an opaque dispute that POLITICO and other media outlets have tied to Mueller s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The ruling offers the intriguing detail that the entity fighting the Mueller subpoena is a foreign government-owned company, not a specific individual, as many experts had speculated.  POLITICO-- CNN S KATE SULLIVAN:  Trump signed letter of intent for Trump Tower Moscow project despite Giuliani insisting he didn t :  A newly obtained document shows President Donald Trump signed a letter of intent to move forward with negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Russia, despite his attorney Rudy Giuliani claiming on Sunday the document was never signed. CNN s Chris Cuomo obtained a copy of the signed letter of intent that set the stage for negotiations for Trump condominiums, a hotel and commercial property in the heart of Moscow. The letter is dated October 28, 2015, and bears the President s signature. When asked on Sunday about the letter, Giuliani incorrectly told CNN s Dana Bash that it had not been signed.  It was a real estate project. There was a letter of intent to go forward, but no one signed it,  Giuliani told Bash. The non-binding document is also signed by Andrey Rozov, owner of I.C. Expert Investment Co., the Russian firm that would have been responsible for developing the property.  CNN   The documentTV THIS MORNING -- Rep.

Dance, Michael LaForgia and Nick Confessore:  For years, Facebook gave some of the world s largest technology companies more intrusive access to users  personal data than it has disclosed, effectively exempting those business partners from its usual privacy rules, according to internal records and interviews. The special arrangements are detailed in hundreds of pages of Facebook documents obtained by The New York Times.   Facebook also assumed extraordinary power over the personal information of its 2.2 billion users   control it has wielded with little transparency or outside oversight.  Facebook allowed Microsoft s Bing search engine to see the names of virtually all Facebook users  friends without consent, the records show, and gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook users  private messages.   Yahoo, The Times and others could still get Facebook users  personal information in 2017.

                    By STEVEN SHEPARD12/19/2018 05:21 AM ESTIf parts of the federal government shut down later this week, most voters will blame President Donald Trump and Republicans over Democratic minorities in Congress, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll.The holiday brinkmanship in Washington comes as the government must approve a series of spending bills to stay open past Friday. But Trump is feuding with Congress over the $5 billion he wants to fund construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. While Republicans control both chambers in Congress, any spending bill will require 60 votes in the Senate, where there are currently only 51 Republicans.Story Continued BelowTuesday brought some softening in the White House s position, though a path to approving the must-pass spending bills was still unclear.Forcing a shutdown over border-wall funding would put Trump crosswise with public opinion, the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows. A majority of voters, 55 percent, say a wall along the border with Mexico is not important enough to shut down the government   far greater than the 31 percent who say it is important enough, the poll shows.There is some appetite among Trump s base   60 percent of GOP voters say a wall is important enough to warrant a shutdown, while 30 percent say it isn t   for a fight over the wall, but both Democrats and independents are opposed by ratios of more than two to one.The 2020 Election.

Roughly one in five voters say presidents and Congress should use a lapse in government funding to achieve their policy goals, while just under two-thirds say they should achieve their policy goals another way.Forty-one percent of voters say that if the government does shut down, they will blame Trump, while another 10 percent will blame Republicans in Congress. Just three in 10, 31 percent, would blame Democrats in Congress, and 18 percent have no opinion.GOP voters would have Trump s back, according to Tyler Sinclair, Morning Consult s vice president.  If a shutdown occurs, two-thirds of Republicans (66%) would blame congressional Democrats, while just 20 percent would blame President Trump and congressional Republicans,  he said.But Trump and Republicans would get the lion s share of the blame from others, including independents. Roughly half of independent voters, 49 percent, would blame Trump or congressional Republicans, while only 22 percent would blame Democrats in Congress.While a partial government shutdown might not be an earth-shattering political event for Trump, it would frame a tumultuous 2018 that saw continued economic growth at home and relative peace abroad   even as his party got drubbed in the midterm elections and scandals continue to swirl around his administration.

His lowest approval rating in 2018, 40 percent, came in September.The new survey shows a majority of voters, 55 percent, disapprove of Trump s job performance.The poll was conducted Dec. 14-16, just days after Michael Cohen, Trump s former personal attorney, was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to a number of crimes, including violating campaign-finance laws during Trump s 2016 presidential bid. Asked whether Cohen was telling the truth when he said he broke campaign-finance laws at Trump s direction, a plurality of voters, 45 percent, say Cohen was telling the truth, while 26 percent say he wasn t.

Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) to include money for harbor maintenance, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge with the negotiations. -- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP does not want to accept a short-term stopgap spending bill, and, as of now, wants Congress to send him the seven-bill minibus package, which includes $1.6 billion in border security money. TRUMP will make the argument that he can use the $1.6 billion for  wall  spending, plus the White House believes they can redirect other money to pay for the physical border with Mexico.WHAT SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SAID:  We have other ways that we can get to that $5 billion that we ll work with Congress if they will make sure that we get a bill passed that provides not just the funding for the wall, but there is a piece of legislation that has been pushed around   that provides roughly $26 billion in border security including $1.6 billion for the wall.  More from Sarah Ferris and Burgess Everett-- SANDERS is holding an on-camera briefing at 1:30 p.m.  BUT, BUT, BUT: A SENIOR DEMOCRATIC AIDE tells us that the offer MITCH MCCONNELL made to CHUCK SCHUMER includes the $1.6 billion for border security, plus $1 billion in other money for immigration. That would be a non-starter for Democrats.-- NO MATTER WHAT THEY DECIDE, the Friday deadline is fast approaching. NEW   CONSERVATIVES ARE STARTING TO FRET   Unlike many members of Congress, who have viewed the president s utterances on the border wall as a joke, there are many conservatives who thought the president would finally fight for some wall money. One conservative House Republican texted us this this morning:  Book the flights, trim the trees, there will be no fight for border wall funding, no shutdown and Pelosi will have gone into the Oval Office and won. SIREN   CONSERVATIVES WARN TRUMP, from the House GOP conservative lawmaker:  The political future of the President and the backdrop for the next two years will be decided in 72 hours. It is all over but the crying. At least we can rejoice that there will not be a shutdown and [R]epublicans won t get blamed. BULLETIN ... TRUMP INC. -- LAURA NAHMIAS:  Trump Foundation to shut down under agreement with New York attorney general :  The agreement to shut down the Trump Foundation is a significant victory for the attorney general s office, which sued the charity in June, alleging the president and several of his children used it for their own political benefit. That lawsuit, which seeks millions of dollars in restitution, will continue, even as the foundation agrees to cease existence.    Our petition detailed a shocking pattern of illegality involving the Trump Foundation   including unlawful coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing, and much more. This amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump s business and political interests,  [NY AG Barbara] Underwood said in a statement Tuesday.

Democrats are also promising changes to the new limit for households that deduct state and local taxes, which hits blue states particularly hard. Massachusetts Rep.

                        Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared that the government would stay open and that the White House would be  flexible  on its border wall demands.
                    By SARAH FERRIS, BURGESS EVERETT and ELIANA JOHNSON12/18/2018 11:00 AM EST
                    Updated 12/18/2018 08:48 PM ESTMitch McConnell thinks he s gotten President Donald Trump to back off his shutdown threat. And it s looking increasingly likely to come with a short-term punt.The Senate majority leader emerged from a lengthy party lunch after a flurry of mixed signals from the White House to declare there will be no partial shutdown on Friday evening, when a quarter of government funding expires. The GOP majority may have to settle for a short-term delay, but McConnell said the White House is now  flexible  on border wall funding, just one week after Trump said he d be  proud  to shut down the government in a fight over border security.Story Continued Below He can speak for himself. But I think a government shutdown is not a good idea. That s my view. The American people don t like it,  McConnell told reporters. Asked whether he believes a shutdown could now be avoided ahead of the holidays, he responded:  Yeah, I do. McConnell s efforts to soothe an inflamed debate between the president and Democratic leaders capped a day of unsuccessful negotiations between McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and a softening public position from the White House. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders indicated the president could accept less than the $5 billion from Congress that he had previously demanded, and Schumer did not rule out a short-term spending bill that would punt the border fight to next year.Trump, of course, revels in the daily drama and, on Tuesday, refused to admit defeat or pledge that he would win the standoff. After McConnell and Schumer spoke to reporters, the president said he wants more border security and was coy on whether he ll sign whatever Congress sends him.  We ll see what happens,  he told the news media.The 2020 Election. The New Congress. The Mueller Investigation. Be in the Know.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Back on Capitol Hill, senators and aides said they believed a short-term spending bill might be the best option.Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby said Tuesday night that lawmakers were likely to pass a spending bill that would expire in  early February. It could flip a few days.  That would give the new Democratic House time to organize,  Shelby said. He said ultimately it would be up to McConnell and Trump, but acknowledged that was the most likely outcome.Earlier Tuesday, McConnell suggested to Democrats that they pass the bipartisan Senate homeland security funding bill and its $1.6 billion for fencing plus an additional $1 billion in spending Trump could use on the wall, which Schumer deemed a  slush fund. The Democratic leader soon called McConnell to reject the proposal and stood behind a bill offering flat funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which would provide $1.3 billion for fencing. The Republican offer today would not pass either chamber,  Schumer told reporters. He said his caucus would  very seriously  consider a short-term spending bill, which would thrust a spending fight into the lap of presumptive House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the beginning of the new Congress.The round of failed talks followed a key breakthrough: Sanders admitting publicly that Trump would take less than $5 billion in border wall funding from Congress as a condition for keeping the government funded. She said on Fox News that the administration would work with Hill leaders on passing a bipartisan bill providing $1.6 billion in fencing and would try to move more money around within the government to fund the border wall. Schumer said he would withhold congressional approval for that.Later, Sanders told reporters the White House was  disappointed  the Senate hadn t sent it anything. But she also underscored that the White House was waiting on lawmakers to act.  When they do something, we ll make a decision about whether we re going to sign it,  Sanders said.And party leaders are clearly preparing to make a move given the new wave of negotiations among Schumer, McConnell and Pelosi. Some Senate Republicans signaled after the party lunch that they might try to force Democrats to reject their proposal, arguing Democrats might be bluffing. Nancy Pelosi is balking because she doesn t know if she has got the votes for speaker next year,  said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).  Seems to me we need to make members vote in both houses on what they ve already agreed to essentially. 
                    White House
                    By SARAH KARLIN-SMITH, RACHEL ROUBEIN and BRIANNA EHLEYOthers said a short-term spending bill might be the only option. Our goal would still be to a long-term agreement, but if not, and if it s a short-term CR, then we ll see what can ride on that, and what the president will sign,  said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.).Even with the partisan bickering and lack of a firm solution, Sanders  statement was a breath of fresh air to Republicans after all of Trump s shutdown talk last week. The emphasis on the desire to not have a shutdown is a major plus,  said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who struck the initial border compromise.Since Trump s televised Oval Office sparring match with Democratic leaders a week ago, the White House has careened between a hard-line position and indications it is preparing to give in to Democratic demands. The result has been utter confusion on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have waited for a clear sign from the White House about what sort of bill the president would sign.Indeed, Sanders  remarks came 48 hours after the White House sent Stephen Miller, the administration s leading immigration hawk, to serve as the White House s spokesman on CBS, where he said Trump was prepared to shut down the government if he didn t get the wall funding he was seeking. We re going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,  Miller said.Sanders, however, suggested the White House is open to cobbling together a series of funding bills that together would amount to $5 billion in border security and wall funding   something that the president would spin as a victory, according to a White House official. It s not to anybody s political benefit to shut the government down right now, so I think the likelihood of some concessions are very high,  said a former White House official.White House aides stressed that the president is aware that a shutdown would dominate cable news headlines over the Christmas holiday, when he is planning to decamp to his Mar-a-Lago resort and when there is unlikely to be much more in the way of political news to overshadow it. Trump had 30 minutes of  policy time  scheduled with Mick Mulvaney, his budget chief and soon-to-be acting chief of staff, earlier Tuesday and was also scheduled to meet with top aide Kellyanne Conway.
                    Congress 
                    By MARIANNE LEVINESanders did not say in her Fox News appearance where the additional border money would come from to reach Trump s full $5 billion demand, but administration officials have hinted it could come from the military s budget.The president has suggested as much in a tweet, writing,  If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall. They know how important it is!  Trump is still haunted by regrets over signing a $1.3 trillion omnibus bill last March that included $1.3 billion for fencing but fell far short of his initial demands. After signing the bill into law, Trump was stung by the critical reviews it received on Fox News, which blasted the president for allowing major increases in domestic spending without extracting painful concessions. I personally wish the president vetoed this bill, made them stay in Washington. Make them keep their promises,  Trump pal Sean Hannity said on his prime-time show.  What happened to the Republican Party? Whatever happened to the party that believed in fiscal responsibility? In the weeks that followed, the president told aides he wouldn t make the same mistake twice and even floated the idea of pushing a so-called rescission bill in order to claw back as much as $60 billion included in the original bill.Still, lawmakers were relieved after the White House signaled it was preparing to back down and some sort of endgame began to take shape. I don t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president s advisers are telling him this would not be good,  Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said. I m starting to feel like a combination of Christmas being right upon us and people s desire to go home makes it feel like it s all coming together here,  he added.John Bresnahan and Brianna Gurciullo contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

Story Continued Below ALEXANDER S SENATE CAREER COMING TO AN END: A former governor, university president and Education secretary, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) has unprecedented education experience for a senator. His retirement, announced Monday, will likely have sweeping consequences for how education policy is made on Capitol Hill.   Still, Alexander has two more years as Senate HELP chairman ahead of him. With the countdown clock ticking, his retirement raises the stakes for him to make progress on a major overhaul of higher education. Read more on his chances from Michael Stratford.   In K-12 education, Alexander was one of the key architects of the bipartisan law to replace No Child Left Behind, shepherding the sweeping overhaul through Congress and onto President Barack Obama s desk in 2015.   Alexander s been a long-time supporter of providing more school choices to low-income students through charter schools and the use of public funds for private school tuition   ideas embraced by President George H.W. Bush when Alexander served as Education secretary under him.   During the Trump administration, Alexander has been a supporter of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, defending her through a contentious confirmation process against Democratic attacks.

SCHOOL SAFETY COMMISSION REPORT EXPECTED TODAY: President Donald Trump will host a roundtable at 2:15 p.m. today in the Roosevelt Room of the White House to discuss findings from the Federal Commission on School Safety. DeVos chaired the commission, which Trump created in March.   One of the most significant recommendations it s expected to make is to rescind Obama-era school discipline guidance, as Caitlin Emma reported last month.   Outside of Washington, lawmakers in Texas and Arkansas have introduced bills in response to school shootings, although neither mentions firearms: TX HB496 (19R) would require that bleeding control kits be easily accessible while AR HB1014 (19R) would require high school students to be trained in how to control bleeding, according to PULSE: State Health Care.  GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN LOOMS:  The clock is ticking on whether a spending agreement will be reached by the end of the week that keeps the entire federal government open. A partial shutdown wouldn t directly affect the Education Department, as Trump already signed the spending bill that funds its operations. But there s a research-related fight brewing over USDA funding that s worth keeping an eye on.    Pro Agriculture s Ryan McCrimmon writes that key lawmakers tasked with writing the Agriculture-FDA spending bill, which funds USDA, have been tight-lipped about how they plan to address Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue s proposal to move the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture outside of the Beltway region in 2019. Agriculture appropriators have considered including language in the bill that would halt Perdue s plans until lawmakers could gather additional information   adding a layer of suspense to the process.   Also on the research front: The Association of Public and Land-grant Universities is out today with a new National Science Foundation-funded report that finds not enough African-American and Hispanic students are earning engineering degrees in the U.S. to fill the growing demand for high-tech workers. Read it here.  ICYMI: A federal judge in California on Monday rejected DeVos  efforts to dismiss a lawsuit challenging her delay of Obama-era rules governing online college programs. U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that the National Education Association could proceed with its lawsuit accusing DeVos of illegally postponing the  state authorization  regulations for distance education programs.

But they are waiting for President Donald Trump to weigh in before making a move, and he appears to be in no rush to help them out,  write POLITICO s Burgess Everett, John Bresnahan and Sarah Ferris.  Roughly one-fourth of the federal government is scheduled to shutter on Friday without action, and Democrats and Trump continue to spar over his border wall.    HASC S SMITH OPPOSING DoD FUNDING FOR BORDER WALL: House Armed Services ranking democrat Adam Smith is reiterating his opposition for funding a border wall through the Defense Department. The Washington state Democrat, set to wield the committee s gavel in the next Congress, reiterated Sunday and Monday that he anticipates bipartisan opposition to the president s plan for funding a wall through DoD.  SOME BORDER TROOPS HEAD HOME FOR CHRISTMAS:  More than 2,000 active-duty troops dispatched to harden the U.S. border with Mexico are back at their home bases, the Pentagon said Monday,  via the Washington Examiner.  Last week, the number of troops deployed in support of Customs and Border Protection operations along the southwest border was reported to be 5,200.  This week the number is down to 3,150, a drop of 2,050.  HOW MULVANEY CAN IMPACT THE FY20 DEFENSE PLAN:  Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney s takeover, at least temporarily, of the White House chief of staff position could have repercussions for defense spending, analysts predict,  writes Defense News.  Mulvaney, a former congressman and leader of the fiscally hawkish House Freedom Caucus, is viewed as a budget hawk, one who has no problem pushing for lowered defense spending. He attempted, with various degrees of success, to drive down defense spending in both the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 budget submissions from the Trump administration, according to sources.   Meanwhile, CBO analysts spot hundreds of billions in military savings ... by capping military pay, scrapping aircraft, slashing veterans  benefits, adds the Military Times. NAVY CHIEF DIRECTS THE CREATION OF TWO INNOVATION HUBS:  The Navy will create new concept development commands on each coast and establish a new directorate in the Pentagon to translate innovative ideas more quickly to the fleet, according to new guidance obtained by POLITICO that Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson issued Sunday,  reports our colleague David Brown.   A Design for Maintaining Maritime Superiority 2.0  marks an update to the  New Design  document released in 2016 and incorporates changes from the Trump administration s National Defense Strategy, which focuses on great power competition with China and Russia.  TESTER AND BOOZMAN URGE BETTER VA CARE FOR WOMEN: Sens. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and John Boozman (R-Ark.) are urging the VA to immediately take steps to provide better care for women veterans, including through implementation of a new law aimed at improving services. The senators write in a letter to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie the department should implement reforms signed into law as part of the Deborah Sampson Act, which expanded the Women Veterans Call Center as well as women veteran mini residency programs, among other reforms. TALIBAN APPEAR READY TO DISCUSS PEACE TALKS, EXCEPT  :  Representatives from the Taliban, the United States and several Asian countries gathered in the United Arab Emirates on Monday for what officials cautiously described as important meetings that could lead to formal talks to end the 17-year war in Afghanistan,  writes The New York Times.  The optimism fostered by months of urgent American diplomacy was dampened by the Taliban s apparent refusal to meet with a delegation of the Afghan government, although Afghan officials said late Monday that they had not given up hope that the two sides would talk.   Talks between the Taliban and U.S. were set for a second day today, adds Reuters.  And an austere base in Afghanistan rapidly expands for more US troops, writes Stars and Stripes.  TURKEY S ERDOGAN RENEWS THREAT AGAINST U.S.-BACKED KURDS IN SYRIA:  Turkey s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan escalated his threats Monday of a military attack on U.S.-controlled territory in northeastern Syria, while the U.S. military insisted that the two countries were  making progress  in resolving their differences,  writes The Washington Post.  JAPAN S AMERICAN-MADE WEAPON SPENDING SPREE:  Japan plans to spend around $10 billion to become the largest customer outside the U.S. for Lockheed Martin Corp. s F-35 jet fighters, as it responds to a rising China and pressure from President Trump to spend more on American military hardware,  writes The Wall Street Journal.  The cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday approved an increase of Japan s existing order for 42 F-35s to 147 of the aircraft as part of new defense plans that include the development of Tokyo s first post-World War II aircraft carriers.  U.S. BACKS NATO MEMBERSHIP FOR BOSNIA:  The United States supports Bosnia s ambition to join NATO, a senior U.S. official said on Monday, dismissing Bosnian Serb objections and adding Washington would react strongly to any threat to the stability of the country,  via Reuters.   SIGNIFICANT MILITARY CAPACITY  ALONG UKRAINE S BORDERS:  Russia has amassed  significant military capacity  on Ukraine s borders, a top U.S. diplomat confirmed Monday amid fears Russia has its eyes on another piece of the country,  via the Washington Examiner.  Still, Moscow says it doesn t want  to lose the rest of Ukraine  by mishandling other embattled regions in the eastern part of the country, also via the Washington Examiner.  The U.S. and Ukraine push Europe to increase Russia sanctions, adds the WSJ. ARMY PICKS GD, BAE TO BUILD LIGHT TANK PROTOTYPES:  The Army [Monday] awarded General Dynamics and BAE Systems a pair of contracts with up to $376 million to develop prototypes of a new light tank,  reports our colleague Wesley Morgan.  The Mobile Protected Firepower program aims to equip select infantry brigades with lightweight tanks to make them more prepared for heavily-armed ground forces like Russia.   SEE YOU IN COURT   AMAZON AND ORACLE BATTLE OVER PENTAGON CLOUD:  Global tech giants Oracle and Amazon have fired off early salvos in what is likely to become a protracted court battle over how the Pentagon should build advanced cloud-computing technology into its operations, the latest turn in a long-running dispute over one of the biggest military IT procurements in years,  writes The Washington Post.  EMBRAER AND BOEING AGREE TO KC-390 JOINT VENTURE:  Brazilian aerospace firm Embraer and Boeing have officially formed a joint venture on Embraer s KC-390 multimission aircraft as part of a larger partnership on the companies  commercial sides,  reports Defense News.

AIA HIRES NEW COMMS HAND: Phil Cardarella has joined the Aerospace Industries Association as a writer-editor. Cardarella will work directly with CEO Eric Fanning and report to VP for Communications Caitlin Hayden. He joins AIA from the Senate, where he served as the speechwriter for then-Sen.

CRUNCH WEEK ON THE HILL: The clock is running out on the 116th Congress and the chances of passing the long-debated driverless car bill ( S. 1885 (115)) are getting slimmer by the day. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the bill s sponsor, told MT on Monday that a new offer was made over the weekend to Democrats still opposed to the measure.  We re waiting for feedback from them,  Thune said.  Ideally it would be great to get it done, I just am not convinced yet that there s a path forward.  Everyone would be gone from D.C. by now if it wasn t for the ongoing staredown over a potential partial government shutdown, and Thune had previously said the lengthened session could give the bill s backers a chance to iron out differences with Democrats over safety and opposition from trial lawyers over liability provisions. But the shutdown debate is still unpredictable.  As every minute ticks by it s going to become more difficult,  said Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), one of the bill s co-sponsors.  Another AV safety report: Meanwhile, Silicon Valley self-driving car startup Zoox published a safety report Monday, laying out the company s approach to safely operating its autonomous vehicles. Zoox, which boasts former NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind as its chief safety innovation officer, is the eighth company to issue a voluntary safety report under the guidelines set out by DOT. In the words of The Verge reporter Andrew Hawkins, the reports  toe the line between marketing and verifiable data.

Like other railroads around the country, NJ Transit still faces a long two years of testing to have the technology fully operational before another 2020 deadline.  While we can ease up on the accelerator, we cannot and will not stop,  said Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti, the state transportation commissioner. POLITICO Pro New Jersey s Ryan Hutchins has more.  LAYING TRACK: Amtrak is planning to open a new track at Washington Union Station, in part funded by a $19 million grant from the Federal Railroad Administration. The project will increase rail capacity for Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express at the second busiest terminal in the country, the company said. Track 22, which is currently a storage track, will be opened to customers in 2022.  RESHAPING THE MTA: POLITICO New York s Dana Rubinstein reports that Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for the reconfiguration of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which he effectively controls.  No governor, no mayor, no county executive, no state legislator will fulfill their public obligation this year without addressing this critical need,  Cuomo said.  Period.  Of note: The Metropolitan Transportation Sustainability Advisory Workgroup is set to release today its report on how to resuscitate MTA  s flailing subways, buses and commuter railroads.  While we re here: Ryan has another story on a bill passed unanimously by the New Jersey state legislature on Monday that would reshape the management of NJ Transit, expanding its board of directors, creating new transparency requirements, improving procurement procedures and installing a top official to be responsible for advocating for riders. A LOOK AT ICE S FLIGHTS: ICE Air Operations, an obscure division of the immigration and customs agency, operates hundreds of flights every year to deport immigrants, and the Trump administration is looking to raise its budget for charter flights by 30 percent. According to the AP s Nomaan Merchant and Angeliki Kastanis, ICE says using private flights saves money, provides flexibility and avoids elongating detention periods.  But migrant advocacy groups say ICE Air is an example of how tougher immigration enforcement   from detention to tracking to removal   enriches private companies.  Read the full story here. GREAT DAY FOR SPACE NERDS: Three different rockets will be blasting off today from both coasts and the middle of the country.

BREAKING DOWN WHEELER S FIRST FEW MONTHS: Andrew Wheeler took the helm of EPA when Scott Pruitt exited under a cloud of ethical scandals in July, and many observers predicted pretty much exactly what has happened: The former EPA worker/congressional staffer/coal lobbyist would run a drama-free agency that focused on the wonkiest details as it rewrote the agency s pollution rulebook. And now, many are wondering if that s what will transpire with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke s exit and hand-off to Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt, himself a former lobbyist.  But just how much deregulatory action has Wheeler taken since taking over for Pruitt? Pro s Eric Wolff and Alex GuillÈn break that down this morning, finding that since being named acting administrator in July, Wheeler has avoided the Pruitt-style scandals, while upending the agency s approach to smog-forming pollution from power plants and trucks, questioning the health studies used to set safety rules for chemicals, stymieing greenhouse gas pollution regulations and launching a freeze on aggressive fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. Wheeler s critics like George W. Bush EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman say he is better at navigating to the same destination than Pruitt ever was. Wheeler  knows the process better,  Whitman said. While some of his allies, like the Competitive Enterprise Institute s Myron Ebell, applaud his steady rollback of EPA regulations, but say Pruitt and Wheeler could have had an even more effective partnership.  Pruitt was a really good advocate for Trump agenda, but less good at accomplishing or implementing the Trump agenda,  Ebell said. Read the story.  ZINKE S EXIT WON T END PROBES: Zinke may be preparing to head out, but the probes into his various ethical decisions will still continue, Pro s Ben Lefebvre and Zack Colman report.  At this point, everything is continuing,  Interior inspector general spokesperson Nancy DiPaolo said, though she did not elaborate on the extent of the IG probes. And while the Justice Department declined to comment about the reported criminal probe underway into Zinke, the secretary s departure would be unlikely to derail it, according to Brendan Fischer, director of the federal reform program at the watchdog group Campaign Legal Center.

SHUTDOWN WATCH: Senate Republicans were still waiting Monday evening for President Donald Trump to weigh in before they make a move to avert a partial government shutdown come Friday, POLITICO s Burgess Everett, John Bresnahan and Sarah Ferris report. But they could be waiting until deadline day. A former White House official who spoke with Trump on Friday said the president is relishing the fact that Republicans are awaiting his signal while another Republican close to the White House said Trump wants to  maximize drama.   If the government does shut down Friday, national parks would remain open but all visitor services would stop, Pro s Caitlin Emma reports. A National Park Service spokesperson referred to January 2018 guidelines when asked for contingency plans.  WARM WORDS FOR HELLER: Sentiment at 1600 Pennsylvania seems to be cooling on him, but Senate Republicans have warm words for their colleague Sen. Dean Heller to replace Zinke.  I think he would do an excellent job,  Sen. Cory Gardner told reporters. Sen. John Barrasso added  he s good and confirmable.  That s a big selling point, of course, but Heller, who lost his seat in November s election, didn t win any fans at the White House when he caused turbulence over the Obamacare repeal effort.  Some Democrats said they hadn t considered the possibility of Heller in a new role. His home-state colleague, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, offered she could work with him:  He knows the issues that are important for the Interior Department because of all the work he s done here in the Senate and he knows the issues that are important to Nevada,  she said.  EXTENDERS BACK: House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady added the extension of a pair of temporary tax provisions to the latest version of his year-end tax bill, including one to extend and then phase out an incentive for biodiesel and renewable diesel fuel, Pro s Bernie Becker reports. The House Rules Committee will take up the measure, H.R. 88 (115), on Wednesday. OZONE TIME! Murray Energy today will make its case to a panel of D.C. Circuit judges that EPA in 2015 acted inappropriately in lowering the allowable amount of ozone in the air to 70 parts per billion, down from 75 parts per billion. Murray argues that the new standard is essentially a zero-emission standard, because some amount of ozone is naturally occurring, called  background emissions.  EPA has elected to defend the standard, but it said in an earlier filing that it would take a  new approach  when it comes time to review ozone pollution, a process already underway. If you go: Arguments start at 9:30 a.m. at the E. Barrett Prettyman courthouse.  DOE S YUCCA PLAN: The Energy Department suggested appropriators give Energy Secretary Rick Perry broad authority to collect up to $120 million in unassigned agency funds to restart work on the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste project, according to a recent set of documents prepared for lawmakers and seen by Pro s Darius Dixon. In the documents, DOE staff offer legislative language that would allow Perry to use  any unobligated balances available to the Secretary  to raise the $120 million for restarting the nuclear waste program. API S DURBIN TO DEPART IN 2019: American Petroleum Institute Executive Vice President Marty Durbin will depart the trade association at the end of January. Durbin has spent close to 10 years in the natural gas and oil industry at both API and America s Natural Gas Alliance, where he was president and CEO.  It was a thrill to have worked with the natural gas and oil industry during a period of such incredible innovation   even the dual challenges of an economic recession followed by an industry downturn couldn t dampen the U.S. shale energy revolution,  Durbin said in a statement. His next steps and who will replace him have not yet been determined. His last day at API will be Jan. 31.  Donald Welsh will become executive director of the Environmental Council of the States, the coalition of state and territorial environmental protection agencies announced Monday. Welsh has served since 2017 as chairman of the Citizens Advisory Council to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and was previously EPA Region 3 administrator from 2001 until 2009.  Bike-share company Lime added former Clinton EPA Administrator Carol Browner as a  sustainability-focused  adviser. Browner is also a former director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy under the Obama administration, and is currently chairwoman of the board for the League of Conservation Voters and senior counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group.  Lowry Crook joined Best Best & Krieger LLP s Environmental Law & Natural Resources group. Crook previously served as a senior leader and counsel at the Army Corps of Engineers, the White House Council on Environmental Quality and the Federal Maritime Commission.  TAKE A GLANCE! In anticipation of EPA s proposed rule that s expected to recalculate the costs of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, the left-leaning Center for American Progress is out with a new report this morning that says mercury emissions have decreased by more than 81 percent nationwide since MATS was first implemented in 2011.

THE FUTURE OF RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION   MT caught up with the researchers behind the blockbuster reports unveiled Monday detailing a sweeping online influence campaign by Russia during and after the 2016 election. They told us what to expect from the Internet Research Agency in the years ahead.    The reports point to likely 2020 tactics: Bharath Ganesh of Oxford University said trolls are likely to move into the background and  embed  themselves among activist groups critical of U.S. institutions in order to amplify their voices. That is, instead of generating their own content to inflame America s social and political divides, they ll likely share, retweet and otherwise engage with genuine, domestically produced content that aligns with those goals, falsely inflating its apparent reach, according to Ganesh and Renee DiResta, a researcher at New Knowledge. DiResta said it s harder to spot manipulation when trolls are able to piggyback off real users conveying the messages they want to spread.    Platform hopping to continue: As seen particularly after the 2016 campaign, Russian trolls are no strangers to shifting their resources around the web to circumvent rule changes and controls that social media sites instituted in response to disinformation campaigns and trolls.  They were complaining about being taken down from one platform and migrating to another,  Ganesh said of the IRA. And the fact that tech platforms are now seeking them out sets up a  little arms race,  DiResta said, as platforms continue to modify their rules and troll monitoring techniques, and trolls then regroup to develop new tactics.    Google, Facebook and Twitter under fire: The researchers are also raising fresh questions about how forthcoming Google, Facebook and Twitter have been in sharing data on Russian disinformation. In its report, New Knowledge said social media companies may have chosen to share  the bare minimum possible  with researchers. Ganesh said he would  broadly agree  with the assertion, arguing that the disclosures from Google were  incredibly scant  and  really limited what we could do.  In statements, Facebook said it continues to cooperate with authorities and Twitter cited its security improvements since 2016. Google declined comment.  CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS DIAL UP PRESSURE ON FACEBOOK   A group of 31 civil rights and advocacy organizations, including the Southern Poverty Law Center and Freedom from Facebook, are renewing calls for leadership shake-ups at the social media giant, in a letter out today. Their demands: that CEO Mark Zuckerberg step down as company chairman, that COO Sheryl Sandberg relinquish her role on the company board and that Facebook fire its top Washington executive, Joel Kaplan, whose links to conservative figures have drawn scrutiny, among others.    Also today the NAACP is kicking off a #LogOutFacebook boycott of the platform, in response to the latest Russia revelations. Muslim Advocates chief Farhana Khera, whose group was among those signing onto the letter to Facebook leadership today, also supports the boycott.  The reporting ... about our deeper understanding of the influence of Russia in voter suppression is all part of the broader context in which we re making these demands,  she said.

FCC NOMS AGAINST THE CLOCK   Multiple holds may prevent the Senate from advancing long-stalled FCC nominations this year before Congress adjourns, which could come as soon as Friday if lawmakers resolve government funding negotiations. Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) confirmed Monday they both still maintain holds on the nomination of GOP FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr for a full term. The holds on Carr are also blocking Democratic FCC nominee Geoffrey Starks from being seated as a commissioner, as lawmakers want to advance the two nominations as a pair.    The latest obstacle: Manchin, who announced last week he would block Carr in response to the FCC pausing its Mobility Fund wireless subsidy auction to probe whether wireless carriers knowingly supplied inaccurate broadband coverage data for the program. Manchin wants  a firm timeline on the Mobility Fund funds to be released,  an aide said. Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Manchin s longtime partner in criticizing FCC broadband mapping, disagrees, saying the FCC has made  a correct decision  and  ought to get it right before  disbursing subsidies based on inaccurate information. Wicker s office confirmed he s pleased enough with the investigations that he is no longer trying to add a broadband mapping rider to a government funding bill.    Sullivan, meanwhile, is still blocking Carr following a months-long fight over the FCC s rural health care program subsidies. He secured a private meeting with FCC Chairman Ajit Pai last month and a commitment, unveiled Friday in a Pai letter, to overhaul the program rules next year.  All good progress,  Sullivan told John.  We re trying to finalize this, so I think we re close.   That letter is helpful. It did have a lot in there.  He said he s not sure whether he will be in a position to lift his hold on Carr this week.  SENATE PASSES SCHATZ ALERTS BILL   Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) is now two for two on legislation he introduced after the false ballistic missile alert sent in Hawaii this January. The Senate on Monday night unanimously approved substitute text for Schatz s Reliable Emergency Alert Distribution Improvement Act, S. 3238 (115), which is aimed at improving federal oversight of the wireless and broadcast emergency alert system. The House s companion bill, H.R. 6427 (115), has not advanced. The Senate also unanimously signed off on Schatz s ALERT Act, S. 2385 (115), in June.  GOOGLE UNDETERRED ON CHINA OVERTURES   A spokesperson for the tech giant said Monday the company s desire to expand in China has not diminished in response to a report that the company s development of a Chinese search product had  effectively ended.  According to The Intercept,  Google has been forced to shut down a data analysis system it was using to develop a censored search engine for China after members of the company s privacy team raised internal complaints that it had been kept secret from them,  all but ending the project.    Not so fast? Asked about the report, a Google rep reiterated CEO Sundar Pichai s stance, delivered during a House Judiciary hearing last week, that the company has no plans to launch a search product in China at the moment. But the spokesperson added that Google still hopes to somehow break into the Chinese market eventually. Google s search and other functions have for years been inaccessible in China, where the government tightly controls and monitors its citizens  internet use.  ABOUT THAT WHITE HOUSE EXECUTIVE ORDER ON HUAWEI     With rumors circulating in Washington that the Trump administration may be preparing to issue an executive order on the national security implications of telecommunications equipment imported from places like China, a White House official told MT that the U.S. is  working across government and with our allies and like-minded partners to mitigate risk in the deployment of 5G and other communications infrastructure.  But is an EO inbound?  We have nothing further to announce,  the official said.   Elisebeth Collins has left her post as a member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, effective Dec. 15.   Karen Peltz Strauss, a longtime staffer at the FCC, has retired.

Democrats are pledged to block the GOP s labor nominees if Republican senators won t confirm nominees for Democratic seats on the NLRB and the EEOC.   Lots of buzz about Senator Lamar Alexander s announcement that he won t seek re-election in 2020. But that won t affect leadership of the Senate HELP panel, because Alexander s chairmanship was already term-limited to end in 2021.    GOP lawmakers are plotting to avoid a partial government shutdown Friday, but with three working days left they re still waiting on a plan from President Donald Trump.    National-security officials gave T-Mobile the green light Monday to merge with Sprint, prompting labor economists to fret that less competition will mean lower wages.  GOOD MORNING! It s Tuesday Dec. 18, and this is Morning Shift, your daily tipsheet on labor and immigration news.

Follow us on Twitter at @RebeccaARainey, @tedhesson, @IanKullgren, and @TimothyNoah1. TWO CAN PLAY THAT GAME: In one corner, Sen. Mike Lee (R.-Utah) is barring Chai Feldblum, an EEOC commissioner whom the Trump administration nominated to keep her Democratic chair for another term from getting confirmed through unanimous consent. Lee s objection is that Feldblum (who is gay) believes that  rights for LGBT Americans are secured only by curtailing the rights of religious Americans.  Feldblum, for her part, has complained that  various groups have mischaracterized my views in an effort to paint me as a radical opponent of religious liberty.  If Feldblum isn t confirmed, the EEOC will lack a quorum in January.  In the other corner, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) has pledged to block unanimous consent votes on all other GOP labor nominees unless Feldblum and Mark Pearce, re-nominated for his Democratic seat on the NLRB, are confirmed by unanimous consent. To get all these blocked nominees to the floor by Friday, Democrats and Republicans will have to cut a deal or file for cloture by mid-day Wednesday. More on the situation from Vox  here.  ENZI IN 2021?: Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) announced Monday that he won t seek reelection after the next Congress. This isn t as momentous as it sounds for the Senate HELP Committee, which Alexander chairs, because he was already due to give up the gavel in 2021 when he reached his six-year term limit. Next in line by rank is Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), but it s way too early to tell if he ll be the next chairman. More on Alexander s exit from POLITICO s Burgess Everett here.  TRUMP SAVORS SUSPENSE: Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) met privately with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday afternoon to talk about avoiding a government shutdown, POLITICO s Burgess Everett, John Bresnahan and Sarah Ferris report. The Republicans have a plan, but Trump isn t saying whether he supports it because he wants to  maximize drama,  according to a Republican who s close to the White House.  A former White House official who spoke with Trump Friday said the president is relishing the fact that Republicans are awaiting his signal and letting him set the terms,  Everett, Bresnahan, and Ferris report. More from POLITICO here.  SPRINT-T-MOBILE MERGER: National-security officials okayed T-Mobile s merger with Sprint Monday, The Wall Street Journal reports. While the deal still needs approval from antitrust authorities,  executives have said they expect that process to end in the first half of next year,  according to the Journal. If the merger is approved, the U.S. wireless market will be reduced to three major players, including AT&T and Verizon, leaving retail wireless workers fewer opportunities for employment. Researchers at the Economic Policy Institute and the Roosevelt institute, two left-leaning think tanks, estimate that their average weekly earnings would decline 1-3 percent in most affected labor markets, and as much as 7 percent in the hardest hit markets. More from the Journal here; read the paper here. CBP CONTRADICTS COMMENTS ON METERING: Did CBP Acting Assistant Commissioner Jud Murdock contradict official claims that border agents haven t been slow-walking asylum processing deliberately to create a deterrent? Buzzfeed reports on a letter signed by Democratic Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), and Jerry Nadler (D- N.Y.) that says, in a closed congressional hearing earlier this month, Murdock  clearly indicated, given the context, that the department s decision to limit processing was primarily motivated by its desire to deter migrants from seeking asylum at ports of entry.  More here.  NO MOOLAH FOR MOONVES: Former CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves won t get his $120 million golden parachute after the company says he misled CBS about  multiple allegations of sexual misconduct and tried to hide evidence,  the New York Times reported Monday. Moonves stepped down as chief executive of the storied Tiffany Network after the New Yorker s Ronan Farrow detailed two rounds of sexual harassment allegations against Moonves, including  claims that Moonves forced [women] to perform oral sex,  that he  exposed himself,  and that he  used physical violence and intimidation.  The Times obtained a report from lawyers hired by CBS earlier this month that said Moonves  destroyed evidence and misled investigators in an attempt to preserve his reputation and save a lucrative severance deal.  More from the Times here.  CONTRACTORS DYING FROM ELECTROCUTION: Of all the contract workers who died as a result of electrocution in recent years, a  significant share  were construction workers, Construction Dive s Kim Slowey reports. The National Fire Protection Association analyzed Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2012 through 2016 and found that 8 percent of all contract worker deaths were from electrocution, and 68 percent of those workers were in the construction and extraction fields. More from Construction Dive here.  MORE DROPPED FROM MEDICAID: Some 4,655 Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas were booted from the program this month for failing to meet the state s work requirement, POLITICO s Dan Golberg reports. More than 16,000 low-income adults have now been removed in total from the program during the past four months in Arkansas, the only state where Trump-approved work rules have taken effect, he writes. More for Pro s here. MORE UNION REFUND DISPUTES: A San Francisco appeals court will hear arguments this morning in a class action lawsuit seeking refunds from union dues collected from an estimated 40,000 California state workers by SEIU Local 1000. The National Right to Work Legal Foundation, which is representing the workers in Hamidi v. SEIU, says the potential cost of the refunds could top $100 million.  A lower court found in February 2017 that the union s procedure for collecting fees from non-members did not violate their constitutional rights, but the National Right to Work Foundation, which is representing the California workers, appealed the following month. With the Supreme Court s June ruling in Janus v. AFSCME, the foundation says that its case seeking to collect fees all the way back to 2012 has been strengthened. The union says in its brief that it stopped collecting so called  fair-share  fees once the ruling in Janus was issued, and that it had relied on  good faith  concerning existing state law. A Washington federal district judge dismissed a similar case last month filed by a separate conservative group, but the foundation has successfully collected refunds for public employees in Minnesota and Oregon.  IMMIGRATION IMPACTS FOOD SAFETY: Remember that E. coli outbreak before Thanksgiving that prompted officials to warn American consumers to avoid all romaine lettuce? Crop scientist Sarah Taber writes in Slate that the Trump s administration s hard-line immigration policies may be partially to blame. As ICE worksite enforcement investigations, audits, and arrests  surged  over the last fiscal year by 300 to 750 percent,  the fear of being noticed may have kept front-line migrant workers from flagging food safety concerns, Taber writes.   To do even the most basic food safety practices, you need workers who can get trained, stay, and put that training to work,  Taber writes.  Any situation that disrupts the farm workplace, increases turnover, or incentivizes workers to keep quiet and not get noticed has consequences for food safety.  More from Slate here.

Story Continued Below WALL STREET BLUES   The Santa Claus rally does not appear to be coming to town this year. The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq all tanked another 2 percent-plus on Monday, putting all three lower for the year. The Dow and S&P are both down about 5 percent on the year and are enduring their worst start to December (typically a good month for stocks) since 1980. Stocks are on their way to their worst month since the financial crisis. Why is this happening? Some of it is concern about slowing global economic growth, some is concern over what the Fed will say about 2019 when it almost certainly raises rates again on Wednesday. And a great deal continues to be concern about global trade disruption, mainly uncertainty about whether Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping will make some kind of deal before March 1 or at least agree to kick the can down the road a few more months. MM spoke with Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.  It s a litany of things and I d throw renewed fears of a government shutdown in there. But it s really a list of things that we are going to have to deal with throughout 2019. There is a lot of headline risk that can prompt day-to-day volatility even if underlying conditions remain fairly strong    THE HOPEFUL VIEW    The tailwinds from tax reform are fading but if we go back to a run rate of 2.5 percent in real GDP, where we ve been most of the past 10 years, that s OK for the stock market.   And this is the sixth correction of this very long equity market cycle and a correction combined with pretty robust earnings growth has brought equity valuations to a more reasonable level. 2019 will probably be marked by a lot of these kinds of days but I m still an optimist.   THE RISING WALL OF WORRY   Satyajit Das on Bloomberg Opinion:  The  everything bubble  is deflating. The fact that it s happening relatively slowly shouldn t blind us to the real threat: The world is dangerously underestimating how hard it ll be to deal with the fallout once it pops. Frothy markets can t disguise the warning signs.  The shift to tighter monetary policies in the West is putting pressure on global equity and real-estate values. Even more critically, it s weakening credit markets. Over-indebted emerging markets face headwinds from rising borrowing costs and dollar shortages. At the same time, investors are underestimating how disruptive trade conflicts and sanctions could turn out to be.  Read more.  FUTURES RISE   U.S. futures were up a bit early in Asian trading.  XI DEFIANT   Via CNBC:  Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed his nation Tuesday morning in Beijing to commemorate the 40th anniversary of China s  reform and opening up,  striking a relatively defiant tone to international calls for major changes in his country s economy. His remarks are being watched to see whether Xi s idea of progress aligns with the West s increasingly vocal demands for less state control.  That could have significant consequences for whether the U.S. reaches a trade deal with China by the end of its 90-day tariff ceasefire.  No one is in a position to dictate to the Chinese people what should or should not be done,  Xi said in Mandarin Chinese during the address, according to a translation.   Read more. TRUMP PROMISES MORE FARM BAILOUT MONEY   Per Trump tweet:  Today I am making good on my promise to defend our Farmers & Ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations. I have authorized Secretary Perdue to implement the 2nd round of Market Facilitation Payments. Our economy is stronger than everñwe stand with our Farmers!  Our Ryan McCrimmon with details:  The Trump administration announced   a second and  final; round of trade aid for farmers and ranchers burned by retaliatory tariffs, including roughly $4.9 billion in additional direct payments for certain commodity producers.  The second batch of trade relief payments will apply to the second half of 2018 production for producers of corn, soybean, wheat, sorghum, cotton, shelled almonds, sweet cherries, dairy and pork, according to USDA   Farmers and commodity groups have complained that the government aid has been insufficient to make up for the financial impact of the administration s tariff policies  Read more.  TWEET DU JOUR   From J.D. Scholten (@Scholten4Iowa) who ran against and almost beat GOP Rep. Steve King:  We re borrowing money from China to give to our farmers to not sell our products to China.   AND YET MORE TRUMP ON THE FED   The president returned to his browbeating of Fed Chair Jay Powell and his FOMC colleagues not to hike:  It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris is burning and China way down, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. Take the Victory!   MM SIDEBAR   These tweets are rapidly becoming background noise, just another guy popping off about Fed policy. At the margin, they make it harder for Powell to hit the pause (or stop) button so as not to signal to markets that the Fed moves at the whim of the president. But the case for stopping rate hikes is getting stronger regardless of anything Trump says. And he s not wrong about the slowdown in China and relatively tame inflation. Not raising rates on Wednesday would be a huge shock to markets and raise question about Powell caving to Trump. So it s very hard to see it happening. But telegraphing a more gentle approach next year and then skipping a hike at the March meeting would seem reasonable and cheering to markets and would not reek of political pressure.  NAVARRO GETS ON BOARD THE FED TRAIN   It wasn t just Trump taking the baseball bat to the Fed on Monday. Per CNBC:  White House advisor Peter Navarro   just hours after   Trump blasted the Federal Reserve   doubled down Monday, singling out the central bank as the biggest threat to U.S. economic growth.  Appearing on CNBC s  Squawk on the Street,  Navarro said the Fed should pause its interest rate hikes   not because growth is slowing, but because growth is strong with barely any inflation.  We have zero inflation for all practical purposes  and strong economic growth, Navarro told CNBC s Rick Santelli.  The only argument I m hearing for the Fed to raise rates now is somehow they have to exert their independence.   Read more.  WHAT A SHUTDOWN WOULD DO   Via AP:  In truth, the government won t really shut down. Many agencies, including the Pentagon and the departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, are already funded for the year    Still, the dispute could affect nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies, including the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Interior, Agriculture, State and Justice, as well as national parks and forests. More than 800,000 federal employees would see their jobs disrupted, including more than half who would be forced to continue working without pay.  Read more.  BUT IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN?   Our Burgess Everett, John Bresnahan, and Sarah Ferris:  Senate Republicans are searching for a way out of the impending partial government shutdown   but they are waiting for   Trump to weigh in before making a move.   With the House out of town until Wednesday, all eyes are on the Senate GOP majority and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who hates shutdowns.   Read more.

Patenaude gave no reason for her exit from HUD after just 15 months on the job.    Patenaude will transition out of her position in January, when Federal Housing Administration Commissioner Brian Montgomery will step in as acting deputy secretary, a HUD official told POLITICO. Patenaude is well-versed in housing policy and had given industry leaders and advocates comfort as a steady hand whose knowledge would offset Carson s lack of housing experience.  Read more.  WALL STREET HITS NEW 2018 LOWS   NYT s Carlos Tejada and Matt Phillips:  Stocks on Wall Street fell on Monday to a new 2018 low, as investors braced for a Federal Reserve decision on interest rates this week and health care stocks were roiled by a court decision about the Affordable Care Act.  The S&P 500-stock index ended down 2.1 percent, sinking below levels reached during a steep decline in February. The index is now down 4.8 percent for the year. Should the market fail to rebound, the losses for 2018 could represent Wall Street s worst year since the financial crisis a decade ago.  Read more.  Historically, rate hikes are rare when stocks are this beat up   Bloomberg s Lu Wang:  Trump s hectoring aside, it s exceedingly rare the Federal Reserve raises interest rates when stocks are behaving this badly. In fact, were policy makers to follow through with their widely expected hike Wednesday, it would be the first time since 1994 they tightened in this brutal a market. Right now, the S&P 500 is down over the last three, six and 12 months, a backdrop that has accompanied just two of 76 rate increases since 1980.  The statistic is another lens into the divide between markets and the economy, a split that has beguiled forecasters trying to draw connections between the two. While half the S&P 500 sits in a bear market and groups like banks and transports tumble day after day, some key economic data bolster the case of hawks.  Read more.  S&P 500 HITS 14-MONTH LOW   Reuters  April Joyner:  Wall Street s major indexes all slid more than 2 percent on Monday, with the benchmark S&P 500 closing at its lowest in 14 months, on concerns about slowing economic growth ahead of a highly anticipated decision from the Federal Reserve this week on the course of U.S. interest-rate hikes.  The S&P 500 hit its lowest since October 2017 to breach lows reached during its sell-off in February, having wiped out about $3.4 trillion of market value since late September. The small-cap Russell 2000 index confirmed a bear market, having fallen more than 20 percent from its Aug. 31 closing high.  Read more.  ACA RULING HITS HEALTH CARE STOCKS   NYT s Stephen Grocer:  A federal judge s decision to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act late Friday has hit the stocks of health insurers and hospitals.  Shares of Molina Healthcare, which specializes in providing care to low-income people under Medicaid and is a mainstay of the individual insurance markets created by the law, fell almost 9 percent on Monday. The stock of Centene, which had expanded aggressively into the state marketplaces, dropped nearly 5 percent. Other health insurers   Anthem, UnitedHealth and Cigna   were down at least 2.6 percent.  Read more.  THE FED S COMMUNICATION PROBLEM   WSJ s Nick Timiraos:  Federal Reserve officials will debate this week how to signal less certainty over the path of interest rates without implying they are done raising them after their two-day policy meeting ends Wednesday.  One challenge is deciding how to alter the Fed s postmeeting policy statement. Since the central bank began raising rates three years ago, it has indicated the potential for  gradual increases.  It signaled greater confidence in the path since January, when it started saying it expected  further gradual increases.  Officials have been debating how and when to usher this language out of the statement now that their policy path looks less certain than it did just three months ago.  Read more.  GOLDMAN CALLS FOR INVESTORS TO GET DEFENSIVE   Bloomberg s Joanna Ossinger:  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. s solution to high uncertainty about the stock market next year: Get defensive.  The path of the market next year will depend on investor perception of the longevity of the current economic expansion,  strategists led by David Kostin said in a note released late on Dec. 14.  Investors should increase portfolio defensiveness.   The S&P 500 Index will probably climb to 3,000 by the end of next year, the Kostin-led strategists initially forecast last month. But they assign that outcome just a 50 percent probability, also seeing a 30 percent chance the gauge will drop to 2,500, and a 20 percent likelihood of a gain to 3,400.  Read more.  INVESTORS SEE OPPORTUNITY IN BEATEN DOWN BONDS   WSJ s Joe Wallace and Christopher Whittall:  Large swathes of the corporate bond market are trading at a discount to face value, a dynamic not seen since the depths of the financial crisis 10 years ago. Rather than a sign of impending doom, however, some investors see a unique opportunity to buy bonds with significant headroom for capital appreciation.  Rising interest rates and the Federal Reserve s shrinking balance sheet have sent shudders through the bond market. Companies are finding it harder to raise new debt, regulators have expressed concerns about risks to financial stability, and investors have been burned by steep declines in the price of bonds issued by firms such as General Electric Co. But declines in the face value of bonds has also created a pricing dynamic that can make bargain hunting especially attractive.  Read more.

Without congressional action by Friday, roughly a fourth of the federal government will shutter. Senate Republicans have no plan to stop it, and the House isn t back in session until Wednesday.  What Trump s intentions are as to a potential shutdown apparently are as opaque to [Senate Republicans] as they are to anyone else,  Burgess, Bres and Sarah report. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) conceded,  We don t know  what the president wants. If there s a plan, I think at the moment it s the president and the Democrats trying to figure out what they can agree upon,  Senate GOP Conference Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) added.  This is going to have to build for a few days here before there s a solution out there.  One possible solution is a two-week continuing resolution, which punts the fight into January. Another is an omnibus spending bill with funding for seven federal agencies, including an increase in border security spending. Multiple Republican senators encouraged Trump over the weekend to consider another two-week extension. Story Continued Below Trump, though, hasn t told anyone what he wants to do,  they note.  House Republicans are also confused by the state of play. They had believed that [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell would file a compromise funding bill with $1.6 billion for fencing on Monday, but that didn t happen either.

But now it faces a different challenge: Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).  The Arkansas Republican is pushing changes, introduced with Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), that could blow up the fragile compromise on legislation to reform prisons and sentencing laws,  Marianne reports.  The amendments would bar more offenders from participating in the bill s earned-time credit program and would require the Bureau of Prisons to notify victims when a prisoner is released early. The amendments also would require authorities to track arrests of ex-convicts after they re released from prison early. In a National Review op-ed published Monday, Cotton claimed his  conservative friends and colleagues   jumped on the bandwagon too soon.  The First Step Act, he wrote, fails its  basic test to protect public safety  because  [a] number of serious felonies   are still eligible for early release.  But Democrats say Cotton s amendments are simply a strategy to sink criminal justice reform by dividing its supporters and making changes that would complicate its passage in the House.  The Cotton amendments are the latest obstacle in a dramatic push to get criminal justice reform through in the lame-duck session,  she writes.  The Senate voted 82-12 Monday to move forward with the bill, moving closer to a final vote.

Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who unseated outgoing Democratic leader Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), now has her eyes set on the new caucus chairman: Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). Ocasio-Cortez has recruited an African-American woman to primary Jeffries.  Challenging Jeffries would open an audacious new front in Ocasio-Cortez s efforts to steer the direction of the Democratic Party, pitting her and allies against a rising-star African-American Democrat seen by some as a potential future speaker of the House,  Laura BarrÛn-LÛpez writes.  It would also set off another intra-party New York City brawl   that would peak just as Democrats hope to rally around a presidential nominee in mid-2020. One person who spoke to Ocasio-Cortez and her staff said,  [i]t s personal for  the congresswoman-elect,  and she s going to go all out to take him out.  Ocasio-Cortez is unhappy that a campaign donation from Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) was allegedly used in a whisper campaign against Lee, who lost a close race to Jeffries for caucus chair last month. Ocasio-Cortez spokesman Corbin Trent denied eyeing recruits but said Ocasio-Cortez and her allies were  disappointed  with Jeffries  leadership race. Jeffries  response?  It s a free country and democracy is a beautiful thing,  he said. More: https://politi.co/2rFkD8Y GOOD MORNING!

DHS FRUSTRATES HISPANIC CAUCUS -- DHS told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in a conference call Monday that they won t be allowed to talk to Customs and Border Protection agents who were involved in the apprehension and detention of Jakelin Caal when they visit the remote station where her illness was originally treated. Caal, a 7-year-old Guatemalan asylum seeker, died in CBP s custody earlier this month.  The refusal frustrated lawmakers, and the CHC source said at one point Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, warned that if the agents are not made available during the Tuesday inspection, they can expect to be called before Congress as soon as Democrats take control of the House in January,  BuzzFeed News  John Stanton reports. DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman acknowledged that there s an ongoing investigation and suggested DHS  inspector general should conduct a probe, not Congress. She also said CBP can t force its unionized Border Patrol agents to speak to members of Congress.  On Friday, Rep. Lou Correa, who will take the helm of the Homeland Security Committee s Subcommittee on Oversight in January, announced that he would hold hearings on Caal s death next year, and warned that he will hold DHS leadership  responsible for their failure to properly care for migrants in their custody and their inability to lead the hardworking officers under their command,   Stanton adds.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is releasing a bill today  that would effectively create a government-run pharmaceutical manufacturer to mass-produce generic drugs and bring down prices,  Alex Thompson and Sarah Karlin-Smith report.  The bill, dubbed the Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act, is unlikely to pass the Republican-led Senate, but it signals that a future Warren White House could try to radically revamp the federal government s role in the pharmaceutical market in order try to lower prices.  In a statement, Warren said  competition is dying as a handful of giant companies spend millions to rig the rules, insulate themselves from accountability, and line their pockets at the expense of American families.  Warren, however, is just the latest senator mulling a White House bid to introduce legislation targeting the pharmaceutical industry. Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) introduced the CURE High Drug Prices Act last week. Merkley has also put forward a separate bill, while Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced his Prescription Drug Price Relief Act in November.  The flurry of bills suggests that the powerful pharmaceutical industry will be a major populist target during the Democratic presidential primary and possibly the general election, as millions of Americans struggle with rising health care costs,  they write.

Even before Alexander could get to the reason he was calling, Trump asked him to stay in the Senate for 20 more years,  Burgess reports.  A former governor, Cabinet member, presidential candidate and now the chairman of the influential Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Alexander decided to call it quits after three terms despite polls showing him in strong position for 2020.  Alexander is widely respected on both sides of the aisle.  He is a problem solver at a time when too many people in politics want to talk about a problem rather than solve a problem,  Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said. Alexander called outgoing Gov. Bill Haslam and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty the  obvious favorites  to succeed him,  in addition to four or five of our congressmen.  Rep. David Kustoff (R-Tenn.) is considering a run. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.), meanwhile, said he is keeping  an open mind towards the future  but is  solely focused on the responsibilities of my current role for the time being.

Judy Chu (D-Calif.) is asking Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to clarify a claim from DHS that s been repeated by Republicans regarding the number of terrorists apprehended at the southern border each day. The president and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in recent days have said that the U.S. catches 10 terrorists a day at the border.  This is an alarming statistic,  Chu wrote in a letter Monday.  If true, 3,600 terrorists are crossing or attempting to cross our southern border every year. This would represent a significant percentage of terrorists worldwide. Chu said the White House, DHS officials and members of Congress have cited that statistic as evidence for the need to quickly fund the president s border wall. But a 2017 State Department report on terrorism found that there is  no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States,  she noted.

Two Chicago Police officers were killed by a train while chasing a suspect. Prayers to their families and colleagues.Mayoral candidate Susana Mendoza will outline today how she would govern Chicago. Top on her list: She wants to re-purpose underused schools into community centers.Story Continued Below We have to think boldly and transformationally,  she says, according to planned remarks released to POLITICO before her City Club speech.  Instead of asking which 50 schools we should close next, I ll be focused on which 50 underutilized schools we should be doubling down on, turning them into true community hubs and stronger academic centers.  Mendoza calls it the 50NEW Initiative, for Neighborhood Education Works.Mendoza also will address the  sickening, senseless plague of violence.  She says she wants to resurrect the Obama Justice Department s mindset for policing--which calls for law enforcement to take on a  guardian  role instead of a  warrior mentality.  She supports the consent decree, ending the police code of silence, hiring more detectives, building tech hubs to track crime and enacting  real gun safety laws. Mendoza, currently the state comptroller, also supports building a new police and fire training center.  You cannot train, re-train and constantly update the training for 12,000 police personnel with the out-of-date, out-of-scale training infrastructure we have in Chicago today. Jeanne Ives is back. The conservative state lawmaker who lost the 2018 primary race to Gov. Bruce Rauner, is now championing David Krupa the kid candidate in the 13th Ward aldermanic race.That s right. Ives has emailed supporters asking that they donate to the 19-year-old running against veteran alderman Marty Quinn, a friend and ally of House Speaker Mike Madigan. Ives sees this as a David v. Goliath race after learning Quinn supporters filed some 3,000 affidavits to revoke signatures for Krupa even though he only collected 1,700 names. I am sending this to my entire statewide email list and beyond. And I am asking all of you to send this guy $10 to keep his fight going against the Madigan Machine,  Ives says in her email. She links to stories in the Tribune, which feature Krupa as a little guy trying to beat the establishment.Ives  email doesn t mention yesterday s POLITICO story detailing Krupa s backstory.

Preckwinkle spoke Monday night at a forum moderated by Sun-Times columnist Laura Washington at Yoshi s.  Ex-top cop Garry McCarthy secured his spot on the ballot Monday when Paul Vallas dropped a challenge to his petition signatures, saying it would be  cumbersome and expensive  to follow through. Sun-Times  Alexandra Arriaga reports. Story here  Mayoral candidate Ja Mal Green is likely off the ballot. Records show he has 11,639 valid signatures. That s 861 fewer than the required 12,500. Green had been challenged by Willie Wilson, who lamented that there were so many other black candidates in the race.  They need to get out of the way,  Wilson said recently.  Petition-challenge craziness: Michael Dorf, the election lawyer for Lori Lightfoot, was surprised to learn his signature was among those challenged by Toni Preckwinkle in her bid to push Lightfoot off the ballot. Dorf is among 32,000 residents who signed Lightfoot s petition. He s also a guru in how this petition challenge process works. Dorf was the election lawyer for Barack Obama from the time Obama ran for Congress in 1999 through Obama s election to the U.S. Senate in 2004. Along with Lightfoot, Dorf represents David Krupa in his petition drama (see above).  Congressman Mike Quigley (IL-05) is endorsing Ameya Pawar for treasurer.

I never denied that,  Johnson said.  From day one, I have acknowledged that there s racism on the police department. From day one, I have acknowledged that there s misconduct. From day one, I have also said that s a small minority of police officers. The majority of these men and women are doing the right thing for the right reasons.

Asked if there was a Chicago politico who might have influenced him, Papadopoulos said in an email he was an  impressionable university student  who voted for Barack Obama for president in 2008. I liked his platform of  change,  especially after becoming increasingly against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But I never witnessed any real change and that is why I voted for (Mitt) Romney the second time,  wrote Papadopoulos wrote.Papadopoulos grew up in suburban Lincolnwood and attended Niles West High School and DePaul University. After his sentencing, he returned to Chicago and was spotted in the Lincoln Square neighborhood, where he owns a home with his mom and a brother.

Rauner to Michigan: We ll take your carp money but decide how to spend it, by State Journal-Register s Doug Finke: Gov. Bruce Rauner, in a letter to Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, said he does  not believe it is appropriate   especially given our lame duck status   for us to accept funds and bind Illinois to a project that is not final and whose true costs are years from being calculated.

Beto O Rourke both run for president, it could leave one of the state s rising stars caught in the middle when 2020 rolls around. Story Continued BelowRep. Joe Kennedy III is close to both potential candidates, who are among the leaders in early polls. On one hand, Warren was Kennedy s first-ever professor at Harvard Law School. They share a home state. And Kennedy in 2016 said she d make a great vice president. But O Rourke is a fellow member of the House class of 2012, which is where Kennedy bonded with him. When O Rourke launched his longshot bid against Sen. Ted Cruz six years later, Kennedy stumped for O Rourke in Texas. The pair swapped stories while driving to McAllen with their wives on Facebook live.So in the (increasingly likely) event that both Warren and O Rourke run, who would Kennedy back? Before an event at the Kennedy Institute last night, where he spoke about bipartisanship in Congress with several fellow lawmakers, I asked him. I love them all,  Kennedy told me. When asked what kind of Democrat should run in 2020, here s what Kennedy said:  All of them, and everybody is. I think you re going to see a lot of folks who are interested in making that case, and I would encourage all of them to do so. The Democratic party needs it. As for rumors of his own presidential run, Kennedy laughed and said  no. Candidates aside, the congressman said the coming presidential contest is going to be a  question about policy.   It is going to be a question about which candidate has the policies that are going to address the concerns of the American public,  Kennedy told me.  It is also about persona, it is also about credibility, it is about inspiring the American public to take ownership of the challenges we face and to do their part and our government to do so, too.

The Progressive Caucus, which will once again be chaired by Sen. Jamie Eldridge in the next session, will grow its membership from 14 to 18 come January, even as it loses one of its members, Sen.

Jerry McDermott, a Westwood resident who currently serves as chief of staff in the state agency responsible for managing state buildings, will take over Dec. 24 and serve until 2020, when voters can make their pick in a special election to fill the final two years of former sheriff Michael G. Bellotti s six-year term. ñ  BARRETT NOT FEELING URGENCY OVER GAS SAFETY BILL,  by Matt Murphy, State House News Service:  Natural gas industry executives and others told a key committee last week that they support Gov. Charlie Baker s bill to require stricter oversight of dangerous natural gas work, but the Energy Committee co-chair Sen. Michael Barrett said Monday that passage of the bill before the end of the year is  not mission critical  to safety. Barrett, a Lexington Democrat and co-chair of the Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, said that after hearing the testimony last week he s confident that the extra oversight proposed by Baker would not have prevented the Merrimack Valley gas disaster. ñ  A new report outlines what needs to happen next at Steamship Authority,  by Matt Rocheleau, Boston Globe:  The Steamship Authority is excessively cheap, lacks accountability, and is rife with internal factions working at odds with each other, according to a scathing new report from outside consultants tasked with dissecting problems at the agency that led to a series of high-profile boat breakdowns this year. The 140-page report, released Monday morning, cautioned that the agency was lucky it didn t have more frequent and severe problems before this year and warned that if it fails to address the issues, it could experience  a repeat of the spate of incidents that instigated this study, or worse.  ñ  Before announcing shutdown, Newbury College recruited students from defunct Mount Ida,  by Laura Krantz, Boston Globe:  When Mount Ida College announced last spring that it was shutting down, Newbury College in Brookline encouraged students to transfer to Newbury, assuring at least one anxious family that the college was in no financial peril itself. Now Newbury is set to close too   leaving students devastated, none more than those who had recently arrived from Mount Ida and now feel twice betrayed. ñ  Boston mayor doubles down on support for immigrants amid plea from ICE,  by Brooks Sutherland, Boston Herald:  Mayor Martin J.

Boston s diversity only makes our city stronger and I will never stop fighting for our immigrant community,  Walsh said Monday in a statement to the Herald.  A safe city is our first priority, and we will keep working to ensure all residents are safe in their communities.  ñ  New coalition will push for more education funding in Massachusetts,  by Shira Schoenberg, Springfield Republican:  The coalition, which is planning a Tuesday event at the Statehouse, will be asking for more funding of both the K-12 system and public colleges and universities this year. This campaign will be called Fund our Future. A 2015 report found that Massachusetts is significantly underfunding its public schools by not accurately accounting for the costs of special education and employee health benefits, among other things. ñ  Mass.  not immune  to ripple effect of health care law ruling,  by Priyanka Dayal McCluskey, Boston Globe: A Texas judge s ruling late last week to throw out the Affordable Care Act could have far-reaching consequences, threatening health coverage for millions and insurance markets nationwide   even in Massachusetts, which has its own universal health care law. The Massachusetts law, which went into effect more than a decade ago, has bipartisan support and was the model for the sweeping federal health care overhaul approved under President Obama in 2010. But Massachusetts relies on billions of dollars in federal funding every year to provide coverage to lower-income residents, and the state s health care system is deeply entwined with the federal system. ñ  Number of homeless people in Mass. is up 14 percent,  by Cynthia Fernandez, Boston Globe:  Homelessness in Massachusetts increased by 14 percent this year, according to a federal report released Monday, and local advocates said the data highlight the need to quickly build more housing for the most vulnerable. Nationally, there was a 0.3 percent increase in homelessness, caused partly by hurricanes, wildfires, and other natural events, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. In Massachusetts, overall homelessness has increased by 38 percent in the past decade, even as cities and towns take steps to address the problem. ñ  Amid Record Rise In Teen Vaping, Mass.

The report shows us is that there is a sharp increase in the prevalence of nicotine vaping among our young people,  says Dr. Monica Bharel, commissioner of the state Department of Public Health.  E-cigarette use by youth and young adults is really a public health epidemic right now.  ñ  Warren bill would get feds into generic drug manufacturing,  by Alex Thompson and Sarah Karlin-Smith, POLITICO:  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a likely 2020 presidential candidate, will release a bill on Tuesday that would effectively create a government-run pharmaceutical manufacturer to mass-produce generic drugs and bring down prices, several sources in her office told POLITICO on Monday in an exclusive preview of the legislation. ñ  Sen.

Cory Gardner, the Colorado Republican co-sponsoring the bill, says it could. And he s trying to make it happen this week. ñ  18 states, including Mass., file motion challenging ruling striking down Affordable Care Act,  by Jackson Cote, Boston Globe: Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey and her counterparts in 17 other states filed a motion Monday challenging a Texas federal judge s ruling last week that struck down the Affordable Care Act. The motion, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, asks the court to clarify the impact of the ruling and confirm that the ACA  is still the law of the land,  Healey s office said in a statement. ñ  Citing police corruption, Suffolk DA drops prosecution of Sean Ellis in 1993 murder of Boston detective,  by Gintautas Dumcius, MassLive.com:  Reversing course on a bid for a new trial, the Suffolk District Attorney s Office said they re ending the prosecution of Sean Ellis in a case involving the armed robbery and first-degree murder of a Boston police detective. The Supreme Judicial Court, the state s highest court, in 2016 affirmed a judge s order for a new trial against Ellis, who had been convicted of murdering Boston Police Detective John Mulligan during a 1993 armed robbery.  ñ  HOUSE FLIP WILL UNBOTTLE CLIMATE AGENDA, MARKEY SAYS,  by Katie Lannan, State House News Service:  A Democratic majority in the U.S. House in January will mark the  dawn of a new era  in fighting climate change, according to U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, who on Monday ticked off his own energy and environmental policy to-do list for the coming year. Markey held a morning meeting at his Boston office with representatives of more than 20 environmental groups to discuss priorities for the new Congress. ñ  Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts  1st black congresswoman-elect, says she will get Shirley Chisholm s old Capitol Hill office,  by Shannon Young, Springfield Republican:  Ayanna Pressley, the first black woman elected to represent Massachusetts in Washington, announced Monday that she will move into the Capitol Hill office once held by Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to ever be elected to Congress. Pressley, who will officially join the 116th Congress in January, said she s  humbled to occupy the same space (Chisholm) did on Capitol Hill.  ñ  US Rep. Richard Neal pledges to take  immediate action  to protect ACA in wake of court ruling,  by Shannon Young, Springfield Republican:  U.S. Rep. Richard Neal, a Springfield Democrat who is expected to lead the House Ways and Means Committee, pledged to take  immediate action  when the Congress convenes in January to protect the Affordable Care Act and appeal a recent federal court ruling, which struck down the controversial health care law. ñ  Seth Moulton says he does not plan to run for Senate in next election,  by James Pindell, Boston Globe:  It has been a rocky several weeks for Representative Seth Moulton after he organized a largely unsuccessful effort to prevent Nancy Pelosi from becoming House speaker. So what s next for the Salem Democrat: Will he be forced to fend off a primary challenge? Can he mend ties with Pelosi and be a player in the next Congress? Will he look at a run for president? One thing he is not doing is running for the Senate in 2020, he said. In a Friday interview with the Globe, Moulton smothered speculation he was mounting a Democratic primary challenge to Senator Edward J. Markey. ñ  Moulton Calls For Homeland Security Secretary s Resignation Over Migrant Child s Death,  by Antonio Caban, WGBH News:  Rep. Seth Moulton slammed Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen and called for her to resign during a Monday interview on Greater Boston, blaming her for the death of a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who died in the custody of U.S. Border Patrol.  It s very clear that this president and his secretary of homeland security have set a tone where it s okay to just let a girl like that die,  Moulton said.ñ  Easthampton and Wareham marijuana retail stores get opening dates after Wareham shop  jumped the gun,   by Gintautas Dumcius, MassLive.com:  The fourth and fifth retail marijuana shops in Massachusetts have been authorized to open as soon as Friday by the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission. I.N.S.A., Inc. in Easthampton and Verilife in Wareham received their final opening approvals on Monday and may open their doors after the commission s standard three business-day waiting period. ñ  Communities not all keen on cannabis crowds,  by Mary Markos, Boston Herald:  From blocked driveways and traffic, to public urination and even a possible case of child neglect, Northampton and Leicester have become familiar with the nuisances of rolling out recreational pot over the past few weeks. A 10-year-old child was left in a car last week while an adult took a shuttle to Cultivate, the recreational marijuana store in Leicester, to buy pot, according to Police Chief James Hurley. The child was left in a parking lot about a quarter mile away from the facility, the chief said, which Cultivate rented to provide additional parking after residents complained of a half-mile long traffic jam. ñ  Niki Tsongas s second act comes to a close,  by Joan Vennochi, Boston Globe:  When she won election in 2007, Niki Tsongas was the first woman in 25 years to represent Massachusetts in Congress. But the bigger news was how she was claiming the seat once held by her late husband, US Senator Paul Tsongas. Over the next 11 years, Niki Tsongas staked out her own turf   most notably, a crusade against sexual assault in the military. Now, as she retires from Congress, her tenure showcases the value of hard work and commitment to common ground. But it s also the story of a woman who launched and managed her own second act. ñ  Poll: Klobuchar rising in Iowa,  by Natasha Korecki, POLITICO:  Former Vice President Joe Biden led the field with 30 percent saying he was their top pick for president, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders with 13 percent and Texas Rep. Beto O Rourke, who captured 11 percent. But Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren   the Massachusetts senator who placed just below Klobuchar with 9 percent   saw their numbers slide among potential Democratic Iowa caucus-goers since September, according to a new Focus on Rural America poll released Monday and first obtained by POLITICO.   Herald:  SAVE OUR SCHOOL!    Globe:  Meet the suddenly ordinary Pats,   Report slams ferry authority over mishaps,   Exclamation inflation.  ñ  UMASS CHAIR SOUNDS ALARM OVER HIGHER ED S  GRADUATION RATE CRISIS,  by Nicole DeFeudis, State House News Service:  While not on the agenda, student debt and graduation rates emerged as focuses of last week s University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees meeting where students offered an olive branch to trustees in a plea to freeze rising tuition rates. The conversation, which began at a trustees meeting, continued on campus into the afternoon when nine UMass Amherst Center for Education Policy and Advocacy students marched a wooden box with more olive branches and student testimonials to new legislators attending training events with Beacon Hill leaders. ñ  Everett schools superintendent placed on leave amid sexual harassment probe,  by Danny McDonald, Boston Globe:  The longtime superintendent of the Everett public schools has been placed on paid administrative leave amid allegations of sexual harassment, a city official said. The Everett School Committee voted Monday to place Frederick F. Foresteire on leave, according to Tom Philbin, the city s communications director. The committee also voted to allocate $50,000 to investigate the allegations against him, Philbin said.

                        government shutdown
                        Senate Republicans want to avoid a shutdown over Trump s border wall, but they re waiting on the president to provide a plan.
                    By BURGESS EVERETT, JOHN BRESNAHAN and SARAH FERRIS12/17/2018 04:47 PM EST
                    Updated 12/17/2018 07:05 PM ESTSenate Republicans are searching for a way out of the impending partial government shutdown. But they are waiting for President Donald Trump to weigh in before making a move, and he appears to be in no rush to help them out. Roughly one-fourth of the federal government is scheduled to shutter on Friday without action, and Democrats and Trump continue to spar over his border wall. With the House out of town until Wednesday, all eyes are on the Senate GOP majority and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who hates shutdowns.Story Continued Below But as of Monday night, McConnell and Senate Republicans don t have any plan. What Trump s intentions are as to a potential shutdown apparently are as opaque to them as they are to anyone else. Senior Republicans suggested the shutdown deadline may have to come closer before either side is willing to make a deal.   If there s a plan, I think at the moment it s the president and the Democrats trying to figure out what they can agree upon,  said Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune of South Dakota following a leadership meeting in McConnell s office. This is going to have to build for a few days here before there s a solution out there,  he added.  We re talking about how to resolve our dilemma, which is what we all need to do,  said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.).  We don t know  what the president wants.A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Shelby met privately with McConnell earlier Monday afternoon and has been trying to steer the GOP away from a shutdown. One option that s been discussed has been a two-week continuing resolution to kick the fight into January; another is a massive  omnibus  spending bill with funding for seven federal agencies, including a boost to border security spending, according to sources tracking the spending fight. No final decisions by the White House have been made, according to multiple sources.A former White House official who spoke with Trump Friday said the president is relishing in the fact that Republicans are awaiting his signal and letting him set the terms.Trump wants to  maximize drama,  per another Republican close to the White House. Senate Democrats have effective veto power over any deal between Republicans and the president under the Senate s 60-vote threshold. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he s heard nothing from the White House since offering flat spending levels on border security to Trump last Tuesday.  We don t even know what their parameters or plans are. We ve asked them, we ve sent them two things, they haven t answered us. They ve sent us nothing,  Schumer said on Monday.  They don t seem to know where the president is at.  That likely leaves it to McConnell, who talks to Trump on a near-daily basis. Senate Republicans would prefer not to pass a stopgap bill but acknowledged on Monday it was possible. That would likely result in House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) passing a long-term spending bill in January and denying Trump the $5 billion in wall funding he s demanding.  Failing everything else, I admit that s a possibility. But that s not the first, second or third choice,  said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) of a short-term bill. He added that the Senate could start passing spending legislation before the House, though it would require more procedural hoops. Trump surprised Republicans last week when he vowed to  own  any government shutdown if Democrats don t relent in the border wall fight.
                    Congress
                    By BURGESS EVERETTOver the weekend, Trump heard from multiple GOP senators who privately urged him to consider another two-week extension, according to a White House official. Trump, though, hasn t told anyone what he wants to do.House Republicans are also confused by the state of play. They had believed that McConnell would file a compromise funding bill with $1.6 billion for fencing on Monday, but that didn t happen either.A GOP senator involved in the leadership talks suggested a possible solution that includes Congress passing a continuing resolution with more border security funding than what Democrats want, but less than what Trump has sought followed by the president redirecting other funds to use on the border wall.But even that would take coordination between Trump and GOP leaders on the Hill, and that hasn t happened yet. [McConnell] said,  I don t have any information.  We re waiting for them,  the Republican senator said following Monday s GOP leadership meeting.A second Republican senator said the only thing the GOP has decided is it doesn t want a shutdown. Republicans are entertaining options from a two-week stopgap funding bill to a full-year continuing resolution for any unfunded portions of the federal government that would stretch through Sept. 30. Yet Republicans are unsure whether Trump would sign any proposal.
                    Congress
                    By DARREN SAMUELSOHN and KYLE CHENEYCornyn said a government shutdown over the holidays for 25 percent of the government might seem small, but it would still be poor governing. I don t think most people will see it or feel it. But it would eliminate critical functions of Homeland Security and elsewhere which would hurt public safety,  he said.Congress has already approved two stopgap spending bills since September. But Trump is reluctant to punt any funding decisions beyond this week because he prefers to boost his leverage just ahead of the Christmas holiday, the official said.Senate Republicans, however, are seeking to avoid a dramatic year-end shutdown after one of their most productive years for appropriations in more than a decade.Three-quarters of federal spending went out the door on time this year, including funding for the Pentagon. A potential funding lapse would affect only about a dozen agencies out of hundreds   which some conservatives say gives Trump extra incentive to force a shutdown in the final days of a GOP-dominated Congress.Schumer said last week that Democrats would agree to no more than $1.3 billion for border security, the same budget already approved for this year. House GOP leaders insist they stand behind Trump s $5 billion demand, though they have not put a bill on the floor with that figure this year. Gabby Orr and Jake Sherman contributed to this report.

LAMAR ALEXANDER (R-TENN.) will not seek re-election in 2020, he announced on Twitter. Full statement-- ALEXANDER has had quite the career: two-term governor of Tennessee, secretary of Education under George H.W. Bush and, by the end of this term, senator for 18 years. More from Burgess Everett   The Tennessean s story, with 46 photosStory Continued BelowTHE SHUTDOWN   LET S PUT THIS PUZZLE TOGETHER   -- THE WHITE HOUSE had Stephen Miller on CBS   Face the Nation  saying that they would fight for the wall, and seemed OK if the government shut down.-- THE PRESIDENT is dismissing  border security  funds as being insufficient. He tweeted:  Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line. Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control!  This is the centerpiece of the Democratic offer.-- THE HOUSE is out of session until Wednesday evening. Government shuts down on Friday.-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP isn t really interested in a one- or two-week stopgap funding bill, Bloomberg is reporting. BLOOMBERG S JUSTIN SINK and ERIK WASSON:  Trump isn t inclined to support a one- or two-week stopgap spending measure that would avert a partial government shutdown over the holidays, according to a person familiar with White House planning.  BloombergTHE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE WOULD INDICATE Congress is heading for its third shutdown in two years.BUT, BUT, BUT   We keep hearing over and over again on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue that the THE WHITE HOUSE is privately OK with the Senate-negotiated spending bill, which includes money for border security, not a wall. The question is when do they express that publicly? Do they push this until Friday evening, and force Congress in for the weekend? Once a decision is made, Congress can move quickly. THE INVESTIGATIONS -- CAITLIN OPRYSKO:  Flynn business associates charged with illegally lobbying for Turkish government :  Two former business partners of ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn have been charged with failing to register as foreign agents as they covertly lobbied on behalf of Turkey. Bijan Kian, a former partner at Flynn s shuttered lobbying firm, the Flynn Intel Group, is being charged with acting as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy for his work trying to get a Turkish cleric accused of inciting a failed coup in 2016 extradited from the U.S.   A Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin, who allegedly helped bankroll the lobbying, has also been charged with conspiracy and failing to register as a foreign agent, as well as with lying to investigators, but he remains abroad in Turkey.

The announcement added last-minute drama to an already contentious campaign. More important, it also pre-empted scrutiny of the secretary of state s own missteps while initiating a highly unusual criminal investigation into his political rivals. But no evidence supported the allegations against the Democrats at the time, and none has emerged in the six weeks since, the Journal-Constitution found. It appears unlikely that any crime occurred.   That examination suggests Kemp and his aides used his elected office to protect his political campaign from a potentially devastating embarrassment.  AJC2020 WATCH -- HOLLY OTTERBEIN in Philly:  Pennsylvania meltdown triggers Republican alarms :  The enfeebled state party   still reeling after a devastating midterm election where Republicans lost three congressional seats and whiffed gubernatorial and Senate races by double digits   is tangled in a power struggle messy enough to capture the attention of the White House. The chaos threatens the president s chances in a state where there s no room for error.    Top Trump allies are eager to have a strong Trump voice atop the state party in 2020.   But in Pennsylvania, the Trump team sat out the election for state party chairman in 2017   and some state Republicans now fear that was a mistake.  POLITICO-- WSJ S REID EPSTEIN:  California Upends 2020 Democratic Primary Calendar :  When Iowa Democrats hold their February 2020 presidential caucuses, millions of Californians will already have their primary ballots.

You ll be forgiven if the juxtaposition of those two makes you scoff.   In Buttigieg, [Lis] Smith and others see an ideas candidate who is everything Donald Trump isn t. Quiet. Substantive. Thoughtful. He s a progressive Democrat who doesn t shy away from talking about issues like universal basic income.    Over coffee in November, Mike Schmuhl, his first campaign manager, and the guy tasked with managing his federal PAC, outlined a platform that would include planks of democracy, security, and freedom, including voting by mail, and statehood for D.C. and Puerto Rico.   A Buttigieg campaign would also seek to do more than just be a referendum on Trump by outlining benefits to would-be Democratic voters.

NBC S BENJY SARLIN:  Democrats eyeing 2020 presidential bids test simple pitch: Have some money :  A suite of big ticket bills by Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., would directly transfer upward of trillions of dollars in cash directly to Americans. While low-income workers would be the biggest beneficiaries, the proposals would apply to large chunks of the middle class as well.    Cost estimates of their bills are loosely similar in scale to the $1.9 trillion Trump tax cuts, with some larger and some smaller, and they ve all called for at least partially repealing the Republican bill to help finance their ideas.

He also insisted the U.S. wants to reform the global trading system to make it fairer for U.S. citizens and defended America s long role in supporting that system for seven decades, at the World Trade Organization and its predecessors.    Meanwhile, his Chinese counterpart upbraided the U.S. over tariffs and blocking appointments to the World Trade Organization s appeals body. Chinese ambassador Zhang Xiangchen said Trump s tariff increases on steel and aluminum products were  based on dubious national security concerns  and blasted U.S. efforts to put WTO s appeals body  in paralysis.

WSJ FOR YOUR RADAR -- AP S MARTIN CRUTSINGER:  After the Fed s likely rate hike this week, all bets are off :  On Wednesday, the Fed is set to announce its fourth rate hike of the year. But after this week, no one is sure what it will do. Neither, most likely, is the Fed itself.   Many analysts think the Fed will signal Wednesday that it s considering whether to slow or suspend its rate hikes in 2019 to avoid weakening the economy too much. And some predict that the rate increases, which began three years ago, will end altogether next year.  AP TRUMP INC. --  Trump Organization plots return to Dominican Republic, sparking ethics concerns,  by ABC s Matthew Mosk, Kyra Phillips, Alex Hosenball and Kaitlyn Folmer:  [L]ast month, the non-profit group Global Witness sent an undercover investigator to see if they could learn more.   That included undercover recordings that captured a sales agent at the Cap Cana resort describing a Trump-branded condominium development in the works for a new, beachfront location.   The Trump Organization calls the Global Witness report  completely false.     Global Witness and other critics say any move by the Trump Organization to return to the island nation could represent a departure from the president s promise to avoid undertaking fresh overseas developments during his term in office.

The Daily BeastWAR REPORT -- AP S KATHY GANNON in Islamabad:  Pakistan, Saudis, UAE join U.S.-Taliban talks AFTERNOON READ   THE NEW YORKER S BEN TAUB:  Iraq s Post-ISIS Campaign of Revenge :  The Islamic State has been mostly destroyed on the battlefield, but the war is far from over. Air strikes cannot kill an idea, and so it has fallen to Iraq s fractured security, intelligence, and justice systems to try to finish the task. But, insofar as there is a strategy, it seems almost perfectly crafted to bring about the opposite of its intent.  American and Iraqi military officials spent years planning the campaign to rid Iraq of ISIS, as if the absence of the jihadis would automatically lead Iraq toward the bright democratic future that George W. Bush s Administration had envisaged when U.S. forces invaded the country, in 2003. But ISIS has always derived much of its dangerous appeal from the corruption and cruelty of the Iraqi state.   What is at stake, in this post-conflict period, is whether the Iraqi government can win over the segment of the population for whom ISIS seemed a viable alternative.  New Yorker SPOTTED: Sen.

The next Prescription PULSE newsletter will publish on Thursday, Jan. 3. Friday s Obamacare ruling could have some big impacts on the drug industry. Meanwhile, a number of pharma and medical device bills are hoping to squeak through Congress in the waning days of 2018, but first: FDA s shutdown watch. Story Continued BelowSHUTDOWN WATCH: FDA FUNDING IN JEOPARDY   FDA could be headed for a messy end to 2018. The agency s funding, part of the annual agricultural spending bill, runs out Friday along with money for more than a half-dozen other federal agencies. The House and Senate don t yet have a strategy to avert a partial government shutdown   and the House doesn t come back until Wednesday. DÈj‡ vu: We re in the same place we were two weeks ago, when seven spending bills were being held hostage by a Democrats vs. White House dispute over how much to give the Department of Homeland Security for President Donald Trump s border wall. Congress kicked the can down the road with a two-week continuing resolution that expires at midnight Friday. But there s little indication the extra two weeks of negotiating time has led to any breakthroughs   in fact, the dueling parties appeared to have stopped talking, our Congress team reports. When the Housel return Wednesday evening, they will have just 72 hours to reach a deal. Potential options on the table include a continuing resolution through Dec. 26 or Jan. 3. As of Friday, Trump appeared to be leaning toward delaying the fight until early 2019. Another idea is a long-term spending freeze that would leave FDA to operate with 2018 s budget level for the rest of the fiscal year. What goes on at FDA during a shutdown: Much of what the agency does can continue during a funding freeze, either because the work is considered essential to public health or because its funded by industry user fees, not specifically approriated taxpayer dollars . Nearly 60 percent of FDA employees would continue working during a government shutdown. The agency would respond to emergencies, deal with high-risk product recalls and work on criminal enforcement and civil investigations involving imminent threats to human health or life   all of it posted months ago in HHS s fiscal 2019 contingency plans. (Other HHS agencies including NIH and CDC are already funded through a separate spending bill.) FDA also would continue inspecting imported products for health risks, and address drug shortages and outbreaks related to food and infectious diseases. What stops: Some safety activities like routine inspections and compliance and enforcement will come to a halt, as will most non-urgent laboratory research that is necessary to inform public health decisionmaking. Companies with drug or device applications in the pipeline could face some delays despite the reliance on user fees. Some meetings with FDA could be postponed   meaning, for example, delays in clinical trial approvals.Happy Monday and welcome to the last Prescription PULSE of 2018! We re taking a short break for the holidays and will return with a special Thursday edition on Jan. 3. We ll be tracking pharma news during a 10-day break, so keep send tips and your predictions for the drug world in 2019 to Sarah Karlin-Smith (via email or Twitter) Sarah Owermohle (email or Twitter).PHARMA IMPACTS OF THE TEXAS OBAMACARE DECISION   On Friday a federal judge ruled that the entire Affordable Care Act must be struck down. While the Trump administration has said the law will remain in place during the appeals, it s important to remember that the 2010 law is far more than the creation of a new individual marketplace for health insurance or Medicaid expansion. If the whole law goes so would the Biologic Price Competition and Innovation Act, which created a pathway for bringing cheaper versions of expensive biologic medicines to market. The biologics law also gave brand biologics 12 years of marketing exclusivity. Another part of the ACA, a sunshine act provision, created the CMS Open Payments database, which publicly tracks drug industry payments to doctors and hospitals. And without the ACA, we wouldn t have the CMS Innovation Center, which is currently being used by the Trump administration for drug pricing reform the drug industry isn t so fond of. For seniors in Medicare Part D, the ACA closed the coverage gap by requiring drug makers to provide large discounts on medicines while patients are in the so-called  doughnut hole  phase of the benefit. In Medicaid, the ACA raised the amount of rebates drug companies must pay and required that these rebates also be available to Medicaid managed care plans. Obamacare also greatly expanded the 340B dug discount program, which requires drug companies provide steep discount on medicines to certain non-profit hospitals and safety net clinics. Plus the sweeping health reform legislation also ensured prescription drug coverage for many more people in the U.S. as individual and small group health plans must cover drugs as one of 10 essential health benefits. The ACA also made a number of vaccinations available without any patient out-of-pocket costs. LAST MINUTE LEGISLATION?  If the fights over Obamacare and FDA funding aren t enough to track, there are some other last-minute drug and medical device proposals that could squeak through Congress before the year ends   though none look too likely at this point. Here s a list of what we re tracking:1. Over-the-counter drug reform, S. 2315 (115), and reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018, S. 2852 (115), both cleared the House but remain stalled due to a dispute between Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.).2. A House Republican tax bill would postpone Obamacare s medical device tax until 2025. It also would delay two other ACA taxes and repeal a third. Getting the Democratic support in the Senate needed to wrap this up could be difficult.3. A package of Medicaid bills that include new penalties for drugmakers who overcharge the government by improperly classifying their branded products as generics cleared the House easily last week. The IMPROVE Act, H.R. 7217 (115), awaits a potential Senate vote.4. The drug industry is still pushing for lawmakers to partially roll back a February budget deal that put it on the hook for billions in additional Medicare payments. But Democratic opposition plus focus on the border wall drama make it unlikely that pharma will get the hoped-for $4 billion reduction in what it must cover when patients fall into the Medicare Part D coverage gap.CVS-AETNA PREP FOR FINAL FIGHT   The Justice Department and CVS submitted briefs late Friday night making the case for CVS s blockbuster acquisition of Aetna to D.C. District Court Judge Robert Leon. The judge ordered the briefs earlier this month after he said that the pharmacy giant and insurer were treating him as a  rubber stamp  on their $69 billion merger.Background: Leon s role is limited to reviewing whether the Justice Department s condition for approving the merger   requiring that the combining companies divest overlapping Medicare Part D businesses   was sufficient to address anticompetitive concerns. Leon cannot outright reject the deal, but he can conclude that the DOJ solution wasn t sufficient, and order that the companies remain separate. The burden is on the Justice Department to explain its reasoning for the approval, James Tierney, an antitrust attorney with Orrick, told Prescription PULSE.Making the case: DOJ s brief outlined the limits of Leon s role and questioned whether the Tunney Act   the law that gives the court the power to review Justice Department decisions   may itself be unconstitutional. Meanwhile CVS argued in its brief that a hold-separate order would hurt new businesses already being launched by the integrating company, including preventive health and medicine adherence programs. The hearing is set for Tuesday.DIABETIC MEDICARE PATIENTS MOUNT HHS LAWSUIT  Beneficiaries with diabetes who were denied reimbursement for continuous glucose monitors filed a class action lawsuit against HHS Sec. Alex Azar demanding a federal mandate to cover the devices. Though CMS in January 2017 said it would start covering the monitors, its criteria essentially limited reimbursement to just one approved brand and did not retroactively apply to people who already spent thousands of dollars on the monitors, attorney James Pistorino told Prescription PULSE.Pistorino said that between device parts, replacing sensors every week and transmitters every few months, patients spend roughly $3,500 a year. Yet HHS has previously denied claims on the grounds that the monitors   which attach to the skin to track glucose day and night, sometimes reducing the need for finger-prick testing   are not  primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose,  according to the complaint.STEM CELL COMPANY PLANS TO USE RIGHT-TO-TRY   Therapeutic Solutions International said last week it plans to make its adult stem cell treatment available to patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy and traumatic brain injury through the new right-to-try process, which lets patients request access to experimental drugs without FDA oversight.The product, known as the Jadi Cell, is generated from umbilical cords, which are available in large quantities at inexpensive prices, the company said in a statement. The cells have demonstrated safety in animal models with brain injury and pilot human trials for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are no human data for treatment of CTE or TBI, Thomas Ichim, who sits on the company s board of directors told Prescription PULSE.Ichim said the company has established an independent Institutional Review Board to evaluate whether patients should be given the product under right-to-try. The IRB will  make sure that it is a situation where we are not taking advantage of the patient,  that there is some rationale the treatment will help the patient and ensure there are no other options, he explained. Depending on the amount needed, the company will give some right-to-try patients the product for free, while others may be charged so the company can recover costs. One of the primary reasons the company is going with right-to-try over FDA s compassionate use process, Ichim said, is he prefers the liability protection offered to companies under right-to-try versus FDA s pathway. Regenerative medicine companies seem to be the main players gravitating toward right-to-try (at least those discussing it publicly). Among those planning to offer products under the six-month-old law, S. 204 (115), are Pluristem Therapeutics through WideTrial Inc. and Creative Medical Technologies. Meanwhile, Batu Biologics is working on technology that would help it match cancer patients with treatments under right-to-try. BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics had planned to provide its ALS treatment through the law but backtracked due to funding concerns. Oregon regulator recommends drug monitoring overhaul   A state auditor reviewing Oregon s prescription drug monitoring program recommended relaxing data-sharing limits, producing prescriber report cards and requiring prescribers to check the database before writing new opioid prescriptions. All this aims to address a core issue the auditor found: that the PDMP is either barred from or has difficulty sharing relevant prescription data with state licensing boards or law enforcement, our POLITICO e-health colleague Darius Tahir writes. That makes it hard for law enforcement to curb doctor shopping, according to the auditor. Read the full report here.Oklahoma signs a third drug-outcomes contract   The state inked a deal with Johnson & Johnson s Janssen Pharmaceuticals to provide its two schizophrenia drugs, Invega Sustenna and Invega Trinza, to Medicaid beneficiaries in results-based contracts emphasizing early treatment. Oklahoma announced in July it had negotiated a contract for Alkermes  anti-psychotic drug in July   the first deal tied to outcomes that was approved by CMS   and another in September for an antibiotic that treats serious skin infections. Details of the J&J agreement are unclear, but Oklahoma Health Care Authority Pharmacy Director Nancy Nesser said it provides a significant opportunity to curb medical costs.Pharma writing checks for patients  meds   When copay coupons and prepaid cards aren t an option for pricey medicines, drugmakers sometimes resort to a little-known method   writing a loyal patient a check. Direct reimbursements, as they re called, are legal for private insurance plans, reports Kaiser Health News  Sarah Jane Tribble. As insurers and lawmakers push back on copay programs, these direct reimbursement methods   which can be hard to track   could become more common. More here.Suing for clinical trial transparency   A reporter, a physician and a former FDA official have come together to file a complaint against FDA, HHS and NIH alleging that the agencies are inconsistently enforcing a law requiring that clinical trial results be reported on ClinicalTrials.gov. The plaintiffs argue that the agencies chose an arbitrary start date for enforcing the requirement   and even then, only 60.8 percent of trial results get posted, FDA Law Blog explains. There has been criticism of lax ClinicalTrials.gov posting practices in the past, but this may be the first litigation focused on the topic, according to the blog.Big pharma slashing pipelines   Pharmaceutical companies are culling wide-ranging experimental drug portfolios, focusing their energies and ballooning research budgets on select products that they believe are sure bets. The move represents a shift for an industry that used to see large pipelines as a mark of future prosperity   but is now focused on which drugs have a chance to progress through the costliest late-stage trials, writes Bloomberg s John Lauerman and James Paton. GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis are just two drugmakers pulling the plug on dozens of projects. More here.Scientists now questioning CRISPR baby claims   Last month s sharp concern over a Chinese scientist s announcement that he successfully edited human embryos is turning into skepticism from the science community, The Wall Street Journal s Amy Dockser Marcus reports. There s limited data to back He Jiankui s claims and his work has not been independently verified. Meanwhile, it s unclear how the edits affected the twin girls born shortly before he went public   and whether there are unseen effects still to play out.

Bill Anderson, currently CEO of Roche subsidiary Genentech, will succeed him on Jan. 1.Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of The AIDS Institute, and John Wiesman, Washington state s secretary of state, were named co-chairs of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. The council has been vacant since late 2017, when President Trump fired 16 members. The other six had already resigned in protest of administration health care policies.Researchers at the National Academy of Medicine discuss how to expand single-subject trial designs in the era of precision medicine.FDA released draft guidance on building evidence for biomarkers to be used in drug development.FDA issued a final rule codifying changes to the reclassification process for high-risk medical devices.FDA rejected the new drug application for opioid Roxicodone, which developer Mallinckrodt said was designed to be abuse-deterrent.The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force posted a draft research plan on preventing opioid use disorder, the first time that the panel will review related evidence. The focus is on interventions that can prevent initiation or minimize use of opioids. FDA released guidance on data integrity in drug manufacturing. The Institute for Clinical Evaluation and Research will assess the comparative clinical effectiveness and value of treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, including Sarepta s Exondys 51. Amgen and pharmacy benefit manager Magellan Rx Management announced they will work together to identify clinical gaps in difficult-to-treat diseases. Initial projects will focus on improving patient outcomes for osteoporosis and migraine. Could fentanyl be a weapon of mass destruction?   National security experts are concerned that fentanyl could be used as a weapon by terrorists, Anna Edney writes in Bloomberg. It s not just science fiction: in 2002, the drug was used by Russian forces to incapacitate rebels holding hostages in Moscow. The opioid is so potent that an amount equal to a few grains of salt can be deadly   and could cause havoc if released into the air in a closed space, experts say. Or it could be placed on everyday objects that people touch, triggering a dangerous reaction if they then put their fingers in their mouths or rub their eyes.Fentanyl is relatively cheap and easy to make, and poses challenges for first responders because multiple doses of naloxone are often required to reverse an overdose. The U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority has a $4.6 million contract with Opiant Pharmaceuticals to produce a better fentanyl antidote. Read Anna s full story here.

Story Continued BelowThe government inches closer to another shutdown, and anti-abortion clinics are tapping into federal funds. But first: The fallout from Friday s surprise ACA ruling.  OBAMACARE RULING DELIVERS NEW SHOCK TO HEALTH SYSTEM   The Friday night verdict that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional would mean that 20 million Americans could lose coverage, if the shock decision is upheld. Numerous other initiatives, all created under the ACA, also would be imperiled. For instance, the decision would put an end to numerous hospital payment reforms. It would stymie the Trump administration s own drug reform plans. And it landed right before one of the busiest days of ACA open enrollment, too.    The ruling by a Texas district judge was panned by legal experts, who widely expect the Fifth Circuit to knock it down on appeal. (Though many of those same legal experts didn t expect such a sweeping ruling in the lower court...) It s possible the case will never make it to the Supreme Court, where it would face an uphill battle   given that Chief Justice John Roberts specifically found that the ACA could stand even if part of the law was unconstitutional.    And the ruling doesn t have any immediate impact, given that it was a declaratory judgment, and not an injunction to freeze the ACA. The White House said it s not taking any action to halt the law based on the ruling. But in the short-term, the verdict creates a batch of headaches for lawmakers   and raises many questions, such as whether the government will appeal and how quickly. More.    We ve seen it before: ACA uncertainty creates new problems. Hospital CEOs delay investments. Health insurers have to make contingency plans. People say they re not sure if they should sign up for coverage. And lawmakers crafting health care legislation   whether in Congress or in states like Kansas, where the Democratic governor-elect wants Medicaid expansion but Republicans dominate the legislature   now have a new hurdle that could delay or defeat their plans.  ON THE HILL: GOP FEELS THE HEAT   Democrats now get to replay a message that helped them flip  40 House seats: that Republicans remain hellbent on gutting Obamacare and rolling back protections for pre-existing conditions, POLITICO s Adam Cancryn and Paul Demko write. Among Democrats  tactics: House Democratic leaders plan to intervene in the lawsuit as soon as they take control of the chamber next year. More.    Chuck Schumer: We re going to push for Senate vote.  We re going to fight this tooth and nail,  the Senate minority leader said on Sunday on NBC s  Meet the Press,  adding that  the first thing we re going to do when we get back there in the Senate is urge, put a vote on the floor, urging an intervention in the case.  It s not likely that the Senate s GOP leaders would let that vote take place, however. More.   Chuck Grassley: We ll have hearings on  fatally flawed  ACA. The Iowa Republican said Saturday that the Senate Finance Committee would hold hearings in the wake of Friday night s decision.  congress shld figure out better way 2insure Americans at lower cost +better quality,  Grassley wrote in a series of tweets, among the first clues of what the Iowa Republican plans to do when he takes control of the committee in January. More for Pros. Grassley was the ranking member of the committee in 2009 as the ACA was being hammered out.  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION s MIXED MESSAGES    President Donald Trump celebrated the ruling as  Great news for America!  but his health officials and HealthCare.gov quickly tried to tamp down concerns.  There is no impact to current coverage or coverage in a 2019 plan,  CMS administrator Seema Verma tweeted Friday night   a message that was applauded by Democrats and good-government types. Hours later, Verma posted a second statement that copied the president s language, which praised the  highly respected judge  and said the decision  vindicates President Trump s position that Obamacare is unconstitutional.    The CMS innovation center, created by ACA, also moved to reassure providers. The ruling is  still moving through the courts, and the work of the Innovation Center will continue unchanged,  according to an email sent Sunday to participants.  We remain committed to our current and future models as well as our focus on better health outcomes at lower cost.   IT s MONDAY PULSE   Where your author finally picked up this health care classic over the weekend. What books are you reading this holiday season? (More importantly, what books are you giving this year?) Tips on shopping or otherwise to ddiamond@politico.com. PULSE has more on Friday s ACA decision below   but first, here s a quick check on other stories driving the news. ** A message from PhRMA: There are wrong and right prescriptions for changing Medicare. Seniors need Washington to focus on the right ones. Cutting costs for everyone except seniors and limiting access to lifesaving medicines are the wrong prescription for Medicare. Making changes that help seniors pay less out-of-pocket are the right prescription for Medicare. **FAITH-BASED CLINICS PURSUING FEDERAL FUNDS TOO   Anti-abortion family planning clinics are increasingly vying for the same federal funds that go to Planned Parenthood, signaling a major change in federal policy being pushed by the Trump administration, POLITICO s Victoria Colliver reports. This new front in the abortion wars comes as conservatives have largely given up on completely defunding Planned Parenthood, so they re trying to use the rules to their advantage, pushing for faith-driven women s clinics to apply for those same federal funds to push an anti-abortion agenda. More.  THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN WOULD BEGIN FRIDAY   Neither the House nor the Senate have passed a spending bill. The House isn t back until Wednesday.  The president is scheduled to go on a 16-day vacation at Mar-a-Lago on Friday.  CONSERVATIVE COALITION CONSIDERS ACA REPEAL AGAIN   The conservative coalition made up of groups like the Heritage Foundation and Galen Institute that developed their own ACA repeal/replace plan are huddling this week to discuss the Texas verdict and whether it provides a fresh opportunity to push their proposal, POLITICO s Adam Cancryn reports. The so-called Consensus Group plan, which is based on a similar framework as Graham-Cassidy, hasn t gained much traction among lawmakers since it was unveiled last year   though that was in part because Republicans had already decided to move on from health care to other topics  LOOKING CLOSER AT THE ACA COURT DECISION   The bombshell verdict wasn t wholly unexpected, given U.S. District Court Judge Reed O Connor s skepticism about the ACA in oral arguments. O Connor also has emerged as a go-to judge for conservatives, issuing controversial decisions to block the ACA s protections for transgender patients and to strike down a long-established law for Native American adoptions.    But O Connor s legal arguments on ACA don t hold up, experts say.  We were on opposing sides of the 2012 and 2015 Supreme Court challenges to the Affordable Care Act,  Case Western Reserve s Jonathan Adler and Yale s Abbe Gluck write. But  we agree that this decision makes a mockery of the rule of law and basic principles of democracy,  they add, saying the judge is subverting Congress. More. Georgetown s Marty Lederman also says that the focus on O Connor s ruling on severability   namely, that the ACA can t stand without the individual mandate   is ignoring the many other flaws in O Connor s reasoning. More.   Critics also were furious about the timing, given that the Trump administration had asked O Connor to wait until after the ACA s open enrollment period ended early Sunday morning.  ACA SIGN-UPS GET EXTENDED   California s health exchange extended its deadline to buy coverage that starts Jan. 1 through Dec. 21 in response to Friday s ruling.  Open enrollment is full-steam ahead and continues in California and other states for several more weeks,  said Peter Lee, Covered California s executive director.  No one in California should let this ruling discourage them from enrolling in health coverage or be worried about using the health plan they have.    More for Pros.   Connecticut officials on Saturday extended open enrollment one month, through Jan. 15.  We will not let this news get in the way of fulfilling our mission to reduce the rate of the uninsured and help Connecticut residents get health insurance coverage for them and their families,  said James Michel, Access Health CT s CEO. Anti-abortion groups attack Francis Collins  comments on fetal tissue. The NIH director last week defended HHS  controversial review of fetal tissue work but said that the effort was to  assure the skeptics  that current practices are morally and scientifically justified, Science Magazine reported. Fetal tissue  will continue to be the mainstay,  Collins told reporters, even as NIH committed $20 million last week to explore alternatives. That didn t sit well with anti-abortion groups, which have repeatedly targeted the NIH director in recent years. Collins  remarks  put him at odds with HHS and the whole Trump Administration in the audit process and begs the question of whether anything can truly change while he s in charge at NIH,  Marjorie Dannenfelser of Susan B. Anthony List said in a statement.    HHS responds:  As stated in September, we are conducting an internal audit and review of the Department s research, policies and procedures of the use of fetal tissue in research,  a spokesperson told PULSE.  No decision has been made regarding any changes in those policies. Nothing that Dr. Collins said should be seen as pre-judging the outcome of the review.     Up next: Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir and NIH officials are scheduled to lead a day-long review of humanized immune system mouse models on Tuesday, which draw on fetal tissue, Science Magazine reported. The day-long event is closed to press.  CMS: We ve been good stewards of the ACA s imperatives. The agency on Friday afternoon   before Friday night s legal bombshell   responded to criticism of its webpage deletions and other moves, which were detailed in Friday s issue of PULSE.  Under the leadership of Administrator Verma, the Trump Administration has never wavered from its strong commitment to best serve consumers in need of health care coverage,  a spokesperson told PULSE. See the full statement. Some hospital, university parking spaces may be going away. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the parking benefits that hospitals, colleges and other nonprofits offer their employees are now taxable. That s causing headaches for nonprofit administrators and could lead to some of those perks disappearing, POLITICO s Brian Faler writes. More.  Florida: Rubio planning bill that would boost state hospitals. The Florida senator is planning to introduce a bill this week to give Florida hospitals nearly $600 million more in federal dollars that they could use to chip away at their annual $2.7 billion Medicaid hole, POLITICO s Alexandra Glorioso scooped last week. More. Maine: Jeanne Lambrew tapped as next heath commissioner. Lambrew, a Maine native who served as former President Barack Obama s top health adviser, was chosen to run the state s health system under Gov.-elect Janet Mills. More. It s a notable reversal, as Lambrew would take over a job that was long held by Mary Mayhew, who s now a top official at CMS but was formerly health commissioner under GOP Gov. Paul LePage and an opponent of the ACA s Medicaid expansion.  I worked with Jeanne every day,  ex-CMS administrator Andy Slavitt tweeted.  Life is about to get a hell of a lot better for the people in Maine.  By Brianna Ehley  Texas ObamaCare Blunder : The Wall Street Journal s editorial board doesn t agree with Judge O Connor s ruling to invalidate the ACA. More. A newborn baby is the youngest survivor of the deadly Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Associated Press reports. More. Swiss drugmaker Novartis is considering working with the global reinsurance industry to fund expensive drugs, the Financial Times reports. More. Michigan lawmakers are seeking to let police access the state s prescription drug monitoring program to combat the opioid crisis, but patient groups say the move could violate privacy protections, the Lansing State Journal reports. More. Hospitals are bringing in hospitality professionals to make patients more comfortable, the Wall Street Journal reports. More.** A message from PhRMA: There are wrong and right prescriptions for changing Medicare. Seniors need Washington to focus on the right ones. There s a lot of talk in Washington about changing Medicare to reduce costs. But while many proposals would cut costs for governments and insurers, they won t cut costs for seniors; and even worse, they would limit access to the medicines that could save their lives ñ now and in the future. Cutting costs for everyone except seniors and limiting access to medicines are the wrong prescription for Medicare. On the other hand, making changes that help seniors pay less out-of-pocket are the right prescription for Medicare. **

Story Continued Below ZINKE HEADS TOWARD THE EXIT: The long-expected announcement that Secretary Ryan Zinke will depart from the Interior Department at the end of the year now kicks off the guessing game about who will replace the former Montana congressman atop the agency. President Donald Trump announced Zinke s exit in a tweet, of course, and said he d reveal a replacement this week. Already Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), outgoing Rep. Ra˙l Labrador (R-Idaho), outgoing Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and outgoing Republican Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval have been named as potential picks. But people inside and outside the industry said Trump might easily give the job to Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt, Pro s Ben Lefebvre reports.  Keep in mind: Bernhardt, who is a former lobbyist with years of Beltway experience, has already faced a Senate confirmation fight. Any Zinke replacement will face a new Senate Energy Committee, where Sen. Joe Manchin   who previously supported Bernhardt   will lead as ranking Democrat.  A change in Heller? Heller has been in talks with the White House to take over as Interior secretary since losing his reelection bid last month, according to a source close to Heller s office, who adds that Heller thinks the job is his to lose. As with anything in Trump world, getting support from the president s family is key for any Cabinet post. That might bode well for Heller, given Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. both stumped for him in the final week of the midterm campaign. Neither the White House nor Heller s office responded to requests for comment.  Also up in the air: Just how aggressively Democrats   like incoming House Natural Resources Chairman Ra˙l Grijalva, who Zinke recently called a drunk   will probe Zinke after he s gone. Grijalva said in a statement he was  hopeful  Zinke s exit would be a  a genuine turning of the page,  but spokesman Adam Sarvana told ME to expect  oversight of the consequences of many of Secretary Zinke s policy decisions, including the destruction of Utah s national monuments and the many giveaways the Interior Department granted to fossil fuel companies on his watch.  The committee still plans to request testimony and go from there, Sarvana said, adding  it s safe to say that our oversight of his legacy hasn t even started yet.  Other critics, like Sen. Richard Blumenthal, say Zinke shouldn t get to skip out on facing legal reviews of some of his actions.  Investigation must continue of Zinke s illicit effort to sabotage CT tribal casino project,  the Connecticut Democrat tweeted on Sunday, referring to an issue POLITICO first reported in February that has kept the proposed casino project on ice.  Possible criminal culpability must be pursued even after he leaves office.  
                            Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke attends the Congressional Ball in the Grand Foyer of the White House in Washington, Saturday, Dec. 15, 2018. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)Like former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt before him, Zinke in his own statement Saturday maintained that the attacks against him were false, Ben reports.  [A]fter 30 years of public service, I cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations,  he said. Zinke s resignation letter, obtained by the Associated Press, similarly cites that  to some, truth no longer matters,  and lists his official last day as Jan. 2.  WHAT S NEXT FOR ZINKE? Zinke s next step might be the private sector, Ben reports, though he still has an eye on a eventual run for the White House, sources familiar with his thinking said. And adding fuel to the fire, The Washington Post reports Zinke told White House staffers he wanted to have his final public appearance at his office Christmas party Thursday night, where he invited lobbyists and conservative activists.

LABOR PAINS: Democrats  quick embrace of Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez s Select Committee for a Green New Deal has left some in the party worried about reopening old wounds between environmental groups and labor unions, Pro s Zack Colman reports this morning.  It is incumbent on some of us to provide that bridge   and it s also to the advocates at both ends to realize that their individual agendas are not going to be accomplished without each other,  Grijalva said.  Ocasio-Cortez or her allies have reached out to unions including the AFL-CIO, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and United Steelworkers, an activist familiar with the effort told Zack. And various factions have also convened meetings with groups like the Center for American Progress and the Blue Green Alliance. But major unions are taking a wait-and-see approach until more details are filled in of what exactly a Green New Deal would entail. In the past, tension between environmental activists and union members have disrupted Democratic action over issues like the Dakota Access Pipeline, or a ban on fossil fuel contributions to the DNC.  While some unions have backed the Green New Deal, others remain unconvinced that environmentalists understand the reality that union members who work in energy intensive industries face. Case in point: On Tuesday, Laborers International President Terry O Sullivan is scheduled to join the Chamber of Commerce s Karen Harbert to promote a report warning against  the anti-energy  Keep It In the Ground  movement.   PARTIAL SHUTDOWN NEARS: Close to a quarter of the federal government will shut down Friday if lawmakers can t figure out a bipartisan deal, which would include funding for Interior and EPA. The prospects of a potential shutdown land squarely on Trump s shoulders, POLITICO s Eliana Johnson, Burgess Everett and Rachael Bade report, and sources say Trump is still mulling whether to make a counter-offer to Democratic leaders that would prevent the funding lapse and kick the fight over his proposed border wall to next year.  While the specifics of that offer are unclear, Republicans on Capitol Hill are increasingly considering a two-week stop-gap that would fund the government into January, the trio writes. Complicating matters further, lawmakers made clear last week that without a funding deal, there d be no legislative vehicle for reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. PARIS, IN THE BALANCE: After two weeks of tense negotiations during the COP24 summit in coal-reliant Poland, nearly 200 governments agreed late Saturday on a rulebook to implement the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The final deal represents a balancing act between rich nations, emerging countries and poor and vulnerable nations, POLITICO Europe s Kalina Oroschakoff and Paola Tamma report. But it also falls short of the the action that many climate scientists say is required to stave off the worst effects of global warming.  The end result is underwhelming, signaling that not even the last IPCC report on 1.5∞C was enough of a wake up call for some of the biggest polluters on the planet,  said May Boeve, executive director of 350.org.

(AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski)What they agreed on:  Rich nations agreed to put more money on the table to help poorer countries deal with the impact of global warming, and to give developing countries some leeway in meeting the rules on cutting their emissions. In return, developing nations agreed on common reporting requirements to track countries  emissions reduction efforts   something that will apply to all countries,  Kalina and Paola report.  CALIFORNIA CRUISES TO CARBON-FREE BUSES: California became the first state Friday to commit to an all-electric bus fleet, requiring new buses be carbon-free by 2029. The California Air Resources Board voted unanimously in support of the measure, which environmental advocates predict will lead to 100 percent zero-emission buses by 2040 statewide, the Associated Press reports.

We can appropriately package, with our allies, trillions of dollars in economic impact on other countries when they misbehave,  said Sen. Mike Rounds, who sits on the Armed Services Committee.

TIC-ING THE LAST BOX   The Office of Management and Budget late last week finished updating the federal government s core IT policies, quietly rolling out new guidance on how agencies should manage their  trusted internet connections.  The TIC program, which began in 2007 and evolved during the Obama administration, is designed to reduce the number of external, internet-facing access points on an agency s network. DHS, which helps manage the program, says it also helps  provide enhanced monitoring and situational awareness of external network connections.   Obama-era TIC guidance required agencies to route all their internet traffic through a hardware device, but OMB s new policy eliminates that requirement. The document, which is open for public comment, explains what agencies are required to do and how OMB, DHS and the General Services Administration will work with them to do it. The policy directs DHS to  streamline and automate processes to validate agency compliance  with TIC in order to move away from  burdensome, point-in-time spot checks.   Federal Chief Information Officer Suzette Kent recently told POLITICO that the TIC update marked the final phase of OMB s policy overhaul initiative, which also included updates on cloud migration and high-value asset protection. Following the publication of the draft policy late last week, Kent tweeted that the revised guidance  increases flexibility to federal agencies to achieve better cybersecurity outcomes!  YOUR REMINDER OF SHUTDOWN EFFECTS ON CYBER   A government shutdown is looming at week s end, and we ve written repeatedly about what that can do to cybersecurity. To summarize: not usually that much in the short term, given that many vital IT security personnel are protected from furloughs; but in the long term, it s bad for morale and government hiring and retention when agencies are already competing with higher-paying private cybersecurity firms. Earlier this year, the shutdown briefly halted DHS cyber hygiene scans for states, but officials said they wouldn t let that happen again in any future shutdowns.  SCHIFF WANTS THE RECEIPTS   Rep. Adam Schiff reiterated to NBC s  Meet the Press  on Sunday that he wants to obtain President Donald Trump s records with Deutsche Bank because they could show if Russia has some kind of sway over the commander in chief.   Unquestionably the U.S. response to the Russian hacking of our election has been influenced by something,  according to Schiff, the likely incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.  Whether it s been influenced by the president being concerned that his effort to build the Trump Tower deal would come out because the Russians knew about it   or whether it is simply Donald Trump reacting to the question that has been raised about his legitimacy because of the taint over the election   I don t know but we need to find out,  he added.  SOCIAL MEDIA SCRUTINY DIALS UP ON CAPITOL HILL   From our friends at Morning Tech: Top tech firms are facing fresh questions about foreign interference online and privacy lapses amid a round of troubling new revelations. Senate Intelligence leaders are reportedly preparing to unveil two separate reports providing a broad view of Russian disinformation campaigns before and after the 2016 presidential election, according to multiple reports. One report, according to The Washington Post, provides  the most sweeping analysis yet of Russia s disinformation campaign around the 2016 election,  which  found the operation used every major social media platform to deliver words, images and videos tailored to voters  interests to help elect President Trump.   Keeping up with the Kremlin: And that s not all. The committee, according to CNN,  has been advised that social media companies might have provided the  bare minimum  amount of data to aid the panel s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election,  according to research commissioned by Senate Intelligence and carried out by research firm New Knowledge. Google and Facebook, two of the companies mentioned in the reports, did not offer comment. A spokesperson for Twitter, also cited in the reports, said the company has  made significant strides since 2016 to counter manipulation of our service.   Dems  fed up  with Facebook: Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate demanded answers after Facebook disclosed last week that over a thousand third-party apps were given unauthorized access to photos of as many as 6.8 million Facebook users.  I am fed up with Facebook s repeated failures & inability to get its act together,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal tweeted Friday. In the House, Rep. Frank Pallone, who is poised to become chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee in the next Congress, vowed to take  a closer look at this failure, along with the many other issues, in the next Congress.   APP SECURITY   New York has reached settlements with five companies regarding a security vulnerability present on each of their mobile apps, the state s attorney general announced late last week. The companies   Equifax, Western Union, Priceline, Spark Networks and Credit Sesame   will be required to implement security programs to protect customer information.  Businesses that make security promises to their users   especially as it relates to personal information   have a duty to keep those promises,  AG Barbara Underwood said in a statement.  BRAVE, WEIRD NEW WORLD   Memes with hidden instructions to your computer aren t the stuff of dystopian fantasy   they re the newest vector for digital snooping, according to Trend Micro. The security firm recently discovered a Twitter account that posted bizarre memes with computer code steganographically embedded in them. When someone already infected with certain malware viewed the memes, the code sprang into action.   Hidden inside the memes   is the  /print  command, which enables the malware to take screenshots of the infected machine,  Trend Micro said.  The screenshots are sent to a C&C server whose address is obtained through a hard-coded URL on pastebin.com.  One of the memes is a photo of a character from  The Matrix  with the caption  What if I told you / the resources are not real.  In addition to these images and their hidden  print  instruction, Trend Micro discovered that the associated malware supports four other commands, including one to exfiltrate documents from a specified folder.  FROM SEXTORTION TO BOMBS TO ACID   The bomb threat hoax emails demanding payment across the country late last week appear to be the evolution of extortion and sextortion attacks a cybersecurity firm identified in October.  What makes these particular extortion messages unique from other extortion scams we ve monitored is that, previously, the attackers threatened only the individual   the attackers would threaten to expose sensitive data, or even attack the recipient physically, but there was never any threat of harm to a larger group of people, and certainly not the threat of a bomb,  Cisco Talos wrote in a blog post late last week.  It doesn t appear many people paid up, but the emails cost  untold  amounts of money for organizations that shut down out of abundance of caution, Talos wrote. Multiple law enforcement agencies are probing the threats. The campaign has since evolved again, with the emails now threatening to throw acid on the recipients.

But funding for nearly a third of the government, including the Department of Homeland Security, runs out a midnight Friday, unless Congress and the president act. So far, there s no plan.  On Sunday, White House senior adviser Stephen Miller said the Trump administration would  do whatever is necessary  to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, even if it means shutting down the government, reports our colleague Connor O Brien. HASC S BROWN QUESTIONS  UNPRECEDENTED  WALL FUNDING SCHEME: Rep. Anthony Brown, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, is asking the Defense Department to describe the proprieties and impact of using emergency funds or authorities to build a wall on U.S.-Mexico border. Using emergency executive authority, typically reserved for wartime, would be  unprecedented,  the Maryland Democrat writes in a letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, provided to Morning D. Additionally, Brown asks how using military construction funds to help build the wall would impact the military s nearly $10 billion project backlog.

TRUMP TO REVIEW U.S. SOLDIER S CASE IN AN AFGHAN MURDER:  The long and winding case of Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn had all the elements of a story that would seize President Trump s attention. A Green Beret charged by the Army in the killing of a man linked to the Taliban. Thorny questions about America s longstanding entanglement in Afghanistan. And a Fox News program that lauded the officer as a war hero.  And so, on Sunday, Mr. Trump announced on Twitter that he would examine the case of Major Golsteyn, using, verbatim, language aired just minutes before by his favorite program,  Fox & Friends.    At the request of many, I will be reviewing the case of a  U.S. Military hero,  Major Matt Golsteyn, who is charged with murder,  Mr. Trump wrote.  He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas.    In the UAE, the Taliban say they re meeting U.S. officials again today in the latest attempt to bring an end to the war, adds The Associated Press.   END DAYS  NEARING FOR ISIS IN SYRIA:  Fighting against the Islamic State group in its last enclave in eastern Syria  is going very well,  a U.S. official said Saturday as U.S.-backed Syrian fighters battled the extremists on the edge of the largest urban area they still hold,  via the AP.  Spokesman for the U.S.-led Coalition Col. Sean Ryan added that the  end days  of IS in the enclave they hold near Iraq s border are getting closer, however,  they still have the capability for coordinated attacks, and the fight is not over.    Meanwhile, the Trump administration tries to head off a Turkish assault on Kurds in Syria, writes The Washington Post. PORT CITY CEASEFIRE SAID TO START TUESDAY:  A ceasefire agreed between Yemen s warring parties in Hodeidah will begin on Dec. 18, sources from both sides and the United Nations said on Sunday, to try to avert more bloodshed in a port city vital for food and aid supplies,  writes Reuters.  And a U.N. monitoring unit will oversee the cease-fire implementation, adds The Wall Street Journal. KINGDOM REJECTS U.S. SENATE S  INTERFERENCE :  Saudi Arabia issued an unusually strong rebuke of the U.S. Senate on Monday, rejecting a bipartisan resolution that put the blame for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi squarely on the Saudi crown prince and describing it as interference in the kingdom s affairs,  via the AP.

PYONGYANG WARNS U.S. TACTICS  WILL BLOCK  PATH TO DENUCLEARIZATION:  North Korea warned on Sunday that if the United States continued to escalate its sanctions and human rights campaign against the North, that approach could permanently shatter any chance of denuclearizing the country,  via the NYT.  The North Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that if senior State Department and other American officials believed they could force North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons by increasing sanctions    it will block the path to denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula forever   a result desired by no one.   RUSSIA CLAIMS U.S. IGNORES NUCLEAR OUTREACH:  Russia wants to sit down with Pentagon officials for  open and specific  talks on alleged violations of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, the Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday,  via the AP.  Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu sent his counterpart, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis, a proposal for launching a dialogue three days ago, according to a statement Saturday.  But Russia says it hasn t received any official reply from the Pentagon, which spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said proves that the U.S. is unwilling to maintain professional dialogue with Moscow on security issues.   Ukraine asserts a major Russian military buildup on its eastern border, via the NYT.  And Kosovo s parliament votes to create an army, defying Serbia and NATO, reports the NYT. SHANAHAN: MODERNIZATION A TOP PRIORITY IN FY20 BUDGET:  As the Trump administration and Congress deliberate the Defense Department s top-line budget for fiscal 2020, safeguarding the military s weapons programs and funding technology development is taking precedence over growing the force, the Pentagon s No. 2 official said Thursday,  via Defense News.  DOJ WORRIED TRANSGENDER ENLISTMENTS COULD CONTINUE INTO 2020:  The Justice Department is worried that without Supreme Court intervention, an ongoing court battle could allow transgender people to continue joining the military well into 2020, according to a new court filing,  reports the Washington Examiner.  That concern comes as DoD complains about the 1,100 U.S. high schools that ban military recruiters, adds the Washington Examiner. GPS III SATELLITE SET FOR LAUNCH TUESDAY:  After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile,  writes the AP.  But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

                    By CAITLIN OPRYSKO12/17/2018 08:53 AM ESTPresident Donald Trump on Monday predicted that Democrats would work with him in the event that the Affordable Care Act is struck down, echoing promises he s made in the past that have not come to fruition.A federal judge in Texas on Friday ruled that without the individual mandate, which Republicans stripped from the law in its tax overhaul last year, former President Barack Obama s signature legislative achievement violates the Constitution.Story Continued BelowThe controversial ruling, which fell right before the final day for open enrollment for coverage under the law, is expected to swiftly draw appeals that could send the case to the Supreme Court, where some legal experts say it could be overturned.Trump hailed the ruling on Friday as  great news for America  and urged congressional leaders to work together on replacement legislation.He continued on Monday to bash the law   widely referred to as Obamacare   suggesting there is room for compromise between the two parties. The DEDUCTIBLE which comes with ObamaCare is so high that it is practically not even useable! Hurts families badly,  Trump wrote on Twitter.  We have a chance, working with the Democrats, to deliver great HealthCare! A confirming Supreme Court Decision will lead to GREAT HealthCare results for Americans! Republicans have railed against Obamacare since its inception, and furor over the law is credited with sweeping the GOP into power during the Obama administration and fueling a two-week government shutdown in 2013, though public opinion about the law has improved in recent years.Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning   in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

John McCain ripping his colleagues  lack of transparency and ultimately providing the decisive vote to sink the effort in a move that Trump still publicly derides him for. Democrats, who grabbed 40 new seats in this year s midterms in large part by relying on a message of health care, have not shown an appetite for crafting a new law, vowing instead to fight Friday s ruling. Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over the weekend ripped the decision as  absurd,  claiming that it lays bare the  monstrous endgame of the GOP s all-out assault  on protecting coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.She and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have said they plan to call for a vote in the next Congress to intervene in the lawsuit on behalf of the law and urge for the ruling to be overturned.Missing out on the latest scoops?

The House is out today and tomorrow, and Senate Democrats remain opposed to giving the president $5 billion for his border wall.  President Trump should understand -- there are not the votes for the wall, in the House or the Senate,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on NBC s  Meet the Press.   He is not going to get the wall in any form.  Meanwhile, on CBS   Face the Nation,  White House senior adviser Stephen Miller said the administration would  do whatever is necessary to build the border wall. Including shutting down the government?  If it comes to it, absolutely,  Miller said.  The ratcheting up of the rhetoric from both sides suggests that finding even a short-term alternative to prevent some of the government from shutting down on Dec.22, three days before Christmas, is fading,  The Washington Post s Erica Werner, Damian Paletta and Lisa Rein report.  GOP congressional leaders are scrambling to find an alternative that could stave off a shutdown. But White House officials signaled to lawmakers Friday they would probably not support a one- or two-week stopgap measure.

House staffers met with Mueller s office earlier this month to determine which witnesses they could call next year without causing any problems, and progressive Democrats who backed a move to begin impeachment debate last year are practicing patience.  You really stand to lose something if you try to move impeachment before you have everything on the table,  Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said.  We don t have everything on the table yet.  Party leaders, including Pelosi and incoming Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, fear that appearing overeager to use their new levers of power to begin the process of removing President Donald Trump from office could blow back on Democrats and damage their chances to win the White House in 2020,  Darren Samuelsohn and Kyle report.  Pelosi, Nadler and many other Democrats want to see more from Mueller before committing to anything on impeachment -- and they re particularly sensitive about doing anything that would be seen as either undercutting Mueller or making the former FBI director appear to be in league with Democrats.

Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) will introduce legislation requiring background checks on all gun purchases, including private transactions.  Thompson s proposal, like many that House Democrats will pass in the new majority, may end up more as a messaging bill meant to show the American public that they listened to those who marched for action after the February 2018 shooting in Parkland, Florida, as well as proving they won t shy away from talking about gun control ahead of ahead of the ultimate 2020 battle with Trump,  Bres, Heather and Laura BarrÛn-LÛpez note. The bill would go nowhere in the Senate, but passing the House would be considered a victory for the gun-control movement. Thompson said his bill will have bipartisan cosponsors. And incoming House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) intends to move  very quickly  to get the legislation to the floor. Nadler said he would move the bill through his panel in late February or early March, with a floor to follow soon after.  People who are putting this forward, I think they have good intentions,  said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), an NRA ally.  They don t want the wrong people to have guns. But the wrong people are not going to report gun sales.  More: https://politi.co/2CjiFkL GOOD MORNING!

And now he s writing a memoir, tentatively titled  Notes From a Smoke-Filled Room.   I ve never really been interested in doing your typical political-memoir kind of book. And this won t be that kind of book,  Boehner said.

Senate Republican leaders, however, are unlikely to oblige. House Democratic leaders also plan to intervene once they take control of the chamber in January.  Though they don t need to hold a formal vote to direct the House counsel to defend the Affordable Care Act in court, a Democratic leadership aide told POLITICO they will do so in order to hold their GOP colleagues  feet to the fire,  Connor O Brien and Alice Miranda Ollstein report. District Court Judge Reed O Connor on Friday sided with a group of GOP attorneys general who filed a lawsuit against Obamacare, arguing that Congress  vote to repeal its individual mandate as part of its 2017 tax cuts renders the rest of the health care law unable to stand.  A group of Democratic attorneys general defending the law, led by California, say Congress  many failed attempts at repealing the entirety of the ACA show this was never lawmakers  intent,  the two add.  Now, Democratic leaders in the House and Senate hope to force their colleagues to pick a side.

Dean Heller (R-Nev.) is being seriously considered as a potential replacement for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who will leave the administration by the end of the year. The president said he would name Zinke s replacement this week. Heller is interested in the position, and his supporters have encouraged the president to tap him for the post.  Senators have been talking amongst themselves about Heller as a possible replacement for Zinke after the Republican senator lost his re-election bid in November,  The Nevada Independent s Megan Messerly reports.  The outgoing senator is also well liked by many of his colleagues in the Senate, which could make for a smoother confirmation process.

Labrador (R-Idaho), Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) and Rob Bishop (R-Utah), who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee.  Zinke s resignation, which comes after Trump replaced his attorney general and White House chief of staff, could be followed soon by other Cabinet departures,  The Washington Post s Juliet Eilperin, Josh Dawsey and Darryl Fears write.  The positions of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross remain precarious, according to White House officials.

A former congressman who has steered clear of scandal and remained a favorite of the president, he was tapped for the job at a time when Trump will need a politically minded partner who understands Congress,  Eliana Johnson, Rachael, Ben White and Nancy Cook write.  Mulvaney has maintained relationships with influential members on Capitol Hill and may be able to help him deal with the Democratic House takeover in January. Yet congressional Republicans and Democrats question how effective Mulvaney will be as a liaison between the White House and Congress.  Mulvaney, 51, made a name for himself on Capitol Hill in 2013 as a founder of the House Freedom Caucus. He was a perpetual thorn in the side of the Republican leadership, opposing government funding measures, debt limit increases and bipartisan budget agreements,  they explain.  He hounded speakers John Boehner and [Paul] Ryan to shut down the government in order to secure conservative victories, even urging Republican leaders to risk a credit default in order to force Democrats to accept spending cuts. But everything seemed to change for Mulvaney when Trump won.

You can unsubscribe at any time.By  LAURA NAHMIAS,  TERRY GOLWAY and  DANIEL LIPPMAN 12/17/2018 07:19 AM ESTPresented by the Healthcare Education ProjectYou may recall that two New York politicians who were seeking re-election earlier this year pledged, hand on heart (metaphorically, that is), that they would not seek a change of residence while in the middle of their new terms. Well, that s not exactly what Andrew Cuomo and Kirsten Gillibrand said when they were asked if they intended to run for president in 2020. But those were the sentiments. The governor notably told Marcia Kramer during a debate with Cynthia Nixon that he d serve his full four-year term unless he met an unexpected and untimely end. This was interpreted to mean that he really and truly would not run for president in 2020 even though there are some who believe he would like very much to do so. They have believed this for approximately a quarter-century.Similarly, Gillibrand vowed during a debate that she would be content to be a U.S. senator for the next six years, never mind all that speculation about her presidential ambitions.Now, however, with their re-elections achieved and all eyes turning towards 2020, it would appear that they have detected the siren sound of ambition in the air.Over the weekend, Gillibrand said on CNN that she s  definitely thinking  about a presidential campaign.  I m going to think about it over the holidays with my children and my husband, and I will make a decision soon,  she said.But wait? Didn t you already say...As for New York s other coulda been, he s speaking at the New York City Bar Association this morning, and the buzz has it that he will have something to say about another New York governor, Franklin Roosevelt, who never saw any reason to deny his ambitions. Officially, Cuomo s talk is being billed as a preview of his 100-day agenda for his third term. And you know who had the original 100-day agenda, right? Yeah, the last New York governor to make it to the White House.If nothing else, this should demonstrate once and for all the futility of asking politicians if they wish to place limits on their ambitions. Most are like careerists in any line of work, and to demand that they pretend to be demure is to ask them to deny what makes them run in the first place.But if they now feel they have no choice but to heed the siren s call, never mind what they said over the summer, they would do well to consider how that story ends.IT S MONDAY.

If Corey had an approval rating in the City Council,  said City Councilman Ritchie Torres, who also ran for speaker,  I suspect it would be nearly 100 percent. Much of the praise for Johnson comes at the expense of de Blasio.   I think there s a general recognition that there s a leadership void in New York City. And Corey is filling it,  Torres said.  He is a larger-than-life speaker in the midst of a vanishing mayor. De Blasio will reach the term limit of his office at the end of 2021 and already seems to be suffering from final-term fatigue. While he won re-election in a landslide last year, New York City s overwhelmingly Democratic voters just gave their Democratic mayor a lackluster 43 percent approval rating. And The New York Times recently reported that the mayor showed up at City Hall just 10 days a month over the first nine months of this year. By contrast, Johnson seems to everywhere. At City Hall, yes, but also at tree lightings, beach volleyball matches, canvassing days and dance parties. His star is in the ascendant, while de Blasio s is setting. Talk of a Johnson run for mayor in 2021 has already begun, and Johnson isn t ruling it out.  Read it here. AN NYPD INTERNAL AFFAIRS BUREAU REVIEW OF THE ARREST OF JAZMINE HEADLEY IN BROOKLYN LAST WEEK found no wrongdoing on the part of NYPD officers involved or action that would result in discipline or change of status.  The NYPD has conducted a strenuous review of what happened, because the public deserves answers, and we must take every opportunity to continuously strengthen how the NYPD serves the people of New York City,  Police Commissioner James O Neill said in a statement.  This review shows that prior to the incident depicted on public video, NYPD officers are working with the client to de-escalate the situation.  Uniformed NYPD officers can be seen in the footage trying to wrench Headley s 1-year-old son from her arms, at one point lifting the pair off the floor of a city benefits office. An NYPD officer produces a stun gun and waves it indiscriminately in the faces of onlookers. POLITICO s Rosa Goldensohn  New York Times  Ashley Southall and Nikita Stewart: Headley s  arrest highlighted the tension that plays out in public benefit offices throughout the city every day. People seeking benefits are usually under tremendous financial strain and are dealing with an unyielding bureaucracy, and city workers at these offices are under pressure to follow rules, ferret out abuse and keep order. Those strains occasionally boil over into physical confrontations and arrests, officials said, an outcome that can have lifelong consequences for people already struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder. Since January 2017, law enforcement agencies have been called to food-stamp offices across the city 2,212 times and have arrested 97 people, mainly for assault and offenses against public administration, the police said.

The push to give undocumented immigrants access to the same in-state college scholarships and financial aid available to U.S. citizens has been a point of contention between the Assembly and Senate for years. But the Senate s incoming Democratic majority includes a handful of senators-elect who are immigrants themselves, so the dynamic seems bound to change. ... With a 40-23 advantage, Senate Democrats hope to pass the DREAM Act late January or early February, according to sources close to incoming leadership. They will likely name the legislation after the late Sen. Jose Peralta of Queens, who carried the legislation last year but died unexpectedly on Nov. 21. POLITICO s Anna Gronewold UNDERWOOD INVESTIGATES THE MARIO    The New York attorney general s office is investigating why a small number of steel bolts intended for the new Mario M. Cuomo Bridge unexpectedly fractured during the construction process, and whether the state s contractor tried to conceal the problem. State officials said there is no immediate safety issue for the bridge, a $4 billion span that is one of the signature infrastructure projects of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. A spokeswoman for the New York Thruway Authority, which oversees the bridge and its construction, said it had hired independent experts to assess the bolts and that they were deemed safe before the bridge opened.  The New York TImes  Shane GoldmacherDISCOVERY REFORM   Advocates for discovery reform will launch a new coalition on Monday in advance of a renewed push in next year s legislative session. The effort will include a number of groups that are regularly involved in criminal justice reform efforts, such as the Legal Aid Society and Katal Center. But several organizations new to the reform effort have signed on, including District Council 37, Citizen Action of New York, and the New York Hotel Trades Council. Discovery refers to the ability of criminal defendants to know details about the evidence that will be brought against them in advance of a court case. Advocates argue that New York has one of the worst discovery laws in the country, making it harder for defendants to prepare for their day in court. POLITICO s Bill Mahoney CUOMO TOURS L TRAIN    It was a tour de farce! Gov. Cuomo made an early Friday  inspection  of an L-train tunnel that disrupted service, proudly released photos of himself underground   and then came to the same conclusion the MTA has had for years: The looming shutdown will last 15 months.  I m not holding out hope,  Cuomo said, when asked if he thinks the timeline can change.  New Yorkers are willing to bear the expense and the burden of change, and they get that sometimes big projects are required, but they want to make sure that it s really done right and it really has to be done,  he told 1010 Wins. Cuomo announced Monday that he wanted to see for himself if the massive Canarsie Tunnel project really needed to take 15 months and seriously hamper more than 225,000 daily commutes.

The Trump administration s proposed changes for water rules are seen by western New York farmers as a boon, but environmentalists have concerns about long-term implications.TRUMP TENANTS:  They were collateral damage as Donald J. Trump and his siblings dodged inheritance taxes and gained control of their father s fortune: thousands of renters in an empire of unassuming red-brick buildings scattered across Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. Those buildings have been home to generations of strivers, municipal workers and newly arrived immigrants. When their regulated rents started rising more quickly in the 1990s, many tenants had no idea why. Some heard that the Trump family had spent millions on building improvements, but they remained suspicious. As it turned out, a hidden scam lurked behind the mysterious increases. In October, a New York Times investigation into the origins of Mr. Trump s wealth revealed, among its findings, that the future president and his siblings set up a phony business to pad the cost of nearly everything their father, the legendary builder Fred C. Trump, purchased for his buildings. The Trump children split that extra money...Padding the invoices had a secondary benefit for the Trumps, allowing them to inflate rent increases on their father s rent-regulated apartments.

In a blog post Monday, Google said it would lease a large office building at 550 Washington St. in Manhattan s West Village neighborhood and make it the centerpiece of its new 1.7 million-square-foot Hudson Square Campus. Google plans to invest $1 billion in capital improvements to the campus, which will also include two nearby buildings at 315 and 345 Hudson Street.

The Church of the Epiphany   built in 1939 to minister to the nearby hospitals and the only place of prayer on York Avenue   is buying Jan Hus, which sits one block to the east, pastors and lay leaders of both congregations confirmed.   A third venerable local institution   which also has a healing mission, and boasts a far richer endowment   is making the twin transactions possible: Weill Cornell Medicine, which includes a graduate school and a medical school that traces its origins to 1898, is buying Epiphany, the church told worshippers in a Nov. 13  Dear Friends  letter.

The Department of Buildings on Tuesday will begin blocking applications that incorrectly state that apartments are empty or void of rent-stabilized tenants, according to a notice recently posted online and testimony from the agency commissioner at a City Council hearing last week. The city reviews applications filed with the state housing agency before signing off on work permits that sometimes allow substantial renovations which turn rent-restricted buildings into market-rate ones. Tenant advocates believe that by falsely stating that a building is empty, or that the residents are not living in rent-stabilized units, owners have been able to avoid scrutiny from city officials as they upgrade their properties.

That s bad news for NASA, since about 90 percent of its workforce would be furloughed, according to the agency s plan for a shutdown last year. NASA still is evaluating how it would be affected by a lapse of government funding after Dec. 21,  NASA spokesperson Megan Powers said in a statement.  In previous shutdowns, we have maintained personnel to support the International Space Station and its crew, and currently operating space missions, such as satellites, landers, rovers, to ensure they re safe and secure. Story Continued BelowNASA has not released an updated shutdown plan, but the 2017 version called for closing all NASA visitor centers and discontinuing access to NASA TV, along with other public-facing activities. Contractors may continue working on projects that are already funded, as long as they don t need NASA personnel or facilities. A short shutdown over the holidays would likely have little impact. But if the shutdown stretches into 2019 it could delay some major programs, such as the first test of SpaceX s Crew Dragon capsule planned for mid-January, predicted Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.A quick reminder that Congress has already funded the Defense Department for fiscal 2019, so any space missions or acquisition programs at the Pentagon won t be affected by a shutdown.

The GPS III satellite, built by Lockheed Martin, will provide more accurate location information and greater protection from cyber attacks. Officials, however, said it will take several months to get the satellite up and running, so people won t see an immediate difference on their devices.The mission also marks another milestone: SpaceX s first national security mission for the Air Force. But the Defense Department asked the contractor, which sued the Pentagon for the right to compete for launches, not to land and re-use its booster as it does in commercial launches.  The rocket is here to make sure we deliver this capability safely on orbit,  Walter Lauderdale, mission director of the Space and Missiles Systems Center Launch Enterprise Systems Directorate, told reporters Friday.  Fundamentally, we need to remove uncertainty and analyze performance.  He left open the possibility that the booster could be recovered on future GPS missions.Tuesday s launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, which Vice President Mike Pence will be attending, has an 80 percent chance of favorable weather, said Capt. Jason Fontenot of the 45th Weather Squadron, which will oversee the launch. MILESTONE: SpaceX breaks commercial launch record: SpaceX has already launched 20 times so far in 2018, beating the previous record of 18 launches in a year set by Elon Musk s company in 2017, Business Insider reports. Tuesday s launch would bring the number to 21. A LICENSE PLATE FOR SATELLITES: Aboard the Rocket Lab mission that launched Saturday night   the California-based company s first for NASA   was a new technology that will allow operators to identify satellites from the ground, like a license plate helps identify the owner of a car. David Palmer, a scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, developed the Extremely Low Resource Optical Identifier, or ELROI, that emits short bursts of light in a unique pattern that allow it to be tracked and identified from ground stations. It could help with space traffic management in low-Earth orbit, which is already congested and getting more so as companies plan for constellations of hundreds of satellites. The system is the size of a postage stamp and about a quarter inch thick, including the light-emitting beacon, a solar cell to power the light and a battery so it can work at night, Palmer said. The size is critical, since cubesat manufacturers and operators have pushed back against adding tracking technology that would weigh down their small, light and cheap machines. Palmer is waiting for this first test before bringing it to industry, but said a lot of early conversations have been  very positive.   A lot of people want this,  he said. ICYMI: PREPARING FOR SPACE WAR: Pence participated in a space war game on Friday in the White House situation room with leaders from the DoD and intelligence community, a White House official said. While the details of the simulation are classified, it could include scenarios such as a U.S. satellite being hit by a weapon or a cyberattack that knocks it out of commission, affecting military intelligence and emergency communications. As nations are introducing increasingly concerning threats to both government and commercial space systems, our senior leaders need to be prepared to protect our space assets,  the official told us ahead of the exercise.Several top-level defense officials and Cabinet staff were also in the room for the exercise, including Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Paul Selva, U.S. Strategic Command chief Gen. John Hyten, National Reconnaissance Office Director Betty Sapp, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan.TRACKING SANTA FROM SPACE: Analytical Graphics Inc., a space software company, is helping the North American Aerospace Defense Command track Santa on Christmas Eve, a program it has worked on since 1997. This year, the company is providing the software that projects Santa s route onto a globe, which is produced using satellite imagery. It also helps with the video feeds that show Santa flying through cities around the world, said Paul Graziani, the company s CEO. The International Space Station is getting into the holiday spirit, too. Astronaut Anne McClain tweeted a photo of the Elf on the MELF, the Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer, which preserves scientific samples to be returned to Earth.

NEW   SPEAKER PAUL RYAN S office has cut a six-part series about his career-long goal of enacting tax reform. The full video will be released Tuesday. Here is a minute-long trailer   RYAN S farewell address is Wednesday.SPEAKING OF SPEAKERS   ELIANA JOHNSON and JAKE SHERMAN:  It s Boehner s turn: Inside D.C. memoir on the way :  The next big political memoir isn t coming from inside the Trump White House. But it is likely to offer eye-popping tales from inside another important D.C. institution. Former House Speaker John Boehner is at work on a memoir about his time in Washington, which stretched nearly two and a half decades, from 1991 to 2015. Then he was chased out of office by the right flank of his party. The tentative title,  Notes From a Smoke-Filled Room,  suggests that Boehner intends to portray himself as an anachronism, a creature from a bygone era when bipartisan deals were negotiated by party leaders behind closed doors rather than in front of the cameras and on Twitter   and when a politician s habit for enjoying one too many glasses of expensive Merlot was indulged not excoriated.  POLITICOFOUR DAYS TILL SHUTDOWN   NYT S JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS and EMILY COCHRANE on A1:  A Shutdown Looms. Can the G.O.P. Get Lawmakers to Show Up to Vote? :  Just days before a deadline to avert a partial government shutdown, President Trump, Democratic leaders and the Republican-controlled Congress are at a stalemate over the president s treasured border wall. But House Republican leaders are also confronting a more mundane and awkward problem: Their vanquished and retiring members are sick and tired of Washington and don t want to show up anymore to vote. Call it the revenge of the lame ducks. Many lawmakers, relegated to cubicles as incoming members take their offices, have been skipping votes in the weeks since House Republicans were swept from power in the midterm elections, and Republican leaders are unsure whether they will ever return. It is perhaps a fitting end to a Congress that has showcased the untidy politics of the Trump era: Even if the president ultimately embraces a solution that avoids a shutdown, House Republican leaders do not know whether they will have the votes to pass it. The uncertainty does not end there. With funding for parts of the government like the Department of Homeland Security set to lapse at midnight on Friday, Mr. Trump and top Republicans appear to have no definite plan to keep the doors open. It is clear that as Democrats uniformly oppose the president s demand for $5 billion for his border wall, any bill that includes that funding cannot pass the Senate, and might face defeat in the House, too.  NYT-- WHERE THE WHITE HOUSE IS   AP S HOPE YEN:   We re going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,  White House senior adviser Stephen Miller said Sunday. Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said:  If it comes to it, absolutely.   APGood Monday morning. BOMBSHELL REPORT: WAPO S CRAIG TIMBERG and TONY ROMM:  New report on Russian disinformation, prepared for the Senate, shows the operation s scale and sweep :  A report prepared for the Senate that provides the most sweeping analysis yet of Russia s disinformation campaign around the 2016 election found the operation used every major social media platform to deliver words, images and videos tailored to voters  interests to help elect President Trump   and worked even harder to support him while in office. The report, a draft of which was obtained by The Washington Post, is the first to study the millions of posts provided by major technology firms to the Senate Intelligence Committee, led by Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), its chairman, and Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), its ranking Democrat. The bipartisan panel hasn t said whether it endorses the findings. It plans to release it publicly along with another study later this week. The research   by Oxford University s Computational Propaganda Project and Graphika, a network analysis firm   offers new details of how Russians working at the Internet Research Agency, which U.S. officials have charged with criminal offenses for interfering in the 2016 campaign, sliced Americans into key interest groups for targeted messaging. These efforts shifted over time, peaking at key political moments, such as presidential debates or party conventions, the report found.

How could this be? It s not for a lack of meetings, of which there have been 37 in the almost two years since Trump took office, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said on Sunday at the Doha Forum in Qatar. Erekat himself has met with Kushner and others in the Trump administration 33 times, and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has had four summit meetings of his own. But Erekat s last meeting with Kushner took place more than a year ago and it did not go well, according to his account of the situation. In fact, you could fairly describe it as a disaster. Kushner revealed Trump s plan to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, blowing up a long-standing agreement by U.S. presidents to hold back on such a move until the final status of Jerusalem is resolved. It didn t go well from there.  BuzzFeedThe 2020 Election. The New Congress. The Mueller Investigation. Be in the Know.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

With backing from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and key chairmen, Democrats will move to require federal background checks on all gun sales, part of a broader effort by the party to advance long-stalled gun control measures. While the proposal won t get through the Republican-run Senate, much less become law, getting through the House will be a win for the gun-control movement, which has little to cheer about since President Donald Trump was sworn into office.

So, is it important for someone to get there and at least remind people in their Republican primary what Republicans generally speaking have been about for generations?  I think it s important to remind people that we re going through an anomaly right now as it relates to much of the standard Republican focus that s been around for a long time. At the same time a lot of good things are happening, now as a Republican I love the fact that we have so many judges that are being confirmed.

Trump has begun publicly calling the E.U. a  foe,  and promoting the resurgence of nationalism, which Macron and Merkel see as a direct threat. ... Europe has had many fights with American Presidents over the years, but never in the seven decades since the end of the Second World War has it confronted one so openly hostile to its core institutions. Since Trump s election, Europe s leaders have feared that it would come to this, but they have disagreed about how to respond to him. Many hoped to wait Trump out. A few urged confrontation. Others, especially in nations more vulnerable to Russia, urged accommodation.

And they point to a previous campaign   his 2012 run for Congress   as evidence that he can hold his own in an intraparty brawl. Six years before the high-minded Texas Senate run that lifted his national star, O Rourke felled an eight-term incumbent House Democrat, Silvestre Reyes, casting him as ineffectual and unethical in a bruising primary campaign. The race pit O Rourke not only against Reyes, but then-President Barack Obama, who endorsed the sitting congressman, and former President Bill Clinton, who campaigned for Reyes in the West Texas border district.

                        Trump s nominee to run pension agency has a thin resume.
                    By IAN KULLGREN12/17/2018 05:10 AM ESTThe Trump administration, staring down a $54 billion pension crisis, is placing its faith in a man who is a stranger to most of Washington but for one big connection: His brother-in-law is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his sister-in-law is Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.Gordon Hartogensis has little professional paper trail, and has largely just managed his family s sprawling investment portfolio after striking gold in a  90s startup and retiring by the time he was 29. But he is expected to gain Senate confirmation by the end of the year to run the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the troubled government backstop for people whose pension plans have become insolvent.Story Continued BelowHartogensis, 48, who s married to Chao s sister, will oversee an agency with nearly 1,000 employees that manages $100 billion in assets and handed out $5.8 billion to more than 861,000 retirees in 2018. He ll also have to deal with lawmakers as they contemplate a bailout plan that can avert a shortfall of tens of billions of dollars in the corporation s cash reserves. Hartogensis  low public profile and his lack of government and management experience sets him apart from previous occupants of the job, who have typically worked in politics and at federal agencies such as the Treasury Department and the Office of Management and Budget before taking over. The nomination has drawn criticism for that reason.A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Retirees  need and expect leadership and expertise from the director position [and] I don t believe that Mr. Hartogensis has the qualifications necessary to provide that leadership,  said Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who voted against Hartogensis  nomination in the Finance Committee, in a written statement.The in-law connection  may be why they re appointing him, as a family favor,  conceded George Hartogensis, his cousin.  The administration is not known for great people, but   he has a lot of experience in business and he s smart. The cousin, who describes himself as politically liberal, added:  It s like if your family member is a made man in the Mafia. I mean, I m proud of him, but they re still a band of criminals. Exactly how Hartogensis  name surfaced for the job isn t publicly known. President Donald Trump nominated him in May, ousting Tom Reeder, an Obama appointee whose five-year term was not set to expire until October 2020. The White House did not to respond to requests for comment on the decision to replace Reeder.  Hartogensis  supporters note that he s conversant with the investment world, having founded and then sold two tech companies before retiring in 2011. His family connections could prove advantageous as Congress weighs a $3 billion-a-year pension bailout from the Treasury Department, said Joshua Gotbaum, who ran the PBGC before Reeder.Funded entirely through premiums paid by pension funds, the PBGC will be bankrupted if even one of a few very large and insolvent funds, mostly in Rust Belt industries where retirees outnumber employees, goes belly-up. That prospect has lawmakers scrambling to come up with a fix as the corporation faces a $54 billion gap in its reserves.
                    White House 
                    By ELIANA JOHNSON Given this is a guy who has started companies from zilch, I think he has the energy and the smarts to do it,  said Gotbaum, who ran the PBGC from 2010 to 2014.  I don t know what the relationship is between him and his brother-in-law,  he said,  but hopefully it s one that could help. As very wealthy people go, Hartogensis leaves a small footprint. Despite having a Twitter profile, he s never tweeted. The account, formed under his name in 2009, follows a handful of celebrities, including Justin Bieber and Lindsay Lohan, and one politician: Donald Trump. I don t even know much about him, honestly,  said Rachel Greszler, a seasoned pension analyst at The Heritage Foundation.People close to Hartogensis describe him as intelligent but introverted, rarely contributing more than a few words to conversations. He did not respond to numerous requests to be interviewed for this article, and his mother, who lives in a Washington suburb, shooed a reporter off her porch last week. He s a really private guy,  explained his sister, Martine Hartogensis.  He doesn t tend to publicize things very much. Chao did not describe recent qualifications when The Washington Post asked her about Hartogensis shortly after his nomination last spring. She did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Secretary Acosta made the selection and hired him, and I think he s an excellent choice,  Chao said, referring to Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta. Her brother-in-law, she said, was  quite accomplished, he s quite an entrepreneur. He went to Stanford, was valedictorian of his high school class, and he retired before the age of 29 because of his great success. Most of Hartogensis  wealth comes from Petrolsoft, a niche software company that he and two friends started in 1989, when they were still undergraduates at Stanford. The company, which helped oil and gas companies forecast consumer demand, was valued at nearly $60 million when it was purchased by Aspen Technology in 2000, according to news reports at the time.Hartogensis moved to New York after selling Petrolsoft and, in 2004, he started another software company called Auric Technology, state records show, before selling it to a Mexico City-based company in 2011. He s very, very smart,  said Rita Hartogensis, Gordon Hartogensis  aunt by marriage.  He once said he wanted to be the next Bill Gates. The family trust that Hartogensis has been managing since 2011 includes  private equity, venture capital, and real estate assets,  according to his LinkedIn profile. Among the ventures it s invested in are  immunotherapy, artificial intelligence, cryptography, streaming video, financial services, and marketing automation.  Hartogensis has also  acted as an advisor to several angel portfolio companies. Hartogensis  financial disclosure form   nearly 60 pages in total   lists investments in hundreds of businesses, from Amazon to Nike. In a letter to ethics officials, Hartogensis said he would divest from only a dozen companies, a decision that s raised eyebrows among critics.
                    Congress
                    By SARAH FERRIS, BURGESS EVERETT and ANTHONY ADRAGNAOnly two Democratic senators opposed Hartogensis in the Finance Committee, after a confirmation hearing that most of the committee didn t attend, scheduled on the same day that controversial hearings to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court were absorbing all of Washington s attention. Ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said he was impressed by the technical knowledge Hartogensis demonstrated of the PBGC during his confirmation hearing in September   a rare compliment for a Trump appointee. Frankly, that has not always been the case with Trump nominees,  Wyden said ahead of the vote last month.Hartogensis has given brother-in-law McConnell $11,600 in political contributions since 2001, according to a database compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. He s also given $50,000 to the Kentucky GOP since 2007, and occasionally he s donated to Republican Senate candidates in key races.Registered as a Republican in Connecticut, Hartogensis occasionally ventures into liberal circles. In May, one of his daughters was confirmed through an affiliate United Church of Christ, a left-leaning branch of Protestantism that supports abortion. Hartogensis and his wife provided cake to the congregation, according to a church bulletin, though it s unclear whether he is also a member. The church did not return calls seeking comment. He is obviously conservative, but he s not afraid to speak up to do the right thing,  said his sister, Martine Hartogensis.  Whether that aligns with the current political climate, I don t know.

                    Updated 12/16/2018 02:10 PM ESTWhite House senior adviser Stephen Miller on Sunday said the Trump administration would  do whatever is necessary  to build its signature wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, even if it means shutting down the government. We re going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,  Miller, a well-known immigration hard-liner, said in an interview on CBS   Face the Nation. Story Continued BelowAsked by interviewer Margaret Brennan whether that meant forcing a partial government shutdown, Miller replied,  If it comes to it, absolutely. Building a border wall to stop illegal immigration, and making Mexico pay for it, was a signature issue in President Donald Trump s 2016 campaign. Funding the wall is at the epicenter of a battle over funding a slew of federal agencies that will come to a head later this week.Funding for numerous federal agencies, including the Homeland Security Department, runs out after Friday   though the majority of the government, including massive bureaucracies like the Defense Department, Health and Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs, is already fully funded through next fall. Trump has demanded $5 billion for the wall as part of a deal to prevent a shutdown.

                    By ELIANA JOHNSON, BURGESS EVERETT and RACHAEL BADEIn a televised Oval Office meeting last week with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Trump said he d be  proud  to shut down the government over the wallMiller called the dispute  a very fundamental issue.  At stake is the question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country. Whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country.  The Democrat Party has a simple choice, they can either choose to fight for America s working class or to promote illegal immigration,  Miller argued.  You can t do both. Along those same dramatic lines, the president tweeted on the subject of immigration Sunday morning. The Democrats policy of Child Seperation on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now,  Trump tweeted.  Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the Obama years. However, if you don t separate, FAR more people will come. Smugglers use the kids! Missing out on the latest scoops?

Tuesday: Trump will host a roundtable on the Federal Commission on School Safety Report. Wednesday: Trump will have lunch with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.THE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN begins Friday. Neither the House nor the Senate have passed a spending bill. The president is scheduled to go on a 16-day vacation at Mar-a-Lago on Friday.WAPO S ERICA WERNER, DAMIAN PALETTA and LISA REIN:  The White House and a number of federal agencies have started advanced preparations for a partial government shutdown, as President Trump and congressional Democrats appear unlikely to resolve their fight over a border wall before some government funding lapses at week s end. GOP leaders are scrambling to find a short-term alternative that could stave off a shutdown, which would start on Dec. 22 absent a deal. But White House officials signaled to lawmakers Friday that they would probably not support a one- or two-week stopgap measure. Some congressional Republicans support such a  continuing resolution,  but the White House rejection has dramatically increased the odds of a spending lapse.

Now what happens? :  He had a backup plan, too, pitching himself as a potential successor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in the event Mnuchin had been tapped to be Trump s chief of staff. ... The failures of his predecessors and the daunting year ahead did not deter Mulvaney, who, according to several current and former White House officials, has spent several months openly lobbying for the job. Reports that he was uninterested in the job, these people said, were in fact an effort to increase his chances of landing it by playing hard to get. ...  White House aides say he is unlikely to attempt to reform the president s habits of spending much of his time watching television and tweeting, or to curtail the influence of Trump s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, on the policymaking process. ... [S]ome conservatives on the Hill see him as a sellout, a ladder-climber who puts career advancement over principle. ... Mulvaney allies argue that he s done the best he can given the president he serves and advanced conservative priorities where he can.  POLITICO-- NYMAG S OLIVIA NUZZI,  The Impossible Job: How John Kelly Failed to Tame the West Wing :  Mulvaney does have one advantage: He has demonstrated his loyalty to the president since the beginning.  It s cultish. It s Stockholm syndrome,  said one person close to the White House.  There s this thing that s set in of a bunker mentality. There s less infighting because of the bunker mentality.  Nevertheless, as the incoming Democratic Congress prepares to challenge Trump, and various law enforcement investigations draw ever closer to him, it seems unlikely that Mulvaney will be able to do much to change the place. ...  [Kelly] would come into a meeting and say,  You re probably going to leak this,   the first former senior White House official said.  I don t think he ever really understood how it actually worked. It was kind of weird that the people he gravitated towards in terms of becoming his allies were some of the most prolific leakers.   NY MagNEXT UP AT INTERIOR   BEN LEFEBVRE:  Zinke s likely replacement has been  the man behind the curtain  :  Like former EPA chief Scott Pruitt before him, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has an experienced deputy steeped in the world of bureaucratic infighting ready to fill his shoes   one with longstanding ties to the energy industry he now regulates.  Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for the oil, gas and water industries that rely on Interior s decisions, is poised to become acting secretary following President Donald Trump s announcement Saturday that Zinke will leave by the end of the year. And that s already alarming environmentalists, some of whom had said they might prefer to see a distracted, scandal-plagued Zinke stay in the job. Bernhardt, who joined the Trump administration last year, has taken the lead in softening the department s protections for endangered species, a move that will make it easier for oil and gas companies to drill on ecologically sensitive lands.  He knows how to make that agency work and he is why Interior is now considered  best in class  in terms of agency performance,  said Stephen Brown, a lobbyist at RBJ Strategies.

POLITICO-- NYT S SHERYL GAY STOLBERG, ROBERT PEAR and ABBY GOODNOUGH:  The Democrats  first step will be in the courts; aides to Representative Nancy Pelosi, the top House Democrat, said Saturday that House Democrats would move quickly to notify the Trump administration that they intended to intervene in the case. A vote on a resolution to do so is expected in the earliest days of the new Congress.  NYT-- CHUCK TODD spoke with SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER on NBC s  MEET THE PRESS : SCHUMER:  The first thing we re going to do when we get back there in the Senate is urge, put a vote on the floor urging an intervention in the case.   A lot of this depends on Congressional intent, and if a majority of the House, and a majority of the Senate say that this case should be overturned it will have a tremendous effect on the appeal. So our first stop is the courts. We believe this should be overturned. It s an awful, awful decision. -- JAKE TAPPER spoke with SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-MAINE) on CNN S  STATE OF THE UNION : TAPPER:  You heard President Trump call this  a great ruling for our country.  Do you agree?  COLLINS:  I don t. First of all, I would point out that this ruling is not going to affect people who are currently enrolled or in Obamacare policies, so -- or their policies for 2019.  There is widespread support for protecting people with preexisting conditions. There s also widespread opposition to the individual mandate. And here s why. The individual mandate penalties, 80 percent were paid by people -- 80 percent of the people who paid the penalty earned under $50,000 a year. So, this hurt low- and middle-income families who couldn t afford the cost of health insurance. And it s telling that, when the tax bill was on the floor, not a single Democratic senator offered an amendment to strike the repeal of the individual mandate. That s how unpopular it was.I think this will be overturned on appeal.

FOR YOUR RADAR --  World s nations agree on rules to implement Paris climate deal,  by POLITICO Europe s Kalina Oroschakoff and Paola Tamma in Katowice, Poland:  After two weeks of tense negotiations, nearly 200 governments agreed late Saturday on a rulebook to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. The final deal is a careful balance between the interests of rich nations keen on robust transparency and reporting rules to track emissions, emerging countries aiming to protect their economic interests, and poor and vulnerable nations depending on greater financial support to address climate impacts. ... But it falls short of the radical action that many climate scientists say needs to happen to prevent global warming from wreaking havoc on the planet.

Just days before an important Tuesday meeting in D.C. on the future of the data operation, Perez sharply criticized a new proposal from state party leaders and singled out prominent state officials by name. ... The party s data is largely owned by the state parties, but there is a considerable amount of other data being collected by outside groups like labor unions and super PACs that could be leveraged to benefit Democratic candidates and the eventual 2020 nominee. The DNC wants to gather all the data points on voters into a new, massive for-profit database but needs to convince state parties on the idea. The state parties have been wary, accusing the DNC of conducting a power grab that could financially benefit a few elite party figures. ... The executive director of the Alaska Democratic Party, Jay Parmley, emailed a response directly to Perez telling him he was being  petty. ...  I like Tom but I think this was really poor judgment. It read like a letter from an 8th grader,  Parmley told POLITICO.  POLITICOTRUMP INC. --  As the Trumps Dodged Taxes, Their Tenants Paid a Price,  by NYT s Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig:  They were collateral damage as Donald J. Trump and his siblings dodged inheritance taxes and gained control of their father s fortune: thousands of renters in an empire of unassuming red-brick buildings scattered across Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.  Those buildings have been home to generations of strivers, municipal workers and newly arrived immigrants. When their regulated rents started rising more quickly in the 1990s, many tenants had no idea why. Some heard that the Trump family had spent millions on building improvements, but they remained suspicious.  I ve always thought there was something strange going on,  said Jack Leitner, who has lived in the Beach Haven Apartments in Coney Island, Brooklyn, for more than two decades.  But you have to have proof, and it s an uphill battle.  As it turned out, a hidden scam lurked behind the mysterious increases.  In October, a New York Times investigation into the origins of Mr. Trump s wealth revealed, among its findings, that the future president and his siblings set up a phony business to pad the cost of nearly everything their father, the legendary builder Fred C. Trump, purchased for his buildings. The Trump children split that extra money. Padding the invoices had a secondary benefit for the Trumps, allowing them to inflate rent increases on their father s rent-regulated apartments.

                        Mick Mulvaney has angled for months to be Donald Trump s chief of staff. Now what happens?
                    By ELIANA JOHNSON, RACHAEL BADE, BEN WHITE and NANCY COOK12/15/2018 09:18 PM ESTChief of staff to President Donald Trump was seen by many as the job that no one wanted, a thankless post with an impossible mission. But when Trump soured on his former chief, John Kelly, Mick Mulvaney didn t see a quagmire   he saw his next gig.Mulvaney, the president s budget director, who has also moonlighted as the head of a consumer protection agency conservatives hate, had angled for the job for months. He had a backup plan, too, pitching himself as a potential successor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in the event Mnuchin was tapped to be Trump s chief of staff.Story Continued Below He would have given up a very valuable appendage to get that job,  a Republican close to the White House said of Mulvaney s desire to be Trump s chief of staff.Mulvaney has a rÈsumÈ that would appear to make him the man for the moment. A former congressman who has steered clear of scandal and remained a favorite of the president, he was tapped for the job at a time when Trump will need a politically minded partner who understands Congress. Mulvaney has maintained relationships with influential members on Capitol Hill and may be able to help him deal with the Democratic House takeover in January.The position has proved challenging for others, first Reince Priebus, the consummate insider and connected former party chairman, and then John Kelly, the retired Marine general who made futile attempts to impose discipline in the West Wing.
                    White House 
                    By ELIANA JOHNSONThe failures of his predecessors and the daunting year ahead did not deter Mulvaney, who, according to several current and former White House officials, has spent several months openly lobbying for the job. Reports that he was uninterested in the job, these people said, were in fact an effort to increase his chances of landing it by playing hard to get.Mulvaney didn t initially have a natural rapport with Trump   Priebus and House Speaker Paul Ryan, the sort of Republicans against whom Trump had campaigned, and about whom he remains skeptical, pushed him for budget director. But Mulvaney developed a relationship with Trump on the golf course, often staying in Washington over weekends rather than returning to his native South Carolina, to hit the links with Trump at his Virginia country club.Mulvaney has developed a good relationship with the Trump over time   enough so that the president named him acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau when the post became vacant. White House aides say he is unlikely to attempt to reform the president s habits of spending much of his time watching television and tweeting, or to curtail the influence of Trump s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, on the policymaking process. 
                                Instead, Mulvaney is expected to get Trump on the road as much as possible heading into his reelection campaign, capitalizing on the president s love of campaign rallies while trying to sprinkle into the events as much policy talk on taxes and regulation as he can.Despite his experience on Capitol Hill, both Republicans and Democrats questioned how effective Mulvaney would be as a liaison between the White House and his former colleagues.Mulvaney, 51, made a name for himself on Capitol Hill in 2013 as a founder of the House Freedom Caucus. He was a perpetual thorn in the side of the Republican leadership, opposing government funding measures, debt limit increases and bipartisan budget agreements. He hounded speakers John Boehner and Ryan to shut down the government in order to secure conservative victories, even urging Republican leaders to risk a credit default in order to force Democrats to accept spending cuts.But everything seemed to change for Mulvaney when Trump won. While he was always a reluctant Trump supporter   once calling candidate Trump  a terrible human being    Mulvaney saw Trump s victory as an opportunity to rise in Republican ranks and advocate for his positions from a more prominent perch. With few Republicans willing to work in a Trump administration, Mulvaney made an aggressive bid for Office of Management and Budget director, striking an uncharacteristic dÈtente with Ryan just as his Freedom Caucus friends were planning to boot him from the speaker s chair.Ryan recommended Mulvaney to top Trump officials for OMB, giving his candidacy added heft. Mulvaney in turn nominated Ryan to return to the speakership, a conservative endorsement that infuriated the Freedom Caucus.
                    White House
                    By QUINT FORGEYRepublicans sent mixed messages over the weekend about whether they think Mulvaney will be able to tame the president s impulses, keep spending in check and improve the White House s relations with Capitol Hill. The self-described  right-wing nutjob  who helped chase Boehner out of his job has shown over the past two years that he is willing to put his personal ideology aside to secure Trump wins or help other officials advance their agendas. Indeed, some conservatives on the Hill see him as a sellout, a ladder climber who puts career advancement over principle.Mulvaney allies argue that he has done the best he can, given the president he serves, and has advanced conservative priorities where he could. They point in particular to his yearlong stewardship of the the CFPB, where he curtailed funding and imposed a six-month freeze on data collection, the lifeblood of nearly all the organization s operations.No aspect of the bureau, the brainchild of Trump nemesis Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), was too small for Mulvaney s attention. He even required employees to call it the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and rearranged the letters in the agency s front office, insisting he was merely following the statute as he worked to undo years of Democratic branding.But Trump has never pretended to be an ideological conservative interested in reducing the national debt or overhauling entitlements, even though Mulvaney has tried to convince him on the merits. He has taken the shape of the offices he s held, but I think you have to do that when you take an administration job, and he s been a voice for conservative priorities internally. This could ve been much worse for conservatives,  said Yuval Levin, editor of National Affairs, the leading conservative policy journal.  What he always says is, as long as he s comfortable that the president has been presented all the options and all the arguments, then he s comfortable with whatever decision the president makes,  said one person who worked closely with Mulvaney at the budget office.  If a member wants to call him a hypocrite for that, fine, but he s not the president. The former South Carolina congressman will take the reins at a challenging time. The coming year will bring a Democratic takeover of the House, a potentially damaging report from special counsel Robert Mueller, and a plethora of additional investigations into Trump s businesses and practices.Mulvaney s first test comes next week, when Trump will have to decide whether to shutter the government to get the funding he wants for his border wall with Mexico. Hill conservatives, including Freedom Caucus leaders Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Mulvaney s old Hill pals, have urged Trump to embrace the fight. But while Mulvaney used to cheerlead shutdown showdowns as well, he was already urging Trump to kick the deadline into January. 
                    White House
                    By BEN LEFEBVREJordan praised Mulvaney s promotion in an interview Saturday, calling the move an  ideal selection  for conservatives. I think he s a great pick   and, oh, by the way, he happens to be one of the founding members of the Freedom Caucus. ... He also happens to be conservative.   I think that s good for the country and good for the president. Mulvaney s history as a member of the Trump administration is, in part, why some conservatives may be worried. On his watch, the budget deficit grew by $113 billion in fiscal year 2018 due to the Republican tax bill and increased federal spending on defense, Medicaid and Social Security, which Trump has refused to cut.Some, however, are pleased to see Mulvaney has displayed a willingness to compromise. And he has quietly maintained tight relationships with top Republicans such as Kevin McCarthy, the incoming House minority leader; Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina; outgoing Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and Sen. Tim Scott, also of South Carolina.
                            Mick Mulvaney is seen in Congress in 2016.  Everyone respects him,  Rep. Richard Hudson said.  Some members didn t appreciate the way he handled himself in the House, but I think most members liked him.  | Alex Brandon/AP Photo Personally, I think it s a great choice. He ll do a great job for the president,  said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), a former foe. Mulvaney is  incredibly smart  and  full of great strategic advice. Yet like other GOP lawmakers, Hudson described Mulvaney s relationships on the Hill as  a mixed bag.  Everyone respects him,  Hudson said.  Some members didn t appreciate the way he handled himself in the House, but I think most members liked him. Hill Republicans hope Mulvaney will be the voice of fiscal restraint in Trump s ear when House Democrats are dangling a massive infrastructure bill before his nose next Congress. Trump campaigned on a promise to rebuild the nation s roads and bridges. And Republicans want Mulvaney to remind the president of the more than $20 trillion national debt when Democrats offer to back an expensive infrastructure package next year.Democrats, however, are blasting Mulvaney s promotion, pointing to it as sign that Trump won t work across the aisle. President Trump s choice of Mick Mulvaney as acting Chief of Staff is a deeply troubling indication that he is choosing confrontation over compromise,  said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) in a Saturday statement, noting Mulvaney s previous support for government shutdowns.Mulvaney has been involved in the biggest Capitol Hill fights of Trump s presidency, from the failed attempt to repeal Obamacare to the successful tax overhaul and, now, budget negotiations that may lead to a partial government shutdown next Friday.As those events have unfolded, he has done two things that have helped him endear himself to the president. He has avoided the sorts of scandals that have felled several of his colleagues, including former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who told the president on Friday that he plans to leave the administration at the end of the year.Secondly, if Mulvaney was considered a showboat in Congress, he has kept a lower profile since joining the Trump administration, going out of his way to avoid attention as he twisted arms of his former GOP colleagues to win their votes, people close to him say. When he made visits to the Capitol, he has opted to take back hallways instead of marching through the Rotunda in front of the cameras.This spring, Mulvaney quietly helped persuade House Republicans to dramatically increase their budget for Trump s border wall   coming up with the $5 billion figure that s at the center of next week s potential shutdown fight. The House spending panel in charge of Homeland Security was planning to include just $1.6 billion for the wall, which matched Trump s initial request. But Mulvaney knew that Trump wanted more, and he helped drive the figure up to $5 billion.He has never once talked about that victory publicly.Sarah Ferris, Katy O Donnell, John Bresnahan and Jake Sherman contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                        Senate Democrats are emboldened after the midterm elections and Trump s vow to own any government shutdown.
                    By BURGESS EVERETT12/15/2018 06:53 AM ESTThe midterm election results had barely finished trickling in when Chuck Schumer began preparing for a head-on collision with President Donald Trump over the border wall. The Senate minority leader called his members on the phone and buttonholed them in his office   eager to see where they stood on the president s $5 billion border wall request, according to a person familiar with his interactions.Story Continued Below Several moderate Democrats had previously endorsed or considered supporting the funding, but after the midterms, the whip count was clear. There aren t even close to nine Democrats who would join Republicans to break a filibuster. The bottom line? Mexico isn t paying for the border wall, and neither is Congress   even if there s a Christmastime shutdown.A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.  You can break arms and do things like that, I don t think the votes are here,  said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.). Even ousted Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) said in an interview he wasn t wedded to the $5 billion wall proposal after endorsing it during his reelection campaign. The Democratic unity is already having its desired effect: After digging in on Tuesday in a remarkable back and forth with Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in a televised Oval Office debate, Trump is actively considering ways out of the wall fight to avoid a partial shutdown next Friday. GOP and White House officials have continued the battle, running old clips of Schumer, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton calling for stronger border security. But that footage doesn t reflect today s Senate Democratic Caucus and its rapid shift left even since the midterms, when House Democrats took the majority and Schumer stopped worrying about protecting his most vulnerable red-state incumbents. Simply put, there s now very little incentive for Schumer or anyone in his conference to compromise with Trump, and even past olive branches are now being snapped. Schumer has shifted away from the Senate s bipartisan bill that would provide $1.6 billion in fencing on the border, reasoning that the legislation can t pass the House, where Republicans still rule for two more weeks. Schumer is now offering Trump spending at current levels for border fencing, about $1.3 billion, and nothing more. Trump repeatedly predicted to Pelosi and Schumer that House Republicans could pass a border funding bill, but griped about the Senate. Then he took ownership of any impending shutdown, saying it was worth the border wall fight. The results made Schumer s caucus almost giddy.
                    Congress
                    By ELIANA JOHNSON, BURGESS EVERETT and RACHAEL BADE  They completely handed him his head. He better get used to it because that s what it s going to be like now. He s going to get fact-checked to his face,  said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.).  He s not going to have congressional leaders or Cabinet people around him like bobble heads saying yes to everything.  Schumer has long been respected by Republicans for being a pragmatic deal-maker when he needs to be, the same reputation that has earned him some criticism from the left. But despite outside liberal groups criticizing Schumer for cutting deals with Republicans on judges, his early handling of the border wall fight and allowing West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin to become the top Democrat on the Energy Committee, those complaints have never emanated from within the Democratic Caucus.  In fact, Schumer seems to have a tighter grip than ever. Even Kyrsten Sinema, who won Arizona s Senate race on a platform of opposing Schumer as leader, offered no dissent during the party s leadership elections.  I know of no criticism. No hint of any dissension,  said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). And now that Democrats  electoral fortunes are on the rise, the GOP is beginning to see Schumer as unreasonable.  He s reacting to his caucus. And to their political base which is basically anything Trump wants, they re opposed to,  said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), who works out alongside Schumer in the Senate gym.  He can be, but it doesn t sound so far like he s being pragmatic about this.  Schumer s stance has also made House Republicans, who just lost their majority, less motivated to meet the president s demands. Passing a $5 billion wall funding bill to try to pressure Democrats would just be a messaging exercise at this point, one that would be even less effective than usual given Trump s willingness to embrace blame for a shutdown.  Whether you pass it or not there s no reason to believe that it s going to move in the United States Senate,  said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.).
                    Congress
                    By SARAH FERRIS, BURGESS EVERETT and ANTHONY ADRAGNA Trump has also shown little appetite to make a bipartisan compromise on immigration. He turned down a chance to get $25 billion for his border wall earlier this year after an extensive back and forth with Schumer and other senators. He later lobbied against a bill providing deportation protections for young undocumented immigrants and $25 billion in border wall funding because he wanted cuts to legal immigration as well. That bipartisan bill might get just a handful of votes in today s Senate. And most Democrats say they don t want to negotiate on immigration until the spending bill is finalized.   The position has hardened,  said Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), whose effort attracted the support of 46 of 49 Democratic Caucus members. Today, he says,  I don t know if we d get any.  The border funding question is so touchy that some Democrats have a hard time just giving him border security at current spending levels.  I don t want the perfect to be the enemy of the good. But certainly standing up to this president, who keeps putting forth things that are ridiculous and frankly not good for border security and not good for taxpayers  money, is a very natural place to be for my state,  said Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.). Any filibuster threat from Democrats may have little risk now that Trump has said he would be  proud  to own a potential shutdown. Earlier this year, Senate Democrats blocked a government funding bill and caused a brief shutdown over demands for an immigration debate   a stumble that produced a debate, but no law, and which Trump says Schumer got  killed  over. But this time, even if congressional Republicans try to blame Schumer s caucus for intransigence, the president has already contradicted them live on television.  We were wondering if the president would accept responsibility for this shutdown,  said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).  But what he said publicly at that meeting became a matter of record. James Arkin and Caitlin Emma contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/14/2018 06:47 PM ESTAfter eliminating one contender to be his next White House chief of staff, and being turned down by another, President Donald Trump announced on Friday that Mick Mulvaney, the right-wing congressman who has served as his budget director for the past two years, would take on the role in an acting capacity. The decision does little to remove the uncertainty that has consumed the White House this week, as Trump cast about for someone to replace chief of staff John Kelly, who is leaving his post at the end of the year. Story Continued BelowIt is unclear how long Mulvaney will serve in the role   a senior administration official said there was no time limit, and a source close to Mulvaney confirmed there was no timetable for his exit   and the decision to bring him on in an acting capacity suggests the president may have been running out of options. Six days ago, the president failed to reach an agreement with his first-choice candidate, Nick Ayers, the vice president s chief of staff, when Ayers wouldn t agree to serve in the role for two years. 
                                Without a backup plan, however, the president s bargaining position softened. Though Trump told reporters this week that  over 10  people were vying to be his chief of staff   on Thursday, he indicated the number was five   they have gradually been eliminated or fallen away. The president told North Carolina congressman Mark Meadows on Wednesday that he was too valuable in the House, where Democrats are set to take control in January. Trump s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, had also expressed reservations about his trustworthiness, according to a source familiar with the conversations. The 2020 Election.

Chris Christie took himself out of the running, announcing it was  not the right time for me or for my family to undertake this serious assignment.  Another contender, former Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie, lunched with the president on Friday. For his part, Mulvaney told allies as late as Thursday evening that he wasn t eager to take the job and didn t think he d get it, and he said he expected to learn of the president s decision on Twitter  like everybody else.  While Trump s tweet caught some White House officials off guard, it came after he spent time with Mulvaney Friday afternoon at the White House, where the two had a pre-scheduled meeting to discuss the federal budget. He got picked because the president liked him,  the senior official told reporters.  They get along. Asked about why Trump had applied the  acting  tag, the official simply said:  Because that s what the president wants. In a statement late Friday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said:  Mick Mulvaney will not resign from the Office Of Management and Budget, but will spend all of his time devoted to his role as the acting Chief Of Staff for the President. Russ Vought will handle day to day operations and run OMB. Mulvaney, who was first floated as a candidate for chief of staff over the summer, is a central player in negotiations with Congress to avert a partial government shutdown. If the president cannot reach an agreement with Congress before next Friday, several agencies will close. That was the subject of Mulvaney s meeting with the president on Friday. Shortly after the meeting wrapped, the president said in a series of tweets: 
                    The Friday Cover
                    By MICHAEL GRUNWALD I am pleased to announce that Mick Mulvaney, Director of the Office of Management & Budget, will be named Acting White House Chief of Staff, replacing General John Kelly, who has served our Country with distinction. Mick has done an outstanding job while in the Administration...I look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Later Friday, Trump tweeted:  For the record, there were MANY people who wanted to be the White House Chief of Staff. Mick M will do a GREAT job! The tweets   guaranteed to upend the weekend news cycle   capped a week of headlines about the chaotic chief of staff search that were compounded by a spate of revelations tied to special counsel Robert Mueller s Russia probe. On Wednesday, Michael Cohen, Trump s former personal lawyer and fixer, was sentenced to three years in prison for financial fraud and violating campaign finance laws. Cohen accused the president of directing him to break the law during the election by ordering him to buy the silence of two women alleging affairs with Trump in the hopes of protecting the GOP candidate s presidential bid. Trump has denied the accusation, but the National Enquirer s publisher, which had a hand in the payments, corroborated Cohen s account.Trump has long told associates he wants a chief of staff who is more attuned to politics. Mulvaney, who served three terms in the House before joining the administration, fits that bill, though he remains a controversial figure on Capitol Hill among both Republicans and Democrats. He is among several OMB directors who have gone on to serve as White House chief of staff, including Leon Panetta in the Clinton administration and Josh Bolten in the George W. Bush administration.Russell Vought, OMB deputy director, will take over as Trump s budget chief, a senior official said. Vought has been one of Mulvaney s closest advisers in the administration, along with Emma Doyle, Mulvaney s chief of staff. Mulvaney has also leaned on Jonny Slemrod and Al Simpson, both lobbyists now working outside the administration.Nancy Cook and Gabby Orr contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    By TED HESSON12/14/2018 04:48 PM ESTHouse Speaker Paul Ryan is leaving Congress with a grateful nod to his Irish ancestors.A bill pushed by Ryan, whose family fled famine-ravaged Ireland in 1851, could provide Irish nationals with thousands of additional U.S. work visas each year.Story Continued BelowThe legislation cleared the House Nov. 28 on an uncontested voice vote and is increasingly likely to clear the Senate next week, a GOP aide told POLITICO. But the measure has stirred opposition from the alt-right publication Breitbart, which dubbed the visa program  amnesty for Irish lobbies  and said it would take jobs away from U.S. college graduates.The bill would give the Irish access to unused E-3 visas, which currently are available only to Australians in  specialty occupations  that require a bachelor s degree or the equivalent. In return, Ireland would offer additional work visas to Americans, among other concessions.  The idea here is that this is going to be reciprocal,  said John Deasy, an Irish special envoy to the U.S.  We think it s important that the flows in the workplace continue between the two countries. A single GOP senator is blocking the legislation, the GOP aide said. That represents apparent progress from earlier this month, when six Republicans had put a hold on the bill, according to an Irish-American news website.Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning   in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Passage of the Irish visa bill would be an unexpected but not illogical conclusion to Paul Ryan s speakership. He worked behind the scenes in 2013 and 2014 on a bill to overhaul the legal immigration system, an effort that eventually died under then-Speaker John Boehner. Ryan maintains close ties with Irish officials, and the 48-year-old Wisconsinite said earlier this year that sometime after his 60th birthday he would like to become the U.S. ambassador to Ireland.The next opportunity for the visa bill to clear the Senate will be Monday, when lawmakers return to grapple with a spending bill to prevent a partial government shutdown. Even if the measure clears the Senate, though, it will need the support of President Donald Trump, whose position on the bill is unclear. A White House spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.The bill would draw from the annual pool of 10,500 work visas in the E-3 program, which was created as part of a 2005 immigration law. Under the measure, Irish nationals would have access to any visas that remained unused by Australians in the preceding fiscal year.The State Department issued 5,657 E-3 visas to Australians in fiscal year 2017. At that rate, nearly 5,000 visas would remain for Irish professionals. The Irish government appears willing to offer more than just employment visas to cement the deal, according to a document circulated among Senate offices and obtained by POLITICO. In addition to reciprocal work permits, the proposal suggests changes to make it easier for qualifying Americans to retire in Ireland. The document also floats an expansion of academic exchange programs and an extension of a reciprocal  working holiday  visa available to U.S. and Irish nationals ages 18 to 30. As part of the proposal, U.S. nationals on holiday visas could begin work immediately after entering Ireland, bypassing the current registration process, according to Deasy, the Irish envoy.

                    By ELIANA JOHNSON, BURGESS EVERETT and RACHAEL BADE12/14/2018 01:28 PM EST
                    Updated 12/14/2018 02:13 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump is mulling the prospect of making a counter-offer to Democratic leaders that would prevent a partial government shutdown and kick the border wall fight into next year, according to two sources familiar with the negotiations.While the specifics of that offer are unclear, Republicans on Capitol Hill are increasingly considering a two-week stop-gap that would fund the government into January. Roughly a quarter of the federal government will shut down next Friday absent a bipartisan deal.Story Continued BelowThe president has meetings scheduled this afternoon with his legislative affairs director, Shahira Knight, and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, to discuss possible options, according to his private schedule and a source familiar with his plans, who indicated that the White House has yet to settle on a counter-proposal to Democrats.There is universal agreement that the decision about whether to keep the government open rests with the president. Trump said during a contentious, televised Oval Office meeting on Tuesday with House Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that he would be  proud  to shut down the government if Democrats refuse him the $5 billion in funding for his border wall.The 2020 Election.

You can unsubscribe at any time.But Trump appeared to backtrack on Thursday, writing in a tweet:  Let s not do a shutdown, Democrats ñ do what s right for the American people! Democrats say it s up to Trump. Their latest proposal   freezing the Department of Homeland Security budget through next October while approving new funding for the rest of the government   has been rebuffed by Republicans. It s in his lap at this point. And it always has been,  said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).Republican lawmakers are signaling to the president that he is unlikely to get the wall funding he is seeking, according to a senior House Republican source. Instead, Trump s going to have to decide whether to strike a deal that could create positive momentum with a new Congress or poison the well with many members who will have the power to torment him when Democrats take control of the House next year.A second Republican source on Capitol Hill said that the White House could still have its border wall fight in January and also disrupt the new Democratic majority in the House from starting fresh with their own agenda. It would also more clearly pit Trump against Democrats, rather than members of his own party.A Democratic aide said this stopgap plan would just ensure that Trump  will lose twice,  as Pelosi would pass a longer-term spending bill when she becomes speaker that won t fund the border wall.The White House declined to comment for this story. As of Thursday afternoon, the president had not changed his plans to leave Washington next Friday to spend two and a half weeks at his Mar-a-Lago estate for the Christmas holiday   which would keep him away from Washington if the government shuts down. Mulvaney has signaled his openness to a continuing resolution into January, according to a source familiar with his thinking, in part because it would involve less federal spending than approving new funding bills for the agencies that would shut down, including the Department of Homeland Security.

                    By JESUS RODRIGUEZAnother stopgap funding bill would simply freeze agencies  current budgets, while approving new versions of those measures would unleash billions more in spending. Trump approved the bigger budget this spring, but later complained of the higher spending.Capitol Hill Republicans are open to a myriad number of ways to avoid a shutdown but need the president to come to an agreement with Capitol Hill Democrats on how to do that. There s recent precedent for a two-week stop-gap bill, which was passed earlier this month. We were elected not to shut the government down but to make it operate for the benefit of taxpayers. And I think that s what almost everybody in Congress wants to do. And I think that s what will eventually happen,  said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.).Asked if the White House agrees, he replied:  I don t know.  Republicans are  scrambling   he s already said:  It s on me, I take the blame, I m proud of it,  said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).  I think Republicans will  chart their own course. Sarah Ferris contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

The resolution, led by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), invokes the War Powers Act and passed in a 56-41 vote. It s the first time the Senate has voted to withdraw forces from a war Congress didn t approve.    The Senate also agreed by unanimous consent to a resolution from Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) to condemn MBS for [Jamal] Khashoggi s murder, which he offered as an alternative for lawmakers wary of pulling support for the Saudis  Yemen intervention.   BUT THE RESOLUTION IS DOA IN THE HOUSE: Republicans pushed through a rule earlier this week to block consideration in this waning Congress of any War Powers resolutions to limit U.S. involvement in Yemen. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who has sponsored several measures aimed at withdrawing U.S.-support for the Saudi-coalition, reiterated Thursday that he would reintroduce his Yemen War Powers Resolution in the Democratic-controlled House next year in the new Congress.  And in the face of the criticism, the Saudi ambassador has left Washington again, fueling speculation he may have left his post for good, writes Al-Monitor.  WARRING SIDES IN YEMEN AGREE TO TRUCE IN KEY PORT CITY:  Yemen s warring parties have agreed to terms for a cease-fire in the crucial port city of Hudaydah, the United Nations chief said on Thursday, announcing the biggest step toward peace in years for a war that has produced the world s worst humanitarian crisis,  adds The New York Times.  PENTAGON TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT FOR SAUDI-COALITION REFUELING: The Pentagon will seek full reimbursement of $331 million from Saudi Arabia and the UAE for fuel, refueling services and flight hours, Senate Armed Services ranking Democrat Jack Reed said Thursday. The Rhode Island senator led an inquiry that found the Defense Department had not properly charged the two countries for fuel and aerial refueling services.

SWAPPING A SUBCOMMITTEE FOR INVESTIGATORS: Should House Armed Services Democrats decide to eliminate the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee next year in the new Congress, the committee would likely look to hire a team of investigators as a way to beef up oversight, an Armed Services source tells Morning D.  What has been contemplated is to eliminate [the subcommittee] and take the resources and hire investigators,  the source explained.  The idea would be these investigators would then be able to serve the full committee s needs and the subcommittees  needs and do so in a much faster, more nimble way to collect information and provide facts to  those panels. Still, the person added, the proposal is far from a done deal. Presumptive HASC Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) is likely to survey fellow committee members before making a final decision, and a full HASC roster for the new Congress hasn t yet been named. CONGRESS SKIPS TOWN AS SHUTDOWN NEARS:  Without President Donald Trump to worry about, a bipartisan deal would likely sail through Congress to fund the government ahead of the holidays.

And NATO will send Kiev signals equipment after latest Ukraine-Russia spat, adds Reuters. TRUMP S AFRICA RESET COULD CHANGE THE U.S. MILITARY S ROLE:  The Trump administration has declared a new era of Great Power competition, shifting U.S. national security priorities from counterterrorism after almost two decades to long-term strategic threats from countries like Russia and China,  writes Defense One.  But in Africa   a contested battlefield where those adversaries are vying for strategic influence   policy experts warn that the U.S. hasn t been playing the game.

Story Continued Below KIBITZING: Our Tanya Snyder caught Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.) huddling with staff members after Senate votes Thursday and wondered if she d stumbled onto a press conference on the driverless car bill ( S. 1885 (115)). No such luck   and when she asked whether there was any movement, Thune said,  Well, we re about to find out. We re going to sit down and kibitz about it.  (Note that the Jewish members of the Pro Transportation team appreciate Thune s use of Yiddish but would like to discuss his pronunciation.) Commerce staff director Nick Rossi wouldn t say any more except to echo Thune s admission from the day before:  It s still a long shot.   From the top: Thune has said the longer Congress is in session, the better the chances for the bill. But Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is tentatively planning Christmas-week work on criminal justice legislation and a spending bill. Even if Commerce leaders manage to settle on consensus language, it s unclear how much floor time McConnell would be willing to offer.  See you in the 116th: All this means it s looking likely Congress will have to start over next year, with two new Commerce leaders (Sen. Roger Wicker as chairman and Sen. Maria Cantwell as ranking member, ICYMI) and Democratic control in the House. The trial lawyers, which hadn t fully mobilized by the time the House passed its version, will be dictating what Democrats can and can t get behind. Safety advocates will have a lot more clout with a Democratic House. The upshot: Congress won t be able to just take the current bill off the shelf and keep tinkering. Expect the process to start again from scratch. At least one private sector representative, Toyota s Hilary Cain, has said the industry, frustrated with the legislative process, is  not interested in doing this again.  Meanwhile, Waymo has put driverless cars into commercial service in Phoenix, GM is due to follow suit in the new year, and driverless cars are logging millions of miles in testing on public roads   all without any federal regulation framework.

CH-CH-CHANGES: Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson, the presumed next chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told reporters Thursday that subpanel leadership hasn t been decided, but might be by next week.  We re kind of waiting until we get to know who our people are,  he said. And he expects there will be some  reshuffling  of the subcommittees. Notably, the transportation subpanel might oversee maritime security, which is currently combined with border security under a different subpanel, per Thompson. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), the current ranking member of the transportation subpanel, also told our Stephanie Beasley that leadership decisions were  still in flux  but didn t rule out the possibility of her chairing the panel next Congress.  Welcome to the club: Two new Democratic senators, Kyrsten Sinema and Jacky Rosen, are joining both the Commerce and Homeland Security committees, meaning they ll be in a position to have a say on a variety of transportation issues. Pros can read about more moves in the committee carousel in Sam s story here.  STILL UNRESOLVED: Lawmakers are also looking at how the tug-of-war over DHS funding might shape up next week. Thompson said he was hopeful the House   which isn t scheduled to return until Wednesday   might agree on a government spending measure before the shutdown deadline on Dec. 21. But he won t support a GOP plan to attach $5 billion in border wall funding:  If it s in there, I m going to vote against it.  Meanwhile, when asked if she would support any anomalies to a stopgap measure, Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee Chairman Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said she remained  very devoted  to providing the Coast Guard with a polar icebreaker. And she criticized the House for adjourning without passing a bill.  I was on the House side,  she said.  I mean, finish your job.  FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION: Deficit hawks rejoice: CBO is out with its annual list of ideas for reducing the federal budget shortfall. With the caveat that many are close to politically impossible, several changes to transportation programs made the list, as Sam reports. They include cutting funding for Amtrak and the Essential Air Service; limiting outlays from the Highway Trust Fund to match revenue; eliminating FTA altogether; and raising the passenger fee for aviation security. While Congress is likely to protect most of the programs listed, President Donald Trump has already tried to slash funding for Amtrak and EAS, and his administration has changed the way FTA funds projects. NOT GOING AWAY: The American Public Transportation Association argues in a new report that public transit is the  backbone  of new mobility, rather than at risk of being pushed aside with continued growth in ridesharing and development of autonomous vehicles. Seventy-seven percent of Americans polled by the group said they think public transit is  the backbone of a multi-transit lifestyle.  The report also suggests transit agencies can play a role as regional mobility managers; 74 percent of millennials surveyed said they would use a multitransit app to arrange and pay for different types of transportation. DOING THE CYBER: Tugboats and cybersecurity aren t two words you would expect to see in the same sentence very often, but managing cyber risks is a serious issue for American Waterways Operators, which along with the Coast Guard, published a new set of best practices this week for the tugboat, towboat and barge industry. Among the advice for operators: Never rely solely on GPS and AIS (automatic identification systems), which can both be compromised. UNITED IN THEIR FRUSTRATION: United Airlines has been a popular target for Senate Democrats this week. HuffPost wrote about Sherrod Brown s unusual mission to restore tip jars to United s airport lounges after the company removed them, leaving workers with their wallets $50 or $100 lighter on a given day. Connecticut s Richard Blumenthal is on a different crusade: opposing the airline s plan to cut the number of flight attendants.  These reductions will ultimately harm consumers   negatively affecting waiting times, in-flight service, & safety,  Blumenthal said. TAKING OFF: Margaret McKeough, the executive vice president and chief operating officer at the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, is leaving early next year. McKeough has worked at MWAA for 20 years and is also the Aero Club of Washington s president.

Story Continued Below  A LOT OF ENERGY, A LOT OF ANGER  FUELS WAVE OF TITLE IX COMMENTS: Democrats in Congress plan to fight Education Secretary Betsy DeVos  proposed rules for how schools handle allegations of sexual assault. But for now, the most fervent opposition is arriving via campus pizza parties, social media and celebrity videos.   While the initial outrage over DeVos  Title IX proposal came from Democrats   who immediately promised pushback   the sustained caterwauling is coming from the grassroots. That s where the anti-DeVos troops are organizing to flood the Education Department with pleas to scrap or overhaul the proposal, which recently opened for public comment.   Lawmakers are watching closely. The comment period is Democrats   first order of business,  an aide told POLITICO. Waves of comments are crashing in: In less than two weeks, the plan has drawn more than 45,000 comments. It attracted more than 7,000 in one day this week.   Students are energized, advocates say   despite the fact that the comment period comes during one of the busiest times of the year for many as they finish papers and prepare for final exams.  There was a lot of energy, a lot of anger,  Mina Aria, a Washington University in St. Louis alum and organizer with Know Your IX, said about a recent event at the school.  I think energized is the best word to describe the mood. It s really cool because it s the end of the semester and they have other papers to write and other finals to study for. They made time to stay for those hours on a Friday.    DeVos supporters say they re outgunned   they don t have the resources to bring in big names or the funding to create new websites. But they say what they do have is public opinion, which they believe is turning in the wake of the #MeToo movement and Justice Brett Kavanaugh hearings. They point to polling, including a Morning Consult survey from October that found 57 percent of adults say they re equally worried about men facing false allegations of sexual assault as they are about women facing sexual assault.    People are starting to realize   just normal Americans   I think public awareness is on our side,  said Cynthia P. Garrett, co-president at Families Advocating for Campus Equality, a group that represents students who say they ve been falsely accused of sexual assault.  We just don t have the resources.

UNC  SILENT SAM  VOTE TODAY: Teaching assistants at the University of North Carolina are refusing to grade thousands of students  work to pressure the system s Board of Governors to shoot down a proposal to spend millions moving a Confederate monument to a more secure spot on the Chapel Hill campus.   Eighty-five graduate students are on strike, withholding the grades of nearly 2,500 students in Chapel Hill. They plan to demonstrate when the board is scheduled to take up the proposal, which calls for moving  Silent Sam  to a new history and education center on campus that s estimated to cost $5.3 million, around 11 a.m. this morning.   They have the support of hundreds of professors at UNC Chapel Hill and beyond, who have signed an open letter saying they  support the right of our graduate and post-undergraduate students to speak out against injustice and intolerance in all of its forms.    Those on strike and their colleagues who support them also signed a letter to parents of UNC students whose grades are being withheld.  Over the last several months, our students have continually inspired us with their courageous activism against the statue and the white supremacy it represents,  they wrote, stressing that  educating is more than providing a grade.    The university has threatened  serious consequences  for the striking instructors.  We trust that our instructors will not act in a way that harms the interests of students and their families, and that these instructors meet the legal, ethical and moral responsibilities for which they have been contracted,  UNC Provost Bob Blouin wrote in an email to instructors last week.  Please consider that your failure to meet your responsibilities to your students, including timely submission of final grades, will result in serious consequences.   EDUCATION DEPARTMENT WILL CANCEL DEBT OF BORROWERS AT CLOSED SCHOOLS: The department plans to expunge the federal student loans owed by thousands of borrowers whose education was interrupted by the closure of their college, carrying out an Obama-era policy that DeVos had fought to stop.   Officials said they will cancel the loans of about 15,000 borrowers who qualified for  closed school  loan discharges, but who haven t yet applied for that benefit. Those student loans total approximately $150 million. The move comes as the Trump administration is forced to implement the Obama-era  borrower defense to repayment  regulations, which created more protections for student loan borrowers who were affected by a school closure or defrauded by their college.   A federal judge in September ruled that DeVos  efforts to stop the 2016 regulations from taking effect was illegal. And in October the same judge rejected a bid by for-profit colleges to immediately stop the regulations, clearing the way for them to take effect. Department officials said they would begin notifying borrowers by email today that they will receive the loan discharges. Borrowers will not have to take any action, but the process could take as long as 90 days to complete. Michael Stratford has the full story. LAWSUIT ACCUSES UT AUSTIN OF  OVERBROAD PROHIBITIONS ON STUDENT SPEECH : Speech First, the advocacy group suing universities it believes are suppressing speech on campus, filed its latest legal challenge this week.   This time it s taking on the University of Texas at Austin, which the group claims  has crafted a series of speech codes with numerous vague and overbroad prohibitions on student speech. The University s ban on  verbal harassment  extends to  offensive  speech, including  insults, epithets, ridicule, [and] personal attacks   based on the victim s   personal characteristics, or group membership,   ideology, political views, or political affiliation.     Speech First s ongoing lawsuit against the University of Michigan  drew the backing of the Justice Department earlier this year. In that case, now before the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, the group claims the University of Michigan s rules meant to prohibit harassment and bullying are actually infringing on free speech rights.     We have not had a chance to review the lawsuit,  UT spokesperson J.B. Bird said.  At first glance, it appears to be incomplete on certain facts. We look forward to reviewing it and responding through legal channels.  He also pointed to the university s Handbook of Operating Procedures, which includes a passage saying,  The freedoms of speech, expression, and assembly are fundamental rights of all persons and are central to the mission of the University.  DEAD LAST IN EMPLOYEE SURVEY: The Education Department came in last place in an annual ranking of the best places to work in the federal government. Employee engagement across the majority of federal departments dropped in 2018, the survey found. It showed a sharp drop in employee satisfaction regarding leadership, agency missions and pay.   Andrea Senteno is the new regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund s Washington, D.C., office.   New research published in the Journal of School Psychology found being in special education classes was not linked to greater suspension rates for students as is commonly thought. Race, however, was.   Twenty states and territories have at least one student board member on their state boards of education, according to a new  brief from the National Association of States Board of Education. The brief says that Delaware and Mississippi are in the process of adding student members, and Utah s board has opted to create a 15-member student-advisory council. One advantage? Students get government experience.   The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is out with a new brief that says reinstating an estate tax in New Mexico with a $1 million exemption would raise an estimated $40 million each year to fund education, health care and other public services.

Story Continued BelowAn appeals court narrowed an injunction on proposed birth control rules, and a House Democrat vows to call her own hearing into fetal tissue research. But first: The Trump administration s subtle messaging makeover.  HHS ON BEST BEHAVIOR AS DEMOCRATIC HOUSE LOOMS   In recent days, the agency has been posting unprecedented details of HHS Secretary Alex Azar s schedule, restoring missing webpages and even touting the Affordable Care Act   a reversal from much of the first two years under the Trump administration.   Why the shift? It s part of a two-month sprint that began after the election, staff tell PULSE, with the prospect of House Democrats conducting investigations and the agency wanting to show that it s being transparent and responsive.   In the past week, HHS has begun posting previews of Azar s daily meetings with outside patient groups, and the agency quickly restored two webpages designed to help Americans sign up for ACA coverage after the Sunlight Foundation s Web Integrity Project flagged that the pages had been altered or removed.   Political appointees also are publicly posting about ACA open enrollment and encouraging other staff to do so as well, according to internal email obtained by PULSE, while tamping down their traditional criticism. CMS Administrator Seema Verma has been one of the more active officials, posting nine ACA enrollment tweets alone in the past week, often exhorting Americans to sign up   a striking difference from last year, when she didn t send a single tweet about ACA sign-ups until the waning days of open enrollment.  This week is the FINAL WEEK for Marketplace #OpenEnrollment!,  Verma tweeted on Thursday.  If you haven t done so already, make sure you visit healthcare.gov/see-plans/ to find and enroll in a plan!    How tone has quickly changed: In the days leading up to the election, Verma s tweets were far more critical on the ACA.  The BIG SECRET no one reports: #Obamacare s skyrocketing premiums are destroying affordable options for the unsubsidized, including people with pre-existing conditions, resulting in 20% drop in unsubsidized enrollment in 2017,  Verma tweeted on Nov. 1   the launch date for open enrollment.  APPEALS COURT NARROWS BLOCK ON TRUMP s CONTRACEPTION RULE   A federal appellate panel on Thursday narrowed an injunction that for the past year had blocked the Trump administration from enforcing new birth control rules, deciding that it applied only to the five states that originally challenged them. The rules undermine Obamacare s mandate that employer-provided insurance include contraception coverage for women at no cost.    Reaction: Attorneys representing the Little Sisters of the Poor, which has fought doggedly to expand the exemptions, criticized the decision.  The 9th Circuit s ruling today lets California continue its fight against nuns, forcing the Little Sisters of the Poor to spend another Christmas defending their religious exemption from the HHS mandate in court,  said Diana Verm, counsel at Becket, in a statement. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, described the decision in a statement as  a win for reproductive health care,  adding that  birth control is health care   critical health care that allows people to lead the life they want.

Seniors need Washington to focus on the right ones. Cutting costs for everyone except seniors and limiting access to lifesaving medicines are the wrong prescription for Medicare. Making changes that help seniors pay less out-of-pocket are the right prescription for Medicare. **Coming next year: Democrats  own hearing on fetal tissue. That s according to Rep. Diana DeGette, the co-chair of the House Pro-Choice Caucus   and the incoming chair of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.  The ongoing interference into ethical fetal tissue research undermines work being done right now to treat a variety of diseases and conditions,  DeGette said in a statement on Thursday, after a contentious GOP-led hearing wrapped up.  I plan to hold a serious and substantive hearing about this important research.    Expect a Democrat-led hearing into fetal tissue to look very different than Thursday s GOP-led investigation, where Democrats only called one witness   a MacArthur  genius  grant winner   who was outnumbered by two GOP witnesses affiliated with Susan B. Anthony List s research arm.  Second maternal mortality bill cleared by Congress. That bill, H.R. 1318 (115), directs states to investigate the causes of deaths during pregnancy and childbirth and to develop prevention plans. It s the second measure addressing maternal mortality to pass out of the lame-duck Congress. Action on the bill by Sens. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) came after several reports documented a maternal mortality crisis in the United States, with higher rates of death from pregnancy and childbirth than any other developed nation.  Maternal mortality rates have been drastically rising across the country, and we need to do more to reverse that,  Capito told POLITICO s Alice Miranda Ollstein.   This legislation will help us figure out what is causing this startling trend and how we can better prevent the same situations from happening in the future. We are one step closer to strengthening our efforts to protect these mothers.  More for Pros. The CBO s guide to how to shrink the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office on Thursday published its annual compendium of options for shrinking the massive federal deficit, which stands at $779 billion. Multiple tactics involved cutting back on health care spending, POLITICO s Caitlin Emma writes, such as by capping Medicaid spending.  Limiting federal spending for the entitlement program that helps millions of low-income Americans with health care costs could generate a gross savings of as much as $805 billion between 2020 and 2028, CBO concluded. Tennessee Health Department, senior senator back science, not incoming Congressman. The Tennessee Department of Health released a terse statement Thursday in defense of vaccines:  Vaccines do not cause autism. Vaccines save lives.  Sen. Lamar Alexander, the influential Senate HELP Committee chairman, echoed the message   a tweet that was shared by FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and others.   The statements came one day after The Tennessean reported that Rep.-elect Mark Green, a physician, said the CDC has  fraudulently managed  vaccine data and that he believes vaccines may cause autism. The Tennessee Department of Health said it welcomes discussion with Tennessee clinicians and scientists who would like to examine the evidence on this topic. California regulators approve Cigna-Express Scripts deal ñ The state Department of Managed Health Care on Thursday approved the impending $67 billion merger between Cigna Corp. and Express Scripts, but with conditions. They include prohibiting the companies from funding the integration by increasing premiums and requiring the insurer and the pharmacy benefit manager to invest in the state s health system to the tune of $60 million.

Story Continued Below LUCK FOR IRISH VISAS?: A bill that could provide Irish nationals access to several thousand work visas each year has a good chance of passing the Senate next week, according to a GOP aide. That s a change from earlier this month, when IrishCentral s Niall O Dowd reported that a half-dozen senators stood in the way.  The legislation, a parting shamrock from retiring  House Speaker Paul Ryan, would grant Ireland access to E-3 visas, currently available only to Australia. Under the bill, H.R. 7164, Irish nationals would have access to any of the E-3 program s 10,500 visas not used by Australians. The measure quietly passed the House on Nov. 28 with a voice vote.  Ryan maintains close ties with Irish officials, and he once suggested he d like to become ambassador to Ireland (in his 60s; Ryan s 48 today). Make of that what you will. The two-year visas would be reciprocal, which means more Americans would be permitted to work in Ireland.  HAPPY FRIDAY!

NO PLAN TO STOP SHUTDOWN: Lawmakers packed their bags Thursday with no plan to address President Donald Trump s threat of a partial government shutdown next week if he doesn t get $5 billion to build the border wall. If the shutdown occurs, hundreds of thousands of workers will be furloughed and the cost to taxpayers will be in the millions, POLITICO s Sarah Ferris, Burgess Everett and Anthony Adragna report.  There is no discernable plan. None that s been disclosed.  said Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), the Senate s No. 2 Republican.  Everybody s looking to [Trump] for a signal about what he wants to do. So far, it s not clear.  Congress won t return until Dec. 19, leaving just three working days to reach a spending agreement. More here. RIGHT TO WORK FOUNDATION PETITIONS SCOTUS: A group of Minnesota home-based care providers backed by the National Right to Work Foundation (which brought the landmark Janus v. AFSCME suit) petitioned the Supreme Court Thursday to take up a challenge to a Minnesota state law that permits home care workers for Medicaid recipients to unionize. The suit, Bierman v. Dayton, was brought in 2014 after Minnesota home care providers voted to be represented by the Service Employees International Union. The plaintiffs argue that even though the law doesn t require union non-members to pay fair-share fees, the SEIU still bargains on behalf of everyone in the bargaining unit, including non-members, a circumstance the plaintiffs decry as  monopoly representation.

MEXICO PAYS FOR THE WALL?: President Donald Trump Thursday declared that he has made good on his campaign vow of requiring Mexico to pay for a southern border wall, thanks to the savings gained from the revised NAFTA deal, POLITICO s Caitlin Oprysko writes. However, Former Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray tweeted following announcement of the USMCA agreement that Mexico would never pay for the wall, even through the new deal.

The girl and her father crossed into the United States illegally on Dec. 6 with a large group of migrants in the New Mexican desert.  More than eight hours later, the child began having seizures at 6:25 a.m.,  the Post said. CBP said in a written statement that the girl  reportedly had not eaten or consumed water for several days.  The death occurred amid rising tensions at the U.S.-Mexico border, where several thousand migrants are massed as they wait to apply for asylum in the U.S. More from the Post here. SENATE COMMITTEE LINEUP: Democratic Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer Thursday announced Senate Democrats  committee lineup for next Congress. Here s a breakdown:  HELP Committee: Sen.

Homeland Security: Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) will replace outgoing ranking member Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who lost her reelection bid. Other departing members include Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), who will take on other committee assignments, and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) who also lost reelection. Newly elected Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Rosen will also join the committee. APPLE S $1 BILLION EXPANSION: Apple announced Thursday that it will invest $1 billion in a new 133-acre campus in Austin that will employ 5,000 new workers, a number that could eventually rise to 15,000, POLITICO s Steven Overly reports.  The company also plans to set up new sites in Seattle, San Diego and Culver City, Calif., bringing more than 1,000 employees to each location, and expand in cities like Pittsburgh, New York and Boulder, Colo.  State and local governments will cut the tech giant a sweet deal if it meets certain employment and investment thresholds, Overly writes, including a $25 million grant and county property tax rebates expected to total tens of millions of dollars over 15 years.

BLUE COLLAR WORKERS  SCARCE:  Blue-collar workers are becoming harder to find than white-collar workers in an historically tight labor market, and economists at the nonpartisan research group The Conference Board, say the shortage will get worse.  The unemployment rate in blue-collar operations during the past 12 months (ending in October) was between 0.8 percent and 1.2 percent below the 2007 average (4.6 percent), while unemployment in management and professional occupations sat at the 2007 average, according to a new report from The Conference Board. In the meantime, the pool of working-age people without a bachelor s degree (who typically fill blue-collar positions) is expected to shrink by 4.7 percent between 2022 and 2027. Recent changes in immigration enforcement, the report says, has shrunk the blue-collar workforce more than the white-collar one.   In certain instances, companies looking to attract enough blue-collar workers will have to continue increasing wages and, as a result, possibly experience diminished profits,  said Gad Levanon, lead author of the report and a chief economist at the board.

VERIZON CUSTOMERS GREETED WITH WORKER CONCERNS: Workers with the distributor XPO Logistics greeted Verizon customers Thursday at over a dozen stores in Los Angeles, D.C., New York and Chicago, among other locations, with information about dangerous working conditions at XPO s facilities   some of which contract with Verizon. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and several chapters of the NAACP, meanwhile, sent a second letter to Verizon executives requesting an update on the company s promised investigation into sexual harassment allegations raised earlier this year.  The tensions over the mistreatment of workers in Verizon s supply chain escalated following a New York Times report that the company discriminated against pregnant workers, suppressed collective bargaining efforts, and maintained dangerous working conditions. Some 97 members of Congress signed a letter earlier this month urging House Labor and the Workforce Committee leaders to initiate an investigation into the distributor. Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) who is expected to be the committee s next chairman, signaled he s open to looking into the claims. Read the Teamsters  letter here.  MINN. AMAZON PROTEST: Rep-elect Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) will join Amazon workers in a protest outside the Amazon Fulfillment Center in Shakopee, Minnesota this afternoon to demand a  humane working rate and workload.  The employees, who were organized through the Awood Center, a nonprofit that supports East African workers, already met with Amazon executives to complain that their work schedules did not allow time for prayer. Although the company provided some accommodations, workers said these weren t enough. Read a flyer about the protest here and more about the workers  prior meeting with Amazon here.  RUBIO BACKS LABOR, KIND OF: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) wrote in an op-ed published Thursday in the Atlantic that the decline of labor unions  is not something to be celebrated.  Unions  once provided workers with a sense of representation and community,  he wrote, but now face declining resources and membership. Rubio reminisced about marching as a boy with his father in a Culinary Workers Uniion strike, but he also took some shots at  Big Labor.   The essay proposed changes to labor law such as embracing the  co-op  model proposed by Mitt Romney s former domestic policy adviser Oren Cass.  These voluntary, dues-paying organizations and their associated worker representatives could receive federal charters that would allow them to administer benefits such as unemployment insurance and worker-training programs,  Rubio wrote.

Story Continued Below FUNDING FIGHT PUTS LWCF IN THE CROSSHAIRS: Lawmakers headed home for the weekend without making any progress toward averting a partial government shutdown.  There is no discernible plan,  said Sen. John Cornyn, the Senate s No. 2 Republican, on Thursday.  None that s been disclosed.  Lawmakers face a Dec. 21 deadline to reach an agreement on government funding for several agencies, including Interior-EPA. And without agreement to move on those, there s no legislative vehicle for reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.    Walled in: Six of the seven spending bills are ready to go next week, which would make up nearly $200 billion in total spending, POLITICO s Sarah Ferris, John Bresnahan and Anthony Adragna report. But Republican leaders in the House are refusing to put any spending package on the floor without money for President Donald Trump s border wall.  DOWN TO THE WIRE: The House won t be back in town until the night of Dec. 19   leaving just 72 hours to reach a deal.  LWCF STRANDED: House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop, ranking member Ra˙l Grijalva, and Senate Energy Chairman Lisa Murkowski and ranking member Maria Cantwell had a lengthy and productive meeting on a public lands package that includes the permanent reauthorization of the LWCF, Anthony reports. But they ve agreed it wouldn t move unless Congress can agree on a year-end omnibus spending package, Murkowski said.  Every time we have a conversation we re closer to a final deal,  she said, adding that  given the time frame we re dealing with  it would have to move with an omnibus appropriations bill.  Not so fast: Cantwell was less bullish on the public land package s chances.  While I continue to hope we can come to an agreement on a deal, I am concerned that last-minute overreach could jeopardize the entire package,  she told ME in a statement.  What else? Murkowski also said Senate leadership is working on a nominees package to pass before the end of the year   welcome news for the seven Energy Department nominees and three Interior nominees awaiting confirmation.

THE ANSWER MY FRIEND, IS BLOWIN  IN THE WIND: The auction for three offshore leases for wind power developments blew through price records Thursday, but the bidding isn t over yet. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management will resume the auction this morning, and bids have already reached an average of about $700 an acre, exceeding the 2016 record of $535 an acre for a lease in New York waters. Four companies out of 11 that started remain in the bidding, and since each company can only come away with one lease, the staring contest over who drops out next could be intense. The action resumes this morning at 9 a.m.  ON TAP TODAY: EPA s Office of Inspector General expects to release a report today on the agency s Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program. SENATE DEMS WARY OF DOE CENTRUS PLANS: A trio of Senate Democrats are pressing Energy Secretary Rick Perry to nix agency plans to issue a $115 million no-bid contract to Centrus Corp. to demonstrate technology for enriching uranium slightly above what s needed to run current nuclear power reactors.  We question the need for such an arrangement outside of congressional consideration for fiscal year 2019 and outside of normal government competitive procurement practices,  Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on energy and water spending, wrote in a letter with Sens. Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall. Centrus was created after the 2014 bankruptcy of uranium enrichment firm USEC, and lawmakers are especially wary about continuing the special treatment the predecessor company received from powerful lawmakers and previous administrations.  DOC OF THE DAY: The Congressional Budget Office released its annual list of options for reducing the federal deficit over the next 10 years, which policymakers rely on in weighing budget decisions, Pro s Jennifer Scholtes reports. Inside the document: imposing a tax on greenhouse gases, which would increase federal revenues by $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years. See it here.  DEMS TO TRUMP: ACT ON CLIMATE REPORT: Close to 100 Democratic lawmakers want the president to heed the warnings of the second volume of the Fourth National Climate Assessment that was released in November. Democrats signed onto a letter requesting Trump  reconsider maintaining the nation s commitment to the Paris Agreement and fully implement and enforce the Clean Power Plan, fuel economy standards, methane emission controls, and safeguards for clean air and clean water,  in order to stave off the worst effects of the climate report.  TO THE MATS: Democratic Sen. Tom Carper expressed concern over EPA s proposed reconsideration of the supplemental finding about Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which provides standards for mercury and air toxics pollution from power plants.  I echo the call of health and environmental groups, states and the business community: Keep the entirety of the MATS rules in place,  Carper wrote in a letter to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. RIOT ACT READ: Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Brenda Burman held Arizona, California and Nevada s feet to the fire Thursday when she publicly set a Jan. 31 deadline for the Lower Colorado River Basin states to sign off on plans aimed at averting a worst-case scenario at Lake Mead   or face federal intervention that would be more sledgehammer than scalpel.  The drought on the Colorado River has been a top priority of the secretary since before I came to the department,  Burman later told reporters at the Colorado River Water Users conference in Las Vegas Thursday.    But Trump won t like this: Burman acknowledged that if the states can t finalize their deal, Mexico likely won t share in the pain of preemptive cuts.  I think it would depend on the secretary s action, but in most cases I would say that the Drought Contingency Plans of the seven basin states are what would trigger Mexico s contribution,  under a bilateral agreement signed between the neighbors in 2017, she said.  Keep your eye on this: Burman said there is general agreement that Congress will need to sign off in order for the state plans to fully go into effect. Don t forget, in recent years, even broadly-supported water sharing agreements have failed to pass Congress (See: Klamath River).  WASHINGTON BUDGET EYES SNAKE RIVER: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee released his budget proposal for the next two years that looks to increase spending on the environment, including efforts to help the state s orca population, the Associated Press reports. The budget also includes $750,000  to facilitate a stakeholder process to inform a path moving forward should the Lower Snake River dams be removed    a contentious issue in the state   that Washington Reps. Dan Newhouse and Cathy McMorris Rodgers were quick to slam. In a statement, the pair said Inslee  does not have the authority to breach our federal dams on the Lower Snake River, and allocating state taxpayers  funds to consider breaching them would be wasteful.   FOR YOUR RADAR: California could today become the first state to commit to an all-electric bus fleet. The California Air Resources Board is expected to vote on the Innovative Clean Transit measure, requiring transit agencies move toward 100 percent zero-emission buses by 2040 statewide.  ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE WILL APPEAL: Atlantic Coast Pipeline will appeal the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling Thursday that vacated the U.S. Forest Service s approval of the project, spokesman Aaron Ruby said. Ruby said the court s decision would  severely harm consumers and do great damage to our economy and energy security.   IT S BACK: Colorado Rising, the liberal group that got the since-defeated measure on fracking limits, Proposition 112, on the ballot in November, announced Thursday it was forming an exploratory committee to start the process of running a ballot initiative in the 2020 election cycle. Trump has appointed Brian Harrell as director of the Infrastructure Security Division of the newly established DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Trump last month appointed Harrell as assistant secretary of infrastructure protection at CISA s predecessor, the National Protection and Programs Directorate.

                        Immigration
                    By CAITLIN OPRYSKO and TED HESSON12/14/2018 09:20 AM EST
                    Updated 12/14/2018 03:22 PM ESTWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Friday that the Trump administration isn t responsible for the death of a 7-year-old girl in Border Patrol custody. Does the administration take responsibility for a parent taking a child on a trek through Mexico to get to this country?  Gidley said outside the White House, according to a pool report.  No.   Story Continued BelowU.S. Customs and Border Protection acknowledged Thursday night that a girl from Guatemala died of exhaustion, dehydration and shock less than 48 hours after authorities at the border took the girl into custody along with her father and a large group of migrants who crossed into New Mexico illegally.Gidley called the death a  horrific, tragic situation  but asserted it could have been prevented with stricter immigration laws.  It s a needless death, and it s 100 percent preventable,  he said.  If we could just come together and pass some common sense laws to disincentivize people from coming up from the border and encourage them to do it the right way, the legal way, then those types of deaths, those types of assaults, those types of rapes, the child smuggling, the human trafficking that would all come to an end. And we hope Democrats join the president. The Washington Post reported Thursday that the girl began having seizures roughly eight hours after being taken into custody and was attended to by emergency responders, who found that she was running a 105.7-degree fever. According to CBP, the girl  reportedly had not eaten or consumed water for several days. She was transported to a hospital where she went into cardiac arrest and was revived, though she died less than 24 hours later, the Post reported.The Homeland Security Department on Friday posted a timeline of the girl s detention and death on Facebook. The girl s father advised Border Patrol officials that she had become sick and was vomiting before officials put the family on a bus from an outpost near the border to a Border Patrol Station in Lordsburg, New Mexico, according to DHS. The trip took roughly 90 minutes, the department said.Upon arrival,  the father notified agents that the child was not breathing,  DHS said.The girl was then transported by helicopter to a hospital where she was later pronounced dead. DHS said initial indications showed she died from septic shock.The DHS inspector general s office will conduct an investigation into the incident, the watchdog announced Friday afternoon. The results will be shared with the department, Congress and the public, the office said.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said earlier Friday the  heart-wrenching  death  is a very sad example of the dangers  migrants face when they try to enter the U.S. My heart goes out to the family, all of DHS,  Nielsen said in an interview on Fox News   Fox & Friends,  where she also touted new border-crossing statistics.Nielsen on Friday painted the incident as a cautionary tale that could have been avoided had the girl and her father entered into the U.S. legally. This family chose to cross illegally,  she said.  They were about 90 miles away from where we could process them. It took a such a large crowd, it took our Border Patrol folks a couple times to get them all. While Nielsen said Border Patrol gave the family  immediate care,  she said that DHS would look into the incident.Still, she said,  We cannot stress how dangerous the journey is when migrants come illegally. Though there is no evidence that the girl s death was exacerbated by the conditions she was held in by CBP, her death has prompted fresh calls for reviews of the detention centers for migrants caught crossing the border illegally, which have lessened some after the outrage sparked by the Trump administration s so-called zero tolerance policy that led to children being separated from their parents after crossing into the U.S. illegally.Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) on Friday noted that there are still several dozen children who are being held in detention centers for various reasons as a result of the previous family separation policy, criticizing the White House for its newest attempt at keeping immigrant families together. Certainly all of those children who are separated were traumatized,  Merkley said in an interview on CNN s  New Day.  We also have now a new strategy of traumatizing children, which is we are going to lock them up, and lock them up with their families in camps,  he continued, referring to the Trump administration s decision to set up tent camps to detain migrant families.Merkley said the girl s death was  tragic and awful  but pointed out that there is no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Border Patrol officers.  I hope she got immediate care and received water as everybody should at the border,  he said.As President Donald Trump threatens to trigger a partial government shutdown in a week over demands for funding to build his long-promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, much of the recent immigration debate has centered around several caravans of thousands of migrants traveling from Central America to seek asylum in the U.S. Trump made the caravans a focal point of his stump speech just before the midterm elections, claiming, without evidence, that they included terrorists from the Middle East attempting to sneak into the U.S.In the days leading up to last month s midterm, Trump ordered the deployment of U.S. troops and resources along the border to shore up security, a move critics have panned as a wasteful political ploy and a misuse of the military. While Trump framed the caravans as an immediate national security threat to the country, a large number of the migrants has concentrated just outside of the U.S. in Tijuana, Mexico, where they have reportedly put a strain on local resources. In recent weeks, CBP has come under fire for using tear gas on migrants, a step the U.S. agency argued was justified because the migrants were allegedly rushing the border and attacking officers. Such tactics on the part of border agents, defenders of CBP noted, have been deployed under other administrations as well.Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) on Friday said he hoped the girl s death could humanize the immigration debate, while hitting the White House for slashing funding for programs intended to improve the quality of life in the countries where the migrant caravans are originating.  This calls on all of us to bring a moral lens to this story, to look at how we re treating families, families with children, families who are coming to this country out of desperation,  he said in an interview on MSNBC s  Morning Joe.  I think we should do everything we can to help make sure families don t feel compelled to make that risky trip, but once they do, Border Patrol needs to do everything they can to avoid this kind of senseless and needless loss of life, particularly for children who [arrrive] at our border in really terrible condition.

HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE CHINA TALKS   There will be closer to 60 days to make a deal one we get through the Christmas and New Year s holidays. And there likely won t be any serious talks before that. Once we hit the new year, there are likely to be several rounds of talks including possible U.S. delegations to Beijing and Chinese visits to Washington, though as of Thursday there was no schedule set up yet. Story Continued BelowThat s not much time for U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to put together a meaningful accord that would include specific goals for the Chinese to meet on intellectual property rights, forced technology transfer and other key administration goals. The document will also have to include timetables for compliance and a mechanism for verification. The Chinese are good at making vague promises and then not doing much of anything to comply with them. This is not true of buying U.S. products, which they are more than happy to do and doesn t actually mean anything to their long-term goals. There is almost no chance any of this can get done in sixty days. Which means there will have either have to be extensions or President Trump can accept a weak deal or push ahead with a trade war escalation. Trump alone will make this call and he probably has little idea at this point which way he is going to go. His senior advisers certainly don t know. A lot will depend on how markets are doing in late February, what the Fed has done on rates, what s happening in the Mueller probe and what Trump s mood is like. The betting here is that Trump will care more about market reaction and not screwing up the economy heading toward re-election than he will about complaints from hardliners like Peter Navarro that he is not being tough enough with China. This makes the most likely outcome an extension past March 1 for more work or acceptance of modest promises and more Chines goods purchases.  CHIEF OF STAFF HUNT GOES ON   Our Rebecca Morin:  Trump said on Thursday that he s narrowed his chief of staff search down to five candidates, but he refused to reveal who s now on the short-list. During a meeting with governors-elect, the president teased out vague details of the search in reality-show style.  Five people. Really good ones. Terrific people. Mostly well known, but terrific people,  Trump said. Trump did not name any of the candidates or say when a decision will be made.  Trump has repeatedly insisted that it s a highly coveted job, even as top White House aide Kellyanne Conway hinted that Kelly may stay on longer than the end of 2018.   Other contenders floated have included David Bossie, a former Trump campaign deputy manager; former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer; and Republican fundraiser Wayne Berman.  Read more.  IS HE GOING TO JARED?   HuffPo s S.V. Date:  Jared Kushner, the husband of Trump s daughter Ivanka and already an official White House adviser, met with Trump Wednesday about the job, a top Republican close to the White House told HuffPost. He and two others close to Trump or the White House who confirmed Kushner s interest in the position did so on condition of anonymity to discuss the president s staffing considerations freely.  Kushner has been pushing his own candidacy with Trump, citing his work on a criminal justice reform package and a claimed ability to work with Democrats, one person said.  Read more.  WP s Josh Dawsey on Twitter:  A White House official says Jared Kushner is not under consideration for chief of staff and is not interviewing for the job. (The usual Trump White House caveats apply here.)   MM SIDEBAR   We are told by one person close to the White House that Christie is unlikely due to frictions with Kushner, though Trump could overrule his son-in-law. We are also told that Mulvaney actually does want it (very badly) and could somehow wind up with it if no other candidate emerges, though wanting it is usually a very bad look with Trump. Blackstone s Wayne Berman is again on some short lists but we are told he is not among the FINAL FIVE. Anyway, it s a big, Trump Show mess.  BOSSIE THE BOSS?   Our Gabby Orr, Andrew Restuccia and Rebecca Morin:  Depending on who you ask   Bossie, a controversial Republican operative excluded from the president s earliest batch of hires, is either a frontrunner or a nonstarter in   Trump s chief of staff sweepstakes.  Some White House allies say Bossie, formerly Trump s deputy campaign manager, shot to the top of the list the minute Trump expressed an interest in having an effective political operator in the slot.   People close to the White House said the president has even discussed splitting the job into two separate positions: one person tasked with focusing on the day-to-day operations of the West Wing and another person charged with orchestrating a political strategy ahead of the 2020 election.  Read more.  CRAPO WEIGHS DEUTSCHE INVESTIGATION   Per our Zachary Warmbrodt: Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo says he s taking a request by Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Elizabeth Warren to investigate Deutsche Bank  under advisement  but he s hesitant to single out a specific company.  The Banking Committee has not yet, and I don t know that I m ready to start, singling out and creating investigations on specific companies,  Crapo told POLITICO. Crapo said the committee s already been reviewing anti-money laundering rules and that  I m very open to looking into the issues further.  Police raided Deutsche s offices recently as part of a money laundering investigation. The company s problems could be a case study as part of a potential anti-money laundering overhaul but Crapo said the committee also has  a list as long as your arm of issues that we need to hold hearings on.  Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the committee, says he s in favor of the committee  looking into all of this kind of scandal, and Deutsche Bank is sort of first in line it seems on all things scandal.  FED PREP   The central bank will almost certainly boost its target rate by a quarter point next week to a range of 2.25 to 2.50 percent. What happens after that is now a pretty open question. We should get some signals from Fed Chair Jay Powell next week on whether three rate hikes are still likely for next year. He may well nudge expectations away from that and lean hard into the idea of data dependence and that any signs of a significant economic slowing could reduce the number to two, one, or even none. RSM chief economist Joseph Brusuelas:  Recent Fed rhetoric implies there will be changes in the language around forward-looking guidance   which will deemphasize the dot plot forecast. We expect the committee to drop the phrase  further gradual increases  in favor of something that points toward the evolution of high frequency data and risks around the outlook, which remain balanced.   SPEAKING OF THE CHINESE BUYING STUFF   Our Megan Cassella:  China purchased 1.13 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans this week, offering a sign that the two countries are beginning to make progress in alleviating trade tensions. The Department of Agriculture on Thursday reported the purchase, which historical data show is the ninth-largest daily sale of U.S. soybeans ever.   The purchase, which is equal to about 41 million bushels, will make up only a fraction of the total soybeans typically sold to China in a normal year.  Including the purchase, the U.S. has sold roughly 55 million bushels to China in this marketing year, which began Sept. 1. That represents a 91 percent drop from the more than 600 million bushels sold to China at the same point last year, said John Newton, chief economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation.

SHOT   Trump to Fox News on the GM plant closings:  It doesn t really matter because Ohio is, under my leadership from a national standpoint, Ohio s going to replace those jobs like in two minutes.   CHASER   American Bridge s Andrew Bates emails:  Trump spent years promising the American people that he could prevent layoffs and outsourcing. But now that 11,000 American workers are losing their jobs on his watch - in part due to economic damage caused by his own trade policies - he says it  doesn t really matter.  Try telling that to the thousands of distressed families in Ohio, Michigan, and Maryland whose futures were just thrown into chaos right before the holidays.

But with Trump enjoying his border wall brinkmanship, everyone in the Capitol has basically stopped talking.  The House and Senate left town Thursday with no strategy to avert a partial government shutdown next week, putting Congress on the brink of an intractable conflict that could drag out through New Year s Day   furloughing hundreds of thousands of workers and costing taxpayers millions.

INSIDE THE LAST DAYS OF LLOYD   Bloomberg s Max Abelson and Sridhar Natarajan:  When Lloyd Blankfein told his colleagues at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in July that he was going to retire from the bank s top job, he said the timing just felt right. When things are going wrong, he wrote them in a memo, you can t up and leave. Now in Blankfein s final weeks as chairman of Wall Street s most influential bank, things have gone wrong.  Prosecutors are zeroing in on the firm s work for a Malaysian investment fund that they say was raided in a historic plunder. Goldman s role raising about $6.5 billion for 1MDB has become one of its ugliest scandals in a generation. In November, the U.S. Justice Department revealed that a former partner pleaded guilty to bribery charges, his deputy was arrested and the firm put a top Asia banking executive on leave. The stock is down more than 30 percent in 2018.  Read more.  MEET YOUR NEW BANKING COMMITTEE DEMOCRATS   Via Zach: Sen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema and Sen. Tina Smith are joining the Democratic side of the Senate Banking Committee, a pair that may effectively cancel each other out when it comes to certain regulatory issues. The appointment of Sinema was great news for bank lobbyists. The Arizona Democrat has been one of the most industry-friendly members of her party in the House, and she supported the landmark bank deregulation bill that became law in May. Smith opposed that legislation. Senate Banking ranking member Sherrod Brown, who led the charge against the bill, described the Minnesota Democrat as  pro-consumer  in an interview. The committee lost two of its more  conservative members    Sens. Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly    and picked up a progressive and a conservative,  Brown told POLITICO.  I don t know Sinema,  he said.  I don t talk to her. I ve never seen her in action. I know that she s not been exactly where I am politically but it s a big country. I worked with Heidi and Joe.   TRUMP PUSHES OPPORTUNITY ZONES   Our Brian Faler:  Trump   signed an executive order creating a new group of government officials charged with developing ways of improving the new Opportunity Zone program. The White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council will be led by Ben Carson, head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and staffed by aides from 13 agencies.  It will be responsible for finding ways federal agencies can support the initiative, which is designed to funnel money into designated areas for economic development.   The effort has come under criticism, though, because many of the areas were already gentrifying before the initiative began. It would also personally benefit Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner s family, the Associated Press and Bloomberg News have reported.  Read more. BUDGET DEFICIT UP TO $305B IN FY2019   WSJ s Kate  Coat Thief  Davidson:  The U.S. budget gap widened in the first two months of the fiscal year as tax collections lagged behind federal outlays, which included higher spending for the military and interest on the national debt. The government ran a $305 billion deficit in October and November, compared with $202 billion during the same period a year earlier, the Treasury Department said Thursday.  Federal outlays climbed 18 percent the first two months of fiscal 2019, which began Oct. 1, and total receipts rose 3 percent. Much of the increase in the deficit was attributable to a shift in the timing of certain payments, the Treasury said. The first day of December fell on a Saturday this year, so payments that would have been made then were moved up to Nov. 30, boosting spending for the period.  Read more.  MNUCHIN  HAPPY,  BUT WILLING TO BE TRUMP S CHIEF   Bloomberg s Jennifer Jacobs and Erik Wasson:  Mnuchin indicated he d serve as White House chief of staff if President Donald Trump wants but said he s happy in his current job.

Trump said earlier Thursday that he s weighing five candidates to succeed retired General John Kelly as White House chief of staff, after eliminating Representative Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, from consideration.

WSJ s Harriet Torry:  Most economists in a recent survey view a trade war between the U.S. and China as the biggest threat to the U.S. economy in 2019, a sign that forecasters view political uncertainty and the potential for new punitive tariff barriers as greater risks than macroeconomic or financial disruptions.  Nearly half of economists who responded to a survey by The Wall Street Journal, 47.3 percent, said they viewed the U.S. dispute with Beijing as the No. 1 risk for 2019. Some 20 percent cited financial market disruptions and 12.7 percent pointed to a slowdown in business investment.  Read more.  ECONOMIST SCALE BACK PROJECTIONS ON FED HIKES   WSJ s Kate Davidson:  Private economists tempered their expectations for the path of interest rates next year in a new Wall Street Journal survey, and many foresee the Federal Reserve cutting rates starting in 2020.  All but one of the 60 economists polled expect the Fed to raise its benchmark federal-funds rate next week to a range between 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent. But they dialed back their median forecast for 2019, calling for two rate increases next year rather than the three they expected when surveyed last month.  Read more. CAN CRYPTO SURVIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION?   NYT s Peter Henning:  The government has finally begun a crackdown on the market for cryptocurrencies and digital tokens.

Giga Watt, a digital currency mining operation in Washington state, filed for bankruptcy recently due in large part to the collapse in Bitcoin s price.  Read more.

You can unsubscribe at any time.12/14/2018 07:58 AM ESTBy SARAH FERRIS (sferris@politico.com; @sarahnferris) With an assist from Nolan McCaskillStory Continued BelowIT S GETTING REAL: The House and Senate skipped town Thursday without a clue as to how GOP leaders plan to avert a politically painful government funding lapse next week. Even top Republicans are griping publicly that they ve been left in the dark on the strategy, with no word from the White House, as they attempt to avoid being stuck in the Capitol on Christmas. Worse still, the House isn t slated to return until Wednesday night, leaving just a 72-hour window for a spending deal that has eluded congressional leaders all year.There s been no sign of deal-making since Tuesday, when President Trump scrambled the GOP s plans by relishing in a shutdown on national TV. Democrats say they re waiting on Republicans, and Republicans say they re waiting on Trump, as your host reports with Burgess and Anthony Adragna. Privately, some GOP spending leaders have begun drafting back-up plans to do just that, but they admit Trump could simply reject those bills.In yet another shift, POLITICO Playbook reports this morning that Trump has begun to give signals that he might back a bipartisan funding package, even without his wall money, to avert a shutdown. The exasperation on Capitol Hill is palpable, though plenty of lawmakers   particularly Democrats   hope that Trump could back down on his threat if he realizes he would need to stay in Washington in that two-week holiday stretch.

Related: Trump is scheduled to arrive at Mar-A-Lago for a 16-day holiday vacation on Dec. 21, the day of the funding deadline, the Palm Beach Post reports: https://pbpo.st/2UEUSCY. FURY AT THE BORDER  Top House Democrats are calling for a  full investigation  into the death of a 7-year-old girl less than 48 hours after she was taken into Border Patrol Custody. That includes Rep. Joaquin Castro, the incoming chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who described a  humanitarian crisis  at the border. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, another top Democrat who will have oversight powers in 2019, shared her outrage on Twitter:  We must investigate her death FULLY, including CBP s actions, and make certain that justice is served. MCCONNELL RELENTS   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has agreed to bring up a bipartisan criminal justice bill next week, teeing up a historic win for long-time advocates in both parties   and for Trump. But behind the scenes, Senate conservatives are still at the drawing board as they pressure McConnell to make changes in the bill, Burgess reports. The bill, which would be the biggest overhaul to U.S. prison and sentencing practices in decades, could pass the House the same week, delivering a victory to another big supporter, Speaker Paul Ryan, in his final days as speaker. More: https://politi.co/2SPBQrZ.If and when it passes, Jared Kushner would deserve credit for months of personally lobbying key Republican senators as well as his efforts to build up support in the most unlikely of places: The Drudge Report. Kushner has quietly courted conservative media figures who he knows shape opinions of his father in law, as well as GOP lawmakers, Eliana Johnson and Burgess write. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said he would sometimes talk to Kushner five times a day as they were nearing the finish line:  He s helped us navigate 1,000 storms.  Much more: https://politi.co/2QQztYx.WE FINALLY MADE IT. Welcome to Friday and thanks for reading POLITICO s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill, where we re still chuckling at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s not-so-subtle shoutout to departing Sen. Jeff Flake on Thursday for once being named  the No. 1 most beautiful person on Capitol Hill.  I m filling in for your host, Nolan, who will be back in the saddle next week. THURSDAY S MOST CLICKED: The winner was HuffPost s report on the five Democrats who voted with Republicans on a controversial farm bill rule that included language blocking a vote on U.S. involvement in Yemen.  WE WERE SHOCKED AS SH**    House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has almost certainly locked down the votes to retake the throne of Speaker next January. For weeks, she was short on support. But that changed in a one-on-one meeting with one of her fiercest critics, Colorado Rep. Ed Perlmutter, when Pelosi told him for the first time that she was open to term limits, as Rachael, Heather and Bres write in a juicy play-by-play of Pelosi s return to power.Perlmutter s meeting capped off several bad weeks for the Pelosi rebels. First, they struggled to recruit more than a handful of incoming freshman to their efforts, even those who had campaigned against Pelosi on the trail. All the while, Pelosi was picking off her opponents one by one, dangling subcommittee chairmanships and promises of floor votes to trigger the defections. Much more: https://politi.co/2zXzD6N. Related:  She works harder than any human being I ve ever known,  via the Washington Post. AN OLIVE BRANCH   Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is offering an open invite for the Democratic party s newbies in the House. McCarthy s staff hand-delivered letters to the cubbies of every incoming House Democrat, offering in-person meetings to talk policy priorities next year, Roll Call reports. His note comes after dozens of Democrats-elect sent their own letter to Pelosi and her deputies, urging them to prioritize  legislation that improves the lives of those who elected us  over investigations.A  WIDE OPEN  PRIMARY?: North Carolina Republicans are bracing for an ugly primary battle if the state is forced to disqualify the results of last month s 9th District seat, the Charlotte Observer reports.Several possible GOP contenders are already being floated in the case of a do-over election, with some in the state GOP eager to distance themselves from the current Republican candidate, Mark Harris, whose campaign has been accused of voter fraud.Related: North Carolina legislators approved rules this week that would require a primary before holding the next election, which is seen as an  admission that many state Republicans are eager to cut ties with Harris,  Laura BarrÛn-LÛpez writes for POLITICO. ANYBODY-BUT-MCSALLY    Rep. Martha McSally is not Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey s top choice to become the state s next senator, the Washington Post reports. The Senate hopeful has fallen out of favor after a post-election memo from McSally s campaign team, which partly blamed  Democratic fundraising, a geographic disadvantage and voter hostility toward President Trump  for her loss, as the Post writes. Ducey s inner circle has interpreted that to mean she s not owning up to her loss to Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. There are few other obvious GOP alternatives, however, and Ducey will likely be under pressure soon to pick a replacement for Sen. Jon Kyl, who was appointed to Sen. John McCain s seat after his death. Kyl is expected to announce his departure soon.A DOUBLE REBUKE   The Senate voted Thursday to withdraw U.S. military support from Saudi Arabia s war in Yemen in its strongest rebuke of Trump since the killing of Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Senate also voted to blame the Saudi crown prince for his death, in a far more bipartisan bill that stands a better chance of making it to Trump s desk, Marianne reports. The House is not expected to take up the measure this year, but the votes  signal that Congress will take on Mr. Trump s support of Saudi Arabia when Democrats take control of the House next month,  per the New York Times.The House and Senate are out.  Zilch.THURSDAY S WINNER   Lindsay Underwood was first to correctly guess that Norman Thomas is the presidential candidate who when he was a child delivered a newspaper, The Marion Star, edited by a future president, Warren G.

                            A deal being floated to avert a shutdown would be a fold from President Donald Trump, and would be read as such by his base on Capitol Hill. | Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty ImagesTHE LATEST SHUTDOWN BUZZ FROM 1600   Several different people inside the White House and on Capitol Hill tell us they are getting some signals PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP might back a bipartisan package of spending bills to avert a government shutdown. The package -- a so-called minibus -- funds border security, but not the wall. (Caveat: This president changes his opinions quickly. And the only word that is close to final is the word that comes out of his mouth.)MAKE NO MISTAKE: This would be a fold from the president, and would be read as such by his base on Capitol Hill. The White House would try to sell it as a victory, of sorts, heading into the holiday. IT WOULD, HOWEVER, BE a recognition that the math simply isn t there for Trump as he pushes for a $5 billion border wall.ONE WEEK until the government partially shuts down.-- SARAH FERRIS, BURGESS EVERETT and ANTHONY ADRAGNA:   There s no plan : Congress skips town as shutdown nears BORDER TALES --  7-year-old migrant girl taken into Border Patrol custody dies of dehydration, exhaustion,  by WaPo s Nick Miroff and Robert Moore:  A 7-year-old girl from Guatemala died of dehydration and shock after she was taken into Border Patrol custody last week for crossing from Mexico into the United States illegally with her father and a large group of migrants along a remote span of New Mexico desert, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Thursday.  The child s death is likely to intensify scrutiny of detention conditions at Border Patrol stations and CBP facilities that are increasingly overwhelmed by large numbers of families seeking asylum in the United States. According to CBP records, the girl and her father were taken into custody about 10 p.m. Dec. 6 south of Lordsburg, N.M., as part of a group of 163 people who approached U.S. agents to turn themselves in. More than eight hours later, the child began having seizures at 6:25 a.m., CBP records show. Emergency responders, who arrived soon after, measured her body temperature at 105.7 degrees, and according to a statement from CBP, she  reportedly had not eaten or consumed water for several days.   WaPo2020 WATCH -- NYT S JONATHAN MARTIN:  Sanders and Warren Meet and Agree: They Both Are Probably Running :  Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders met Wednesday night at her condominium in Washington to discuss their political intentions but did not reach any accord about coordinating their dueling presidential ambitions, according to two Democrats briefed on their discussion. Only the two senators were present and they stated what has become abundantly clear: that they are both seriously considering seeking the Democratic nomination in 2020. But neither Ms. Warren nor Mr. Sanders sought support from the other or tried to dissuade the other from running, said the officials familiar with the meeting. Ms. Warren sought the sit-down and did so as a courtesy and because they have a longstanding friendship that is rooted in candor, according to one Democrat close to the Massachusetts senator. Her office declined to comment about the meeting. Mr. Sanders dismissed questions Thursday in the Capitol about the meeting, asking why a reporter was not asking about his successful push to have the Senate pass a symbolic resolution withdrawing United States support for Saudi Arabia s military campaign in Yemen. And the Vermont senator flashed irritation when he was asked about it during an interview on MSNBC.  NYTHOW PELOSI DID IT   -- RACHAEL BADE, HEATHER CAYGLE and JOHN BRESNAHAN:  How Pelosi beat the rebels and got her gavel back :  While the late President George H.W. Bush was lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda on Dec. 4, Nancy Pelosi was several hundred feet away cobbling together a deal that would return her to the speaker s chair. Colorado Rep. Ed Perlmutter, a leader of a group of Democratic rebels trying to push Pelosi out of House leadership, had flown back to Washington to negotiate with her face-to-face. Pelosi had already flipped several critics and shown momentum in her bid to reclaim the gavel. Perlmutter s group was under siege from Pelosi allies both in and outside the Capitol. But Pelosi still didn t have the votes to become speaker. And she was ready to make a dramatic overture to lock down support. During the meeting in her office on the second floor of the Capitol, Pelosi told Perlmutter she was open to term limits on her leadership. It was the first time Pelosi had expressed a willingness to accept an end-date on her power after 16 years atop the Democratic Caucus. It proved to be the decisive moment in Pelosi s weeks-long slog to ensure she would be the first lawmaker since the legendary Sam Rayburn in the 1950s to win the speaker s gavel a second time.

Some White House allies say Bossie, formerly Trump s deputy campaign manager, shot to the top of the list the minute Trump expressed an interest in having an effective political operator in the slot.   But others quickly dismiss the speculation, saying the Trump world adviser can t overcome opposition within the first family and lingering concerns about a hotheadedness that kept him out of the West Wing to begin with.

As we continue to pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world, drug companies continue to pocket billions of dollars. They can afford to spend nearly $175 million for lobbying, and more than $6 billion for advertising, and yet we re supposed to believe they can t find a way to lower prices? Americans shouldn t have to choose between buying medication and buying food for our families. It s time for Congress to step up and put people before profits. Stop the greed. Cut drug prices now. https://www.aarp.org/Rx

                    Updated 12/13/2018 06:50 PM ESTWithout President Donald Trump to worry about, a bipartisan deal would likely sail through Congress to fund the government ahead of the holidays. But with Trump fueling the border wall brinkmanship, everyone in the Capitol has basically stopped talking.The House and Senate left town Thursday with no strategy to avert a partial government shutdown next week, putting Congress on the brink of an intractable conflict that could drag out through New Year s Day   furloughing hundreds of thousands of workers and costing taxpayers millions.Story Continued BelowFrustrated lawmakers in both parties are complaining that congressional leaders have made zero progress since Tuesday, when Trump stunned even his fellow Republicans by boasting that he would take the blame for the closure of a dozen federal agencies if he doesn t get money for his border wall.Lawmakers say there is no public plan to prevent a partial government shuttering. And no secret plan either. There is no discernable plan. None that s been disclosed.  said Sen. John Cornyn, the Senate s No. 2 Republican, as he threw his hands into the air.  Everybody s looking to [Trump] for a signal about what he wants to do. So far, it s not clear.

With one week to go, the GOP must find an agreement that can satisfy both Trump and Democratic leaders, who have only grown more emboldened since their sit-down with Trump. I ve not heard of any Republican who s sitting down and figuring out how to get this through. There s no plan,  said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). Yet there s no indication that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are even talking. Senators in both parties said they were unaware of anything cooking between the two leaders, and the often-chatty Schumer was tight-lipped when asked if there were ongoing discussions.  No comment,  he said Thursday. The House was expected to make the first move this week. House GOP leaders had planned to try and pass a bill giving $5 billion for Trump s wall and force Senate Democrats to reject it under the chamber s 60-vote threshold. But with morale and attendance low in the House following a brutal election loss last month, Republicans left Washington empty-handed, with all eyes now focused on the Senate. It s just all politics and theatrics,  said Rep Tom Cole (R-Okla.). He said leaders of both parties have the same thought going into next week s final round of negotiations:  Somebody has to lose, and it s going to not be them. 
                    Congress
                    By BURGESS EVERETTMeanwhile, Democrats say they re completely in the dark because Republican leaders haven t taken part in formal back-and-forth negotiations for more than two weeks, according to a Democratic aide. Republicans already rejected the Democratic proposal to freeze the budget of the Department of Homeland Security, including border fencing, through next October, while approving new funding for the rest of the government. But Democrats say they ve had radio silence since then from the GOP.  It s all over the place, but we just need some guidance from them,  the Democratic aide said, referring to Republicans.Privately, some GOP appropriators have been told to prepare back-up options to temporarily extend funding, though they admit they have little confidence that the bills could be signed by Trump without a cash infusion for the border wall.Some Republicans say they want to delay the decision until Jan. 3 at 11:59 p.m., the exact minute when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would take over leadership in the House. Others are pushing GOP leaders to move the deadline to Dec. 26 to give them at least a few days at home with their families for Christmas. Another idea   that some appropriators are already preparing   is a long-term funding bill that freezes funding through October 2019. We re at an impasse. Something s going to happen or we re going to have to have a [continuing resolution] or a shutdown,  Senate Appropriations chief Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) told reporters. Six of the seven spending bills are ready to go next week, which would make up nearly $200 billion in total spending. But Republican leaders in the House are refusing to put any spending package on the floor that doesn t include border wall money.

                    By MARIANNE LEVINEMeanwhile, Democratic leaders have hammered Trump for his vow that he would be  proud  to shutter one-quarter of the government   delaying paychecks for hundreds of thousands of federal workers   over the holidays.  Right now, Chuck and I are not in a negotiation. We re not going for the $5 billion for the wall, we simply are not,  Pelosi told reporters Thursday, making clear that she s already bracing for an ugly shutdown fight that could carry into the first days of the Democrats  new majority in the House.For weeks, the Senate has been mostly focused on an internally divisive criminal justice reform bill and wrapping up a debate over the U.S. involvement in the Yemeni civil war. Senate Republicans say it doesn t feel like the 2013 shutdown, when government funding lapsed for nearly three weeks as a result of a conservative gambit to defund Obamacare.  We ve talked about it almost none in our caucus. I don t even know what the two sides are talking about at this point,  said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).  It s a lot of talking past each other,  agreed Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio).Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning   in your inbox.

                    By BURGESS EVERETT12/13/2018 04:54 PM EST
                    Updated 12/13/2018 09:52 PM ESTThe Senate is moving forward on criminal justice reform. But Republicans are still fighting about it.As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) prepared on Thursday to set up next week s votes on the bill, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) sought to make last-minute changes that would reflect a compromise the bill s supporters had reached with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Cruz had endorsed the bill because it was supposed to bar many violent criminals from earning early release, but the version that was presented on Wednesday did not include all of the exclusions Cruz had been seeking even though it did change some sentencing provisions that he sought to limit leniency toward longtime offenders. Story Continued BelowLee tried to get McConnell to change them, according to multiple people familiar with the matter, but McConnell wanted to give his divided caucus at least 24 hours to review the text that had been released Wednesday. The bill s chief critic, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), joined an intense discussion with McConnell, Lee and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) on the Senate floor on Thursday afternoon, in which Lee argued that the changes should be made to increase the bill s conservative support.But the Senate will start considering a version without all of Cruz s changes and without a provision sought by supporters that would allow faith-based groups to participate in anti-recidivism programs. To get them in the bill, the legislation must be amended on the Senate floor next week. Cruz s endorsement was critical to moving the bill forward, and he has repeatedly touted that the legislation would no longer allow the early release of violent criminals. His office did not comment for this article. The kerfuffle comes as the Senate prepares to vote to advance the legislation on Monday, with the potential to complete the bill by midweek. McConnell on Thursday moved to set up votes to open up debate on the legislation, which will then be followed by a limited number of amendments. McConnell s parliamentary move fulfills a promise to President Donald Trump to consider the bill in the lame duck session after the GOP leader publicly and privately surmised that the Senate didn t have enough time to complete it. After the Senate begins debating the bill, it will ultimately take 60 votes to pass it. And an amendment from Cotton will require just 50 votes in the narrowly divided Senate.Cotton and Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) will offer an amendment to add new exclusions to people who qualify for reduced sentences, including some sex crime offenders. At a majority threshold, that amendment could be adopted to the bill unless the bill s supporters band together to fend off any changes for the carefully negotiated legislation.  It s not necessarily an easy lift, but we will defeat it. I m confident of that,  said one senator supporting the bill.  If passed, it would scuttle the carefully negotiated deal we have on this bill. So we ll have to defeat it. And we will. The senator said that many Senate Democrats would probably defect from the legislation if the Cotton amendment passed.Still, the popular legislation is on the fast track to completion if it can survive an uncertain amendment process. Most Senate Democrats support it, a significant bloc of Republicans are expected to back it, and President Donald Trump is expected to sign it if it passes the Senate and House next week ahead of the Dec. 21 partial government shutdown deadline.

But McConnell instead used Senate procedure to outmaneuver the bill s opponents. Sometimes you ve got to go alone. I m not saying it s necessarily the case here, but sometimes the majority just means the fools are on the same side,  Kennedy told reporters of his stand against it.  There are many senators who are very nervous about this bill and don t like it and are opposed to it. I think some are reluctant to say anything because of the White House. Kennedy s Louisiana colleague, GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, supports the bill and said Kennedy might eventually come around after the bill was amended to block some types of offenders from earning early release. John may decide that the amendments that have been added ... may have moved it to a place where he likes it. But I can t speak for him,  Cassidy said, noting that Kennedy wrote an editorial praising similar reforms done in Texas.Missing out on the latest scoops?

The president has yet to acquire a team to combat the expected influx of congressional investigations and continued fallout from multiple federal investigations of his associates.

But as Pro Tax s Brian Faler reports, those 24 pages are  nevertheless densely written, thick with acronyms and references to individual sections of the tax code,  and there are concerns among the nonprofit sphere that the rules will confuse groups that haven t had much interaction with the IRS in the past. There also are still some questions about whether the unpopular tax will stay on the books for long   House Republicans, who voted for the tax last year as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115), are now proposing to scrap it. But in the meantime, nonprofits are discovering that getting rid of some of their parking spots might help reduce their tax burden, and that they might have to keep better records on mundane expenditures like snow removal.     SO WHAT D I MISS?  as our third president might say. It s good to be back, after an assignment better than even spending the late 1780s in France   spending a couple months with a new Baby Tax. Today also marks 46 years since Apollo 17 s Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt, the 11th and 12th people to ever walk on the moon, started their final day s work on the lunar surface   the last time any human has spent time there. And because there should always be a tax angle: Schmitt served a single term as a GOP senator from New Mexico, and spent about a month as a member of the Finance Committee. (Former Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the Democrat who defeated Schmitt in 1982, later spent a dozen years as a tax writer.) It seems that I have a lot to catch up on.

GET IN THE ZONE: President Donald Trump on Wednesday put some extra federal heft behind Opportunity Zones, the provision from the tax law that seeks to spur investment in economically struggling areas by offering tax incentives to investors. Ben Carson, the Housing and Urban Development secretary, will head up a new White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council featuring aides from 13 agencies that will try to give a boost to the Opportunity Zone program by increasing coordination within the bureaucracy and steering existing federal initiatives toward projects, as Brian also reported. That all sounded like a pretty good idea to the program s supporters in the business community. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce  applauds the Trump administration for its commitment to ensuring the success of Opportunity Zones, and we look forward to continuing to work with Treasury to provide regulatory feedback and to maximize business investment in this initiative,  said its chief tax counsel, Caroline Harris.  What does this story really need? Why The Mooch, of course. Anthony Scaramucci, the White House communications director for 10 days last year, thinks the Opportunity Zones program could help investors in his new real estate investment trust make a lot of money, as Bloomberg reports.  We think we re going to be building a swank, boutique hotel there that s going to create excessive economic rents for the REIT,  Scaramucci said of the Moxy Hotel project in Oakland, which he said is  effectively becoming the Brooklyn Heights of San Francisco.  GOP supporters of the TCJA have pitched the zones, an idea championed by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), as one of the key examples that the tax law is helping the vast majority of Americans, and not just those at the highest end of the income spectrum. But comments like Scaramucci s   or recent reports that Jared Kushner, Trump s son-in-law and a senior White House adviser, will profit off the program   have given new lines of attack to liberals already skeptical of a program they said wasn t designed well.  One more: Practically all of Puerto Rico has been classified as an Opportunity Zone, as Bloomberg s Joe Light reports. But there s already some question about what might happen in a decade, when that designation could come to an end, given that the previous expiration of a tax break that had attracted pharmaceutical companies helped lead to the commonwealth s economic woes. 2019, HERE WE COME: It doesn t look good right now for that semi-regular congressional rite of passage   the year-end tax bill. But could this be a  wait til next year  kind of situation? Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), just weeks away from taking the House Ways and Means gavel, said Wednesday that he might make a quick strike early next year to restore at least some expired temporary tax provisions.  We certainly intend to move on them fast,  Neal said, via Tax Notes  Dylan Moroses. The current GOP chairman of the panel, Kevin Brady of Texas, took all the tax extenders out of his latest crack at a year-end tax bill.  Remember : We still don t know a lot of the Ways and Means members who might consider an extenders measure next year. Between midterm election losses and retirements, the House Ways and Means Committee will see a lot of turnover next year   with only seven in 10 incumbents returning. How does it stack up against other committees? View the full DataPoint graphic here. Want to add DataPoint to your Pro account? Learn more.  Something else for the docket? One of those incumbents, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), is introducing a bill today that would protect individual taxpayers who will underpay the IRS for this year because of withholding changes following the tax overhaul. A host of other Democratic tax writers, like Reps. Danny Davis of Illinois, Lloyd Doggett of Texas, Brian Higgins of New York and John Larson of Connecticut, are co-sponsors of the measure.  And when might they need that assistance? The start of the tax filing season   the first where the IRS and taxpayers are really grappling with all those TCJA changes   might slip into February, as your Morning Tax author reported on Wednesday. But Ken Corbin, the commissioner of the IRS s wage and investment division, said a potential government shutdown as soon as next week wouldn t itself cause any delays. (And to be fair: It s not uncommon for a filing season to kick off in at least late January   this year was Jan. 29, and 2014 s filing season started on Jan. 31.) NOW THAT S AN OPEN DOOR POLICY: Hong Kong is thinking about expanding tax breaks for hedge funds and private equity outfits, an effort that Bloomberg reports could give Hong Kong new advantages as it battles Shanghai and Singapore to reign supreme among Asian financial powers. In short, the proposal would allow private funds currently located offshore   generally for tax reasons   an exemption from a 16.5 percent tax on profits for their stakes in Hong Kong companies.  The proposed change came after many years of lobbying by Hong Kong s local asset management industry, and after the European Union labeled the city s current profits tax regime for funds as  harmful.   THE EMOJI INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX IS CONCERNED: California regulators are considering whether to tax text messages, as part of the state s efforts to give lower-income people and families better access to phone service, the Mercury News reports   calling the development   no LOL matter.  Industry groups say a new fee on text messages could cost Californians around $45 million a year, and the California Public Utilities Commission could make those charges retroactive for five years. A new commission report says that the state s budget for its Public Purpose Program meant to help low-income taxpayers has jumped by more than $300 million from 2011 to 2017, while revenues from telecommunications sources have fallen by more than $5 billion   an  unsustainable  course, according to the report. A commission spokeswoman added that new fees on texting could lead to lower fees for  voice services.  Not surprisingly, the telecom industry has all sorts of objections to this plan   including that it would give other messaging options, like through Facebook or Apple s iPhone, an unfair leg up over Verizon and AT&T.  NOT IN THESE PARTS: Montana s Supreme Court struck down the state s program allowing tax credits for donations to student scholarship funds, Pro Ed s Kimberly Hefling reports. The state s high court ruled 5-2 that the program was unconstitutional because so many of the qualifying schools are religiously affiliated, thus making it incompatible with a constitutional provision barring any public aid to religious schools. The libertarian Institute for Justice said it would appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Montana decision comes as the federal government has been grappling with how to square those types of programs, which have the backing of top Trump administration officials, with the Treasury Department s efforts to crack down on state efforts to sidestep the tax law s limits on state and local tax deductions. The Senate voted to overturn Trump administration rules that allow political nonprofits to give less information about donors to the IRS.  It s three years in prison for Michael Cohen, Trump s longtime lawyer. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) says he ll be keeping a close eye on nonprofits when he becomes Finance chairman again. Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas pushes plan to limit how much localities can levy in property taxes. Cab Calloway s song  Minnie the Moocher  won a spot in the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.

Story Continued Below VIETNAMESE FACE DEPORTATION: The Trump administration is moving to deport Vietnamese immigrants previously protected under a 2008 agreement that shielded refugees from the Vietnam War, Charles Dunst and Krishnadev Calamur report for the Atlantic.  The administration last year interpreted the 2008 agreement to allow deportation of Vietnamese immigrants who arrived prior to July 1995 (when the U.S. and Vietnam reestablished diplomatic communications) if they were criminals. Now the administration contends that the agreement allows the deportation of any pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants, Dunst and Calamur report.   We have 7,000 convicted criminal aliens from Vietnam with final orders of removal these are non-citizens who during previous administrations were arrested, convicted, and ultimately ordered removed by a federal immigration judge,  Katie Waldman, DHS spokesperson, said in a written statement to Morning Shift. A small number have already been sent back, Reuters  James Pearson reported earlier this year. More from the Atlantic here.  The Trump administration is also pushing to deport an expected 46 Cambodians this month, Charles Dunst reports for The New York Times.  Many of those being deported have few or no memories of Cambodia,  Dunst writes,  as they were part of an exodus fleeing Khmer Rouge massacres  of the late 1970s. Some deportations of Cambodians began in 2002 under a Bush-era bilateral agreement, but in 2017 the country stopped accepting deportees, prompting the Trump administration to classify Cambodia  recalcitrant  and impose sanctions. The Cambodian government relented in February, and the country resumed accepting its nationals. More from the Times here.  GOOD MORNING!

THE CARAVAN S DEMOCRACY: The 6,000 asylum-seekers massed on the U.S.-Mexico border  fashioned a proto-democracy  during their weeks of travel through Mexico, including a press shop, a council to work with immigration officials, and an internal police force, Jesus Rodriguez reports in POLITICO Magazine.   When the migrants needed to make public announcements, debate the best routes, and vote on different plans, they established a nightly general assembly as a forum open to all,  Rodriguez writes. A nine-person Governance and Dialogue Council lobbies for migrant s basic needs through civil rights groups and government watchdogs. More here. CONGRESS STRIKES #METOO DEAL:  House and Senate negotiators reached a deal Wednesday on long-stalled legislation to curb sexual harassment in Congress, a bipartisan breakthrough that comes as Capitol Hill has weathered a series of scandals,  POLITICO s Marianne LeVine and Burgess Everett report.   Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said he and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) briefed their respective caucuses on the deal Wednesday. They hope to pass it unanimously this week or next in the Senate, and send it to the House as a stand-alone bill to prevent it from getting tied up in a government shutdown fight.   The compromise holds members of Congress liable for all forms of harassment and retaliation for harassment claims but not discrimination, and requires lawmakers to reimburse the Treasury Department for settlements stemming from harassment, even if they ve left office,  LeVine and Everett report.  The legislation would also eliminate  cooling off  periods and other delays for congressional handling of harassment claims, and allows victims to quickly seek hearings or civil action on harassment allegations. The breakthrough would also create a new position in Congress to help victims of harassment and bar secretive settlements by members of Congress.  More here.   GHOSTING  THE JOB: Amid a tight labor market and strong recent gains in wage growth, workers find it easier to dodge the awkward  I quit  conversation and instead are just  ghosting  their employers as if they were bad dates, Danielle Paquette reports in the Washington Post, citing the Fed s December Beige Book (where the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago applied the term). Recruiters at global staffing firm Robert Half told Paquette they noticed a  ten to twenty percent increase  in ghosting over the past year. More from the Post here. SUIT CHALLENGING OSHA RECORDKEEPING MOVES FORWARD: A federal district court on Wednesday green-lighted advocacy groups  challenge to OSHA s suspension of certain requirements in its electronic recordkeeping rule. Public Citizen s Health Research Group, the American Public Health Association, and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists filed the suit, which argues that a June announcement from OSHA stating it would no longer accept certain forms required under the Obama-era rule altered it without proper public notice-and-comment.   The challenged agency conduct was not simply an exercise of enforcement discretion, but rather a complete suspension of a regulatory deadline subject to review,  District Judge Timothy Kelly said in an order denying the government s motion to dismiss the suit. OSHA sent to the White House Friday a proposed regulation that would formally withdraw most of the Obama rule s injury record-keeping requirements. Read the order here.

ADS TARGET TRUMP IMMIGRATION AHEAD OF 2020: The liberal advocacy group People for the American Way, in its first ad buy for the 2020 election, is airing a spot featuring images of migrant children running away from the U.S. Mexico border as they are teargassed by border agents. The idea is to mobilize Latino voters early against President Donald Trump in several key states, including Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Virginia and Florida. Watch the ad here.  SHUTDOWN IMPACT: If President Donald Trump were to shut down the government on Dec. 21 over border wall funding, 380,000 federal workers in nine agencies would be furloughed and 420,000 would work without pay, according to a projection prepared by Democratic Appropriations Committee staff.  More than 30 million U.S. small businesses employing 59 million employees would no longer have access to federally-assisted loans and technical assistance,  the minority staff warn,  as Small Business Administration guarantees to back loans would freeze.

BOLTON UNVEILS NEW AFRICA STRATEGY AT HERITAGE: White House national security adviser John Bolton unveils the Trump administration s new Africa strategy during remarks this morning at the Heritage Foundation.  The administration wants to see an increase in U.S. investment and trade as part of a strategy to counter Chinese influence on the continent, notes The Associated Press.  KEY SENATOR TALKS YEMEN AT CSIS: Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), who helped to write key certification provisions for U.S. involvement in Yemen in the fiscal 2019 defense policy bill, is scheduled to participate in a discussion on  The Humanitarian and National Security Crisis in Yemen: An Update and Path Forward,  hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. SENATE BEGINS DEBATE ON YEMEN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION:  The Senate is on the verge of passing a resolution to withdraw U.S support for Saudi-backed forces at war in Yemen, with senators predicting that at least a narrow majority will ultimately defy the Trump administration on the matter,  report POLITICO s Marianne Levine and Burgess Everett.  Most Republicans are not expected to support the resolution in a final vote, but the Senate voted 60-39 to proceed to the resolution on Wednesday afternoon, including the support of a handful of Republicans.    Even if the Senate passes the resolution, it s not going far . The House passed a rule Wednesday that appears to block consideration of any War Powers resolutions to limit the United States  involvement in Yemen.    The Senate is scheduled to vote today on seven amendments to the Yemen resolution, S.J. Res. 54, but it s unclear how those might impact a final vote, also expected today.  Still, House Foreign Affairs Committee ranking Democrat Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.),  set to chair the committee in the new Congress, promises to hold hearings next year on all aspects of Saudi behavior, including the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, via Reuters.  And House Armed Services ranking Democrat Adam Smith  (D-Wash.) also set to take over his committee in January, predicts Congress would have to target funding for U.S. military involvement in Yemen s civil war to pressure the Trump administration to change course, via our colleague Connor O Brien.  Despite the mounting criticism, President Donald Trump  reiterates his support for the Saudi crown prince, calling the country a  very good ally  during an Oval Office interview Wednesday, via POLITICO s Caitlin Oprysko.  And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo challenges the accuracy of reports the CIA is confident of the Saudi crown prince s involvement in Khashoggi death, reports The Washington Post.  The rebuke on Capitol Hill played out as negotiations between the warring sides in Yemen continued in Sweden, where a U.N. special envoy presented a draft deal, adds the AP. HASC DEMS WEIGH ELIMINATING OVERSIGHT PANEL: HASC Democrats are considering axing the committee s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee when they retake the majority next year, reports Connor. Democrats are planning tougher oversight of the Pentagon and the Trump administration s military policies, but Smith, who s in line to chair the full committee, says lawmakers are weighing other ways to beef up oversight and whether a subcommittee is even necessary.  Smith also wants legislation to allow transgender troops, but doubts its chances, via Connor. SMITH SIGNALS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT TO KEEP BORDER WALL BILLS AWAY FROM MILITARY:  Smith also predicted bipartisan support to block any attempt by the president to tap the defense budget to pay for his signature wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, also via Connor.  We can certainly put legislation in that says no Department of Defense money should go towards the wall, and that would include using our soldiers as part of the effort to build it,  Smith told reporters.  And I think there is some bipartisan support for that idea precisely because Republicans see greater defense needs.   Meanwhile, GOP leaders plot strategy on the border wall as a partial government shutdown looms, report POLITICO s Sarah Ferris and John Bresnahan.  And Trump uses the latest French terrorist attack to push for border wall funding, writes Caitlin. GAO: MILITARY AIRCRAFT READINESS GOAL  DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE : Defense Secretary Jim Mattis  order to boost mission capable rates for some aircraft above 80 percent by the end of next September will be  difficult to achieve,  a GAO official told the Senate Armed Services Committee Wednesday. Asked about the order at SASC subcommittee hearing on Navy and Marine Corps readiness, John Pendleton, a director for defense capabilities and management, said it would be  difficult to achieve.   Also at the hearing, lawmakers mourned the deaths of the six Marines killed in an aerial collision last week in the Pacific.  We have to do better, we must do better, all of us, including the Congress,  implored Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), chairman of the Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee. RUSSIA TO WITHDRAW BOMBERS FROM VENEZUELA:  Two Russian bombers that flew to Venezuela on Monday as a gesture of support for socialist President Nicol·s Maduro will leave on Friday and return to Russia, the White House said, following a diplomatic spat over the visit,  reports The Wall Street Journal.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement Wednesday the planned departure came after the Trump administration spoke with Russian officials.  DoD: UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTION INTO NORTHEAST SYRIA  UNACCEPTABLE :  The Pentagon said on Wednesday that any unilateral action into northeast Syria was of grave concern and  unacceptable,  after Turkey announced that it would launch a new military operation in the region within days to target Kurdish militia fighters,  via Reuters.   Unilateral military action into northeast Syria by any party, particularly as U.S. personnel may be present or in the vicinity, is of grave concern. We would find any such actions unacceptable,  Commander Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement.  The statement followed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan s vow  launch a new military operation against U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in Syria  within a few days,  via the AP. DoD TAPS NEW HEAD OF AIR FORCE MATERIEL COMMAND:  The Air Force s top uniformed acquisition official has been tapped to pin on his fourth star and take the reins of Air Force Materiel Command,  reports Defense News.

DON T SWEAT A SHUTDOWN   Washington is rife with drama ahead of a potential partial federal government shutdown at the end of next week as President Trump and Congressional Democrats squabble over border wall funding. Wall Street has plenty of issues right now ñ trade fights, interest rates, Brexit ñ but a brief shutdown is not likely to be among them. Story Continued BelowHistorically, Wall Street tends to freak out around potential debt limit breaches (stay tuned next summer) but ignore shutdowns that usually have only minimal impact on the economy. This one would have an even smaller impact given that it would effect only parts of the government including the Departments of Homeland Security, Agriculture, State and Justice. Functions necessary for national security would continue. Here s LPL Financial s Ryan Detrick on shutdowns and markets:  Although shutdowns get a lot of media hype, the reality is that stocks tend to take them in stride. In fact, the S&P 500 has gained during each of the five previous shutdowns   [S]hutdowns rarely push stocks significantly lower and have corresponded with a flat median return in the previous 20 shutdowns going back more than 40 years.  One would think shutdowns in December might be rare, but they re actually fairly common. Three shutdowns in the same year, however, is not. Could this year be the first since 1977 with three separate shutdowns? If [Tuesaday] s drama was any indication, the odds may have increased.   SIREN: FINANCIAL DEREGULATION PACKAGE MAY BE DOOMED   Our Zachary Warmbrodt this a.m.:  One of the House s major bipartisan achievements this year -- a sweeping financial deregulation package negotiated by Democrat Maxine Waters and Republican Jeb Hensarling -- may be doomed.  As Congress prepares to leave town in the coming days, Democrats are opposing efforts to attach the legislation to a year-end government funding bill. GOP Senate leadership hasn t scheduled a standalone vote, which some expect would fail. The stalemate comes as disagreements have cropped up among lawmakers and the Trump administration over a number of provisions in the bill, which the House passed on a 406-4 vote in July. Hensarling is willing to negotiate, but that may not be enough.  More for Pros here.  PELOSI CLOSES IN ON THE GAVEL   Our Heather Caygle, Rachael Bade, and John Bresnahan:  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi struck a deal with Democratic rebels intent on denying her the speakership in a major step toward reclaiming the gavel ..  The California Democrat has agreed to limit her time as speaker to four years at most. In return, several lawmakers who vowed to vote against her in the critical Jan. 3 House floor vote will support her ascent to the position she held eight years ago.  Read more.  MEADOWS OUT FOR CHIEF OF STAFF   Our Andrew Restuccia:  Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, is no longer under consideration to be President Donald Trump s chief of staff.   Meadows, a staunch Trump ally, had been a top contender for the position after Nick Ayers   the president s first choice to replace John Kelly, who Trump said last weekend would be leaving at the end of the year   turned it down.  Meadows had signaled his interest in recent days, despite early reports that he was telling confidants he didn t want the job. But ultimately, the White House said, the president thought it best for him to remain in Congress, where he can continue to be a strong outside defender of the administration.    SO WHO WILL IT BE?    Among those who have been talked about for the position: David Bossie, a former Trump campaign deputy manager; former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey; Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget; U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; and Republican fundraiser Wayne Berman. Mulvaney and Mnuchin have both signaled to the White House that they are not interested in the job.  Read more.  BREXIT IMPACT   University of Michigan s Kyle Handley in a new NBER paper:  Increases in the probability of Britain s exit from the European Union   reduce bilateral export values and trade participation. These effects are increasing in trade policy risk across products and asymmetric for UK and EU exporters.  We estimate that a persistent doubling of the probability of Brexit at the average disagreement tariff of 4.5% lowers EU-UK bilateral export values by 15 log points on average, and more so for EU than UK exporters.

MAY SURVIVES   Our  Charlie Cooper and Annabelle Dickson in London:  British Prime Minister Theresa May won a vote of confidence in her leadership on Wednesday, with 200 votes in favor and 117 votes against, senior Conservative MP Graham Brady said.  The vote was triggered after Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, received letters from 48 Conservative MPs expressing no confidence in May s leadership. Most of those who have publicly declared they want May out are hardline Brexiteers, who say her Brexit deal with the EU keeps Britain tied too closely to the bloc. May s victory means she cannot face another confidence vote from Conservative MPs for another year.  Read more.  FISCAL WARNING   Via Moody s:  The United States  (Aaa stable) fiscal strength is set to gradually decline from 2019 onward, driven by widening federal budget deficits, a rising debt burden and falling debt affordability.   [A]bsent any material changes in the direction of fiscal policy, a persistent widening of fiscal deficits will push the federal debt and interest burdens to historic levels, which will ultimately weigh on the sovereign credit profile.

The overwhelming bipartisan vote for the bill caps an eight-month fight over the legislation, marking a quick turnaround for House and Senate negotiators who were deadlocked in efforts to resolve a dispute over food stamps as recently as a few weeks ago.

SHUTDOWN LOOMS   Our Sarah Ferris and John Bresnahan:  House GOP leaders are wrestling with how exactly they re going to keep the government open through Christmastime   while also affirming support for   Trump s border wall   in the final weeks of their majority.  One option Speaker Paul Ryan and his deputies are considering is a short-term bill that fully funds Trump s $5 billion wall request, but freezes the rest of federal spending through early 2019, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations. That stopgap package would also include billions of dollars for California s deadly wildfire season, as well as other natural disasters. A broader, full-year funding package is also under discussion that includes $5 billion for the border wall  Read more.  SEC DEVELOPING CRYPTO GUIDANCE   Our Patrick Temple-West:  The Securities and Exchange Commission is developing guidance for cryptocurrencies that is likely to be published early next year, an agency official said today. Jonathan Ingram, deputy chief counsel in the SEC s division of corporation finance, said the guidance is intended to help the industry determine if a particular digital asset is a security.  If it is deemed a security, then the guidance would detail what a business should do to comply with securities regulations, he said.  We re shooting for early next year for publication of that guidance,  Ingram said at an event at the District of Columbia Bar.  Read more. WALL STREET ENDS HIGHER   AP s Marley Jay:  U.S. stocks couldn t hang on to a big gain Wednesday, but they still finished broadly higher as technology and health care companies rose. That helped reverse some of the market s big losses from the week before. Stocks initially rallied after the Wall Street Journal reported that China s government could make changes to its  Made in China 2025  economic development plan. That could be one step toward easing dispute between the world s two largest economies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged as much as 458 points in morning trading, but gave later back much of that gain.    After taking steep losses at the end of last week, stocks have gyrated this week: on Monday they rallied to erase a big early loss, while on Tuesday a big morning gain turned into a small decline. On Wednesday, most of the day s gains evaporated in the afternoon. The hour-to-hour changes reflect investors  nervousness about the health of the global economy: economic growth is expected to slow in 2019 and the U.S.-China trade dispute and rising interest rates could both make that slowdown more painful. Sonders said investors overlooked those threats for a time, but can t ignore them anymore.  Read more.  STOCK VALUATIONS AT FIVE-YEAR LOW   WSJ s Mike Bird:  The stumble in global equity markets this year has outrun a moderation in expectations for earnings growth, leaving stock valuations at their cheapest in about half a decade by some measures. The forward price to earnings ratio for global stocks is at five-year lows, having dropped to about 13.3 times. That s down from more than 16 times in early 2018, according to FactSet s World stock index, which includes tens of thousands of listed securities around the world. The price to earnings ratio is a favorite among analysts and investors for valuing companies.  Read more.  YIELD CURVE TO INVERT IN 2019, RECESSION TO FOLLOW   Reuters  Hari Kishan:  The U.S. Treasury yield curve will invert next year, possibly within the next six months, much earlier than forecast just three months ago, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday. Those expectations come on the heels of a deep sell-off in global stocks and the flattening of the U.S. yield curve, with the gap between longer-dated and shorter-dated yields narrowing to its smallest in more than a decade.  Some maturities on the curve, notably yields on 2- to 5-year notes have already flipped. An inversion between 2- and 10-year yields is a closely watched signal as that has preceded almost all the American recessions off the past half century.  Read more.  And many financial officers agree   WSJ s Sharon Nunn:  Almost half of U.S. chief financial officers believe a recession will strike the U.S. economy by the end of 2019, with the tight labor market and growing trade tensions driving economic jitters among corporate America. Additionally, more than 80 percent of U.S. CFOs think a recession will strike by the end of 2020, according to the Duke University/CFO Global Business Outlook survey released Wednesday.   All of the ingredients are in place: a waning expansion that began in June 2009   almost a decade ago   heightened market volatility, the impact of growth-reducing protectionism, and the ominous flattening of the yield curve which has predicted recessions accurately over the past 50 years,  said Campbell Harvey, a director of the survey.

Bloomberg s Sydney Maki and Austin Weinstein:  Strategists in the $5.1 trillion-a-day currency market are gearing up for a slumping dollar next year, while pinning their hopes for 2019 gains on the yen.  A major driver of the dollar s decline could be a downturn in the U.S. economy, especially in the second half of the year, JPMorgan Asset Management predicted. Others expect the Federal Reserve to slow down interest-rate increases, which they see as bearish for the greenback. Rising market volatility and capital demand abroad will also spur an outflow of funds from the U.S., according to Morgan Stanley strategists. Whatever the reason, a popular view is for a dimmer dollar. The greenback is 10 percent to 15 percent overvalued, according to Morgan Stanley.  Read more. BANKS GET GENTLER TREATMENT UNDER TRUMP   WSJ s Lalita Clozel:  After years of acrimony, the nation s top banking regulators are seeking a detente with the firms they oversee. Two Trump-appointed officials have spent several months touring the country, visiting bank examiners in regional offices and asking them to adopt a less-aggressive tone when flagging risky practices and pressing firms to change their behavior.  The officials   the Federal Reserve s Randal Quarles and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. s Jelena McWilliams   aim to change policy in a subtle but significant way and reshape regulators  relationship with banks, which officials have said was too contentious during the Obama years that followed the financial crisis. Changing the supervision culture  will be the least visible thing I do and it will be the most consequential thing I do,  Mr. Quarles, the Fed s vice chairman for supervision and regulatory point person, said in an interview.  The banks should feel that their supervisor is going to be firm but fair.   Read more.  NATIONAL DEBT SURGING AT FASTEST PACE SINCE 2012   Bloomberg s Alexandre Tanzi:  U.S. government debt is on track this year to rise at the fastest pace since 2012, as a stronger economy fails to keep pace with the wave of red ink that s rising under the Trump administration. Total public debt outstanding has jumped by $1.36 trillion, or 6.6 percent, since the start of 2018, and by $1.9 trillion since President Donald Trump took office, according to the latest Treasury Department figures. The latter figure is roughly the size of Brazil s gross domestic product.  If this year s growth rate is sustained through the end of the year, it would be the biggest jump in percentage terms since the last year of President Barack Obama s first term, at a time when the economy needed fiscal stimulus in the aftermath of the financial crisis. As of Monday, the nation s debt stood at a record $21.9 trillion.  Read more.

The accord is a major triumph for Pelosi, who has spent the past several weeks engaged in a full-court lobbying campaign to line up the remaining votes she needed to clinch the speakership,  Heather, Rachael and Bres report. The deal wins Pelosi the votes of seven critics who had previously pledged to oppose her in a Jan. 3 floor vote.  The proposal will come up for a vote before Feb. 15,  they write.  Even if it fails, Pelosi has promised to abide by the rules as if they were enacted.  And the Democratic leader won t retaliate against those who do vote against her.  As speaker, Pelosi has the power to make the lives of her adversaries miserable,  they note.  She can keep members from serving on their favored panels, refuse to move their legislation and make them ineffective in other ways.  But the group of rebel Democrats urged her to pledge not to. Story Continued BelowThe agreement, which would be retroactive and impose term limits on the other top two Democratic leaders, will likely set off a heated debate inside the Democratic Caucus.  Term limits is one of the most controversial and divisive issues for House Democrats, often pitting members against each other along both generational and racial lines,  they add. Incoming Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), who opposes term limits, told reporters this week that Pelosi wasn t negotiating for him. And incoming Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) expressed concern that term limits could have an adverse effect on young black lawmakers.

The House is now poised to leave town [today] for five days without offering a clue to how it would avoid a crippling funding lapse for roughly a dozen agencies,  Sarah and Bres report.  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has cautioned members that they may need to come back Monday and Tuesday for a last-minute session on funding bills. But even Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, the House GOP s spending chief, said Wednesday he was in the dark. GOP leaders are discussing hard-line spending tactics that back up President Donald Trump s demands for $5 billion in border wall funding.  Those ideas, though, would do nothing to resolve the bitter standoff with Democrats that threatens a shutdown,  they note.  But any House bill along these lines -- even if it could pass -- would almost certainly be rejected by Senate Democrats.   Either House option would also have to account for the GOP s attendance problem in the final weeks of the lame-duck session.  Dozens of Republicans have skipped votes since returning after the election.

THE SENATE S STOPPER -- He stopped immigration reform as a House freshman in 2013. And he s helped tank a nuclear deal with Iran, another immigration reform effort, a border tax plan and early versions of GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare. But Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) may have met his match in criminal justice reform.  Cotton is trying to use the same hard-edged tactics he deployed in the past to beat back the bill, arguing that Republican supporters will be held accountable if someone let out of prison under the bill s terms commits a serious crime,  Burgess writes.  The bill s backers have accommodated some of Cotton s critiques, moving to fill potential loopholes that could make violent offenders eligible for earlier release,  he continues.  But now that the bill is finished and moving forward, some of Cotton s colleagues say he s already lost and his political arguments are falling flat.

Most Republicans are not expected to support the resolution in a final vote, but the Senate voted 60-39 to proceed to the resolution on Wednesday afternoon, including the support of a handful of Republicans,  Marianne and Burgess report.  Senators said Wednesday they were hopeful they would finish the measure up soon and avoid a lengthy debate over the issue so they could move on to criminal justice reform and funding the government. Supporters are optimistic they have the votes to pass the resolution. But even if they do, the measure won t go far.  The House passed a rule Wednesday that appears to block consideration of any War Powers resolutions to limit the United States  involvement in Yemen,  they note.  The White House also warned last month that Trump would likely veto the resolution, stating that it  would harm bilateral relationships in the region and negatively impact the ability of the United States to prevent the spread of violent extremist organizations.

They hope to pass it unanimously this week or next in the Senate, and send it to the House as a stand-alone bill to prevent it from getting tied up in a government shutdown fight,  Marianne and Burgess report.

[P]arty officials have not publicly backed away from their support of his candidacy. But Republican support for the bill seems to reflect the increasing sense on the part of both parties that a new election is becoming increasingly likely. It s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper will sign the legislation, which could open the door for outgoing Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.) to run for his seat again. Privately, Republicans have also considered former Gov.

                    Updated 12/13/2018 11:06 AM ESTGood Thursday morning, Illinois. Um. Who knew Andy Shaw s son-in-law was Chris Hayes? Check it outMayoral candidate Jerry Joyce has dropped his petition challenge against Bill Daley, but not without a parting shot about finding  a widespread pattern of forgery and fraud in the petitions.  Joyce says it s just too difficult to track down the circulators. With that challenge removed, Daley is assured a spot on the Feb. 26 ballot.Story Continued BelowIt s the latest chapter in a relationship that reads like a Shakespearean play.Daley s brother, former Mayor Richard M. Daley, and Joyce s father, Jeremiah Joyce, were longtime friends and allies. They overlapped serving in the state Senate. Later, not much went on in Daley s City Hall without Joyce nearby. The elder Joyce would eventually secure a lucrative concessions contract at O Hare Airport and hold on to that through Daley s administration. In 2011, newly elected Mayor Rahm Emanuel stripped the contract from Joyce; the Daley pal fought the move all the way to the Illinois Supreme Court and lost.Fast forward to Emanuel s 2015 re-election and Mike Joyce one of Jerry Joyce s brothers threw down the gauntlet. He backed Chuy Garcia, knowing the Daleys were behind Emanuel. The Daley-Joyce friendship was severed, ala Montague and Capulet.Now comes the junior Jerry Joyce, a resident of the 19th Ward and a former state s attorney now in private practice.Joyce got in to the race while Emanuel was still the candidate to beat. Once the mayor dropped out, Joyce seemed to redirect his venom toward Daley, though Joyce denies that. His campaign withdrew the challenge to Daley about an hour after POLITICO called for this story.  It s not personal,  he said.  I would never encourage volunteers to put their time and effort into a cause that wasn t doing anything but doing right by the city. Daley s camp called Joyce s challenge  vague and sloppy,  adding:  The 1980s are over and this type of politics will eventually end. Joyce isn t the only one who s seemed to have an axe to grind in the mayor s race. Former Police Chief Garry McCarthy said this week he s still trying to prosecute Emanuel over handling of the Laquan McDonald shooting. And Troy LaRaviere, the fired Chicago Public Schools principal, came out swinging against the mayor when he started his campaign. He s since dropped out.Mayor Rahm Emanuel s plan to pay down the city s $28 billion pension debt drew criticism from some mayoral candidates. And Gov.-elect J.B. Pritzker said voters won t have the stomach to change the constitution to reduce public workers  pension benefits a key point of Emanuel s plan.Not everyone, though, was so skeptical. Institutional investors from three different out-of-state firms all with stakes in the city attended Wednesday s City Council meeting to hear Emanuel s plan. They spoke to POLITICO and a few financial reporters on condition of anonymity. The investors agreed they were  cautiously optimistic  about Emanuel s proposal.They said bonding isn t a stand-alone solution but could be a piece of a broader, comprehensive plan, as Emanuel has laid out.So what about the possibility of locking up revenue?  It s a drawback, but it s hard to view these things in black and white,  said one of the investors.  If it improves the overall credit of the city, that s also something to consider. We re in the midst of a change in the administration.  We don t know who the next mayor will be, who the next COO will be. Those questions are extremely important as to whether the disciplines will be maintained,  said another investor. And the third added:  Bonding part of it depends if the next administration maintains the same level of fiscal discipline that this administration does. Does it mean the next administration won t be able to wiggle out of the plan?  You can take the pension holiday, but you can t take the principal-on-the-interest-payment holiday,  an investor said.  That s catastrophic. So moving it over to a more formal legal structure, I think has a lot of advantages. Of course, there are risks, but there are some benefits to it.  HT to Caitlin Devitt of Debtwire Municipals, for spotting the investors as they slipped out of the City Council chambers.Details:Mayor Rahm Emanuel pushes public pension fix to City Council, including legalized marijuana, Chicago casino, constitutional amendment.  Asked afterward why he waited so long to make his proposal and why he thinks the next occupant of the mayor s office will listen, Emanuel argued he has been trying to cope with the looming problem since he took office. And without naming his predecessor Mayor Richard M. Daley, Emanuel contrasted his approach with the prior administration s, saying it s  the responsible thing to do  to leave the next mayor some possible solutions,  report Tribune s John Byrne and Bill Ruthhart.

Her emailed statement said:  In light of several unknown and troubling factors that I was not privy to during the campaign, I am unable to effectively continue in this role. I wish her the best in her endeavor.  Reached by POLITICO, Kucera declined to explain the memo, citing a nondisclosure agreement. She said she supports Enyia s campaign and reiterated she wishes the mayoral candidate  the best. Enyia s campaign followed with its own statement, saying,  As we step into the next and final stage of this campaign, internal transitions and shifts are to be expected. We are excited for the opportunity to expand our growing team ahead of this critical next phase of work, and we remain grateful to all of our colleagues, past and present, for the exceptional work they ve done thus far. Enyia was a little known candidate until Chance the Rapper endorsed her and Kanye West gave her $200,000 to get her campaign off the ground.

                            Half of the Democrats who vowed to never support Nancy Pelosi for speaker are now supporting her. | Alex Wong/Getty ImagesTWENTY-FOUR DAYS AGO, 16 Democrats -- 14 men and two women -- wrote a letter to their Democratic colleagues saying that they were  committed to voting for new leadership in both our Caucus meeting and on the House Floor. LESS THAN ONE MONTH LATER, NANCY PELOSI flipped eight of them -- plus one more who signed on later -- and that put her on the brink of winning the speakership. Half of the people who vowed to never support Nancy Pelosi are now supporting her.THE FLIPPERS: Bill Foster (Ill.), Brian Higgins (N.Y.), Seth Moulton (Mass.), Stephen Lynch (Mass.), Ed Perlmutter (Colo.), Filemon Vela (Texas), Linda S·nchez (Calif.), Tim Ryan (Ohio) and Gil Cisneros (Calif.).THE COST: Support for term limits for the three senior members of Democratic leadership: Pelosi, 79-year-old Steny Hoyer of Maryland and 78-year-old Jim Clyburn of South Carolina. If the proposal passes -- it will come up for discussion and a vote by Feb. 15 -- Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn can serve in leadership only until the beginning of 2021. They could serve one more term -- until the beginning of 2023 -- if they are able to get two-thirds support of the caucus. Pelosi will be 82 at the beginning of 2023.PELOSI SAID she was  comfortable with the proposal and it is my intention to abide by it whether it passes or not.  Pelosi s full statementTHERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANCE that this proposal will not pass. HOYER has said he isn t for it, as have some members of the Congressional Black Caucus. BUT   There are 63 freshmen, many of whom would like to see more churn atop the caucus.BOTTOM LINE: Pelosi said over the summer she was going to be a transitional leader. She filled up her leadership team with new people. This now puts some weight behind that. Good Thursday morning. ON THE SHUTDOWN   HOUSE REPUBLICANS are torn about whether to vote on the $5 billion border wall bill. They are afraid it might fail.REPUBLICANS DITCH TRUMP ON HIS SHUTDOWN   WAPO S ERICA WERNER, SEAN SULLIVAN and SEUNG MIN KIM:   I don t understand the ≠strategy, but maybe he s figured it out and he ll tell us in due course,  said John Cornyn (Tex.), the No. 2 Senate Republican.  But I don t understand it.     John Thune (S.D.), the third-ranking GOP senator, said there was no scenario under which he would be proud to shut down the government.  It would not be good,  Thune said. Pressed on whether Trump s comments were helpful to the negotiations, Thune answered obliquely.  The president has his own style and way of negotiating,  he said.  The only thing I would say is, it s just simple math   that you ve to got to get 60 votes in the Senate, and that s going to require Democrats.     House GOP leaders claimed Wednesday to have the votes [to pass $5 billion in wall funding], but some questioned the wisdom of holding a vote that would face certain rejection in the Senate. And the risky proposition would come in the waning days of a lame-duck session, when it could be difficult to corral scores of defeated and retiring House Republicans who have been showing up only intermittently to vote.  Do we have the votes for a measure that includes $5 billion for the wall? Yes,  said Rep. Patrick T. McHenry (N.C.), a member of the House GOP leadership.  The question of whether to do it is a question of wisdom and strategy and tactics, and it s highly debatable about whether that s the right move.   WaPo-- SARAH FERRIS and JOHN BRESNAHAN:  GOP leaders still lack funding plan as shutdown looms :  The House is now poised to leave town Thursday for five days without offering a clue to how it would avoid a crippling funding lapse for roughly a dozen agencies.   Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has cautioned members that they may need to come back Monday and Tuesday for a last-minute session on funding bills. But even Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, the House GOP s spending chief, said Wednesday he was in the dark.  POLITICOThe 2020 Election. The New Congress. The Mueller Investigation.

Some of these steps mark a turn in the Senate s willingness to stand up to President Trump   at least on foreign policy matters   and some are important but symbolic gestures by frustrated senators. Another could deliver Trump a key domestic policy win on bipartisan sentencing restructuring. Regardless of the motives, rank-and-file senators have employed a mix of unique techniques, old-fashioned threats and insider persuasion to spark debates that had been blocked or delayed. It has left McConnell (R-Ky.) with a seemingly looser hold on power, which could translate into more opportunities next year for Democrats and any GOP allies willing to oppose Trump.

The tech giant, based in Cupertino, Calif., said it would open new offices in Seattle, San Diego and Culver City, Calif. adding more than 1,000 employees in each place. It also plans to add hundreds of jobs in Pittsburgh, New York, Boulder, Colo., Boston and Portland, Ore., over the next three years. In Austin, where the iPhone maker already employs more than 6,000 people, the new 133-acre campus will initially accommodate 5,000 additional employees, with the capacity to grow to 15,000, with new jobs covering engineering, research and development, operations, finance, sales and customer support.

James Inhofe (R-Okla.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, reported purchasing tens of thousands of dollars of stock in one of the nation s top defense contractors. After The Daily Beast asked about the purchase, Inhofe s office said the senator had contacted his financial adviser to cancel the transaction and instructed him to avoid defense and aerospace purchases going forward.

But Mr. Trump s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was in Manama, Bahrain, on Tuesday, meeting with the king and the interior minister of an important United States ally in the Middle East.  The government-run Bahrain News Agency featured a photo of Mr. Giuliani meeting in a royal palace with King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa. The story said the king discussed  Bahraini-U.S. relations  with Mr. Giuliani, who was described as leading a  high-level U.S. delegation.  But Mr. Giuliani was not in Bahrain, a country with a record of human rights abuses, on official business.  He was there to seek a lucrative security consulting contract with the government. The trip was part of a concerted push Mr. Giuliani has undertaken in the last few weeks to win business from governments around the world   including in Africa and South America   for a firm he owns called Giuliani Security and Safety. ...  I m probably the most ethical person you ever met,  he said.  NYTTHE INVESTIGATIONS -- DARREN SAMUELSOHN:  A  loud gong : National Enquirer s surprise deal could imperil Trump :  The National Enquirer s parent company has agreed to tell prosecutors everything it knows about Donald Trump   and it might know a lot. In a court document released Wednesday, the tabloid publisher, American Media Inc., admitted to coordinating a hush-money payment with Trump s 2016 campaign, reversing two years of denials.  The confession came as part of an immunity agreement with the U.S. attorney s office in New York, made public shortly after Trump s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison over charges of tax fraud, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress. But the disclosure might just be scratching the surface. Based on court documents and a plethora of media reports, Trump and his aides have worked for years with the tabloid to kill incriminating stories. AMI s CEO David Pecker also had a decades-long copacetic friendship with Trump.  POLITICO-- JUST POSTED:  Get Ready for Mueller s Phase Two: The Middle East Connection,  by The Daily Beast s Erin Banco:  In court filings that are set to drop in early 2019, prosecutors will begin to unveil Middle Eastern countries  attempts to influence American politics, three sources familiar with this side of the probe told The Daily Beast. In other words, the so-called  Russia investigation  is set to go global. ... Now, according to those same sources, the Special Counsel s Office is ready to outline what cooperating witnesses have told them about foreigners  plans to help Trump win the presidency. Two sources with knowledge of the probe said Mueller s team has for months discussed the possibility of issuing new charges on this side of the investigation.

The measure opens the door for Republicans to consider replacing Mark Harris, their candidate in the disputed race in the Ninth Congressional District.  The bill, backed by substantial majorities among both parties, could eventually place Republicans in the awkward position of choosing whether to stick with Mr. Harris, who appeared to have narrowly won a primary and general election   both now buffeted by allegations of irregularities including tainted absentee ballots   or replace him on the ballot.

The report is the most thorough investigation yet of how white supremacist ideology helped shape the Southern Baptist Convention and, by extension, evangelical Christianity in America. Among the report s findings are that all four founders of Southern Seminary, which was established in 1859, owned slaves and early faculty and trustees defended the practice as  righteous ; during the Civil War, the seminary supported the Confederacy; and, once the War was over, the seminary opposed racial equality well into the 20th century. School officials said they believed it was the first time a U.S. seminary had made such an investigation into its past.  WSJMEDIAWATCH --  Tribune, Tronc And Beyond: A Slur, A Secret Payout And A Looming Sale,  by NPR s David Folkenflik:  Several months after taking control of the troubled Tribune Publishing Co. in 2016, Chicago investor Michael Ferro convened a session of corporate leaders from within his own news empire, including chief news executives from such storied papers as the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune and The Baltimore Sun. ... At the dinner, as at other moments, [Michael] Ferro railed against those who he felt were impeding him   including perceived rivals and competitors. Among them: the Southern California billionaire and civic leader Eli Broad, whom Ferro called part of a  Jewish cabal  that ran Los Angeles. This account of the evening is based on interviews with two attendees who separately say they heard Ferro make those remarks. A spokesman for Ferro denied the incident occurred and called the claim  reckless allegations.   Early this year, however, Tribune Publishing made the first in a series of secret payments to total more than $2.5 million to avert a threatened lawsuit filed by a fired newspaper executive [Davan Maharaj], according to three people with knowledge of the deal. That had the effect of keeping Ferro s anti-Semitic slur out of the public spotlight.   At moments of frustration, Ferro also urged his editors to devote negative coverage to people he saw as obstacles in business, including competitors and even fellow investors, according to four former colleagues who say they witnessed him do so.

How he got his start in politics:  I was politically interested in high school, but it wasn t until I was a student at Georgetown during Bill Clinton s 1992 campaign that I became politically inspired. But I still didn t think of it as a career. Then, right out of college, I took a job as a paralegal at a Wall Street law firm while waiting to take the Foreign Service exam. I hated every single minute of it.  After one particularly terrible day at the office, I came home, popped open a beer, made a sandwich and turned on the TV. It was Election Day 1994, and I watched as my party got decimated. When I saw political heroes of mine like Mario Cuomo and Ann Richards lose, I said to myself,  This is what I need to do with my life.

                        The first-term senator has defeated a series of bills he despises. But he may not be able to stop criminal justice reform.
                    By BURGESS EVERETT12/13/2018 05:04 AM ESTAs a House freshman in 2013, Tom Cotton sat in the Capitol as GOP lawmakers went back and forth on whether to take up immigration reform. When Cotton s turn came to speak, he ripped the proposal   and helped spark a conservative revolt that killed the bipartisan bill. Since moving to the Senate two years later, the Arkansas Republican has also helped tank a nuclear deal with Iran, a different immigration reform deal, a border tax plan backed by Paul Ryan and early versions of the GOP s Obamacare repeal. Story Continued BelowCotton has shown a flair for stopping things he opposes, dictating his party s agenda to a remarkable degree considering his limited time in Congress. His close alliance with President Donald Trump has further boosted his influence. But he may have met his match in criminal justice reform   which has been endorsed by Trump and a large bloc of the Senate GOP caucus. A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

We shouldn t release serious and repeat-violence felons, which is what the bill will do. It will be bad for anyone who votes for it,  Cotton said in an interview Wednesday. Political strategists  think this bill will be as toxic as immigration. Or more so. You re not going to be insulated from it  just because the president backs it. Still, Cotton s crusade against the bill, which relaxes some federal sentencing guidelines and encourages anti-recidivism programs, was dealt a serious blow on Tuesday when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced plans to bring it to the floor. Trump and his son-in-law, White House official Jared Kushner, had been leaning on Republican leaders for weeks to bring the prison and sentencing reform bill up.  We re getting a lump of coal for Christmas,  said one Cotton political ally. Yet Cotton is going to continue his opposition, saying he won t allow quick passage unless he gets votes on amendments that could rupture the bill s fragile coalition. The government is set to enter a partial shutdown next Friday without bipartisan action, and Cotton could drag out the debate on criminal justice reform until just before that deadline if he so wishes.  If Democrats and the Republicans that support this bill are too scared to vote on these amendments, maybe they should think twice about bringing up such a dangerous bill in the first place,  he said. The bill s backers have accommodated some of Cotton s critiques, moving to fill potential loopholes that could make violent offenders eligible for earlier release. But now that the bill is finished and moving forward, some of Cotton s colleagues say he s already lost and his political arguments are falling flat. Asked whether Cotton has any hope of derailing the bill, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) replied:  Uh, no.   I like Sen. Cotton but that argument? Taking it to its logical conclusion, you never let anybody out for anything,  Graham said of the idea Republicans will be blamed for early release of repeat offenders.  I understand that Sen. Cotton feels strongly about this bill. So do a lot of other members   who think this is a good bill that will improve our criminal justice system,  said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who has argued with Cotton about the bill on Twitter.  It s not a  jailbreak.  It s not going to result in a crime wave.

                    By BURGESS EVERETT Most of the president s close allies in the Senate, from Graham to GOP Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and David Perdue of Georgia have backed the prison and sentencing reform. But despite their disagreement, a person who knows both Trump and Cotton said it hasn t yet affected their relationship. Cotton agreed:  The president is well aware of where I stand on the issue and respects my stance.  At a minimum, Cotton s argument holds sway with more than a dozen GOP senators who are undecided or oppose the bill. It s certainly not enough to stop the bill on a final vote, but it s a significant number given McConnell s reluctance to divide his conference on the floor. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) conceded of Cotton:  He s a good stopper.  But Durbin said he can t imagine him winning this bout. Even as the bill s advocates presented whip counts showing more than 70 votes to pass the legislation, the internal GOP fight continued behind closed doors on Wednesday. At a party lunch, Cotton and Lee argued about whether the bill was actually finished and how substantive the changes have been, according to multiple attendees. Shortly thereafter, the bill was officially released. It immediately hit a roadblock as Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a Cotton ally, said he will not allow it to come to the floor quickly. Kennedy hasn t decided whether he dislikes this version as much as previous iterations that would be improved with a  shredder,  but he needs time to digest it.  I need to know what s in the bill before I m asked to vote on it. And that will undoubtedly upset some people. But they need to call somebody who cares,  Kennedy said. Kennedy s move to slow the bill could make it more difficult to complete before the government funding deadline. But advocates say if the Senate has the will to complete the bill, they should work through attacks on the policies and politics.  We ve been through this. Painstakingly gone through this start to finish,  Durbin said of their compromise.  But we ll undoubtedly prevail. And hopefully we can fend off amendments.  The latest version of the legislation makes more categories of offenders ineligible to earn  good time  credits for early release, though Cotton argues there are still too many gaps in the bill that allow serious criminals to win early release. But the bill s supporters say it won t just automatically allow the release of people just because they are eligible.  It s not just because there s an offer of a lower sentence or release that they will be granted that,  said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a sponsor of the bill.

                    By HEATHER CAYGLE, RACHAEL BADE and JOHN BRESNAHANBut some Senate Republicans are still caught between Cotton s argument and that of the pro-reform crowd.  We have too many nonviolent people that are sent to prison and come out a criminal. But I want to protect the streets from violent criminals,  said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), one of a handful of Republicans still agonizing over the bill. Added Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.):  It s obvious Sen. Cotton doesn t like the bill. It s very clear. I m waiting to see what s in the bill.  Cotton says he s seen enough to know he hates it, blasting out news releases identifying 35 types of violent criminals he says are still eligible for release. And in the interview, he said even if he doesn t win the fight, he s still made his foes respond to his latest campaign.  They ve already yielded to a lot of my proposals even though they suggested at the time they were wrong or fake news,  Cotton said.  Every proposal I am making would make the bill less dangerous to public safety, whether it passes or whether it fails.  Eliana Johnson contributed to this report. Missing out on the latest scoops?

                        House Republicans are eager to give Trump his wall, but it s not clear how they ll get there amid low morale among departing GOP lawmakers.

                    Updated 12/12/2018 06:35 PM ESTTop House Republicans are at a standstill on exactly how to keep the government open next week amid mounting fears of a Christmastime shutdown on Capitol Hill. House GOP leaders couldn t agree on a funding strategy   which involves billions of dollars for President Donald Trump s border wall   in multiple rounds of talks Wednesday. Story Continued BelowThe House is now poised to leave town Thursday for five days without offering a clue to how it would avoid a crippling funding lapse for roughly a dozen agencies. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has cautioned members that they may need to come back Monday and Tuesday for a last-minute session on funding bills. But even Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, the House GOP s spending chief, said Wednesday he was in the dark.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and his deputies are discussing several hard-line spending tactics that would assert support for Trump s $5 billion wall request. Those ideas, though, would do nothing to resolve the bitter standoff with Democrats that threatens a shutdown at midnight Dec. 21.One option Ryan and his deputies are considering is a short-term bill that fully funds Trump s $5 billion wall request but freezes the rest of federal spending through early 2019, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations. That stopgap package would also include billions of dollars to help people harmed by California s deadly wildfire season and other natural disasters. A broader, full-year funding package also under discussion includes $5 billion for the border wall, as well as six other GOP-backed spending bills jammed with red meat for conservatives. That omnibus would also include disaster aid.But any House bill along these lines   even if it could pass   would almost certainly be rejected by Senate Democrats.Meanwhile, GOP leaders have just nine days before one-quarter of the federal government shuts down, a scenario that Trump himself has been stoking on national television.A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

House Republicans face a real morale problem after last month s Election Day drubbing, and dozens of GOP lawmakers have already skipped multiple votes on their way out.GOP leaders discussed the strategy at a Wednesday afternoon meeting but emerged without a path forward.Failing to secure the votes would be the ultimate humiliation for GOP leaders: watching Trump s border wall funding bill die in a Republican-dominated House, just as Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) predicted to Trump himself on Tuesday.Leadership is under escalating pressure from the party s right flank to vote on a $5 billion border wall bill after Tuesday s extraordinary exchange in the Oval Office, when Pelosi told Trump that he does not have enough votes in the House to pass such a bill. But there s also a concern that the GOP s moderates, many of whom feel that their losses hinged on Trump, will feel zero need to take a final stand on the wall.
                    Congress 
                    By BURGESS EVERETT and JOHN BRESNAHANRepublicans have, so far, done little more than discuss the bill, and have yet to begin a formal whipping operation across the GOP Conference   to the consternation of conservative lawmakers and aides.One day after the White House meeting, Democratic leaders said they were still waiting on the GOP s next move, according to a Democratic aide. Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado, a moderate Republican who lost on Election Day, said Republicans almost have to vote for a stopgap spending bill that includes $5 billion in wall money after Pelosi s taunts. While he prefers to enact new appropriations bills, he d back a continuing resolution plus wall money to bolster the party s hand in negotiations. It s not my preference, but from a point of negotiation I think it s important for Republicans in the House to make that statement,  Coffman said.  When Nancy Pelosi challenged the president by saying,  You don t have the votes,  that put us in a situation to at least demonstrate from a negotiating standpoint that we do have the votes.  Rep. John Culberson of Texas, another Republican ousted in last month s elections, dismissed the question of attendance. We re gonna be here. People are gonna be here. Because we ve got to get these appropriations bills done,  Culberson said.  I think it s important that it pass. I think we all need to get behind it and illustrate to the president that we ve got the support for it. Rachael Bade contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/12/2018 06:59 PM ESTHouse and Senate negotiators reached a deal Wednesday on long-stalled legislation to deal with sexual harassment in Congress, a bipartisan breakthrough that comes as Capitol Hill has weathered a series of scandals.Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said he and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) briefed their respective caucuses on the deal Wednesday. They hope to pass it unanimously this week or next in the Senate, and send it to the House as a stand-alone bill to prevent it from getting tied up in a government shutdown fight.Story Continued Below I talked to the speaker about it today, and if everything goes to plan we ll have our members in agreement in the next day or so,  Blunt said.Klobuchar said their breakthrough would overhaul the Capitol s  broken process.  We need to clean up our own mess here,  she said, adding that the previous process  seemed to be much more focused on protecting politicians than protecting victims. A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.The compromise holds members of Congress liable for all forms of harassment and retaliation for harassment claims but not discrimination, and requires lawmakers to reimburse the Treasury Department for settlements stemming from harassment, even if they ve left office. Former Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), for example, has refused to repay an $84,000 settlement after a scandal forced him from office.  The legislation would also eliminate  cooling off  periods and other delays for congressional handling of harassment claims, and allows victims to quickly seek hearings or civil action on harassment allegations. The breakthrough also would create a position in Congress to help victims of harassment and bar secretive settlements by members of Congress.The Ethics Committee would also receive automatic referrals on harassment claims. In addition, the bill offers employees with claims a confidential adviser and allows them to file claims against both former and current members, if the claims are filed after the legislation s enactment. The House had passed its own, more expansive version, led by Reps. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) and Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.). Notably, their bill made lawmakers personally liable for harassment settlements, as well as settlements over discrimination. Speier intends to reintroduce that portion of the legislation with Byrne in the new Congress to address discrimination, hoping to revisit the issue even though it was left out of bicameral bill.  The deal comes one year after the #MeToo movement went viral and sparked the resignation and retirement of several members of Congress, including Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), Reps. Pat Meehan (R-Pa.), Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Farenthold.The compromise is also a win for Klobuchar, who is in the mix as a potential 2020 presidential contender. Klobuchar said last week that she was pushing Senate leadership to get a deal done by the end of the year.

                    By MARIANNE LEVINE and BURGESS EVERETT I can t say it s one of those dramatic negotiations like you have in major policy bills on health care,  she said, adding that the negotiation was much more about  keeping persistently... making sure we got it done by the end of the year. Senate leadership also wanted to finalize a deal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that he was working to get the bill done by the end of the year, and a person familiar with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer s thinking said the New York Democrat  is supportive of getting it done any way possible. The bill s coverage of all forms of harassment is likely to please advocates, who said the Senate s initial version didn t do enough to protect employees with harassment claims.  We and the groups that we work with on this issue have consistently expressed a preference for the stronger provisions in the House bill, and that s something we have also communicated to [Klobuchar s] office and to the senators leading this effort,  said Maya Raghu, director of workplace equality and senior counsel at the National Women s Law Center.Missing out on the latest scoops?

WaPoNIKKI HALEY SPEAKS   NBC S ALEX JOHNSON:  Nikki Haley says she leveraged Trump s outbursts to get things done at the U.N. :   He would ratchet up the rhetoric, and then I d go back to the ambassadors and say:  You know, he s pretty upset. I can t promise you what he s going to do or not, but I can tell you if we do these sanctions, it will keep him from going too far,   Haley said in an exclusive interview which aired Wednesday morning.   On one of the more delicate diplomatic issues on her watch, Haley said the United States must be careful in confronting Saudi Arabia over the brutal killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.    It was the Saudi government, and MBS is the head of the Saudi government,  Haley said Tuesday, referring to the prince by his initials.  So they are all responsible, and they don t get a pass, not an individual, not the government   they don t get a pass.

Ask some on the right to define the caravan, and they might conspire about highly organized hordes of criminals funded by the Venezuelan state or billionaire philanthropist George Soros who want to rush the American border.   Some liberals, on the other hand, will try to convince you that this is a hapless, hopeless lot with no agency, no rights and no recourse for help. The nuanced reality is far from either ideological extreme.   For people like [Walter] Coello, the caravan government might be the first time they have trusted a government to be responsive and representative even if it s one they threw up essentially overnight.

NOT LOOKING GOOD: Taxes didn t come up in the heated, um, discussion in the Oval Office between President Donald Trump, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But the trio probably didn t do anything to help the chances that tax legislation will get through Congress before lawmakers go home, whenever that might be. The prospect of a government shutdown appears more real than ever, and it would only add more poison to Congress  deep well of partisanship. Democrats, particularly in the Senate, haven t exactly welcomed a House Republican tax plan with open arms and hardly need another excuse to tank it. Story Continued BelowSeparately, as Morning Tax has noted before, the IRS is still awaiting full funding for the 2019 fiscal year since the bill that provides it is among several stalled in Congress until there s a spending deal. As if on cue, ProPublica published a piece rounding up all the ill effects of nearly a decade of spending cuts at the agency: the lowest number of revenue agents since 1953, a 42 percent drop in audit rates between 2010 and 2017, and plummeting collections from people who file but don t pay, among other things. ProPublica estimated that tax collections could have been $18 billion higher last year if the IRS had been able to maintain pre-2010 enforcement levels. The House has voted to spend $11.6 billion on the IRS in fiscal 2019, up from around $11.4 billion in 2018. The Senate has proposed $11.3 billion, though base funding would still go up because there s an extra $77 million in both bills for implementation of the new tax law, H.R. 1 (115). With a Trump appointee, Chuck Rettig, leading the agency, things could get brighter on the spending front, according to ProPublica.  When asked whether lawmakers might eventually provide increased funds to hire auditors and collectors, Republican Hill staffers told ProPublica that the members of Congress they work for will follow the lead of the new IRS commissioner, Charles Rettig. If Rettig, who was confirmed in September, asks for more money for the 2020 budget, Congress might support it, they said.   ONE FOR THE PROGRESSIVES: House Democrats have ditched a proposal to keep the chamber s supermajority vote requirement to raise taxes for all but the wealthiest Americans, the Washington Post reports.  Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), incoming chair of the House Rules Committee, told lawmakers Tuesday he will not advance  supermajority  rules requiring three-fifths majorities to approve tax hikes for most taxpayers, according to Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.  Existing House rules require the supermajority vote for any income tax increase, and Democratic leaders had proposed to keep it except when it came to raising taxes on the top 20 percent of earners, which would only require a simple majority.  But some liberal organizations and lawmakers said that did not go far enough, arguing that even the weaker rule would make it nearly impossible to enact progressive legislation such as Medicare-for-All or free universal college,  the Post noted.  HANDS OFF! Anti-taxers are circling the wagons around the corporate tax cut enacted as part of last year s tax overhaul, now that Democrats are poised to take control of the House. Americans for Tax Reform is launching a new project, Defend21.org, to shield the new 21 percent rate from those who would seek to raise it.  If we fail to stop any and every effort to break the 21 percent ceiling, then every year there will be demands from special spending interests to raise the rate  just one or two points  to fund  fill in the blank,   said ATR President Grover Norquist, in a statement.

MUZINICH IN: The Treasury Department has a deputy secretary officially in place after the Senate voted 55-44 to confirm Justin Muzinich, as Victoria Guida of Pro s Financial Services team reported. You may remember Muzinich from last year s tax reform debate, when he was a top aide to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and a key player in shaping the Republican overhaul. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin  Brady, in a prepared statement after the vote, said  As the House, Senate, and Administration worked together on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to make America more competitive and cut taxes for working families, Justin was an invaluable source of counsel not just to Secretary Mnuchin, but to all of us who were involved.  Democrats criticized Muzinich during the confirmation process for arguing the tax cuts would pay for themselves and reduce the deficit. And Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, used Muzinich s confirmation hearing to lash out at Treasury s decision to stop requiring most tax-exempt groups to send the IRS information about their top-level donors. The Senate postponed a vote until today on a resolution, S.J. Res. 64 (115), by Wyden and Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) to undo that policy.  LOOKS LIKE A LOCK: In other personnel news, the Senate Finance Committee is set to vote Thursday on Courtney Dunbar Jones  nomination for a judgeship on the U.S. Tax Court. Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said the vote would be held off the Senate floor at a time to be determined. The committee gave Jones a warm welcome at a hearing on Tuesday.  It s my intention to support you vigorously in this nomination and see that you are confirmed,  Wyden told her.  OZ EVENT: President Trump is slated to hold an event today at the White House to promote Opportunity Zones, along with officials from Baltimore. Whether he will go beyond mere promotion is another matter. The Rev. DontÈ L. Hickman Sr., who had invited Trump to Baltimore for the event before it was moved to D.C., told The Washington Post that Trump was going to sign an  executive order  related to the tax-advantaged zones, which are designed to lure development to depressed areas. The story didn t elaborate and Hickman couldn t be reached for comment. TAX RELIEF FOR FIRE VICTIMS: Californians victimized by the Camp Fire are rushing to get their property tax payments deferred until their properties can be reassessed, NPR reports. Debbie Martin, a Butte County resident whose home burned to the ground, told NPR  The property is there, and that s worth something. But there is no house, so it needs [to be] reassessed so that we will be paying less property tax.  The county assessors office says 18,000 structures were destroyed and that it projects the county will take a $6 million hit because of the fire, not including lost revenue from other taxes. YELLOW JACKETS UP NORTH? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is brushing off comparisons between Canada s carbon tax and the one in France that was the catalyst for weeks of rioting there. French President Emmanuel Macron  didn t ensure the second part of it, you put a price on pollution [because] we want less pollution, but you also make sure that ordinary Canadians are going to be able to afford this transition towards a lower carbon economy,  Trudeau said in a recent interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. He was referring to the government s plan to rebate to individual taxpayers the money it collects from the tax. But the tax is controversial in Canada, particularly in fossil-fuel producing provinces. Illinois governor-elect considers tax breaks to lessen bite of planned minimum wage boost. Philadelphia city controller makes controversial soda tax more transparent. Musk offers some Tesla buyers full refund if they re hit by cut in tax credit. The U.S. Tax Court was originally known as the U.S. Board of Tax Appeals when Congress created it in 1924 to handle complex tax litigation. Those sitting on the board were known as  members  until Congress made them  judges  in 1942.

Story Continued Below IN THE HOPPER: After months of delays, Congress is making quick work of the farm bill conference report. The Senate easily passed the legislation Tuesday in an earlier-than-expected vote, the House will take it up today, and President Donald Trump indicated he s likely to sign it.    House Republican leaders are trying to sell GOP members on the farm bill by talking up provisions to tighten work requirements for certain SNAP recipients. Except  the bill doesn t really do that, write Pro Ag s Helena Bottemiller Evich, Catherine Boudreau and Liz Crampton.    Adding up the final H.R. 2: While the compromise bill was on the Senate floor Tuesday, CBO released its score of the conference report. Find it here.  FARM BILL SPEEDING TO FINISH LINE: The Senate leapfrogged the House and voted 87-13 to pass the legislation, just 18 hours after it was posted online for public viewing. The unexpectedly quick passage puts the farm bill, H.R. 2 (115), in prime position to reach Trump s desk by Friday.  Next up: The House. The chamber is expected to vote today on the conference report after the House Rules Committee cleared it for floor action Tuesday night. It s widely expected to pass with broad bipartisan support, but there could be opposition from some conservatives frustrated the agreement doesn t include stricter work requirements for able-bodied adults who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.   There is not a single significant conservative win to be found in the entire 800-page monstrosity,  said Caroline Kitchens of R Street Institute, one of several conservative groups that gathered Tuesday to grouse about the lack of farm bill policy wins for their side.  Don t tell that to House GOP leaders. Speaker Paul Ryan said the bill  strengthens work requirements and boosts work supports so that more people are spurred towards opportunities    even though conferees widely rejected the major changes to SNAP that Republicans included in the House version. A spokesperson for Ryan pointed to one provision in the final deal that reins in existing exemptions states can seek for SNAP work requirements. The bill would tweak the policy, but the change is so minimal it didn t register as saving any money on the official budgetary scores, Helena, Catherine and Liz write.  Despite the lack of changes to SNAP work requirements, Trump gave the farm bill a positive review during a White House meeting Tuesday with Democratic leaders.  FWIW: Trump s meeting with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi was highly contentious as they bickered in front of TV cameras over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. The public display of discord   including Trump s threat that he would be  proud to shut down the government for border security    highlighted why House and Senate ag leaders are racing to clear the farm bill well before the government funding fight comes to a head next week.

FARM BILL DROPS AG RETAIL SAFETY EXCLUSION: The compromise agreement also left out House language that would have exempted certain agricultural retailers from Labor Department safety rules for facilities handling hazardous chemicals.  After 15 people were killed in 2013 from an explosion at a fertilizer storage and distribution facility in West, Texas, the Obama administration directed the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to review the current exclusion for retail facilities. OSHA in 2015 moved to limit the exemption, but the policy was challenged by the Agricultural Retailers Association and the Fertilizer Institute and struck down by a federal appeals court in 2016. The House farm bill would have codified the retail exemption and barred any future administration from issuing a similar limiting policy.  In April, OSHA issued another memo clarifying it wouldn t issue citations under the so-called Process Safety Management standard for merchant wholesalers of grains and field beans, farm supplies and other farm product raw materials.  NEW WOTUS RULE CLEAR AS MUD: The Trump administration s new Waters of the U.S. rule was supposed to clarify which waterways are subject to federal clean water regulations. But regulatory experts are scratching their heads after EPA and Army Corps of Engineers unveiled the WOTUS proposal Tuesday, writes Pro Energy s Annie Snider. Given the lack of specifics and definitions from the Trump administration, many decisions about which streams or rivers are subject to regulations could again be left up to Army Corps regulators in the field   who are notorious for reaching wildly different conclusions over the last decade about similar waterways.  Here we go again: The Obama administration s original WOTUS rule was supposed to offer some clarity, but farmers and developers complained it was too confusing. Now the Trump administration is already facing similar complaints, Annie writes. LIGHTHIZER PRIVATELY QUESTIONS TRUMP S NAFTA THREAT: The president s chief trade negotiator might not be fully behind his threat to withdraw from NAFTA. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, in a recent meeting with Democratic lawmakers on the Hill, privately cast doubt on the effectiveness of the strategy Trump has said he will play   intended to pressure Congress to accept the so-called U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.  Lighthizer indicated he wants a more constructive relationship between the White House and Congress, which is expected to vote on Trump s signature trade achievement in 2019. Many Democrats have suggested they won t support the USMCA without changes to strengthen labor and environmental standards and enforcement.  It was implied that Lighthizer might disagree with using the threat of withdrawal as a negotiating tactic, but that wasn t said directly,  according to one source familiar with the exchange. Pro Trade s Adam Behsudi had the scoop Tuesday.   Trump s shutdown threat jams GOP: So much for Republicans being able to blame Democrats if the government shuts down after Dec. 21. Trump s Oval Office threat has backed GOP leaders into a corner in terms of their messaging ahead of the upcoming funding deadline, write POLITICO s Burgess Everett and John Bresnahan.    New CFTC chair nominated: Trump will tap Heath Tarbert for chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a post under the Senate Agriculture Committee s jurisdiction. Tarbert was confirmed by the Senate 87-8 for his current job as assistant Treasury secretary for international markets, reports Pro Financial Services  Patrick Temple-West.    Jimmy Dean sausages recalled: The company said that co-manufacturer CTI Foods was recalling more than 29,000 lbs. of Jimmy Dean s Heat  n Serve Original Sausage Links after several consumers found  small, string-like fragments of metal  in the meat.

Story Continued Below AV START TICK-TOCK: Negotiations on the Senate s self-driving car bill, S. 1885 (115), are rolling along slowly. Our Tanya Snyder reported Tuesday that the group representing trial lawyers   whose problems with the legislation have been one of the factors holding it up for months   still hasn t heard back from Senate leaders about provisions that it says could protect companies from lawsuits.  When you re attempting to regulate in an entirely new space, it s important to preserve existing rights people have under state laws,  an American Association for Justice spokesperson told Tanya.  Broadly, all of our suggested changes fall within that category.   What they re saying on the Hill: Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) told reporters Tuesday the extended session caused by a spending bill deadline could work in the bill s favor.  The longer we re here   it gives us more time. We have to get a final Senate product that we can go to the House with.  Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), one of the Democrats with a formal hold on the bill, said the recent revisions aren t enough to change his mind. House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) said the  active discussions at the staff level  were a  good faith effort on both sides to get this done.  He added that  if we don t do it, states are going to do it,  leading to a patchwork of regulations instead of a unified national framework while Congress starts over on a new bill in the next session.  It s hard to start over,  he said.  It really is.  For his part, digital commerce subcommittee Chairman Bob Latta just said,  I m a perennial optimist.

She had been weighing the move for weeks after current Commerce ranking member Bill Nelson lost reelection. Cantwell s state is home to a massive tech industry, a sizable aviation presence and a large maritime industry. BULK OF BUILD GRANTS GO TO RURAL PROJECTS: DOT on Tuesday unveiled the 91 projects that are receiving $1.5 billion in fiscal 2018 BUILD grant funding, and more than 60 are in rural parts of the nation. During an event at the department s headquarters, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said DOT has tried to  rebalance the under-investment in rural communities to address overlooked needs.   2019: The year for infrastructure?  Over the past month, it s been frequently observed that infrastructure is a subject that s especially ripe for bipartisan legislation in the coming year,  Chao said. She later added that  hopefully in the next year, a bipartisan, comprehensive, long-term initiative can be achieved to address the many infrastructure needs in communities all across our country.   Tweet du jour: The Eno Center for Transportation s Jeff Davis broke down the grant funding by mode.  Of note: DOT said some grants would help boost border security. It awarded $20 million to a project in Calexico, Calif., to widen a port-of-entry bridge and  add intelligent transportation systems for border management and transportation data analysis and enhance border security through the addition of barriers, cameras, and a security fence.   SENATE MINORITY SPEAKS: Senate Environment and Public Works and Finance committees member Tom Carper (D-Del.) wants to hold a hearing early next year   in either of those committees   on lessons learned from the VMT pilot programs underway around the country.  The 800-pound gorilla in the room is always, how do you pay for  infrastructure, Carper said.  I think eventually where we re going to go is vehicle miles traveled.  He supports Rep. Peter DeFazio s idea of a nationwide pilot on VMT fees, saying,  I think eventually we will do that, maybe sooner rather than later,  though he was careful to note he wouldn t limit the revenue conversation to VMT. TRUMP STOKES SHUTDOWN FEARS: President Donald Trump said Tuesday he d be  proud  to shut down the government, earning swift criticism from Democrats, including Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). He warned a shutdown would leave hundreds of thousands of government employees working without pay just before Christmas, including  TSA agents, Coast Guard, even the secret service who have to protect the president at his golf course.  Larry Willis, president of the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO, echoed his sentiment, saying,  The men and women who make up our country s federal workforce   including front-line workers who play a vital role in keeping our transportation system safe and secure   are real people with families to feed, not political pawns to be sacrificed on a whim.   MORE PACKED AIRPORTS AHEAD: Airlines are projecting another busy holiday period, with 45.7 million people expected to fly between Dec. 20 and Jan. 6, which would be a 5.2 percent increase over the same period last year. Airlines for America chief economist John Heimlich said airfares are at historic lows, driving the high demand. A STOPGAP FOR N.J. BRIDGE: Amtrak and NJ Transit want the Coast Guard to change its rules for boats passing under the Portal Bridge in New Jersey   an effort to find a temporary fix for commuter woes created by the century-old structure.  In a statement, the railroads said they want the Coast Guard to consider  limiting or eliminating openings of the bridge during rail commuter rush hours  and to increase the required notice to 24 hours prior to a maritime passing,  POLITICO Pro New Jersey s Ryan Hutchins reports. Around 206,000 passengers ride on trains that cross the bridge every day heading to or from Penn Station in New York, and existing regulations require Amtrak to open the bridge for maritime traffic on the Hackensack River during rush hour as long as its been given one hour s notice. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has slow-walked funding for a $1.6 billion replacement project. PROBING ISLAND LADY FIRE: Federal safety investigators on Tuesday said a January fire on a casino shuttle boat in Florida was caused by an insufficient preventative maintenance program and a lack of guidance for responding to engine high-temperature conditions. The fire aboard the Island Lady in the Pithlachascotee River injured 15 people and killed one. NTSB investigated because of a similar fire in 2004 on board another shuttle owned by the same operating company. The agency issued safety recommendations to the company and to the Coast Guard, which it said had not correctly assessed the vessel s compliance with fuel system regulations.

Story Continued Below BREAKING OVERNIGHT: Manhunt underway after three are killed in a French Christmas market  TODAY: Senators plan to press for vote on Yemen War Powers Resolution   Navy, Marine Corps leaders testify at SASC  TOP NEWS: Trump suggests again the military could build a border wall, but Democrats cry foul  ON POLITICO: U.S. interceptor passes second test in two months  TRUMP SUGGESTS AGAIN MILITARY COULD BUILD THE WALL HE WANTS ON THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER:  If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall,  President Donald Trump tweeted ahead of an Oval Office meeting with Democratic congressional leaders about looming partial government shutdown when funding runs out on Dec. 21.  DoD ASSERTS AUTHORIZATION: The Defense Department has no plans now to build sections of the wall, but could under certain options, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, a Pentagon said in a written statement Tuesday. For example, he said, DoD could fund border barrier projects in support of counter drug operations or national emergencies.  BUT DEMOCRATS CRY FOUL: Some House Armed Services Democrats, though, were quick to push back, insisting the president can t use the military to circumvent Congress.  The president cannot circumvent Congress and use the military to build his absurd, ineffective border wall, and if the border is as secure as the president claims, then he must immediately bring troops deployed to the border home for the holidays,  Rep. Anthony Brown (D-Md.), said in a statement.  Senate Armed Services Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), however, suggested he would be open to supporting using defense funds for a border wall,  as long as it doesn t diminish the amount of money that s going to go for warfighting.   TRUMP THREATENS SHUTDOWN: Trump also Tuesday clashed sharply with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in a remarkable Oval Office squabble before reporters and TV camera, with the president threatening to shut down the government and the Democrats warning him they ll not bend, write POLITICO s Burgess Everett, Sarah Ferris and Caitlin Oprysko:  In a pitched partisan argument televised for all to see, the GOP president and the House and Senate Democratic leaders traded barbs over Trump s border wall during what was supposed to be a private negotiating session to keep a large swath of the government from shuttering after Dec. 21.   Trump s threat jams Republicans, who will now have a hard time blaming Democrats for any shutdown, writes Burgess and John Bresnahan.

NAVY, MARINE CORPS LEADERS TESTIFY AT SASC: Navy Secretary Richard Spencer and Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller are rescheduled to testify about readiness this morning before the Senate Armed Services Seapower and Readiness and Management Support Subcommittees. Their hearing was postponed last week in the wake of former President George H.W. Bush s death.  FIRST LADY TO VISIT AIRCRAFT CARRIER, TWO BASES: First lady Melania Trump is scheduled to visit the USS George H.W. Bush and two military bases today. Before landing on the carrier in the Atlantic, she s set at Joint Base Anacostia to fly in a V-22   the first time a first lady has ever flown in one   as well as offer brief remarks at Joint Base Langley, where Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan will accompany her. BLUE-WATER NAVY BILL FAILS IN SENATE:  A final deal to provide Department of Veterans Affairs benefits to thousands of veterans who served off the coast during the Vietnam War failed in the Senate on Monday night with little time remaining in the 115th Congress to try again,  reports Stars and Stripes. U.S. INTERCEPTOR PASSES SECOND TEST IN TWO MONTHS:  The latest version of the SM-3 interceptor missile successfully struck a medium-range ballistic missile target during a test launch from Hawaii, the Missile Defense Agency announced [Tuesday],  via our colleague Wesley Morgan.  The ground-launched test of the Raytheon-made missile from a Navy site follows a successful ship-launched test in late October and a failed test in February. The U.S. and Japan are jointly developing the SM-3 s Block IIA variant to defend against North Korean ballistic missiles.  JAPAN UNVEILS PLAN FOR FIRST AIRCRAFT CARRIER SINCE WWII:  Japan is nearing development of its first aircraft carrier since World War II,  reports The Wall Street Journal.  A draft of a new national defense plan, released Tuesday, says Japan should convert an existing flat-topped destroyer into a ship capable of launching short-takeoff jet fighters such as American F-35Bs.   The plan also indicates Japan will ramp up defense spending over the next five years to help pay for other advanced U.S. military equipment, adds Reuters.  And this afternoon, Pentagon and military officials are scheduled to provide a closed briefing for SASC s Readiness Subcommittee on U.S. force posture in the Indo-Pacific region. YEMEN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION BACKERS SET TO PROCEED TODAY: Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) plans to move to proceed today with a historic vote on a joint resolution, S.J. Res. 54, to end U.S. support for the Saudi-coalition s war in Yemen, he announced on Twitter last night.  Tomorrow, the Senate will vote to pull the U.S. out of this unconscionable war,  another sponsor of the resolution, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), tweeted Tuesday night.  There are thousands of lives at stake.   But Iowa Sen Joni Ernst, a senior SASC Republican, warned on Tuesday that a resolution to withdraw American military support for Saudi Arabia s efforts in the Yemeni civil war could hinder peace talks in the region, via POLITICO s Rebecca Morin.  HOUSE POISED TO BLOCK FURTHER YEMEN RESOLUTIONS: House Republicans are again moving to block legislation to end U.S. military involvement in Yemen from coming to the floor for a vote. The House Rules Committee Tuesday voted to strip any War Powers resolution related to U.S. involvement in Yemen of its privileged procedural status for the rest of the Congress, meaning opponents won t be able to force a House vote on Yemen for the rest of the year. The measure, included in a rule setting up debate on the compromise Farm Bill, still must be approved today by the full House.  Also Tuesday, Yemen s warring sides agreed during those talks to exchange thousands of prisoners by Jan. 20, reports The Associated Press.  Still, there s a tragedy in Yemen, made in America, writes The New York Times. MANHUNT UNDERWAY AFTER FRENCH CHRISTMAS MARKET ATTACK:  A manhunt was under way in northeastern France early on Wednesday for a gunman who killed three people and wounded a dozen others at a Christmas market in the French city of Strasbourg on Tuesday evening,  reports Reuters.  U.S. ANGERED AT PRESENCE OF RUSSIAN NUCLEAR-CAPABLE BOMBERS IN VENEZUELA:  Two Russian strategic bomber aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons have landed in ally Venezuela, a show of support for Venezuela s socialist government that has infuriated Washington,  via Reuters.  Russia s government has sent bombers halfway around the world to Venezuela,  fumed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Twitter.  Additionally, Russia s new Arctic drones are built to spot ships, writes Defense One.  And here s how a powerful Russian propaganda machine chips away at Western notions of truth, adds The Washington Post. GAO DISMISSES IBM S PENTAGON CLOUD PROTEST: The Government Accountability Office on Tuesday dismissed a protest from IBM contesting the DoD s plan to award its potentially $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure cloud contract to a single company. The competition has drawn criticism from some IT firms for seeking to award a contract to only one company   seen by some as biased toward Amazon Web Services. GAO said it dismissed the protest, however, because  the matter involved is the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction.  Oracle, which GAO also ruled against in its own JEDI protest, filed another protest against the contract last week in U.S. Court of Federal Claims.  ARMY URGED TO PURSUE A REFUND FROM NORTHROP:  More than four years ago, the Pentagon s watchdog warned that Northrop Grumman Corp. may need to refund as much as $101 million for improper labor charges on a project to combat the narcotics trade that supports terrorism. The Army still hasn t completed its assessment,  reports Bloomberg.  LOCKHEED SUED IN CONNECTION WITH FATAL HELO CRASH:  The widow of an Army helicopter crew chief is suing Lockheed Martin s Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., the maker of the Black Hawk helicopter, alleging that a defective tail rotor system caused her husband s helicopter to spin out of control and crash into a Maryland golf course last year, killing him and critically injuring two others,  reports The Washington Post. SMITH CLEARED TO TAKE HASC GAVEL: Rep. Adam Smith is largely clear to be the next House Armed Services chairman after winning the endorsement of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee on Tuesday. The Washington state Democrat, who is currently the panel s ranking member, was uncontested for the chairmanship. In all, the steering panel approved 12 committee chair picks. Smith and others must still be approved by the full Democratic caucus.  REED TO RETURN AS SASC RANKING DEMOCRAT: Sen Jack Reed of Rhode Island will return as the ranking Democrat on SASC, Schumer announced Tuesday. The announcement adds a measure of continuity to the Democrats  side of the panel, as three committee members lost in the 2018 midterm elections.   The Pentagon claims nearly $4.4 billion in savings last year. Can it top it for fiscal 2019?

Story Continued Below RUCKER TALKS AGENDA BEFORE E&C: Tuesday s House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee hearing on 21st Century Cures oversight got testy, with lawmakers grilling ONC head Don Rucker every which way. Rucker ended up providing a peek into the office s agenda for the coming months:   Where s the rule?: Panel members were, shall we say, not amused by the still-nowhere-to-be-found information blocking rule.  It s hard to explain that Congress has provided the tools necessary for doctors and patients to better share data but nothing has changed,  said subcommittee chair Michael Burgess (R-Texas). But Rucker had to explain that the rule has been parked at OMB   since September, in fact   and for whatever reason the valet hasn t retrieved it. So he s annoyed too, but he can t really do much about it. We re all waiting.   ADT chatter: During some long chatter about how the government can extend health IT benefits to behavioral health providers, Rucker corroborated some earlier reporting about the government s health tech agenda. Noting that while CMMI   due to the SUPPORT Act ( H.R. 6 (115))   will have future opportunities to help extend tech, Rucker argued that the government has an opportunity to improve things rather simply making sure admit, discharge, and transfer (or ADT) data is disseminated through health information exchanges that tell doctors when their patients have been hospitalized. That might help for patients admitted for a drug overdose.  There may be low-hanging fruit and we are looking at how to expand that,  Rucker said. His comments back up our earlier reporting about last week s White House interoperability meeting, during which CMS Administrator Seema Verma stated that the government is hoping to promote more fulsome release of ADT data. It s  not enough,  said Al Guida, a lobbyist for the Behavioral Health IT Coalition, noting increased usage of EHRs was a critical prerequisite for safe expansion of medication assisted treatment. Such treatment can be most safely used if prescribers check whether there are any patient allergies or interfering medications   both of which are best with an EHR.   Part 2 questions: Rep. Markwayne Mullin, a determined advocate for an overhaul of 42 CFR Part 2 (a provision which prevents substance use treatment data from being shared without explicit patient consent), tried to pin Rucker down on his position about possible reforms. Rucker managed to mostly escape, deferring to SAMHSA as the lead agency on the subject. But he admitted that providers struggle with knowing which patients are covered by the provision, and said,  I think HIPAA does a great job with privacy.  (Advocates for Part 2 changes believe HIPAA standards are a more appropriate privacy standard for health data.)  eHealth tweet of the day: Nick Dawson @nickdawson  [on reports of errors in medical records] I ve been thinking about a GitHub model for medical records. What if patients owned them and granted  contribute  rights to providers for pull requests. Then contributions could be reviewed and accepted. You could even have forking - eg for research.

The plan will be discussed further at a health  Demo Day  on Feb. 7 at the Department of Commerce, a source at the meeting told POLITICO. A Presidential Innovation Fellow working with the VA presented a  multi-cloudal  architecture plan for big data science in the government, involving VA and Cerner data as well as Department of Energy facilities. VA is starting a data pilot with its de-identified health data, and it will be put to use soon to help combat suicide and PTSD in the veterans population, according to a slide presentation. The February event is the culmination of a  tech sprint  that presidential innovation scholars kicked off in October to transform federal open data from HHS, the VA and other agencies. It s intended, among other things, to assist in clinical trials. More details here.   Forced out: Peter O Rourke, one of the VA officials involved in the internecine feuds at the top fo the department, was forced out, The Washington Post reported Tuesday. O Rourke was an ally of the Mar-a-Lago crowd, which had its hands in everything from the VistA/Cerner decision to app development.   Cassidy bill: Sen. Bill Cassidy introduced a bill to shake up VA medical and surgical supply purchasing Tuesday. The bill, called the  Veterans Affairs Med5 ical-Surgical Purchasing Stabilization Act,  would move the department from a nationwide prime vendor structure to a regionalized one.  ELSEWHERE IN THE ADMINISTRATION : A bit of this and that:   OCR: HHS s Office for Civil Rights handed down a $110,400 fine to the Pagosa Springs Medical Center, after it was discovered that a former center employee still had access to its protected health information. This resulted in the impermissible disclosure of 557 individuals  data. Office director Roger Severino called the error  common sense  in a statement announcing the decision. The action is the office s sixth move related to digital technology in 2018; OCR has taken in $24.5 million so far in those cases, compared to a previous high of $23.2 million in 2016. Overall, the Office has ten settlements and fines related to HIPAA this year. The fine is the office s fifth in 2018; it s taken in a bit more than $24 million so far. That moves this year s haul further past the office s previous high: in 2016, it totaled $23.2 million. However, the number of fines under Severino has slowed: if the office doesn t announce any more fines this year, it d be its slowest year by that metric since 2014.   Shutdown threat?: We re back on shutdown watch as President Trump threatened on Tuesday to not sign a funding bill if it doesn t devote money to a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.  MEDICAID PACKAGE PASSES HOUSE: A package of Medicaid bills passed the House Tuesday. For tech watchers, the ACE Kids Act ( H.R. 3325 (115)) is the most relevant piece of legislation. The bill seeks to encourage state Medicaid programs to fund care coordination entities, which would cover provider efforts to coordinate care for kids with complex conditions. The bill is based on a CMMI demonstration utilizing similar principles; providers who won CMMI awards were able to reduce costs and improve care. As you can probably guess, the providers tried to use tech tools ike registries and data analysis. Here s a Health Affairs blog post from the CEO of the Children s Hospital Association (which advocated for the bill) describing how awardees better coordinated care.  PDMP WATCH: A few notes from the state of prescription drug monitoring programs:   Oregon: An Oregon state auditor is recommending big overhauls to its prescription drug monitoring program, including eased data-sharing with law enforcement and other institutions, in a new report. That report argues that the PDMP is either barred, or finds it difficult, to share relevant prescription data with state licensing boards or law enforcement. That in turn complicates authorities  ability to curb doctor-shopping, the report continues.  Questionable prescribing habits seen within the data, even those that are egregious, cannot be elevated to any regulatory or enforcement entities to directly look into those situations,  the report says. (Nationwide, there s some debate over whether this is a wise approach, as we reported in June.) The report would also like the PDMP to produce prescriber report cards, and for a prescriber mandate to check the database.   More economic evidence: A new study in the American Journal of Health Economics corroborates the emerging consensus on PDMPs: merely making the database available to providers doesn t have an effect. It takes requiring providers to check it. But that effect is mixed: states that require PDMP checking see double-digit percentage declines in opioid prescriptions and deaths but increases in illegal drug deaths. (The evidence for an increase due to illegal drug deaths is somewhat more uncertain, the author cautions.) Will Canada also axe the fax, asks columnist Andre Picard in the Globe and Mail. An exec for the Children s Health System of Texas, Katherine Lusk, says interoperability is possible now.** A message from Johnson & Johnson: Nurses change lives, and that changes everything. Johnson & Johnson has been a proud advocate of nurse professionals for over 120 years. Every day, their creativity, innovation, and healing touch change patients  lives ñ and the world. Nurses are the backbone of our healthcare system, and our critical partners on the front lines of care. Throughout history, we ve seen how nurse-led innovation in patient care has profoundly changed human health and believe supporting and recognizing nurses as leaders and innovators is one of the most effective ways of empowering them as critical change-makers. Today, Johnson & Johnson is working to elevate the visibility and impact of nursing innovation that is changing the trajectory of health for humanity. Visit https://nursing.jnj.com to learn more. Nurses change lives. And that changes everything. **CORRECTION:  An earlier version of Morning eHealth presented a count of OCR s settlements and fines in 2018 as comprehensive, rather than specifically related to digital technology. A separate item misidentified the office presenting a VA data architecture plan.

Story Continued Below TRUMP OWNS SHUTDOWN:  If we don t get what we want ... I will shut down the government. And I am proud to shut down the government for border security.... I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I m not going to blame you for it.  With those words to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi   spoken in the presence of live TV cameras and reporters   President Donald Trump absolved the Democrats of any blame should budget negotiations, now stymied over Trump s $5 billion demand to fund a border wall, fail to produce an agreement before the Dec. 21 deadline.  It was a baffling maneuver for a president who once wrote a best-seller titled  The Art of the Deal.  Congressional Democrats were jubilant.  The President showed what he really thinks, he wants to shut down the government,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol.  It ll be a Trump shutdown and then Jan. 3, if it happens, the House will open it up again.   Congressional Republicans were bewildered. One House member told POLITICO s Burgess Everett and John Bresnahan that it was  unbelievable. I literally couldn t believe a president of the United States was acting that crazy.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately distanced himself from Trump s comments, reported the Hill s Alexander Bolton.  I hope that s not where we end up,  McConnell told reporters.  One thing I think is pretty clear no matter who precipitates the government shutdown is, the American people don t like it.  More from POLITICO here and from the Hill here.

BORDERING ON RECESSION: If Trump were to succeed in his stated goal of halting all illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border,  it definitely would trigger a recession,  according to Giovanni Peri, an economist at the University of California, Davis, quoted by Miriam Jordan in the New York Times. Undocumented immigrants account for about 5 percent of all workers in the U.S., Jordan reports, drawing on data from the Pew Research Center.  There would be companies closing and relocating,  Peri told Jordan.  There would be jobs lost. There will be towns and cities that would see half their population disappear.  More from the Times here. SLATE AUTHORIZES STRIKE: Unionized editorial employees at the online media company Slate announced Tuesday that 98 percent of its collective bargaining unit voted to authorize a strike amid an impasse with management over a new contract. A major sticking point, the union says, is management s demand that the union operate under right-to-work rules, even though Slate s workplaces (in Brooklyn and Washington, D.C.) are not situated in right-to-work states. Lowell Peterson, Executive Director of the Writers Guild of America, East, which represents Slate, told Morning Shift that it s  a very anti union position to take, so I m puzzled by it. It is sort of an ideological marker that employers put down if they want to break a union.  Graham Holdings, which owns Slate, declined comment.  Morning Shift had never before heard of management demanding,  in contract negotiations, that a union voluntarily eliminate agency fees charged to union nonmembers to cover their share of costs associated with collective bargaining. So we checked in with Michael Schorsch, an associate  at the Chicago labor law firm Despres, Schwartz, and Geoghegan and a former field attorney for the NLRB. The maneuver is  not common,  Schorsch explained in an email,  but it s legal.... Really aggressive management lawyers  ones who are set on never reaching a contract and eventually staging a decertification   sometimes refuse to agree to an agency fee ... knowing full well that no self-respecting union will agree to a contract lacking [one].  Read more from Bloomberg, which first reported on the authorization here.  NO PAY FOR CHRISTMAS: If President Trump does indeed shut down the government on  Dec. 21, the Department of Homeland Security will continue to perform its law enforcement and maritime protection duties. Some staff will be furloughed, but nearly 90 percent of employees will still report to work. Even so, POLITICO s Sarah Ferris noted on Twitter, DHS s contingency plan states that employees won t receive a paycheck until a new funding bill is signed into law   a less-than-cheering thought four days before Christmas. Read the contingency plan here.  COLLINS WON T RULE OUT KING: Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the incoming ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, won t rule out the possibility that Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who last month referred publicly to Central American migrants as  dirt,  could become ranking member of the immigration subcommittee.  At this point I m not going to speculate on anybody,  Collins told POLITICO s Ted Hesson Tuesday, adding that he hasn t made any offers. Several House Democrats said last month that King should be censured for this and other viciously derogatory comments about immigrants.  Collins also warned incoming Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.)   formally nominated Tuesday   that the minority will fight back if oversight becomes too aggressive.  Oversight is proper but overreach is not,  Collins said. MINIMUM WAGE HEARING CANCELED OVER WITNESS: The House Education and the Workforce Committee postponed a hearing scheduled for today on the economic consequences of a $15 hourly minimum wage after homophobic and sexist blog posts surfaced that were penned by one of the Republican witnesses, San Diego State University economist Joseph Sabia. In a 2002 post published on his personal column  No Shades of Gray  (which has since been taken down but can be accessed through the Wayback Machine, an internet archive) Sabia suggested the idea to  tax and regulate homosexual acts.    But first we have to mount the assault on Big Gay (no, I am not talking about Rosie O Donnell),  Sabia wrote.

FARM BILL FINALE: Senate lawmakers on Tuesday passed a new compromise version of the farm bill that dropped controversial Republican provisions that would have imposed stricter work requirements on millions of able-bodied adults who receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps). POLITICO s Catherine Boudreau, Liz Crampton and Helena Bottemiller Evich report that the Tuesday vote puts the legislation on track to land on President Donald Trump s desk before the end of the week. (More on that here.)  OSHA EXEMPTION SCRAPPED: The final version of the farm bill dropped legislative language that would have codified a regulatory exemption for certain retail facilities from requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration s Process Safety Management rule. Under the rule, certain types of industries handling hazardous chemicals are required to review and analyze potential risks and implement safety and operating procedures to prevent releases of such chemicals.  Following a 2013 explosion at a fertilizer storage and distribution facility in West, Texas, that killed 15 people and injured 200 others, OSHA issued a policy limiting the exemption at the direction of an executive order. But the policy was struck down by federal appeals court after it was challenged by the Agricultural Retailers Association and the Fertilizer Institute. The language initially included in the farm bill, but now struck from it, would have codified the exemption and barred any future administration from issuing a similar policy. In the meantime, OSHA clarified earlier this year that the agency will not issue citations under the PSM standard for certain merchant wholesalers.

Story Continued Below QUICK FIX: U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer privately doubts that President Donald Trump s NAFTA withdrawal threat helps USMCA s prospects on the Hill. Trump says he could intervene on the Huawei CFO case, as the executive is released on bail. Plus, the president told House and Senate Democratic leaders that the new NAFTA will pay for his border wall. Let s start here:  LIGHTHIZER DOESN T THINK CONGRESS WILL CAVE TO NAFTA THREAT: Lighthizer has indicated to Democratic lawmakers behind closed doors that he s not totally behind Trump s threat to withdraw from NAFTA as a tactic to force Congress to vote on USMCA, Pro Trade s Adam Behsudi reports.  Up to the White House: He made clear in one recent conversation with a Democrat that the White House would be making any decision to withdraw on its own, one source said.  It was implied that Lighthizer might disagree with using the threat of withdrawal as a negotiating tactic, but that wasn t said directly,  the source said. Lighthizer also signaled he d rather have constructive dialogue with Congress to get the deal passed next year.  Lighthizer s approach: He has long expressed confidence in being able to build a bipartisan consensus for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Lighthizer, who met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi last week to discuss the deal, recently said he wants Democrats to not only vote for USMCA,  I want them to be happy with the agreement.  However, Trump s top trade negotiator has not publicly pushed back against a withdrawal, nor supported it either. Adam has more.  IT S WEDNESDAY, DEC. 12! Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host is very much in the Christmas spirit with all the holiday parties in Washington, but mostly sad she missed Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo s  Bipawtisan Howliday  party. Any trade tips or fun holiday party stories to share? Let me know: srodriguez@politico.com or @sabrod123.  TRUMP SAYS HE COULD INTERVENE IN HUAWEI CASE: Trump said Tuesday he could weigh in on the controversial U.S. case against the CFO of Chinese telecom Huawei for national security reasons or if it would help close a trade deal with Beijing.  If I think it s good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made   which is a very important thing   what s good for national security   I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,  Trump said in an interview with Reuters. Trump s comments tie the case with the trade talks, countering officials in his own administration, including Lighthizer, who have insisted for days that the two matters are separate. Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was released from a Vancouver jail Tuesday on $7.5 million in bail. Meng was detained by Canadian authorities at the request of the U.S. for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran, sparking fears it could derail U.S.-China trade talks. More here.  Tit-for-tat fears: China slammed the U.S. for the arrest, saying it would  take further action based on the U.S. actions.  For Canada, the threat became reality. A former Canadian diplomat was detained in China, his current employer said Tuesday, just days after Meng was arrested. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters Tuesday that Canada is in  direct contact with Chinese diplomats.  The former diplomat, Michael Kovrig, worked in Beijing and Hong Kong.  U.S.-CHINA TALKS: FROSTY BEFORE THEY HEAT UP? Aside from the Huawei case, the Justice Department is expected to soon charge Chinese government hackers with a broad campaign of cyberattacks against major tech companies. All of these moves against China are threatening the nascent trade talks, Doug Palmer writes.  PELOSI: TRUMP SAYS NEW NAFTA WILL PAY FOR BORDER WALL: The new NAFTA agreement was pulled into a larger showdown over Trump s border wall with Mexico and a looming government shutdown. After a public shouting match Tuesday, Trump told House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that the new USMCA would pay for the border wall, Pelosi told House Democrats. POLITICO s Rachael Bade has more.  EUROPE S PLAN TO SAVE WTO S APPELLATE BODY GETS ITS DAY: The European Union today will officially present its proposal to the World Trade Organization s highest court in a last-ditch attempt to save it from a U.S. blockade. All eyes will be on U.S. Ambassador to the WTO Dennis Shea and his reaction to the EU proposals.  Refresher: The EU last month proposed changes to the WTO s Appellate Body, which issues final rulings on trade disputes, in response to the Trump administration s continued blocking of the appointment of new judges to the court. Those changes include making appeal proceedings faster, narrowing the scope of rules and making sure they do not set legal precedents without consulting with member countries.  What s next? If Washington today sends signals that it wants to engage on the reform proposals, it could be the start of a negotiation to reform the court. But if the reaction is noncommittal, the message will be that America is not really interested in saving the Appellate Body and is merely playing for time until the court collapses. Many diplomats and trade lawyers think the U.S. wants to go back to a system of voluntary dispute settlement, similar to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  ALUMINUM REPORT GIVES BOOST TO TARIFFS: Supporters of Trump s tariffs on steel and aluminum are now armed with a report saying the trade barriers haven t led to the economic woes that critics warned of. The American Primary Aluminum Association and Economic Policy Institute unveiled a report on Tuesday authored by EPI s Robert Scott that argues that the tariffs on aluminum have had minimal effect on downstream industries and have been a boon to the primary aluminum industry. That includes a projected 67 percent increase in primary production between 2017 and the end of 2018 and 22 expansion projects in downstream companies that produce extruded and rolled aluminum products. The report takes aim at a study from the Trade Partnership that projected the loss of over 400,000 jobs.  There is absolutely no evidence there have been broad or negative effects on employment either in using industries like autos and parts or in manufacturing as a whole or in the overall economy,  Scott said at an event Tuesday.  Canada pushback: The Canadian government criticized the study, arguing that the numbers don t add up. Ottawa has been pushing the U.S. to remove the tariffs, especially after it signed off on an updated NAFTA deal. The two sides are in talks that will likely result in quota restrictions.  The U.S. relies on imported primary aluminum   and will continue to do so. U.S. annual domestic consumption is more than 5 million metric tons (mmt). U.S. primary smelting capacity   even if every idled potline came back online at maximum capacity   is less than 2 mmt,  the Canadian Embassy said in a note to reporters. The embassy also argued that two U.S. producers, Century and Magnitude 7 Metals, announced restarting idled potlines at a time when Canada and Mexico were exempt from the 10 percent tariff. Still an executive from Century Aluminum said both countries need to continue to be subject to restrictions.  When we start talking about Canada and Mexico, just like any other country in the world, when we look at them what we need to be looking at is maintaining an effective regime and to do that we need the tariffs and/or a quota to continue to apply to all foreign parties,  said Jesse Gary, Century s executive vice president and general counsel.  PhRMA SEEKS 12 YEARS OF PROTECTION FOR BIOLOGICS DATA IN JAPAN DEAL: U.S. drug manufacturers want USTR to persuade Japan in upcoming trade talks to provide 12 years of intellectual property protection for test data used to develop biologic medicine. That would be four more years than Japan currently provides and two years more than Canada and Mexico agreed to in the revised NAFTA deal. Jay Taylor, a vice president at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, raised the issue during a USTR hearing Monday on negotiating objectives for a potential trade deal with Japan. He argued the U.S. and Japan,  as two of the most innovative countries in the world,  have a unique opportunity to set ambitious intellectual property provisions in any pact. However, critics say the 12 years of protection already enshrined in U.S. law raises the costs of life-saving medicine by delaying the availability of cheaper  biosimilars.

Story Continued BelowA shutdown fight is looming, and ACOs are working better than the Trump administration might have you believe. But first:  MEDICAID PACKAGE SENT TO SENATE   The House on Tuesday easily passed the co-called IMPROVE Act, H.R. 7217 (115), a bipartisan package of Medicaid bills, which includes new penalties for drugmakers that overcharge the program and legislation aimed at improving care for children on Medicaid with complex medical conditions. Noteworthy is the bipartisanship on drug pricing, specifically a crack down on companies that knowingly misclassify branded products as generics to lower rebate payments. The legislation also provides short-term funding for two Medicaid programs, including a three-month extension of spousal impoverishment rules to let married couples protect certain assets while seeking Medicaid coverage for home and community-based services. The other extension was for the Money Follows the Person demonstration program, which helps state Medicaid programs transition older adults and people with chronic illnesses back into their communities. The bill provides $112 million for the program, which may last for about three months.  On the other side of the Capitol, Sens.  Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and  Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who co-sponsored their chamber s version of the overcharge bill, said they re hopeful the Senate will approve the package in the final weeks of the lame-duck session. More for Pros.  The House also passed: S. 2465 (115), which reauthorizes the sickle cell disease prevention and treatment demonstration program, and, S. 3029 (115), which funds research and education programs aimed at preventing preterm births. Both those bills have already passed the Senate and now head to President Trump for his signature.  NEW REPORT: ACOs ARE SAVING MEDICARE MONEY   The National Association of ACOs commissioned its second report examining whether accountable care organizations are saving the federal government money. The new data counters CMS  suggestion that ACOs in the Medicare Shared Savings Program aren t performing well.  By the numbers: The program saved Medicare over $665 million between 2013 and 2016 (after factoring bonuses paid to ACOs), according to the report. In contrast, the analysis crunched CMS  numbers, which shows a loss of about $384 million. Some experts argue the way CMS calculates its data is skewed because it doesn t factor in what providers would have spent without ACOs.  Why it matters: The Trump administration has proposed a major reboot of the ACO program    and some big provider groups, like NAACOS, aren t happy. NAACOS has been pleading for changes, warning the new plan would limit the number of new ACOs entering the program. Earlier this week, NAACOS said the group met with Office of Management and Budget health staff, and with CMS Administrator Seema Verma before Thanksgiving (with others, like the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association, also in attendance).

Seniors need Washington to focus on the right ones. Cutting costs for everyone except seniors and limiting access to lifesaving medicines are the wrong prescription for Medicare. Making changes that help seniors pay less out-of-pocket are the right prescription for Medicare. **SHUTDOWN LOOMS   With a partial government shutdown potentially less than two weeks away, Democrats and Republicans are dug in, each side upping its demands and vowing not to buckle to the other. Trump is pressuring Congress for at least $5 billion for his border wall, far more than what Senate Democrats are prepared to give. More here.  ... Worth noting that: HHS is already funded, courtesy of last fall s  minibus,  but the FDA receives its annual appropriations through one of the unfinished bills in play. KAL…O ROLES OUT CHEAPER VERSION OF OPIOID ANTIDOTE   KalÈo said today it will sell an authorized generic of its opioid overdose treatment Evizo (naloxone) at a list price of $178 for a carton with two auto-injectors starting in mid-2019. The company plans to lower the price of the branded version to a similar price in the next 18 to 24 months, Omar Khalil, general manager for addiction and neurology told POLITICO. KalÈo has been under scrutiny for raising the price of the lifesaving treatment by more than 600 percent at the height of the opioid crisis. The price jumped from $575 per two-dose package in July 2014 to $3,750 per unit in February 2016 and $4,100 just 11 months later. KalÈo will also make the cheaper alternative available to government agencies, first responders, health departments and other public programs if they buy direct or through authorized distributors. It initially made Evizo available at $360 for a two-dose pack in April for federal agencies and state offices that receive federal funding. CMS EXTENDS OBAMACARE DEADLINE FOR CALL CENTER CUSTOMERS   Open enrollment in Obamacare plans officially ends Saturday, but CMS said that it would allow customers that leave a message with the Marketplace Call Center before the Dec. 15 deadline to enroll in plans afterward. The agency said that heading into the final days of open enrollment, when there s typically a rush to enroll in ACA plans, some customers will be prompted to leave a message with their contact information. An agent will contact them later so that they can enroll in coverage that starts Jan. 1. CMS hasn t fudged deadlines for people who enroll online through Healthcare.Gov. Obamacare enrollment numbers have continued to lag compared to previous years and CMS slashed navigator grants to groups that help people enroll in plans. FIRST IN PULSE  This year saw widespread federal and state attempts to roll back access to abortion and contraception and set up future legal challenges to Roe v. Wade, according to a new analysis by the Guttmacher Institute. In 2018, Guttmacher found 13 states adopted 26 new restrictions on abortion and contraception. POLITICO s Alice Miranda Ollstein reports that though this was the fewest abortion restrictions passed on the state level in more than a decade, several of these new laws are aimed squarely at developing a lawsuit that could reach the Supreme Court, where anti-abortion advocates believe they now have the conservative majority necessary to overturn Roe.  A SHIFTING MAP: Guttmacher s end-of-the year report also scored states on abortion rights and found an increasing number in the  hostile  camp. Since 2010, the research organization calculated, the number of women of reproductive age living in a state hostile to abortion rights has jumped from 12 to 32 million.  TITLE X IN COURT   Reproductive-rights groups will be in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit today arguing that the Trump administration s changes to the Title X family planning program are illegal because they drop references to contraception and prioritize less-effective policies like abstinence. As a result, the groups argue funds would be steered away from organizations with a proven track record in family planning. In July, a district court judge allowed the changes to stand. ALTERNATIVE METHODS   Ahead of Thursday s House hearing on alternatives to fetal tissue research, the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List is releasing a video telling the story of a woman who benefited from treatments procured from adult stem cells, and arguing that there is no need for a more politically controversial method. It s one of two dozen videos in a series meant to support that claim. Most fetal tissue used in research is obtained from abortions. The Trump administration has tapped the AIDS Institute s Carl Schmid, a longtime patient advocate, and Washington state health secretary John Wiesman to lead the presidential advisory council on HIV/AIDS, which has been inactive for nearly a year after Trump fired the entire panel. Schmid previously served on the panel under former President George W. Bush and has been critical of the Trump administration s health care policies. Wiesman has worked on HIV/AIDS prevention efforts in Washington s and Connecticut s public health departments. More from Brianna Ehley here. SIGNED   Trump signed, H.R. 6651 (115), the PEPFAR Extension Act of 2018, which extends parts of the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.  AMERICA S HEALTHIEST STATE IS   Hawaii, followed by Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Utah, according to the the United Health Foundation s annual rankings report. Louisiana is the least healthy state, followed by Mississippi, Alabama and Oklahoma. The report found that for the first time in the survey s history, more than 30 percent of American adults are obese. GRANT LAND   The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute announced nearly $20 million for two studies focused on how different treatments work in improving care for conditions that impose high burdens on patients, caregivers and the health care system. There is a $12.7 million award to researchers in Chapel Hill, N.C.; Chicago and Toronto who are examining the effectiveness of varying strategies to treat anxiety and depression in expectant and new mothers. Another $7 million is going to fund a Vanderbilt University Medical Center study comparing different approaches to preventing obesity in young children. MORE THAN HALF OF UNINSURED TEXAS UNINSURED ARE FROM WORKING FAMILIES   That s a key finding from a new report that provides a snapshot of Texas  uninsured population from the Urban Institute and the Episcopal Health Foundation. About 19 percent of Texans under the age of 65 lack insurance   the highest uninsured rate in the country   and many of those without insurance work in the retail, construction and arts and entertainment sectors. About 70 percent have a high school education or less and more than 60 percent are Hispanic. The study s authors suggest that state could do more to boost insurance coverage. If the state expanded Medicaid, another 1.2 million people would become eligible. Even without an expansion, about 15 percent of those who are uninsured qualify for Medicaid or CHIP and another 17 percent qualify for Obamacare subsidies. But the lack of program outreach and enrollment assistance, especially to Spanish speakers, means that many don t realize that they qualify for public assistance. California Assemblymember Joaquin Arambula, a Democrat, and author of legislation, CA AB4 (19R), that extends the state Medicaid program to all income-eligible adults regardless of immigration status, was arrested Monday and charged with child abuse.

There s a lot of talk in Washington about changing Medicare to reduce costs. But while many proposals would cut costs for governments and insurers, they won t cut costs for seniors; and even worse, they would limit access to the medicines that could save their lives ñ now and in the future. Cutting costs for everyone except seniors and limiting access to medicines are the wrong prescription for Medicare. On the other hand, making changes that help seniors pay less out-of-pocket are the right prescription for Medicare. **

WHITE,  MAYA PARTHASARATHY and  ALEXANDER NIEVES 12/12/2018 09:15 AM ESTTHE BUZZ: Less than a month after its chairman resigned in the wake of sexual harassment allegations, the California Democratic Party has again been roiled by internal strife   this time, the abrupt firing of seven of the party s top officials and the shuttering of its Los Angeles office by the acting chairwoman, Alexandra Gallardo-Rooker.  -- Those fired on Tuesday, sources confirmed to POLITICO, include Clark Lee, the California Democratic Party political director; Tina McKinnor, operations director; Jeremy Thompson, creative director; Adam Seiden, the party s senior adviser; John Vigna, communications director; Sandra Lowe, senior strategist; and Tim Valencia, Los Angeles director and leadership liaison. Story Continued Below --  It was a Tuesday-morning massacre,   said one leading party activist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, adding that some staffers were already considering legal action and that some angry delegates were collecting signatures to challenge Rooker s acting chairmanship, which lasts until May.  -- The news came as a shock to many Democratic activists in the party, which was still celebrating historic wins that included flipping seven House seats in California from Republican to Democrat, and regaining supermajorities in both houses of the State Legislature in the November midterms. Many party activists heard about the firings through social media and were riled that Rooker released no formal statement on the reason for the action before slashing the party s top administrators and its entire Los Angeles staff.  -- Roger Salazar, acting as a party spokesman on Tuesday, confirmed to POLITICO via email that  senior staff who came in with former Chairman Eric Bauman are no longer employed by the California Democratic Party.   --  This is not unusual when there is a change in leadership and is in keeping with the scaling back of party operations after an election year,   Salazar said in his statement.  These moves are not necessarily a reflection upon the work of each of the individuals involved, but are part of a desire by the acting chair, in consultation (with) the Speaker s office and the office of the Governor-Elect, to start fresh and keep the party moving in the right direction.   -- NOT A GOOD SIGN...Despite the statement from the party spokesman, both  Newsom s team and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon say they were not consulted by Rooker about the firings ahead of time.

After talking to the child,  the officer determined that the person responsible was Joaquin Aramubula,  Dyer said. Arambula was arrested for willful cruelty to a child, a misdemeanor under California domestic violence statutes.  Story.  THE JERRY BROWN FAREWELL TOUR BEGINS -- Outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown was on NPR S  All Things Considered  on Tuesday to recount his legacy and forecast some doom. A few highlights:  -- On the downsides of tech money: California may hold the  heart of the most dynamic economy in the world,  Brown said, but with that comes consequences:   All these rich kids making millions of dollars in Silicon Valley   they re bidding up the price of real estate, and the automation is such that a lot of people are now what they call redundant.   -- On the intractability of the housing crisis:  If you come back to me in four years, I assure you we re going to have the same problem we have today.   -- He s not feeling sanguine about politicians acting on wildfires and climate change before things deteriorate: It ll likely require  four or five more disastrous fires, or four or five floods and hurricanes and tornadoes and all that.   -- His advice for Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom:  Imagine what could go wrong, and what could go wrong in the worst way possible. And after you imagine that, then take careful steps to avoid it. You ve gotta think not about all your little pet programs, of which there will be plenty, but what are the things that could go awry?

                    By CAITLIN OPRYSKO12/12/2018 08:35 AM ESTPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would move to fortify U.S. borders  even more  in the wake of an attack in France that left three dead and more than a dozen wounded, criticizing Democratic congressional leaders for pushing back on his requests for money to build a proposed border wall with Mexico. Another very bad terror attack in France. We are going to strengthen our borders even more,  he wrote in a tweet, without elaborating on his plans.  Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security! Story Continued BelowA gunman opened fire Tuesday at an outdoor Christmas market in Strasbourg, France, near the border with Germany. Although he has not been apprehended, the Strasbourg-born gunman was known to authorities before the shooting, which French officials have said is  probably  terrorism-related.Trump met Tuesday with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi over his $5 billion request for funding to build the border wall, a sit-down that quickly deteriorated into a partisan brawl on live television, culminating with Trump s declaration that he would be  proud  to force a partial government shutdown if his demands were not met.Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what s driving the afternoon in Washington.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Trump has upped his request to $5 billion for his long-promised wall and is not backing down, boasting Tuesday that  I don t mind owning that issue.  Though the legislative and executive branches of the government are under Republican control, any spending bill will need 60 votes in the Senate, meaning some Democratic support is required. Schumer and Pelosi said Tuesday they had pitched the president either a yearlong stopgap for the Department of Homeland Security, freezing its funding at current levels, or a yearlong continuing resolution for the remaining spending bills Congress has yet to consider. Either option would deny Trump a proposed $300 million boost for border security but would keep the government open as negotiations continued.

                    By ANDREW RESTUCCIA and ELIANA JOHNSONTrump also sought to tie his demands for border security to the Obama administration s Iran nuclear deal, a pact his administration withdrew from earlier this year, falsely claiming in another tweet that  the Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing, but they can t give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall? The president appears to refer to dubious claims by opponents of the deal that lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbing its nuclear weapons programs freed up $150 billion in frozen assets for the country, a far cry from the $56 billion estimated by then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and the $25 billion to $50 billion estimated by some experts. That money is in a separate category because it never belonged to U.S. taxpayers, unlike border wall funding appropriated by Congress.Missing out on the latest scoops?

The California Democrat and some of her fiercest party critics have tentatively agreed to limit her speakership to four years at most,  Heather, Rachael and Bres report.  In return, several lawmakers who had vowed publicly to vote against Pelosi on the House floor in a critical Jan. 3 roll call will instead back her ascent to the position she held eight years ago.  The agreement was being finalized last night and could be unveiled as soon as this morning.  Under the tentative terms of the deal, the top Democratic leaders would be allowed to serve for only three terms,  they write.  If any leader wanted to exceed that limit by one term, he or she would need a two-thirds majority in the Democratic Caucus. They currently need only a simple majority to do so. After this time frame, the lawmaker would need to run for another position or vacate leadership altogether.  The agreement would be retroactive, limiting the top three Democratic leaders to no more than two more terms. Pelosi is expected to publicly back the agreement and abide by it even if the caucus rejects the rules change. Story Continued Below The agreement is expected to deliver Pelosi at least five rebel votes, which would almost certainly give Pelosi the support she needs to be speaker,  they add.  Picking off these members would be a major coup for the leader. Rebel supporters of the deal are also lobbying Reps. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) and Tim Ryan (D-Ohio). It is unclear whether they will sign on to the agreement.

But that won t stop them from trying.  House Republicans are considering passing a stopgap spending bill that provides $5 billion for Trump s border wall, essentially daring Senate Democrats to accept it or face the fallout of any funding lapse next week,  Burgess and Bres report.  But Democrats -- and some Republicans -- aren t taking the gambit seriously after Trump boasted that he d be  proud  to shut down the government over his wall demands during an extraordinary televised Oval Office clash with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday.  Everybody wants to blame it on the other party, always. That s what you typically do,  Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said.  That s out the window now.  Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) said Schumer  was very shrewd in his efforts to make certain that whatever blame is to be had for a shutdown doesn t rest with the Democrats.  He lamented  that the outcome is what it is at the moment.  But GOP leaders are optimistic that Trump s comments will quickly be forgotten.  This is going to be the finger-pointing exercise we always go through   irrespective of that interesting press conference,  said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 GOP leader.  I m not sure I see the endgame at the moment.

Pelosi met with incoming Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Ra˙l Grijalva (D-Ariz.) on Tuesday afternoon.  Pelosi has already publicly committed to bringing back the select committee after Republicans killed it off eight years ago, but incoming Democratic chairmen are wary of ceding any of their new authority as they head into the majority,  Anthony Adragna, Bres and Heather write. In addition to her own strong views on combating climate change, Pelosi has promised to revive a climate panel as she seeks to meet the demands of bold action pushed by Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and youth climate advocates,  they add. Grijalva said Pelosi will  present her outline  today  and we ll deal with it.  More than a half-dozen lawmakers and aides say Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) is being considered to lead the panel.

The West Virginia Democrat allayed some of those concerns last week when he invoked climate change denial in voting against FERC commissioner Bernard McNamee, who he had previously backed in committee.  More: https://politi.co/2QvqGMp Meanwhile, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) will keep her spot on the judiciary panel. There was speculation after the midterms that Harris could lose her slot on the committee since she s the Democrats  most junior member.

In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will bring the bill to the floor as soon as this week. McConnell said he s moving the measure  at the request of the president and following improvements to the legislation that has been secured by several members.   Trump has called McConnell several times since the midterm elections to ask the reluctant majority leader to take up the legislation,  Burgess notes.  Multiple Republican senators on both sides of the issue said last week that the legislation appeared dead with McConnell prioritizing other legislation and wanting to avoid splitting his caucus.  But Trump nudged McConnell via Twitter on Friday, and a public lobbying campaign from Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and other GOP senators apparently helped the bill s fortunes, giving it  new life,  in the words of Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas).  Given the fact that we have a short window of time to do it, obviously Sen. McConnell was concerned,  Cornyn said.  But he obviously is now doing what the president asked him to do, and I think we got the bill in a better place that makes it more likely we can pass it.

This action by election officials would be a fundamental violation of the sense of fair play, honesty, and integrity that the Republican Party stands for,  Hayes said in a statement.

TRUMP THREATENS SHUTDOWN   The U.S. government is looking more and more like it s heading into a partial shutdown later this month, with President Donald Trump declaring Tuesday that he would be  proud  to oversee one if it means ultimately getting funding for his border wall    a central pillar of his 2016 campaign. Democrats, for their part, don t want to give him any more funding for it than he got last year: $1.3 billion. Stuck in the middle is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who doesn t want the final weeks of a Republican-controlled Congress to wind down this way. Story Continued Below POLITICO s Burgess Everett, Sarah Ferris and Caitlin Oprysko have more:  President Donald Trump clashed sharply with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in a remarkable Oval Office meeting before reporters Tuesday, with the president threatening to shut down the government and the Democrats warning him they will not bend.  In a pitched partisan argument televised for all to see, the GOP president and the House and Senate Democratic leaders traded barbs over Trump s border wall during what was supposed to be a private negotiating session to keep a large swath of the government from shuttering after Dec. 21.  Read more.  As a reminder: Unlike in recent years, Congress has already approved $1.2 trillion in funding for some parts of the government, so a shutdown would only cover certain agencies. Among those that would be affected: the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department, the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  HUAWEI CFO GRANTED $7.5M BAIL   From Ian Young at the South China Morning Post (which has a content partnership with POLITICO):  A Canadian judge has ordered that Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Sabrina Meng Wanzhou be released on C$10 million (US$7.5 million) in bail, prompting applause and gasps in a Vancouver courtroom.  Mr Justice William Ehrcke also ordered that Meng wear a GPS ankle bracelet, submit to the supervision of a private security firm, and surrender her two passports. The judge told the packed courtroom in the British Columbia Supreme Court on Tuesday afternoon that bail would be set at C$10 million, including a cash deposit of C$7 million (US$5.2 million) from Meng and her husband Liu Xiaozong, and C$3 million (US$2.2 million) pledged by friends acting as sureties.

As our Doug Palmer writes, there s no evidence that the U.S. and China are making much progress on their 90-day deadline to reach a trade deal, and U.S. moves on China, including its action against Meng, aren t helping that situation.  Worth nothing is that Trump told Reuters that he would intervene in the Justice Department s case against Meng if it would further national security interests or help get a trade deal with Beijing.  TRUMP: DECEMBER RATE HIKE WOULD BE  FOOLISH    Trump entered new territory in his criticism of the Fed on Tuesday by saying the central bank should not raise rates just before a key meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee next week.  I think that would be foolish, but what can I say?  Trump told Reuters in the same interview. THE STRANGE CASE OF TRUMP VS. POWELL   Your guest host finds herself in the amusing position of promoting this week s POLITICO Money, featuring  herself. Ben White and I chat in the episode about the strange dynamic between Trump and Powell, as well as the outlook on where monetary policy might be going. I also tell Ben that it would be pretty surprising if the Fed doesn t hike rates next week,  unless something big happens between now and then.  From me:  The Fed is currently in its blackout period where   a week or so before the rate-setting meetings, they don t talk publicly. The last speech before that was Lael Brainard on Friday, and she was pretty upbeat about the economy.   She did kind of flag headwinds a little bit more than maybe she had been, but she still said she thinks that further gradual rate hikes will be warranted   I think that the message from the Fed is that right now there s not a sign they need to stop imminently, but they re obviously watching that going forward. There s a lot more time between now and, say, March when people might expect the next rate hike.  Listen here.  MM should add to the commentary on the podcast that one big reason for the Fed to watch the data closely going into next year is that it has now hiked rates eight times   nine, if the December increase happens   since December 2015. So, the Fed has to continue watching the impact of those moves, which operate on a lag, to ensure they re not over-tightening financial conditions.  MEET THE NEW FDIC BOSS   From your host, who sat down with the FDIC chairman this week:  Shortly after Jelena McWilliams took over as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. this summer, payday lenders cited internal agency documents that they say prove FDIC staffers acted inappropriately in connection with an Obama-era program known as  Operation Choke Point.   That program, which discouraged banks from doing business with a range of companies including payday lenders, was apparently ended under President Donald Trump. But court documents in the payday lenders  lawsuit have re-ignited frustration from Republicans and banks. The situation is one of many in which the new FDIC chief has been thrown into the middle of the action, including regulatory proposals put forward by other Trump appointees before her arrival.  More for Pros here.  FARM BILL ADVANCES   POLITICO s Catherine Boudreau, Liz Crampton and Helena Bottemiller Evich:  The farm bill compromise is on track to land on President Donald Trump s desk before the end of the week after the Senate on Tuesday passed the five-year agriculture and nutrition measure by a vote of 87-13.  Senate passage paves the way for the House to take up the farm bill in coming days. Agriculture committee leaders are predicting a bipartisan House vote in favor of the legislation.   Trump is likely to sign the final bill even though it doesn t include a House Republican plan to impose stricter work requirements on millions of able-bodied adults who receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.  Meanwhile, read Catherine and Helena s rundown of what s in the bill, here.  IT S WEDNESDAY   Ben White will be back with you tomorrow. Send news to him at bwhite@politico.com and @morningmoneyben, and to Aubree Eliza at aweaver@politico.com and @AubreeEWeaver. And please feel free to pass along financial regulation tips to me at: vguida@politico.com.  FED, BIG BANKS ON COLLISION COURSE   From yours truly:  The Federal Reserve, in an effort to speed up paychecks, rent and other transactions, is floating the idea of building a new infrastructure for faster payments. The nation s big banks are not happy about that.  The central bank for years has been talking about achieving the goal of so-called real-time payments, which would allow people to receive money in their bank accounts within 15 seconds after it s sent to them   lightning speed by today s standards. Consider: The Automated Clearing House network, which handles card payments and direct deposits, settles transactions en masse three times a day, and only during business hours.  Read more.  TRUMP S FHFA PICK ROILS HOUSING ADVOCATES   POLITICO s Katy O Donnell:  President Donald Trump s nomination of libertarian economist Mark Calabria to be the country s top housing regulator will touch off a bruising battle in Congress over the government s role in the financing of American mortgages.  Calabria, Vice President Mike Pence s chief economist, has a long record of criticizing housing policy, giving Democrats plenty of ammunition during a Senate hearing to confirm him as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  He s on the record ... as highly skeptical of many of the historically successful elements of our housing finance economy,  said National Housing Conference CEO David Dworkin.  Read more.  U.S., U.K. STRIKE INSURANCE DEAL   POLITICO s Zach Warmbrodt:  The U.S. and U.K. have struck a deal on regulation of the insurance industry before the deadline for Brexit next March. The deal was negotiated to ensure the continuation of measures that the U.S. and European Union agreed to last year to resolve trans-Atlantic regulatory conflicts. It covers the same areas as the EU agreement.   Congress will now have 90 days to review it.   MNUCHIN FINALLY GETS A NO. 2   From me:  The Senate in a 55-44 vote [Tuesday] confirmed former banker Justin Muzinich as deputy Treasury secretary, where he will play a key support role for Treasury Chief Steven Mnuchin.  Muzinich has worked as a top aide to Mnuchin since the beginning of the administration and was a key player during last year s tax reform debate. In his new role, he will run the department day-to-day when the Treasury secretary is traveling or dealing with other high-level matters. He fills one of multiple high-level vacancies at Treasury at a time when the administration is preparing to face a House controlled by the Democrats, where top officials might be called to appear at oversight hearings more often.  More for Pros here.  Jeb Bush tweets (Muzinich worked as his policy director in 2016):  Congratulations to Justin Muzinich on his confirmation as Deputy Secretary of @USTreasury. He is a bright and thoughtful leader who will continue to serve our country with integrity.   Treasury might soon lose another Senate-confirmed official though; the White House officially announced Tuesday night that Trump will nominate Heath Tarbert, assistant Treasury secretary for international markets, as CFTC chairman.  GOVERNMENT MORALE TAKES A HIT   Overall in the federal government, employees  views of their jobs and workplace issues went down in 2018, according to this year s  Best Places to Work in the Federal Government  survey from the Partnership for Public Service and the Boston Consulting Group. The Securities and Exchange Commission ranked third in  employee engagement  among mid-size agencies, while the FDIC ranked fifth, and the CFPB ranked  second to last. The bureau s morale plummeted more than any other agency in its size bracket compared to last year. Looks like new Director Kathy Kraninger has her work cut out for her. Read the survey here.  NEW CFPB CHIEF LEAVES EVERYONE GUESSING   POLITICO s Katy O Donnell:  Kathy Kraninger is looking forward to getting briefed. In a 25-minute press conference on her first day as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Tuesday, a smiling Kraninger repeatedly deflected questions about her plans for the powerful agency, saying she was eager to first get the rundown from staff.     When President Donald Trump nominated Kraninger in June to head the controversial agency, Democrats made much of her lack of experience in either financial policy or consumer affairs. She did nothing on Tuesday to allay those fears.  More for Pros here. REALTOR GROUP SHAKEUP   Per press release:  The National Association of Realtors (NAR) announced [Tuesday] staffing changes in the organization s advocacy, marketing communications, member experience and technology groups,  including  realigning its lobbying resources to interact more effectively on key issues with members of Congress and key committees most relevant to the real estate industry.   Sidebar from our Lorraine Woellert:  The trade group has been shaking up its ranks after taking a beating on tax reform last year. California Realtors, who make up a huge share of the group s membership, were particularly unhappy with the bill, which dialed back deductions for mortgage interest and local property tax.   CONSUMER DEBT IN AMERICA   A new interactive tool from the Urban Institute s Opportunity and Ownership Initiative has state and county-level demographic data on people with delinquent auto and retain loans. See it here.  ICYMI: BURIED REPORT ON WELLS FARGO STUDENT FEES   POLITICO s Michael Stratford:  The Trump administration for months concealed a report that showed Wells Fargo charged college students fees that were on average several times higher than some of its competitors.  The  unpublished  report was obtained by POLITICO through a Freedom of Information Act request. It was produced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau office previously led by Seth Frotman, who quit as the bureau s top student loan official in protest of Trump administration policies. Frotman said in his resignation letter that CFPB leaders had  suppressed the publication  of the report.  Read more. INVESTORS FIGHTING THE FED   WSJ s Justin Lahart:  Most investors won t be surprised if the Federal Reserve raises rates next week. But some might, and that poses a risk for markets. Fed officials have lately signaled a more dovish approach to policy in the coming year, but when it comes to next week s meeting, they haven t wavered: They plan to tighten. It is something they laid out in both their economic projections and the minutes from their last meeting, and that they have underscored in recent speeches. But stocks  roller-coaster ride since October has made investors less sure of a hike.  Read more.

                    Updated 12/12/2018 10:24 AM ESTHappy Wednesday, Illinois. Mayor Rahm Emanuel threw a holiday party last night for his staff at the McDonald s HQ in the West Loop. Hors d oeuvres included chicken McNuggets, of course.We re getting a glimpse of what J.B. Pritzker and Juliana Stratton s inaugural festivities might look like based on who s pulling the party together. Think big, modern, inclusive and it will all be funded by Pritzker himself.Story Continued BelowThat means the inaugural committee, traditionally charged with raising funds to cover costs of the event, will focus solely on putting on a grand affair. Pritzker s wife, M.K. Pritzker, is serving as a chair of the committee appropriate because she s familiar with putting on big events. M.K. founded the nonprofit Evergreen Invitational, an equestrian grand prix jumping show that s raised $6 million for women s health-care initiatives at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. (M.K. has been riding horses since her childhood in South Dakota.)Some of the Pritzkers  closest pals and confidantes are on the committee, including, Lee  Rosy  Rosenberg, chief of staff at the Pritzker Group and an adviser to Pritzker on the campaign; businessman Michael Sacks and Cari Sacks; businesswoman Linda Johnson Rice; Marko Iglendza, CEO and Founder of Terminal Getaway Spa, and Neal Zucker, CEO and co-founder of Corporate Cleaning window cleaners; and businesswoman Desiree Rogers, who oversaw 330 White House functions while she was social secretary in the Obama administration.Artist Theaster Gates is on the committee, too. His work is known internationally but in Chicago he s adored for helping revitalize the South Side with the Stony Island Arts Bank.Another co-chair is Bryan Echols, senior adviser to the state treasurer and a leader in community-based organizations. Mary Urbina-McCarthy, who was operations director for Pritzker s campaign, is executive director of the inaugural committee.The rest of the committee consists of members from a broad and diverse swath nonprofits, business, upstate, downstate. They include: Obama Foundation President Martin Nesbitt; real-estate developer Elzie Higginbottom and his wife, Deborah; high-end boutique owners Ikram and Josh Goldman; lobbyist Loretta Durbin (wife of U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin); educator Barbara Bowman (she s Valerie Jarrett s mom); activist Emma Lozano; media exec Eve Rodriguez Montoya; community leader Felicia Davis; nonprofit leader Sol Flores; Illinois Business Immigration Coalition s Rebecca Shi; LIUNA labor President Nicole Hayes; and businessman Skip Braziel and Erica Annise Braziel.Politicos on the committee: former Gov. Jim Edgar and his wife, Brenda; Illinois Democratic County Chairs  President Kristina Zahorik; Chicago Housing Authority Board Chair John Hooker; Highway Commissioner Calvin Jordan and his wife, Lori; former Congressman Glenn Poshard and his wife, Jo; St. Clair County Auditor Patty Sprague and attorney Bob Sprague; former state Rep. Lauren Beth Gash and Studio Gang Principal Gregg Garmisa; North Aurora Village Trustee Mark Guethle and his wife, Louise; and Wanda Rednour, wife of the late John Rednour, a former Du Quoin mayor.Inaugural events will take place the weekend of January 12-13 followed by the swearing-in ceremony and inaugural celebration on Monday, January 14.Related:Government and political PR veteran Becky Carroll has been tapped by J.B. Pritzker to serve as communications adviser to his transition committee. Carroll previously held key comms positions in the statehouse, mayor s office and with Chicago Public Schools. She s now president and CEO of C-Strategies LLC and active in supporting the #MeToo movement in state government.Mayor Rahm Emanuel is setting the table for mayoral debates and forums for weeks to come. He joined suburban mayors Tuesday to call for a 20- to 30-cents-a-gallon gas tax to help fund mass transit and road improvements. And in a speech to the City Council today, the mayor will call on state lawmakers to legalize marijuana, approve a Chicago casino and amend the state Constitution to allow public-employee pension benefits to be adjusted so as to avoid a pension crisis.  Too many people look at our pension obligation through green eyeshade   in terms of dollars and cents. That is just one way to see it, but it is not the whole picture. The other is in terms of our principles and priorities,  his prepared speech reads. His take on pensions was a talking point in a debate last night (see below).Details:Sun-Times  Fran Spielman has as details about the gas-tax proposal: Story hereWBEZ s Claudia Morell looks at gambling and pot proposals: Story hereTribune s Bill Ruthhart has details about today s speech: Story hereWelcome to POLITICO s Illinois Playbook. Have a tip, event, announcement, endorsement? Send to skapos@politico.com or @shiakaposSUBSCRIBE to Illinois Playbook: http://politi.co/1NTMQid  Last night s mayoral debate at the Copernicus Center on the Northwest Side started calmly enough. Candidates made their opening statements, sticking to their bios. When it came to Gery Chico, he lit into Toni Preckwinkle, saying,  Toni, that soda tax really hurt us. That sales tax you said you d repeal hurt us. The discussion moved fast with 10 participating candidates covering TIFs, crime, workers  comp and pension issues. The event was sponsored by the 38th Ward Dems. A few zingers: Lori Lightfoot challenging Preckwinkle:  Join me in calling for taking away the $100 million  ATM  that Ed Burke controls with the Workers Comp system.  Ja Mal Green, whose petitions have been challenged by Willie Wilson, talked about Wilson, saying,  He s not black first. He s rich first.  Wilson has challenged Green s petitions. Here s a video of the full debate. And WGN also hit a second debate held earlier in the evening. Story here  Mendoza looks to block election challenge filed by Preckwinkle campaign. Suzana Mendoza s campaign says she has more than enough names to get on the Feb. 26 ballot and called Toni Preckwinkle s challenge of her petition signatures  shoddy.  The Mendoza campaign plans to file a motion today seeking to dismiss Preckwinckle s challenge. Tribune s John Byrne reports. Story here  When Garry McCarthy jumped into the mayor s race a few months back, it looked like he was at least in part driven by revenge on Mayor Rahm Emanuel for firing him. The former Chicago Police chief has denied that, saying he wants to be mayor because he has  the public-service DNA.  But yesterday, during a City Club discussion about crime, McCarthy sounded a lot like a guy who still has a beef with his boss.  There should be a criminal prosecution on the coverup of the Laquan McDonald video and it should go all the way to the Fifth Floor,  he said, referring to the mayor s City Hall office.  And I m not done with it. I ve spoken to numerous law enforcement agencies about it and nobody wants to touch it because of the politics of it. This is part of the problem in this city.   At odds with Obama: 6 Chicago mayoral candidates say presidential center should guarantee certain community benefits. Tribune s Bill Ruthhart has story here.  Longtime journalist Charles Thomas has joined Amara Enyia s mayoral campaign as a senior adviser. In a statement announcing the move, Thomas said he was drawn to her campaign because of her promise of inclusivity.  Her goal is to return control of the city government to the people. No other candidate is doing that,  he said. Thomas spent more than 25 years at ABC Eyewitness News in Chicago, primarily as a political reporter. He retired from TV last year.   EPA finds another source of toxic manganese on Chicago s Southeast Side, by Tribune s Michael Hawthorne: About 3,800 people live within a mile of Watco Transloading, where EPA data show average concentrations of brain-damaging manganese exceeded the federal safety limit   and spiked nearly five times higher   in September and October. Story here  How it feels to be Javion: 16 and struggling to read in Chicago Public Schools, by Chalkbeat Chicago s Adeshina Emmanuel:  How Javion became a high school student reading at the second-grade level is impossible to say for sure. But multiple forces play a role: Intergenerational poverty and violence abetted by segregation and disinvestment that have strangled opportunities for black families in neighborhoods on the South and West Sides. Underperforming schools concentrated in underserved communities. A special education system that avoided serving students. A patchwork approach to literacy instruction. And thousands upon thousands of students like Javion, who have endured deep, searing losses and trauma.  Story here  Limiting our right to sign more than one candidate petition is beyond ridiculous, writes Trib columnist Eric Zorn. Column here  Gov.-elect J.B. Pritzker will meet with Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase, for an announcement about a new commitment by the bank to Chicago s South and West sides. The event will feature remarks by Dimon, Pritzker and other business and community leaders, as well as a roundtable discussion with community nonprofit partners and small business owners who will talk about boosting commercial activity on the South and West side. Dimon is a New York businessman but he used to live in Chicago.  Evanston s Harley Clarke Mansion saved by council.

Howard Glaser, Gov. Andrew Cuomo s former operations chief, is working as a consultant for Adelson s Las Vegas Sands Corporation and has brokered meetings between officials from the company and New York business leaders. It has also hired Kivvit, the lobbying firm that employs Cuomo s 2018 campaign manager, Maggie Moran, and Cuomo s former communications director, Rich Bamberger. In a sign of its seriousness about entering New York, Sands   which is not known as a union-friendly operator   also reached an agreement with Peter Ward, the head of New York s powerful hotel workers union. The agreement guarantees hotel and casino workers the right to organize at any future Sands facility in New York, the company and hotel union said.Story Continued Below Sands has had the opportunity to meet with people representing the business community, civic organizations and organized labor,  said a spokesperson for the company.  These discussions have given the company both important insights on New York as well as producing tangible results, such as the labor peace agreement the company reached with Peter Ward and the Hotel Trades Council. To some onlookers, Las Vegas Sands  foray into New York politics smells of temerity. Adelson is one of the GOP s top donors and so close to Trump that the president recently awarded Adelson s wife, Miriam, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. New York is one of the bluest states in the nation.Sands  moves might also seem premature. New York State only authorized seven non-Indian casinos in 2013. State law appears to bar the state from issuing any licenses in New York City until 2023, or seven years after the first upstate casino became operational. Several state spokespeople declined to comment for this story.New York State s gambling environment is nothing if not complicated. The four upstate casinos that the state authorized in 2013   and that Cuomo championed   aren t doing as well as the governor expected. Some are wondering if the downstate casinos might help bolster the upstate facilities  bottom line.New York City gambling, proponents argue, could also generate revenue for state purposes, like the languishing subway system.

In the weeks since the announcement of Long Island City as one of the company s two new sites for an additional campus, Amazon has been mounting a public relations campaign in an effort to win over their new neighbors in Queens, in a district where Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an opponent of the deal, holds major sway.    For weeks, executives in charge of the company s public policy have been making frequent flights to New York City from their offices in Washington, D.C. They visited the Queensbridge Houses, the nation s largest public housing development, a short walk from the future site of the Amazon offices, and have held meetings with community groups.  NYT s J. David Goodman   Months ago, Mayor Bill de Blasio s spokesman publicly denied that New York City had a similar deal with other cities that allowed Amazon control over Freedom of Information requests about its business dealings with the city. But that wasn t true.  OP-ED, by City Comptroller Scott Stringer, for Gotham Gazette:   Secretive Amazon Deal Should Have Us Rethinking Subsidy Programs and More COUNCIL LEADERS CHIDE MAYOR OVER ARREST: City Council leadership criticized Mayor Bill de Blasio s near silence Tuesday in the wake of the violent arrest of a 23-year-old mother holding her son last week at a city benefits office. De Blasio beelined from an anniversary celebration for the police oversight board Monday without addressing the matter, eyes fixed down, as reporters waiting at the door of City Hall s Blue Room followed next to him asking for comment. Police Commissioner James O Neill answered a few questions from reporters in the rotunda but stopped short of criticizing officers  actions. City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, who called attention to the video Sunday, questioned the mayor s reticence. POLITICO s Rosa GoldensohnDAILY NEWS EDITORIAL BOARD:  That police Tuesday dropped their charges against Jazmine Headley, that she is out of Rikers Island, hardly closes the book on the confrontation caught on bystander video, the worst of which was officers engaging in a tug of war with the 29-year-old mom over her 1-year-old baby boy. The city must now see all available footage of the episode before and after cops  arrival, including NYPD bodycam video. It is in the public interest to tell the full story: How and why did this standoff escalate?  The last piece of unfinished business: determining why in the world a woman had to wait for four hours, according to reports, for what ought to have been routine public-sector business.

Workers who decked that halls at the Jersey-side tolls turned the signage into a total eyesore when they slapped a triangular tree over the letter  N  instead of  A    and made the crossing a  TONNEL  by putting a wreath over the  U.  The festive failure is so bad that one angry commuter has gotten more than 600 signatures on a petition demanding the Port Authority fix the decorations   saying it s a holiday nightmare for people with OCD. I look at it and it makes me itch.

New York Post s Danielle Furfaro and Natalie O NeillSENATE DEMS RELEASE COMMITTEE LEADERS   State Senate Democrats have released a list of their committee chairs for 2019, with the most powerful posts largely going to members with several years of experience. Panels that have historically gone to newcomers will be chaired by the large crop of freshmen joining the conference. Sen. Liz Krueger will chair the Finance Committee, on which she s served as ranking member for several years and where she was a vice chair when Democrats last had a majority in 2009 and 2010....Sen. David Carlucci will be the chair of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities, a post he held when he was a member of the Independent Democratic Conference while it served in a majority coalition with Republicans. But the other returning member of the IDC, Sen. Diane Savino, was relegated to the Internet and Technology subcommittee. POLITICO s Bill Mahoney  Sen. Tim Kennedy of Buffalo will lead the Transportation committee, which annoyed downstate residents concerned about the MTA.   Sen.

DRINKING WATER QUALITY COUNCIL DELAYS PERSIST   A key meeting of the state s advisory panel on drinking water standards has yet to be finalized, which could lead to further delays in implementing new standards and testing requirements for three toxic chemicals. The Drinking Water Quality Council hasn t met since October 17, and Department of Health officials had said the council would meet this month. The council is tasked with recommending standards for chemicals found in drinking water in Hoosick Falls, Newburgh and on Long Island. ..Gov. Andrew Cuomo vowed to act on setting the standards in the absence of federal action. But progress has been stymied by bureaucratic delays   and advocates and lawmakers have taken notice.  We should absolutely be stepping in,  said state Sen.-elect James Skoufis, a Democrat whose district includes the city of Newburgh where PFOS was found in drinking water.

The agency, the New York State Justice Center, was created in 2013 by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo   a Democrat   to investigate and prosecute cases of abuse and neglect against individuals in state care. But over its five-year tenure, the center has been dogged by criticism that it fails to bring charges in the most severe cases and protects abusive workers by keeping complaints out of the public eye and away from local law enforcement.

An annual report released by the HUD Office of Inspector General outlines the top six management challenges facing the agency in 2019, and the details aren t pretty. In 1994, the Government Accountability Office placed HUD on its high-risk list because of management deficiencies, an issue the OIG said persists more than 20 years later. At the heart of the problem: repeated staff turnover. In the past 10 years, HUD lost 18.5% of its full-time staff, more than any other cabinet-level department.  HousingWire s Jessica Guerin.Gov.

                            One way out of the shutdown is: President Donald Trump folds and allows Congress to pass a stopgap with the current border security funding structure, which he has already touted as being effective. | Mark Wilson/Getty ImagesALERT   POLITICO EUROPE:  Theresa May to face vote of no confidence,  by Annabelle Dickson in London:  British Prime Minister Theresa May will face a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative party Wednesday, something she vowed to contest  with everything I ve got.  The challenge is to May s leadership of her party and if she lost it would not automatically trigger an election, though if she is replaced as Tory leader her successor would take over as prime minister. The news came after May delayed a House of Commons vote on her Brexit deal, which had been due to take place Tuesday night. Instead, she spent Tuesday touring European capitals in a bid to secure assurances over the controversial Northern Irish backstop from other EU27 leaders in the hope of winning over more Tory MPs, many of whom have said they opposed the divorce deal the prime minister negotiated with Brussels. Speaking outside No. 10 Downing Street, May warned a change of leadership now would  create uncertainty when we can least afford it  and said any new prime minister would be forced to extend the Article 50 Brexit negotiating period or revoke it all together.  POLITICO EuropeHappy Wednesday morning. WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW ON GOVERNMENT FUNDING   SO NOW THAT yesterday s show is out of the system, here s what the next few days might look like:-- THE HOUSE is planning -- at the moment -- to take up a $5 billion wall funding bill. GOP leadership believes they ll be able to get 218 on their own -- Democrats are obviously not going to chip in to pass this. Republicans say rebuking NANCY PELOSI -- who said the House can t pass it -- is enough to snap their crowd into action. We are a bit more skeptical they ll be able to get this through. For example: 44 LAWMAKERS were out yesterday. Twenty of them are people who will not be returning next Congress. (Imagine the Republicans ending their eight-year majority by failing to pass this bill.)-- IF THE HOUSE SOMEHOW manages to pass it, THE SENATE will then fail to get 60 votes on that bill, which could -- in theory -- reset this process by the end of this week. WE RE A FEW FITS AND STARTS away from this process getting real. A SHUTDOWN REMAINS VERY LIKELY. It just doesn t seem like a deal is in the works, or close to being thought about. And that brings us to this: How can Congress get out of this mess?  THE BASIC OFF-RAMP   It doesn t seem as if the president is interested in any deal, and Democrats made clear their position yesterday. So the way out is: PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP folds and allows Congress to pass a stopgap with the current border security funding structure, which he has already touted as being effective. He could probably extract some concessions around the edges to help him sell it to himself and his base. He ll blame Democrats and he could say he s going to come back next year with a request for more border money.-- CAN CONGRESS KEEP GOVERNMENT CLOSED FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS? There are 13 days between the funding deadline and when Democrats take over the House. PELOSI could begin the 116th Congress by passing a stopgap to end a partial shutdown. At that point, it would fly through the Senate and Trump would have to sign it. There are plenty of Democrats and Republicans who think this is the most likely scenario at this moment.-- FOR THE RECORD   RACHAEL BADE:  Pelosi privately disses Trump s manhood after White House meeting TRUMP: DISEASE COMING INTO THE U.S.   Yesterday afternoon, per pooler Melissa Quinn of the Washington Examiner:  One of the problems that people don t talk about -- you have a tremendous medical problem coming into the country.

In return, several lawmakers who had vowed publicly to vote against Pelosi on the House floor in a critical Jan. 3 roll call will instead back her ascent to the position she held eight years ago.    Under the tentative terms of the deal, the top Democratic leaders would be allowed to serve for only three terms. If any leader wanted to exceed that limit by one term, he or she would need a two-thirds majority in the Democratic Caucus. They currently need only a simple majority to do so. After this time frame, the lawmaker would need to run for another position or vacate leadership altogether. Most important, Pelosi s agreement with rebels, the deal would be retroactive. That means Pelosi, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) would already be entering their third term in leadership during the next Congress. They would need two-thirds approval from the caucus to serve beyond 2020   and the longest they could remain in place in their current jobs is four years.  POLITICO-- IT WAS AMAZING to see Pelosi handle this episode. She never let anyone see her sweat -- if she ever did anyway -- and it forced her detractors to scramble and launch into negotiations. -- A PELOSI AIDE:  There are various conversations going on about a path forward.

But William P.

Barr has donated more than $567,000 in the past two decades, nearly all to GOP candidates and groups, federal records show. His wife, Christine Barr, gave more than $220,000 over that time, records show.

Peter O Rourke s departure marks an unceremonious fall for a Trump loyalist once seen as a rising star at VA, where he nonetheless had a rocky tenure, first leading a high-profile office handling whistleblower complaints, next as chief of staff and then, for two months, as the agency s acting secretary.

                        The president s eagerness to take ownership of a partial government shutdown if he doesn t get border wall funding has painted Republicans into a corner.
                    By BURGESS EVERETT and JOHN BRESNAHAN12/11/2018 06:57 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump just made it nearly impossible for Republicans to blame Democrats for an increasingly likely partial government shutdown. But they re going to try anyway. House Republicans are considering passing a stopgap spending bill that provides $5 billion for Trump s border wall, essentially daring Senate Democrats to accept it or face the fallout of any funding lapse next week, according to multiple GOP sources.Story Continued Below But Democrats   and some Republicans   aren t taking the gambit seriously after Trump boasted that he d be  proud  to shut down the government over his wall demands during an extraordinary televised Oval Office clash with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) was taken aback when asked if the president s negotiating style had aided Republicans:  Everybody wants to blame it on the other party, always. That s what you typically do. That s out the window now. Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) conceded that neither side had made any effort to compromise and that Democrats were skillfully sidestepping GOP efforts to pin the blame on them.  I think Sen. Schumer was very shrewd in his efforts to make certain that whatever blame is to be had for a shutdown doesn t rest with the Democrats,  added Moran.  It s disappointing that the outcome is what it is at the moment. 
                                 Coming off a remarkable exchange between Trump, Schumer and Pelosi, congressional Republicans were reeling as they tried to adjust to the president s stunning willingness to own an impending partial shutdown over his wall demands. For weeks, the GOP had been attacking Democrats for their unwillingness to help Trump shore up the border. And with just a few words directed at Schumer, Trump laid all those plans to waste:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security.  Later in the day, Trump dug in even further, declaring:  I don t mind owning that issue.   We re closing it down for border security and I think I win that every single time.  It s the latest surprise from a president who has routinely upended the way Washington works. But Trump s confidence, and his partnership with the congressional GOP, will be tested if roughly a quarter of the government ends up closing after next week without a bipartisan agreement. A House GOP member who lost reelection said Trump s performance on Tuesday  was unbelievable. I literally couldn t believe a president of the United States was acting that crazy.  When asked why he didn t come out publicly with his criticism, the soon-to-be-ex-lawmaker deadpanned  Hey, I gotta work, don t I?  At the White House, Schumer probed Trump about his end game during the private portion of their meeting. He noted that if the government shuts down, Pelosi will pass a bill restarting the government on Jan. 3, putting the onus on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to buckle or stick with Trump s border fight.  What do you think Mitch will do? Keep it shut down another month, another week?  Schumer asked Trump, according to a person briefed on the meeting. Trump did not reply, the person said, and did not rule out potentially passing stopgap bills to avoid a shutdown.
                    government shutdown
                    By RACHAEL BADE and SARAH FERRIS Yet publicly, Trump is all in on the shutdown and almost portrayed it as an act of kindness toward Schumer, whose own caucus forced a brief funding lapse earlier this year. Trump said Schumer was  killed  over the episode.  He doesn t want to own it. I said rather than us debating who is owning it, I ll take it. I ll take it,  Trump said. Yet that scuttles all the messaging work Republicans have done in recent weeks. Over and over again, they ve said Democrats would be the unreasonable party if the government shuts down over Trump s border wall. Now they are faced with something new altogether: A president who sees an upside to being blamed for furloughed workers and shuttered federal agencies in the name of fulfilling one of his key campaign promises. House Republican leaders had told their rank-and-file members that there would be no votes next Monday and Tuesday, anticipating a budget deal to keep the federal government open beyond the Dec. 21 deadline. But they may need to scrap those plans to give Trump billions for a border barrier, even if it faces no chance of getting through the Senate.  Yes, we d have the votes to pass it if we put it out there,  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy declared, contradicting Pelosi s taunts that the House can t pass Trump s bill. McCarthy, a close Trump ally who takes over as minority leader in January, said he s  always supported more money for border security.  And some Trump backers quickly threw their lot in with the president, who ran counter to the immigration views of many in the GOP. They seem to trust his political acumen, no matter how counter-intuitive Trump s move to tout a potential shutdown might be.  I m going to stick by President Trump. He needs to dig in, not give in. Let s take it to the public,  said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).  This liberal arrogance, I ve had enough of it. Take it on. Stare it down, see what happens.  Democrats say they aren t feeling arrogant, but that they ve already won the debate. Pelosi crowed after the meeting to her Democratic members that they d gotten Trump to own the shutdown and Schumer told reporters it was now up to McConnell to  persuade  Trump not to enter into an intractable impasse. And most Republicans were reluctant to join Trump in his  proud  stand to own a shutdown.
                    Congress
                    By BURGESS EVERETT, SARAH FERRIS and CAITLIN OPRYSKO  I ve never said that myself,  said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), who has met repeatedly with Trump about the wall.  I m always trying to work to fund the government.  Schumer has been firm since the Democrats took the House in the midterm elections: His caucus simply won t give in to Trump s demands, no matter what the GOP-controlled House does in its final days of the lame duck session. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) tried to fight back against the  Trump shutdown  narrative unfolding, despite the president s own words. Scalise dismissed suggestions that Trump s comments tie Republicans  hands and argued that if Democrats are  for open borders, Pelosi ought to come out and say that.   If Pelosi and Schumer are against any attempt to make sure the president has the tools he needs to keep the country safe just because they want to try play some kind of political games, then we ll keep battling this out,  Scalise said.  At a party lunch with Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Republicans tried to get back on the same page. They discussed how Democrats have previously supported larger amounts of money for border security, senators said. Afterward, GOP leaders came out to tell reporters of their strong support for the president s border security demands. And GOP leaders said Trump s quotes on Tuesday, which might have stuck to other presidents for months, will be forgotten if Democrats vote against a bill to fund Trump s wall in the coming days. In other words, the blame game isn t over yet.   This is going to be the finger pointing exercise we always go through   irrespective of that interesting press conference,  said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader.  I m not sure I see the endgame at the moment. Missing out on the latest scoops?

                    Updated 12/11/2018 04:11 PM ESTNancy Pelosi was on fire with her fellow Democrats.Minutes after a very public showdown with Donald Trump on Tuesday over his border wall with Mexico, the House minority leader returned to the Capitol and railed against the president in a private meeting with her colleagues. Story Continued BelowTrump  must have said the word  wall  30 times,  the California Democrat said, according to multiple sources in the room. I was trying to be the mom,  Pelosi added, but  it goes to show you: You get into a tinkle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you. And then, she went for the most sensitive part of Trump s ego. It s like a manhood thing with him   as if manhood can be associated with him,  Pelosi deadpanned.  This wall thing. A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Congressional Democrats are feeling smug   and actually a little excited   for the looming shutdown fight with the president after Tuesday s Oval Office meeting.The president may have decided at the last minute to open up the entire negotiation session to the public to throw Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York off their game. But in the end, Democrats feel confident that their leaders came out ahead.Trump, Democrats argue, fell into a trap the minute he took ownership of what Pelosi has dubbed  the Trump shutdown.  Absent a bipartisan agreement on Trump s border wall, about a quarter of the government will run out of money on Dec. 21.But instead of finger-pointing, as Republicans and Democrats usually do during spending standoffs, Trump said he wanted to close the government and said he wouldn t even try to pass the blame. If we don t get what we want ... I will shut down the government,  Trump said in the Oval Office before a room full of reporters and TV cameras.  I am proud to shut down the government for border security. ... I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I won t blame you for it. The remarks left Republicans on the Hill perplexed. Even some Democrats scratched their heads. But the comments, Democrats say, work to their benefit. Their leaders look like the only reasonable adults at the table: They were the only side arguing that a government shutdown is a bad thing.
                    Congress
                    By BURGESS EVERETT, SARAH FERRIS and CAITLIN OPRYSKO The Trump shutdown is something that can be avoided and that the American people do not need at this time of economic uncertainty, and people losing jobs and the market in a mood and the rest,  Pelosi told reporters as she was leaving the White House meeting.  It is a luxury   the Trump shutdown is a luxury that the American people cannot afford. Senate Democrats have reached a deal to devote $1.6 billion to fencing along some parts of the border. But Trump has demanded $5 billion to build his border wall, one of his most prominent 2016 campaign promises.The public sniping between both sides is a sign of just how ugly the next two years are likely to be once Democrats take control of the House. Pelosi s personal jab at the president likely won t go over well with the man who tangled with Sen. Marco Rubio after the Florida Republican called Trump s hands  small. And if House Democrats wanted to see how the potential next speaker would match up against Trump, they got a pretty good glimpse of the future Tuesday. Indeed, the episode is likely to help Pelosi in her bid to round up the 218 votes needed to be speaker. It was in that vein that Pelosi harped on Trump as she returned to the Hill to join her colleagues at a Democratic Steering Committee meeting Tuesday afternoon. She told the room the party was well positioned to fight in this shutdown showdown   particularly after Trump s comments in the televised negotiation.
                                 The press is all there! Chuck is really shouting out. I was trying to be the mom. I can t explain it to you. It was so wild,  she said, later adding:  But the fact is we did get him to say   to fully own that the shutdown was his   that was an accomplishment. At one point, after reporters and TV cameras left the Oval Office, Trump told Pelosi and Schumer that the new trade agreement he recently struck with Canada and Mexico is going to pay for the wall, Pelosi told lawmakers.On the campaign trail, the president had vowed that Mexico would pay for any southern barrier   not the United States. Pelosi and Schumer reminded him during the rare public meeting Tuesday that he failed to keep this vow.In private, however, Trump suggested both U.S. neighbors would pay for the construction with the new trade agreement.The entire thing baffled Pelosi. It s a  cultural phenomenon,  Pelosi told her colleagues, that  the fate of our country [is] in the hands of this person. The failed negotiations increase the likelihood of a partial shutdown just days before Christmas, according to multiple House aides. And with both sides dug in, a funding lapse could last weeks, possibly forcing Pelosi to deal with reopening the government as her first order of business in the majority. Some rank-and-file Democrats fear a shutdown   or even a stopgap funding bill   could hamstring their work in the first few days of the majority as they look to advance their agenda. We want to come out of the starting blocks full steam ahead,  said Rep. Anthony Brown (D-Md.).  It s less of a question on the impact on Nancy s leadership   she s a strong leader, and she ll lead us through whatever set of issues we have to deal with   but I think it s a question of whether we get to move out of the starting gate.

                        In the Oval Office, Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer clashed in spectacular fashion, with the cameras rolling and shocked reporters watching.

                    Updated 12/11/2018 05:18 PM EST This has spiraled downward,  Nancy Pelosi declared.That turned out to be an understatement.Story Continued BelowFor 17 awkward and tense minutes in the Oval Office on Tuesday, President Donald Trump and his Democratic adversaries   Pelosi, the expected incoming House speaker, and Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader   clashed in spectacular fashion, with the cameras rolling and shocked reporters watching. White House aides who had given Trump concise talking points were equally blindsided. In the end, Trump handed Democrats what they consider a massive gift: a direct and unqualified admission   on live TV, no less   that he will be responsible for a government shutdown. If we don t get what we want one way or the other ... I will shut down the government,  Trump said, adding that he would be  proud  to induce a shutdown over his push for border wall funding. I will take the mantle,  he said.  I will be the one to shut it down. 
                    government shutdown
                    By RACHAEL BADE and SARAH FERRISTuesday s meeting was supposed to be closed to the press, and Trump was even handed talking points to follow that matched language GOP House leaders were using, according to a source briefed on the conversations. Trump s top congressional liaison, Shahira Knight, met with Trump right before the meeting for a  legislative pre-brief,  according to the president s private schedule. But Trump, as he has done many times before, followed his own script. He quickly welcomed in reporters and veered off on various tangents, trying to make Schumer and Pelosi look weak on border security with the cameras rolling. Instead of sitting quietly while Trump filleted them, Pelosi and Schumer spoke up again and again. It s called funding the government, Mr. President,  Schumer jabbed at the top of the meeting when Trump began talking about the importance of funding his border wall.Pelosi, whose rise to the speakership is facing challenges from within the Democratic caucus, added later:  I think the American people recognize that we must keep government open. The confrontation spoke volumes about the new power dynamics in Washington that come with the arrival of a House Democratic majority in January. All three leaders   Trump, Pelosi and Schumer   looked uncomfortable at times during the exchange. Schumer and Pelosi frequently looked straight ahead, not making eye contact with the president as they disputed him. Vice President Mike Pence didn t speak at all. 
                                As the meeting devolved into a heated argument over whether there are enough votes in the House to fund Trump s wall, Pelosi urged the president to remove reporters from the room.  I don t think we should have a debate in front of the press on this,  she said.Trump ignored the request and the argument barreled on, insisting that he could easily get the necessary votes in the House and blaming Senate Democrats for holding things up.Then Schumer stepped in, noting that The Washington Post had granted Trump  a whole lot of Pinocchios  for distorting facts about how much of the wall had already been built.  You just say,  My way or we ll shut down the government,   Schumer said.  If it s not good border security, I won t take it,  Trump shot back.As the heated exchange continued, Pelosi and Schumer again called for an end to the spectacle. Let s call a halt to this,  Pelosi urged.  Let s debate in private,  Schumer added.But the scene was far from over. As it continued, Schumer and Pelosi at times looked shocked by what was unfolding, even as they continued pushing back on the president. When the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he s in real trouble,  Schumer quipped at one point, to which Trump responded that he did in fact win those states. Responding to Pelosi s calls to end the open-press portion of the meeting, Trump hit back with a thinly veiled swipe at the leadership tumult within her caucus.
                    Congress
                    By BURGESS EVERETT, SARAH FERRIS and CAITLIN OPRYSKO I also know that Nancy is in a situation where it s not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand that,  Trump said.That set off Pelosi.  Mr. President, please don t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory,  she said.  Elections have consequences, Mr. President,  Schumer chided. Pelosi explained that she didn t want to have to publicly dispute Trump s many questionable assertions about the border wall.  We have to have an evidence-based conversation,  she said, adding,  Let us have a conversation where we don t have to contradict in public the statistics that you put forth. Later, Pelosi was more blunt.  I did not want to, in front of those people, say,  You don t know what you are talking about,   she told reporters after leaving the meeting.But Trump didn t seem to care, bulldozing ahead every time Pelosi or Schumer tried to end the verbal skirmish. The president blamed Schumer for the brief government shutdowns earlier this year. Schumer responded that Trump has repeatedly called for a government shutdown.  I don t want to do what you did. Twenty times you   called for it,  Schumer said.By this time, Trump had had enough. But before he ended the meeting, he gave Democrats exactly what they wanted   a sound bite that they are certain to replay every time a government funding deadline nears. I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck. People in this country don t want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country,  Trump said.  I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I won t blame you for it. The last time, you shut it down. It didn t work. I will take the mantle of shutting it down. I m going to shut it down for border security. Trump stood by his comments later Tuesday afternoon. I actually like that in terms of an issue,  he told reporters gathered in the Oval Office for a bill signing, referring to shutting down the government over border security, adding later,  I don t mind owning that issue. Indeed, some of Trump s allies argued that the president s comments were not politically damaging and that they showed that Trump isn t retreating on his campaign promise to build the wall.One former White House official cautioned against assuming the fallout from the president s shtick will be disastrous, even as the person conceded that the Oval Office episode was  wild  and agreed that Trump had given Democrats an easy talking point. The official noted that it s not clear there will be a shutdown and suggested that Trump s willingness to shut down the government would be tempered by a potential compromise on wall funding.Nevertheless, Trump appears to have set aside his pledge that Mexico would foot the bill for the wall. That promise went unmentioned by Trump during his tÍte-‡-tÍte with Pelosi and Schumer, as he urged Congress to approve billions of dollars for the wall.After the meeting, Schumer and Pelosi, standing on the White House driveway, were quick to pounce on his comments, with Pelosi making sure to brand any government closure the  Trump shutdown.  He has admitted in this meeting that he will take responsibility,  Pelosi said.  The Trump shutdown is something that can be avoided and that the American people do not need at this time of economic uncertainty, and people losing jobs and the market in a mood and the rest. It is a luxury   the Trump shutdown is a luxury that the American people cannot afford. After the meeting, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders characterized the riveting spat as a  constructive dialogue  between the three leader, noting in another understatement:  Major disagreement remains on the issue of border security and transparency.

With the discussion being punted until likely after the speaker vote, it s unclear if there s still a deal for Perlmutter to make. Oregon Rep. Kurt Schrader, another Pelosi opponent, said that the larger group of anti-Pelosi Democrats has not been involved in the negotiations over term limits, only a small subsection of the group.

The Trump proposal represents the latest front in a decades-long battle over the scope of the landmark environmental law, whose requirements can impose major costs on energy companies, farmers, ranchers and real estate developers. Reversing Obama s water regulation was one of Trump s top environmental priorities   he signed an executive order directing the new rule barely a month after taking office, even as he repeatedly said he wanted  crystal clear water.   POLITICO STORY OF THE DAY --  How the IRS Was Gutted: An eight-year campaign to slash the agency s budget has left it understaffed, hamstrung and operating with archaic equipment,  by ProPublica s Paul Kiel and Jesse Eisinger:  Over time, the IRS has slowly transformed, one employee departure at a time. The result is a bureaucracy on life support and tens of billions in lost government revenue. ProPublica estimates a toll of at least $18 billion every year, but the true cost could easily run tens of billions of dollars higher.    The last time the IRS had fewer than 10,000 revenue agents was 1953, when the economy was a seventh of its current size. And the IRS is still shrinking.   Without enough staff, the IRS has slashed even basic functions. It has drastically pulled back from pursuing people who don t bother filing their tax returns.   Corporations and the wealthy are the biggest beneficiaries of the IRS  decay.  ProPublicaON THE WORLD STAGE --  Iraqi Who Once Killed Americans Is a U.S. Dilemma as He Gains Political Power,  by WSJ s Isabel Coles, Ali Nabhan and Ghassan Adnan in Baghdad:  [Qais al-]Khazali s evolution from outlaw to aspiring statesman illustrates Iraq s changing political landscape and the Trump administration s dilemma as it tries to curb Iran s influence in Iraq and across the Middle East. As the U.S. tries to weaken Iran s proxies   some of them are now boosting their profile through the very democratic process the U.S. introduced to Iraq.    [I]n the U.S., the House this week passed a bill that would require the president to impose sanctions on groups that threaten stability and peace in Iraq and to designate them as terrorists.  WSJ2020 WATCH --  Potent Weapon or Poison Pill? Super PACs Pose Quandary for 2020 Democrats,  by NYT s Shane Goldmacher:  The choice will represent one of the earliest and potentially more consequential crossroads of the nascent primary, and has been the subject of fierce debate within the inner circles of some candidates.  Is it worth giving up possible seven-figure checks for the chance to campaign more effectively as the candidate of the little guy? Or, put another way, can a Democrat risk embracing unlimited money in an era when small donors and the party s seemingly ascendant left wing may pummel PAC-backed candidates as allies of the rich?  NYT -- CHRIS CADELAGO:  Kasich s camp slams GOP effort to head off primary vs. Trump :  Trump-aligned Republican activists in New Hampshire are quietly maneuvering to fortify his standing and avoid a potentially disruptive primary challenge in 2020. In the most far-reaching move, Donald Trump s allies are looking to scrap the state GOP s tradition of remaining neutral in the primary   to clear the way for an endorsement of the president. They re also moving to install one of their own as head of the state Republican Party.  POLITICOTHE INVESTIGATIONS   DARREN SAMUELSOHN:  Trump s biggest 2020 win: Avoiding prosecution :  Prosecutors say [Michael] Cohen s payments to the women constituted illegal campaign contributions, and some legal experts say Trump could be vulnerable to criminal charges as a result. But long-standing Justice Department protocol dating to the Watergate scandal holds that a sitting president can t be prosecuted when he s in office. That would change as soon as Trump transitions from sitting president to former president.   That means the presidency itself may amount to Trump s best legal defense.

                        The president had pushed the Senate majority leader to vote on the bill, which has divided Republicans.
                    By BURGESS EVERETT12/11/2018 10:15 AM EST
                    Updated 12/11/2018 11:33 AM ESTMitch McConnell has decided to bring criminal justice reform to the Senate floor as soon as this week, a remarkable turnaround for the long-stalled bill that could potentially give President Donald Trump a big bipartisan win. The latest version of the measure might be released Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the matter, and is likely to win over more Republicans on a plan that had sharply divided the GOP. Story Continued BelowTrump has called McConnell several times since the midterm elections to ask the reluctant majority leader to take up the legislation, according to a person briefed on the talks. And on Tuesday, the Kentucky senator said he would move the bill  at the request of the president and following improvements to the legislation that has been secured by several members.  Multiple Republican senators on both sides of the issue said last week that the legislation appeared dead with McConnell prioritizing other legislation and wanting to avoid splitting his caucus. But Trump tweeted on Friday that McConnell should take it up, and a public lobbying campaign by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and other GOP senators appeared to help turn the tide. And now the bill has  new life,  said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), who has drawn criticism from some advocates, despite working on the issue for years and trying to bring on more Republicans. Cornyn said he s spoken frequently with Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, about moving the bill forward and said he was now  optimistic  that it will pass.  Given the fact that we have a short window of time to do it, obviously Sen. McConnell was concerned,  Cornyn said on Tuesday.  But he obviously is now doing what the president asked him to do, and I think we got the bill in a better place that makes it more likely we can pass it.

The legislation, which is backed by Trump, also has strong backing from Kushner and Grassley, who is leaving his role to take over the Senate Finance Committee next year. Grassley and other Republicans like Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky have rapidly revised the legislation to build more support in recent weeks, and in an interview on Monday evening, Grassley called it an  ideal opportunity  for a rare bipartisan success.  The president is tough on crime and reminds you all the time. He s for this,  Grassley said, noting that it had already been negotiated with the House.  We ve got 75 votes in the Senate. We listened to the caucus   everything people have asked us to do, we ve done. I don t know what more we can do.  The House s schedule is still in flux, but outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan is ready to move as soon as the Senate passes legislation.  As the speaker has said, the House stands ready to act on the revised Senate criminal justice reform bill,  said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan. The legislation makes sweeping changes to federal prison laws, expanding programs designed to discourage recidivism and limit juvenile solitary confinement. It would also reduce mandatory minimum sentences for certain crimes. Most conservative groups and many law-enforcement groups support it, though Cornyn is still trying to get buy-in from the National Sheriffs  Association. Critics of the bill, led by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), have argued that the measure could allow the early release of violent criminals. Grassley and other advocates have scrambled to address that concern. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) endorsed the bill on Friday after securing language that would  exclude violent offenders from being released early, and close Trump ally Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) backed it while touting changes that bar judges from  unilaterally  making serious criminal eligible for reduced sentences.

                    By JOSH GERSTEINThe latest version of the bill may face heavy opposition on the Senate floor. McConnell said that without cooperation to move quickly on criminal justice reform, the farm bill, funding the government and a raft of nominations, the Senate is likely to be in session the week between Christmas and New Year s Day.  Unless we approach all this work in a highly collaborative, productive way and take real advantage of unanimous consent to expedite proceedings, it is virtually certain that the Senate will need to be in session between Christmas and New Year s,  McConnell said.  Expediting this work would require an extraordinary degree of collaboration and hard work from everyone.  Some supporters say they are willing to limit debate on the criminal justice package to pass it before Democrats take back the House and potentially destroy the fragile compromise. But moving quickly on the bill will require the consent of all 100 senators, including Cotton and other critics. Otherwise, the legislation could take the better part of a week to complete. In a statement, Cotton said the bill  has major problems and allows early release of many categories of serious violent criminals.  He indicated he will introduce amendments to alter the bill  to address its many remaining threats to public safety,  comments that suggest he will not agree to a quick debate with no amendments. A long debate on criminal justice reform could also affect efforts to avert a partial government shutdown on Dec. 21.  Will Tom go down kicking and screaming, or will he acknowledge that he fought the battle?  said one person familiar with internal GOP negotiations.  I don t know if he s going to burn the place down because of this.  Marianne LeVine contributed to this report. Missing out on the latest scoops?

About 2,200 of the active duty troops will be pulled out before the holidays, the officials said, shrinking an unusual domestic deployment that was viewed by critics as a political stunt and a waste of military resources.  That will leave about 3,000 active duty troops in Texas, Arizona and California, mainly comprised of military police and helicopter transport crews who are assisting border patrol agents. There also will still be about 2,300 members of the National Guard who were sent to the border region as part of a separate deployment that started in April.  Army Secretary Mark Esper tells our colleague Connor O Brien in a POLITICO Pro Q&A he doesn t see the border deployment as hurting readiness.

PELOSI AND SCHUMER TO MEET WITH TRUMP ON BORDER WALL AND OTHER FUNDING ISSUES:  Donald Trump s meeting Tuesday with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer may go a long way toward determining whether the government enters a partial shutdown before Christmas,  write POLITICO s Burgess Everett and Heather Caygle.  But as Democrats seriously re-engage with Trump for the first time in nearly a year, their broad distrust of the president has expectations for a deal at rock bottom.   PENTAGON CIO TO TESTIFY BEFORE FOR HASC PANEL: Defense Department Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy is scheduled to testify this afternoon before the House Armed Services Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee on the  Defense Department s Artificial Intelligence Structure, Investments and Applications.  WAITING FOR  THE RATIONALE  FOR A $750B DEFENSE BUDGET: Count House Armed Services ranking Democrat Adam Smith as a tough sell on the president s plan now to boost the fiscal 2020 defense budget request to $750 billion. Trump embraced the higher topline over the $733 billion the Pentagon had initially planned to request.  It seems hard for me to imagine that we re going to be able to get to a $750 billion defense budget in a fiscally responsible way that balances out ... all the priorities of the country,  the likely next HASC chairman told Morning D.  But I will wait to see that argument.   Senate Armed Services Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), meanwhile,  backs the new $750 billion topline, noting it fits the 3 percent to 5 percent annual growth a recent review of the Trump administration s National Defense Strategy said is necessary for the U.S. to maintain its military edge. On Trump initially indicating he d cut the defense budget to $700 billion, Inhofe told Morning D:  I don t think was ever his intention. You never know with that guy. He s a negotiator.  THE ARMY S  RENAISSANCE  MAN:  Army Secretary Mark Esper sees himself as sort of an all-purpose  renaissance  man,  writes Connor in his interview with Esper.  In just over a year on the job, he s pushed to reorient the service to implement the Trump administration s new National Defense Strategy and pursue new modernization priorities, necessitating some difficult budget decisions. ...   There s a renaissance underway in the United States Army,  he declared confidently.   WALZ EYES VA S  MAR-A-LAGO SHADOW RULERS : House Veterans Affairs ranking Democrat Tim Walz on Monday renewed his call for the VA to release documents related to the reported influence of three members of the president s Mar-a-Lago club.  The American people deserve to know the full nature and extent of this influential relationship between the Department and the three Mar-a-Lago members who ostensibly used their wealth and connections to President Trump and his family to make decisions on behalf of the Department,  Walz writes in a letter to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie. ADMINISTRATION PRESSES COURT ON  EXTRAORDINARY  INTERFERENCE ON TRANSGENDER POLICY:  The Trump administration pressed a federal appeals court Monday to allow the U.S. military to restrict service by transgender men and women, calling it  truly extraordinary  that judges throughout the country have stood in the way of its policy,  via The Washington Post.  Judge Thomas B. Griffith noted the way in which President Trump announced the initial ban last year on transgender troops in a series of tweets   and to the surprise of military leaders    was extraordinary, too.    One judge on the appeals court also pressed opponents of the ban on  who is combat ready?  adds the Washington Examiner.  DoD MUM ON UNUSUAL TIMING OF JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN PICK:  What was President Trump thinking when he announced his pick to be the next Joint Chiefs chairman, while the current chairman has nearly a year left on his term?  asks the Washington Examiner.  If the Pentagon knows, it s not saying.  FIVE MARINES DECLARED DEAD AFTER AIR CRASH OFF JAPAN:  Five United States Marines were declared dead on Tuesday, six days after they went missing when two aircraft crashed off the coast of Japan during a routine training exercise,  reports The New York Times.  The deaths follow a growing number of recent American military accidents, including two deadly collisions involving American warships in 2017, and will likely sharpen the spotlight on the country s military operations in Asia.   Earlier, one Marine recovered the day of the accident was released from the hospital, adds Military.com.  Also, Japan s potential buy of 100 more F-35 s would have big international significance, writes Defense News.  F-35 s arrive in Australian,  reports Defense News.  The U.S. returns church bells taken as war booty from the Philippines in 1901, reports the NYT.  And the U.S. sanctions three senior North Korean officials for state-sponsored censorship activities and alleged human rights violations and abuses, reports POLITICO s Rebecca Morin. POMPEO SAYS INF WITHDRAWAL THREAT  SETS DOWN MARKER  FOR PUTIN:  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday said he set down a marker for Russian President Vladimir Putin in a recent speech when he announced the U.S. would quit the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty if Russia did not correct alleged violations of the pact within a 60-day deadline,  via the Washington Examiner.   Look, what I was intending to do there was articulate President Trump s efforts around the world to continue the tradition of American leadership, to keep the world prosperous and the people around the world secure,  Pompeo told Hugh Hewitt in a radio interview.  ADMINISTRATION LOOKS TO COUNTER CHINA AND RUSSIA IN AFRICA:  The Trump administration plans to unveil a new strategy for Africa this week focusing on countering China s growing influence on the continent, as well as Russia s attempts to gain footholds in resource-rich, unstable countries,  two senior U.S. officials told NBC News.  White House national security adviser John Bolton is scheduled to unveil the strategy Thursday at the Heritage Foundation.  Earlier, on Wednesday, the Senate Armed Services Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee convenes a hearing on the  Implications of China s Presence and Investment in Africa.   Today, SASC s Seapower Subcommittee convenes a closed briefing on China and Russia s naval activities.  Closer to America s backyard, Russia sends two nuclear-capable bombers to Venezuela, reports the AP.  And here s how the U.S. could lose the next big war, writes the Washington Examiner. DIMINISHED SAUDI INFLUENCE ON DISPLAY IN YEMEN DEBATE:  When the Senate voted in March on a resolution to withdraw American military support for Saudi Arabia s war in Yemen, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman personally visited Capitol Hill to urge senators to oppose it,  writes POLITICO s Theodoric Meyer.  Now the resolution has returned, but the crown prince has not. Saudi Arabia s typically formidable lobbying operation has gone quiet as the Senate prepares to vote on the resolution again, a sign of the kingdom s diminished influence in Washington after the killing of the journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi two months ago.   The Senate appears poised to pass the Yemen resolution. So now what? asks Defense One.  In Sweden, Yemen s warring parties discuss expanding a truce for the key port of Hodeidah, reports the AP.  And the U.N. special envoy to Yemen says he hopes factions agree on further talks early next year, via Reuters. SUICIDE CAR BOMBER STRIKES NEAR KABUL:  An Afghan official says a suicide car bomber has struck a security convoy on the outskirts of Kabul, killing four security forces,  reports the AP.

Nancy Pelosi will meet with President Donald Trump this morning to try to reach a spending deal and avoid a threatened partial government shutdown on Dec. 21. But past experience of Trump negotiating with  Chuck and Nancy  over border and immigration issues prompts skepticism that the president will stick to any agreement with the pair.  The Democrats may have backed themselves into a political corner,  POLITICO s Burgess Everett and Heather Caygle report. Pelosi has not yet nailed down enough votes to be speaker in the next Congress, and she can t risk losing her caucus s leftmost members.  Schumer, too, is trying to brush off criticisms over his negotiating record from liberals who think he shouldn t give the president any spending at all on a border barrier, even as Congress provided more than a billion dollars last year.   Schumer and Pelosi have said Trump won t get the $5 billion  he s asking for the border wall, and they ve floated the idea of putting off to next year the debate over wall funding by setting Department of Homeland Security spending at current levels.

SCOTUS TO REVIEW KEY AGENCY DEFERENCE DOCTRINE: The Supreme Court agreed Monday to revisit a doctrine giving regulatory agencies significant leeway by hearing a case called Kisor v. O Rourke. The case, which concerns veterans  disability benefits, allows the high court to revisit so-called Auer deference, which directs the courts to give  controlling weight  to an agency s interpretation of its own regulations unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous. Auer deference is a sort of first cousin to Chevron deference, which directs courts to defer to any reasonable agency interpretation of an ambiguous law.  Auer  deference is important in enforcement matters because it allows agencies like DOL to issue guidance to clarify the meaning of imprecise regulations without having to go through formal notice-and-comment rulemaking. Conservative critics of Auer think they have at least four high court votes to overturn it, with Chief Justice John Roberts a potential swing vote. Although there are important legal distinctions between the Auer and Chevron doctrines, the legal world will watch this case closely for signals about how the Supreme Court might rule in the future on Chevron. Kisor is expected to be heard this spring, with a ruling by the end of June. Read the petition here.  DEMOCRATS BLAST PUBLIC CHARGE: More than 100 House Democrats posted a comment letter Monday in the Federal Register that argued the Trump administration s  public charge  proposed rule (which would deny green cards to immigrants on the basis of their receiving food stamps, Medicaid, or certain other government benefits) undermines the intent of Congress. The phrase  public charge,  the Democrats said, has in the past been interpreted to describe a person who is primarily dependent of the government for care. Under the proposed rule, a person could be deemed likely to become a public charge if that person received benefits exceeding 15 percent of the federal poverty level   currently $1,821.  The proposed rule, on which public comment closed Monday, was praised by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors lower levels of immigration.  Immigrant self-sufficiency no longer appears to be a primary goal of U.S. immigration policy,  the group said in its public comment.  However, it should be.  By Monday evening, the regulation had  received nearly 190,000 comments. Read the congressional Democrats  comment letter here.  Two House Democrats likely to lead key committees next year also condemned the proposal Monday in a letter to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), who is slated to chair the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.) who is likely to lead the Ways and Means Committee, wrote that  Congress is responsible for making decisions about the eligibility of immigrants for benefits under federal health programs,  calling DHS  moves  highly inappropriate.  Read the letter here. JOINT EMPLOYER EXTENSION: The National Labor Relations Board announced Monday a second extension of the comment period for its proposed joint employer rule, which would make it harder for businesses to be held liable for labor violations committed by franchisees and contractors. Comments must be submitted by Jan. 14 of next year, and comments replying to these comments must be submitted by Jan. 22. The board said there will be no additional extensions after this one. Read the announcement here and more on the rule from POLITICO s Ian Kullgren here.  The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute calculates that the joint employer rule would cost workers a  conservatively  estimated $1.3 billion in wages annually. In Dec. 9 comments, EPI Director of Policy Heidi Shierholz and Director of Government Affairs Celine McNicholas argued that the narrower definition of joint employment would make collective bargaining among subcontracted and temporary workers  nearly impossible.  Read a press release here and EPI s comment here.  NEW SOLICITOR AT NLRB: The National Labor Relations Board announced Monday that Fred Jacob will be the board s new solicitor. He will leave his current post as solicitor of the Federal Labor Relations Authority to become the NLRB s chief legal officer. The position has been vacant since January 2017. Read the announcement here. MEMBERSHIP UP POST-JANUS: Despite expectations that public-sector unions would lose members after the Supreme Court s June ruling in Janus v. AFSCME, some have grown or held steady following the June decision, Katherine Barrett and Richard Greene report for Governing. In Pennsylvania, the number of unionized state executive branch employees increased by a little more than 1,000 (to 51,127), and  in Oregon, the Local 503 chapter of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) reported in September that new union members have outnumbered dropouts by three to two.  Maxford Nelsen of the Freedom Foundation, a conservative think tank that sided with the Janus plaintiffs, told Governing the  number of folks who have successfully resigned post -Janus is much smaller than the number that have attempted to resign.  Some pro- Janus observers say many public employees are still unaware of the ruling and of their right to opt out of paying fair-share fees. More from Governing here.  OSHA RECORDKEEPING RULE TO OMB: OSHA sent to the White House for review Friday a final rule that would roll back injury record-keeping requirements. Read a September 28 letter from six House Democrats objecting to the change here. TRUMP CAMPAIGN STAFFER FIGHTS NDA: A former national phone bank administrator and director of Hispanic engagement for President Donald Trump s campaign is fighting a nearly $25,000 penalty for violating a nondisclosure agreement, Zoe Tillman reports for BuzzFeed. Jessica Denson was ordered to pay $25,000 to the campaign in October after closed-door arbitration.  The award stems from a lawsuit that  Denson filed against the campaign in 2017  claiming that officials discriminated against her, cyberbullied her, and were otherwise hostile towards her,  Tillman reports. The campaign answered that bringing legal action violated her nondisclosure agreement, which  prohibited her from disclosing confidential information, disparaging the campaign, competing with the campaign, or violating its intellectual property.  Denson is now challenging the arbitrator s award, arguing that allegations about discrimination and harassment aren t covered under the NDA. More from Buzzfeed here.

WHITE,  MAYA PARTHASARATHY and  ALEXANDER NIEVES 12/11/2018 09:15 AM ESTTHE BUZZ: Elections have consequences, and not just for who wins office this time around: An energized 2018 electorate could have profound implications for the 2020 cycle.  -- Here s what we mean: The threshold for qualifying a ballot initiative is directly tied to turnout, with the  minimum number of signatures required a percentage of the total votes for governor in the most recent election. So after Gov. Jerry Brown s 2014 reelection bid plumbed the dismal depths of civic participation, initiative backers have only needed a relatively slim 365,000 or so signatures. Story Continued Below -- This midterm looked quite different. Surging voter enthusiasm helped propel a resounding Democratic victory that included the seven-for-seven sweep of targeted GOP House seats. Turnout in Los Angeles doubled, and the sum total of ballots looks to be in the neighborhood of 12.7 million (the secretary of state will certify the tentative results this week). That would surpass 2014 by more than 5 million ballots   and make it a lot tougher to get something on the ballot for 2020.  -- Initiative bankrollers have already taken advantage of the prevailing lower requirement to circulate or qualify several high-stakes measures for 2020, including initiatives to roll back recent sentencing and parole reforms; levy a statewide soda tax; repeal California s new cash bail ban; authorize Native-American-run gambling; and increase commercial property taxes, aka Split Roll.  -- The bar for future initiatives is about to get a lot higher. That could also alter the calculus for interest groups seeking to use items as leverage over the state Legislature, as we saw in last year s flurry of deal-making.  BUENOS DIAS, Good TUESDAY morning. Silicon Valley titan Reid Hoffman is backing a play for voter data, and an investigation of location information sharpens a debate over California s privacy protections.

                        The president battled with the Democratic leaders over his border wall in an extraordinary Oval Office meeting televised for the public.
                    By BURGESS EVERETT, SARAH FERRIS and CAITLIN OPRYSKO12/11/2018 08:54 AM EST
                    Updated 12/11/2018 03:26 PM ESTPresident Donald Trump clashed sharply with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in a remarkable Oval Office meeting before reporters Tuesday, with the president threatening to shut down the government and the Democrats warning him they will not bend.In a pitched partisan argument televised for all to see, the GOP president and the House and Senate Democratic leaders traded barbs over Trump s border wall during what was supposed to be a private negotiating session to keep a large swath of the government from shuttering after Dec. 21.Story Continued BelowAnd in perhaps his most definitive statement yet, Trump said he would be  proud  to preside over a partial shutdown if that s what it takes to get his campaign promise fulfilled.Democrats urged the president against such a stance, even as they seized on the chance to blame Trump for any potential shutdown. We shouldn t shut down the government over a dispute,  said Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader.

The last time, Chuck, you shut it down,  shot back Trump, referring to Democrats  brief shut down over immigration earlier this year.  If we don t get what we want   I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck. The public battle revealed the yawning gap between the president and congressional Democrats, foreshadowing the next 10 days of dramatic back-and-forth over whether roughly a quarter of the government will lapse due to the president s $5 billion border wall request. It seems both parties have little incentive to give in: the Democratic grassroots doesn t want a compromise with Trump, and the president sees no reason to give up now that the midterms are over.Republicans are already grappling with the fallout. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said bluntly:  I hope that s not where we end up.  I understand it was a rather spirited meeting. But I feel like I see a smooth ending here. I haven t given up hope,  McConnell said after a GOP lunch with Vice President Mike Pence. After the meeting, Schumer said that Trump had a  temper tantrum  and Pelosi said when Democrats take over in January, they will pass a bill that keeps border security funded at current levels. The President showed what he really thinks, he wants to shut down the government,  Schumer told reporters at the Capitol.  It ll be a Trump shutdown and then Jan. 3, if it happens, the House will open it up again. Later, Schumer also backed away from a bipartisan Senate bill providing $1.6 billion in border fencing. Instead he s endorsing only the amount of funding that the president got last year: $1.3 billion.Inside the White House meeting, the Democrats appeared united in their vow not to accede to Trump s demands, but the president seemed to revel in battling both of them for the cameras.
                                Trump repeatedly said that the outgoing House GOP majority will give him his border wall funding and that the problem is Schumer s Senate, bragging that Republicans held the upper chamber even as Schumer ridiculed him for touting wins in deep red states.Then Trump turned his fire on Pelosi, questioning her negotiating position as she battles for the speakership. Liberals say the two Democratic leaders should deny Trump anything for his wall, and Pelosi is taking on a fight while she s still trying to accrue secure 218 votes to be elected speaker. If we don t have border security, we ll shut down the government,  Trump said, taunting Pelosi.  Nancy s in a situation where it s not easy to talk right now The California Democrat responded icily:  Please don t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting. As Vice President Mike Pence watched on, Democrats said that the public firefight was unproductive. Let s debate in private,  Schumer offered. Let us have a conversation where we don t have to contradict in public,  Pelosi pleaded.But Trump seemed to play up his persistence for the press. I will take the mantle,  Trump said of blame for a shut down.  I will be the one to shut it down. Pelosi told her caucus earlier Tuesday that she and Schumer are pitching two funding options to Trump   neither of which would deliver a funding boost for the border wall, according to multiple people in Democratic Caucus meeting. Both of their options would punt the border wall fight until fall 2019, long after House Democrats retake the majority, Pelosi told her caucus just ahead of the White House meeting. 
                            Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer returns to the Capitol after meeting with President Trump over border security and building  the wall.   | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICODemocrats planned to pitch Trump on a yearlong stopgap bill for the Department of Homeland Security, which would reup a current budget of $1.3 billion for border fencing, while approving the other six unfinished bills. That idea has already been rejected by GOP leaders on Capitol Hill. They also intended to present a new backup option: Approve a massive yearlong stopgap bill, and punt all funding fights until fall 2019 to maximize Democratic leaders  leverage in the House. But GOP leaders said they didn t think Trump would sign something that barely speaks to his border wall request.  I don t expect the president would go along with that [if] he s not getting the border funding he wants,  said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). Other Republicans said Trump s remarks made their job harder but many blamed Democrats for being intractable.  I don t think it s something to be proud of, I think it s something to be resolved,  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).  It s absurd to deny this president additional wall money. Ahead of the meeting, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Pelosi and Schumer to cut a deal with Trump on funding the border wall, raising the prospects of another government shutdown this year over immigration. Senate Democrats refused to fund the government for a couple days in January in an effort to force a debate on immigration reform. 
                    government shutdown
                    By RACHAEL BADE and SARAH FERRISMcConnell said he would watch  eagerly  to see if Democrats could accept a $5 billion infusion of money for border security.  There is no reason for my Democratic friends to end this year the way they began it. It would be truly bizarre for them to decide they d prefer a partial government shutdown to reasonable funding for national security. It would signal that their party is more committed to political spite for the president than to the public interest,  McConnell said.While Congress has provided funding for border security, the massive spending bill Trump signed this spring was mostly restricted to fencing and border protection as a whole rather than a Trump-style wall or even the construction of wall prototypes.He appeared to mix up the two again Tuesday when he claimed that Democrats voted in 2006 for a  wall,  which seems to refer to 2006 legislation to construct fencing along the southern border, even though it garnered little Democratic support in the House. If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall,  Trump wrote.  They know how important it is!
