        President Trump denies caving to Democrats in deal to end the government shutdown
    Some in the base are not buying itPresident Donald Trump issued a tweet on Friday after outrage ensued from many of his supporters over a deal to end the partial government shutdown without any funding for his border wall.  I wish people would read or listen to my words on the Border Wall,  tweeted the president.  This was in no way a concession.   It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days,  he added,  if no deal is done, it s off to the races! The president made an announcement from the Rose Garden at the White House Friday that the government shutdown had ended after he agreed to sign on to a continuing resolution to fund the government without any funding for the border wall. Previously, he had tweeted that he would not cave to the Democrats on the issue of border wall funding. On Tuesday he made a case for the border wall and ended it with the promise,  No Cave!  Without a Wall our Country can never have Border or National Security,  he tweeted.  With a powerful Wall or Steel Barrier, Crime Rates (and Drugs) will go substantially down all over the U.S.   The Dems know this but want to play political games,  he added.  Must finally be done correctly. No Cave! But many of his supporters were disappointed that he appeared to hand a political victory to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) after facing pressure over the shutdown. Ann Coulter, one of Trump s biggest supporters, called him the biggest  wimp  to ever serve as U.S. president. The partial government shutdown will end after 35 days, the longest such shutdown in U.S. history. The deal allows for federal employees to receive backpay for the period of the shutdown. Here s the latest on the shutdown deal:

        Stunning new poll shows Nancy Pelosi net approval hit hard by government shutdown
    You won t see this reported much in the mainstream mediaWhile much of the media has reported the partial government shutdown as an unmitigated disaster for President Donald Trump, one poll shows that it didn t help House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) much either. The NBC/Wall Street Journal found that Pelosi had the worst net approval rating among a list of politicians related to the government shutdown. National Journal Editor Josh Kraushaar first noticed the stunning result from the poll published Sunday. Pelosi s negatives shot up during government shutdown more than any pol,  Kraushaar noted,  now the most unpopular politician tested in the survey. In the except he posted, Pelosi registered positively for 28 percent of those polled, and negatively for 47 percent, for a net approval rating of minus-19 percentage points. This was the largest negative net rating, including that of Trump, which was minus-12 points, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) at minus-18 points. Pelosi resisted the president s demands that the Democrats vote for a budget that would include funding for his promised border wall. Eventually the president relented and the partial government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, ended with an agreement to fund the government for three weeks. Many of the president s supporters have been split on whether the agreement to end the shutdown was a strategic necessity for Trump or simply a failure of negotiation. Here s the latest on the budget battle:

        CEO of cybersecurity company foregoes salary to pay workers during government shutdown
    A wonderful gestureMoe Jafari, CEO of HumanTouch, is foregoing his salary in order to pay the company s workers their wages during the government s partial shutdown. HumanTouch, a cybersecurity company in Tysons Corner, Virginia, depends on government contracts to pay its staff. The cybersecurity and IT firm works to help secure the nation s infrastructure. What are the details? Jafari said that he would not be drawing a salary until the government reopened and HumanTouch staffers began receiving pay again. The partial government shutdown entered its 25th day on Tuesday.  Great people are hard to come by,  Jafari told WUSA-TV on Monday.  We don t want to lose them. The outlet reported that HumanTouch   which works with the Department of Defense   has approximately 20 federal contracts, and more than 200 contracted employees, WUSA reported.Jafari explained that 10 percent of those contracted employees were at risk of losing their pay as a result of the partial government shutdown.  I am foregoing my entire salary during this time period,  Jafari told the outlet.  It affects a lot of people s lives, and that was the right thing to do. Jafari isn t the company s only executive to lend a hand. According to WUSA, 10 other executives at the company will donate a day s pay on a weekly basis   all in order to help subsidize other employees  wages during the shutdown. The company is calling it a  furlough fund.  I don t want the pat on the back. I don t want any of that. That s not the point. Again, this is something that we re doing because it means a lot to us,  Jafari said. WUSA reported that Jafari is simply  challenging other companies to step up to the plate and do the same to pay their employees until the government shutdown is over.

        Marriages on hold in DC amid government shutdown   here s why
    DC marriage bureau closedThe partial government shutdown is placing marriages on hold in the nation s capital.Why is this happening? The marriage bureau closed when the shutdown began Dec. 22. Since that day, no one in Washington, D.C., has been able to get a marriage license, according to WJLA-TV.One couple, Dan Pollock and Danielle Geanacopoulos, decided to have their ceremony anyway, after they found out they couldn t get a license, WJLA reported. Geanacopoulos wore her white gown and veil, and Pollock wore his tux during the mock ceremony. They plan to return to the courthouse to make it official once the shutdown ends.The couple are both former Senate staffers who have lived through government shutdowns before, the TV station reported.  It s easy to see the TSA running, police on duty, etc., and not really see that not only are citizens affected, but thousands and thousands of government employees who aren t really sure when the next paycheck will come,  Pollock said.D.C. courts posted an announcement on its website that indicates services are limited.   The Committee on Admissions, Marriage Bureau, Library, and Child Care Center are closed during the government shutdown,  the website states.Is anything being done?Mayor Muriel Bowser said Wednesday evening that she plans to propose emergency legislation that would allow marriage licenses to be issued. Mayor Bowser will put forth emergency legislation to establish the authority to issue marriage licenses during a shutdown,  John Falcicchio, Bowser s chief of staff, told the media.  Just like the Grinch can t steal Christmas, the shutdown can t stop love.

        GOP senators introduce legislation to prevent future government shutdowns
    Sen. Mike Lee, who co-sponsored the bill, said that shutdowns  are not a responsible way to govern Nine Republican senators have introduced legislation that would prevent government shutdowns from happening in the future.What are the details?After failing to reach a budget deal, the U.S. government partially shut down on Dec. 22. President Donald Trump has declared that he won t sign any spending bill that does not include funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, but so far Congress has refused to comply. On Friday, the shutdown tied with one during the Clinton administration for the longest in U.S. history. Since both the Senate and the House have recessed until Monday, that tie is guaranteed to be broken.On Friday, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) introduced a bill to prevent shutdowns from ever happening again. It was co-sponsored by GOP Sens. Johnny Isakson (Ga.), John Barrasso (Wyo.), Steve Daines (Mont.), Mike Enzi (Wyo.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Mike Lee (Utah), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), and Jim Risch (Idaho).This legislation would automatically create a continuing resolution, in order to keep the government funded at the same level as it was before the deadline to pass a spending bill. This funding would drop by one percent after 120 days, and then by another one percent every 90 days after that,  until Congress does its job and completes the annual appropriations process.  At that rate, it would take nearly 25 years before the government received absolutely no funding like it is right now.Has this legislation been introduced before?This isn t the first time Portman and Isakson have introduced such legislation. According to Isakson, the two have co-sponsored similar legislation  each Congress since 2012.  Portman also introduced it in 2010 and 2011. Shutdowns are not a responsible way to govern. They create instability and unpredictability not only in our government, but also for the many families and businesses that interact with the federal government,  Lee said in a statement sent by his office to TheBlaze.  Sen. Portman s End Government Shutdowns Act strikes a necessary balance between incentivizing good budgeting habits while discouraging last-minute, haphazard stopgap funding measures. And it provides stability and predictability without allowing Congress to pat ourselves on the back for averting a self-made crisis.  It costs money to shut down the government and it costs more money to reopen it. When the government shuts down, Americans are deprived of essential services and their tax dollars are needlessly wasted,  Grassley said in a news release from his office.  Shutdowns also erode the trust between citizens and their government. This legislation would help ensure that policy stalemates and political interests would no longer get in the way of government s duty to serve the American people.

        Could the White House lose its water during the shutdown?
    DC Water also has the option to put a lien on properties of customers who don t pay their bills
	The folks at DC Water   the capital s water authority   said recently that maybe they ll cut off the water to the White House if the shutdown continues to drag on, the New York Post reported.

	In a report Wednesday, the Washington Post revealed that the U.S. Treasury Department emailed DC water  to say that it  will only collect and remit  about $10.5 million of the $16.5 million that federal agencies owe the city water and sewer authority for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019.  The $5 billion shortfall is due to the ongoing partial government shutdown.
	How did DC Water react?

	According to WAMU-FM, the subsequent meeting of the DC Water Board was ... interesting.

	As the station noted, the government is the largest water user in the city. So when your biggest customer doesn t pay its bill, what do you do? That prompted an idea from the DC Water Board Chairman Tommy Wells. From WAMU:

	Now, under the district s law, DC Water is permitted to shut off water to a consumer who doesn t pay for 30 days, as WAMU noted. And residential customers get dinged with a 10 percent fee when their payments are late. Also, if you re more than 60 days late, the authority can put a lien on your place. Would DC Water really put a lien on the White House or cut off its water supply?Nah, it was pretty obvious that this was a joke. But it did lead to some interesting debate, WAMU later reported   including a discussion about the fact that DC Water buys its treated Potomac River water from the feds, via the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

        National parks brimming with trash, human feces as government shutdown continues
    Park rangers and other staffers are among the thousands of federal employees furloughed Overflowing garbage cans, human feces, and illegal off-roading are just a few of the problems plaguing some national parks where visitors are taking advantage of the lack of supervision during the partial government shutdown.Park rangers and other staffers are among the more than 380,000 federal employees furloughed during the shutdown that is in its 12th day. The Trump administration has permitted the parks to remain open despite the staff furloughs. Previous administrations have closed the parks during shutdowns, The Associated Press reported.What s the story?Some parks have begun closing certain areas out of public health and safety concerns, according to U.S. News and World Report. Joshua Tree National Park in California closed its campgrounds Wednesday amid health concerns.The National Park Service noted that the pit toilets were near capacity and human waste in public areas was becoming a problem, adding that illegal off-roading and other harmful actions were also causing damage to the park. Yosemite National Park announced that it would also be closing several areas because of  human waste issues and a lack of staffing.  It s a free-for-all,  Dakota Snider, 24, who lives and works in Yosemite Valley, told the AP Monday.  It s so heartbreaking. There is more trash and human waste and disregard for the rules than I ve seen in my four years living here.  Kristen Brengel, vice president of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association, told CNN that the absence of supervision seems to have created a sense of  lawlessness  among the parks  visitors.  People are bringing in dogs and drones and there are instances where people aren t following the rules and it is not good for the wildlife and the environment,  she said.Officials at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado said Monday they were closing restrooms and locking up trash bins. What else?At some parks, private companies have jumped in to handle some the maintenance normally handled by federal employees. Contractors who operate tours in Yellowstone National Park are grooming trails, hauling garbage, and filling restrooms with toilet paper in an effort to keep their businesses open. It s definitely not our preference   the park service does a good job doing their thing and we hate to see them out of work,  Travis Watt, general manager of See Yellowstone Alpen Guides based in West Yellowstone, Montana, told the AP.  But it s something we can handle.

        Michigan grocery store offers free groceries to members of Coast Guard impacted by government shutdown
    This is one incredible storeBayside Market in Traverse City, Michigan, has offered free groceries to members of the Coast Guard who have been impacted by the partial government shutdown. The partial government shutdown is now in its 13th day.What are the details? Bayside Market has created an account to make sure that members of the Coast Guard and their families don t go without groceries even if their pay is being held. According to WPBN-TV, all the service member has to do is shop, and show their identification card to receive the free groceries. Dan Summers, who is the food and beverage consultant at the store, said that it s only right that the store protects those service members as they would do the same.  We know they re not getting paychecks right now, but that s not gonna stop them from going out and helping me if I m swimming out there in the freezing waters and screw something up,  Summers explained.  They are there to help us, and we want to be there to help them, too.  Members of the Coast Guard will be able to shop until the fund is depleted. Once it is, service members will be eligible to receive a discount of 25 percent off their grocery orders. What else?WPBN reports that the Coast Guard s legal system forbids its members from accepting money or gift cards that exceed a certain amount. Debra Ankerson, who is an agent to the armed forces for the American Red Cross, told the station that community members can still help.   Buy them a gift card, take them groceries, offer to watch their children, give them diapers or formula,  Ankerson said.  Whatever it takes. That s what we are supposed to do.

         Give Trump the money  for the wall, Democrat says with Senate vote scheduled for this week
     I d give him the whole thing Some Congressional Democrats are coming around to the idea of funding a southern border wall as the partial government shutdown drags on, with Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) saying Tuesday that Democrats should vote to  Give Trump the money,  according to The Hill. I d give him the whole thing ... and put strings on it so you make sure he puts the wall where it needs to be,  Peterson told KFGO-TV.  Why are we fighting over this? We re going to build that wall anyway, at some time. Peterson expressed concerns about giving President Donald Trump a  blank check,  but said he didn t want to keep the money from him  if he s going to use the money correctly.  He also said Democrats  look at me cross-eyed  when he brings up the idea.Where are we now?There is some hope for an end to the shutdown this week, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has agreed to hold a vote on two competing funding bills.One bill represents Trump s  offer over the weekend to provide temporary legal protections to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status immigrants in exchange for $5.7 million in wall funding.The other bill is a backup plan, a three-week continuing resolution that would fund the government at current levels and reopen it while border security negotiations continue. For the first time, we will get a vote on whether to open the government without any decision one way or the other on border security,  said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).What s the outlook?It s possible that neither of the bills will pass. Many Democrats view wall funding as a non-starter, putting the passage of Trump s proposal in jeopardy. And a Senate-approved continuing resolution in December died after Trump said he wouldn t support a bill that didn t include wall funding. The votes could be a good indicator of which side has gained the most ground through this extended shutdown.

        Pelosi and Schumer are angry that Trump will have his speech televised   here s what they re demanding
    Now why would they be so upset about this?Democratic leaders are upset that President Donald Trump will receive television coverage for his speech about the government shutdown on Tuesday   and they re making some demands. In a statement released Monday after the president announced he would be giving a speech, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) demanded that Democrats be given the same consideration to present counterpoints.  Now that the television networks have decided to air the President s address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime,  they said in the joint statement. Pelosi tweeted the same statement from her social media account:Trump announced that he would speaking about the government shutdown and why there is such a need for a border wall to fend off illegal entry into the country. Pelosi and Schumer have absolutely rejected any insistence from the president and his allies that Congress approve of a budget with border wall funding.  I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border,  the president tweeted. A senior White House official indicated that the address would take about 7 to 8 minutes. Many on the left were outraged that the major television networks had agreed to give the president airtime.  There s no reason networks should air Trump s latest reality-TV spectacle,  tweeted former Clinton Secretary of Labor Robert Reich. It would just be another opportunity for him to spout lies to the American people, while distracting from the real issue: Trump s complete inability to govern,  Reich added.  Don t fall for it. Former Obama advisor Dan Pfeiffer also registered his anger on Twitter. As long as the legacy media cares more appearing balanced than accurately informing the public,  Pfeiffer said,  Trump and the rest of the Republicans who act in bad faith are going to have a structural political advantage.

        Breaking: House passes funding bill   with billions in border wall funding Dems refuse to pass
    Government is careening toward a shutdown The U.S. government edged closer to a shutdown after Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a funding bill that included billions for the border wall. Democrats made it clear that they would not accept a bill that funded the border wall that was promised by President Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. Republicans passed it anyway in a 217-185 vote   only eight Republicans voted against the bill. If the Senate passes the bill, which is unlikely, the border wall would receive $5 billion in funding. The deadline for a bill to pass before government shuts down is Friday at midnight. Outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said that he spoke with the president, who said that he would not sign a bill without border wall funding.  The president informed us that he will not sign the bill that came over from the Senate last evening because of his legitimate concerns for border security, so what we re gonna do is go back to the House and work with our members,  Ryan said.  We want to keep the government open but we also want to see an agreement that protects the border,  he added.  Everyone knows it can t pass the Senate Even before the bill passed, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said that the House s version would not pass the Senate.  The bill that s on the floor of the House, everyone knows, will not pass the Senate,  said Schumer.  Everyone knows it can t pass the Senate,  he added.  It s a cynical attempt to just hurt innocent people and do just what President Trump wants even though they probably know it s bad for the country. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Schumer have been stalwart in their opposition to funding the wall, which led to a contentious meeting between them and the president. Trump and the Democratic leaders openly squabbled about the wall before the president accepted responsibility for any government shutdown. The bill now goes to the U.S. Senate, where, despite the Republicans having a slim majority, it is likely that the bill will not pass and the government will head to a shutdown.

        Graham: More progress could be made in shutdown talks if Dems would send  somebody that s not crazy to deal with 
    Senator tells CBS   Face the Nation  the left is putting  radical  liberals at the negotiating table
	Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday that more progress could be made in reaching a deal to end the partial government shutdown if Democrats would send  somebody that s not crazy to deal with  to the negotiating table.
What are the details?
	Speaking on CBS   Face the Nation,  Graham told host Margaret Brennan that talks between Republicans and Democrats are at a standstill due to the left s reliance on radical liberals to do their bidding.

	 Dick Durbin s a reasonable guy, but he s not leading this parade,  Graham said, telling Brennan that Sen. Durbin (D-Ill.) is someone the GOP could work with. But insisted that  as long as the radical left is in charge, we re never going to get anywhere. 

	Brennan pointed out that Durbin has been a part of the negotiations, along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), pointing to a White House meeting held last week.

	 He s not in the room. Neither one of them are in the room. They sent staff people to do the negotiation. The vice president s in the room with a bunch of staffers,  Graham said, referring to talks Vice President Mike Pence held over the weekend.
	Graham went on to say that he believes President Donald Trump would be willing to make concessions as long as $5 billion for a border wall is included as part of the package.

	 I think we ll have offers on the table when we find somebody that s not crazy to deal with,  the senator added.  We re not going to put any offers on the table as long as people in charge of these negotiations accuse all of us who want a wall as being a racist, and see our border patrol agents as gassing children. Until you get that crowd put to the sidelines, I don t see anything happening. 
Why Durbin?Graham explained,  Every [border security] plan in the past that I ve supported with Dick Durbin has had money for physical barriers, including walls and fences   except now, when Trump s president. 

	Graham said that  the Democratic Party has supported $25 billion in the past.   We ll negotiate with Dick Durbin, but I m not going to negotiate with somebody who calls the border patrol agents a bunch of Nazis when they re trying to defend the border against a mob,  he said.

        FDA sharply reduces food inspections amid partial government shutdown
    Agency working to bring back inspectorsAll routine domestic food facility inspections are being suspended as hundreds of Food and Drug Administration workers are furloughed under the partial government shutdown, according to the Washington Post. What is the impact?FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is creating a plan to bring back workers so they can resume inspections of facilities that are considered  high-risk,  including those that process foods such as seafood and vegetables, the Post reported. The FDA oversees about 80 percent of the nation s food supply and normally conducts about 160 routine inspections a month, according to the report. The agency gets about 40 percent of its funding from Congress and 60 percent from user fees. We are doing what we can to mitigate any risk to consumers through the shutdown,  Gottlieb said.Inspections typically center on cleanliness, contaminants and pest infestations. The agency is still inspecting recalls and outbreaks related to foreign manufacturers and producers, The Hill reported. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit advocacy group, told the Post that it believes the nation s food supply is at risk.  That puts our food supply at risk,  Sarah Sorscher, deputy director of regulatory affairs at the group, told the Post.  Regular inspections, which help stop foodborne illness before people get sick, are vital. Foodborne illnesses kill 3,000 people and sicken about 48 million people every year, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Other impacts caused by the shutdown include the expiration of some affordable housing contracts, a lawsuit by federal workers and Transportation Security Administration workers quitting or calling in sick because they are not being paid, the Hill reported.In addition the FDA, funding resources are being restricted for the FBI, Coast Guard, Secret Service, Federal Aviation Administration. What is the background? The partial government shutdown is its 20th day, as Democrats continue to oppose President Donald Trump s demands for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump says the wall is needed to increase security and curb illegal immigration. But Democrats believe the president is making a political move to drum up more support for his base. Democrats have said they would approve $1.3 billion for border security that employs technology such as drones to monitor the border. But they remain opposed to a wall.

    Pelosi s CODEL wasn t the only casualtyThe White House announced Friday that there would be no U.S. delegation attending this year s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.What is the World Economic Forum?The World Economic Forum is group that seeks to engage  the foremost political, business and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas.  It meets annually in Davos, Switzerland. This year s theme will be  Globalization 4.0: Shaping a Global Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Last year s forum, which President Donald Trump personally attended, hosted roughly 3,000 business, political, and civil leaders over four days.What did the White House say?Trump had already announced a week ago that he would not be attending the forum this year. While Trump attended last year, former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama never went. Trump cited Democrats   intransigence on Border Security and the great importance of Safety for our Nation  as the reason behind his decision to not personally make the trip.The government has been partially shut down now for 28 days. Trump has refused to sign any deal to fund the government that does not include $5.7 billion for a border wall, a demand to which Congress has been unwilling meet.On Tuesday, the White House announced that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would lead a delegation to Davos that would have included Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for policy coordination Chris Liddell.However, on Friday, the White House announced that this delegation would also not be going to Davos this year. In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said:This move comes a day after Trump postponed Rep. Nancy Pelosi s (D-Calif.) use of a military plane for a Congressional delegation trip to Afghanistan. Pelosi s office said that she had planned to go on the trip anyway, taking a commercial flight instead, but ended up having to cancel due to security concerns after her intended destination had been announced by the White House.

        While blaming Trump for government shutdown, Nancy Pelosi vacations at luxurious Hawaiian resort
    Meanwhile, Trump stayed in D.C. to work
	While refusing to work with President Donald Trump to find a compromise on border security, which resulted in the government shutdown, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is vacationing at a luxurious Hawaiian resort,  a tradition for the wealthy Pelosi.What are the details?
	Despite placing blame for the government shutdown solely on Trump and Republicans, Pelosi   who will likely succeed Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) as Speaker of the House   was spotted at the Fairmont Orchid resort this week, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

	Accommodations at the luxurious resort range from $899-per-night for standard rooms to $4,899-per-night for the presidential suite.

	More from the Free Beacon:
Fox News further confirmed that Pelosi was seen at the resort on Friday. Shockingly, Pelosi s office did not return multiple requests for comment.Why does this matter?Pelosi s vacation comes as she continues to blame Trump for the government shutdown. In an interview with USA Today before Christmas, Pelosi accused Trump of using  scare tactics  to build support for the border wall. She also claimed Trump is  being a fear monger. Additionally, Pelosi s office has continued to release statements pinning blame for the shutdown on Trump s shoulders. Democrats have offered Republicans three options to re-open government that all include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security ñ but not the President s immoral, ineffective and expensive wall. With the House Majority, Democrats will act swiftly to end the Trump Shutdown, and will fight for a strategic, robust national security policy, including strong and smart border security, and strong support for our servicemembers and veterans,  Drew Hammill, Pelosi s deputy chief of staff, said Friday, according to Fox News.Meanwhile, Trump cancelled plans to spend Christmas and the New Year with his family at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Instead, Trump has been working to end the shutdown, though he maintains he will not sign a spending bill that excludes funding for a border wall.

        Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has government shutdown proposal that may win your support
    An idea most Americans can rally behind
	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the democratic socialist who will officially be a member of Congress next month, advocates for socialist policies like universal health care, universal education, and a universal income. Her entire policy agenda has a price tag of more than $40 trillion, alienating a majority of Americans from supporting her.
	But on Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez suggested a government shutdown policy that may earn the support of a majority of Americans.
What did Ocasio-Cortez suggest?
	During the next government shutdown, Ocasio-Cortez called for congressional salaries to be furloughed. Currently, congressional pay is exempt from being furloughed during a government shutdown.

	 It s completely unacceptable that members of Congress can force a government shutdown on partisan lines & then have Congressional salaries exempt from that decision,  Ocasio-Cortez said.  Have some integrity. 
The suggestion came just hours after the government entered a partial shutdown. Roughly one quarter of government agencies closed after lawmakers failed to approve a spending bill by midnight Saturday. Lawmakers will not be in full session again until after Christmas, meaning the shutdown will last through at least next Thursday.Why don t government shutdowns affect every government employee?Government shutdowns typically only effect employees who work for agencies with a budget required to be funded annually through appropriations bills. Employees who are considered  essential  continue to be paid, while those considered  nonessential  are told to stop showing up to work   and aren t paid for the shutdown period.Fortunately, Congress typically acts to give  nonessential  employees back pay once the government re-opens.Most members of Congress make $174,000 annually, along with excellent benefits. Their compensation is written into law, and therefore would need another law to amend their compensation package.Still, many members of Congress   either sympathetically or because they realize the optics of the situation   voluntarily forego pay during government shutdown periods, while others donate their pay to charity.

        President Trump personally secures Coast Guard payroll funding amid government shutdown
    The Coast Guard is part of Homeland SecurityPresident Donald Trump asked his top staff members and attorneys this week to find a way to meet the U.S. Coast Guard s $75 million payroll despite the partial government shutdown. Trump is concerned that Coast Guard forces would lose a paycheck, the Washington Examiner reported. Why is this happening?The Coast Guard is part of the shutdown that is impacting about 25 percent of the government. That includes the Department of Homeland Security, which the Coast Guard is under. Military personnel under the Department of Defense are not impacted because their funding was previously approved by Congress.Trump reportedly noticed media reports about how the shutdown is causing hardships for Coast Guardsmen. Members of the president s team said his is adamant about finding a way to  fix this,  according to the report. The Office of Management and Budget, DHS, and Coast Guard officials have determined that the Coast Guard must be paid through the end of the year. To meet the payroll, attorneys determined that  unused funding  could be used. The agency reportedly has just a  little over the $75 million needed to make  this month s last payroll check,  according to the Washington Examiner. The Trump administration also was able to pay furloughed federal employees for the time they worked prior to the shutdown, which began Dec. 22. In an email to Coast Guard forces, Vice Commandant Adm. Charles Ray called it  outstanding news for our military workforce. The Coast Guard s All Hands blog explains that at this time, only the Dec. 31 paycheck is covered.The blog states: What happens next?  Meeting active duty and reserve military payroll for January 2019 will require a fiscal year 2019 appropriation, a continuing resolution, or passage of an alternative measure,  the blog states.

        Trump says lawmakers are  wasting their time  if border security talks don t include a wall or barrier
    Congress has just over two weeks to try to avoid another shutdownPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday that any congressional negotiations on border security were a waste of time if they didn t include a  wall or physical barrier.  Lawmakers are trying to hash out a deal that would avert another partial government shutdown when the government again runs out of funding Feb. 15.What are the details?In a tweet, Trump wrote,  If the committee of Republicans and Democrats now meeting on Border Security is not discussing or contemplating a Wall of Physical Barrer, they are Wasting their time! On Dec. 22, the U.S. federal government ran out of funding and went into a partial shutdown that lasted for 35 days. Roughly 800,000 federal workers went without pay during that time.Trump has repeatedly said he will not sign any bill to fund the federal government that does not include $5.7 billion in funding for a wall on the border between the U.S and Mexico. Democrats in Congress have so far been unwilling to agree to any bill that contains funding for a border wall. On Monday, 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said she would not vote in favor of any bill that included funding for a border wall  under any circumstances. On Jan. 25, Trump announced a bill that reopened the government for three weeks. If Congress does not come to an agreement by then, the government will go back into a partial shutdown. As part of these negotiations to come up with a new bill to fund the government, 17 Democrats and Republicans from both the House of Representatives and the Senate have met to try to come up with some sort of border security deal that could pass Congress and still be acceptable to Trump.

         God help us!    Jeffrey Toobin says Ann Coulter is to blame for looming government shutdown
    He calls her the real presidentCNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin blamed Ann Coulter and other right-wing commentators for pushing President Donald Trump to force a government shutdown over funding for the border wall. Toobin was speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN as the debate over the border wall was pushing Congress towards a government shutdown on midnight Friday. Republicans are complaining, Jeffrey, that they can t figure out exactly where the president stands,  Blitzer explained,  they meet with him, they hear what he s saying, but he s not telling them  I m gonna sign this but I m not gonna sign that   Well what they should be doing, obviously, is checking with Ann Coulter,  Toobin responded,  because apparently she s the president of the United States as far as this is concerned.  I mean, this was a deal,  Toobin continued,  this deal was agreed to, [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who is nobody s idea of a flaming liberal, [House Speaker] Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), everybody thought this deal was done.   And you know what?  he added.  The president lost on the wall because he didn t have the votes. But then you know, Laura Ingraham and Ann Coulter started challenging the president s manhood and the House Republicans started stamping their feet, and the president decided  no no no, I m gonna scream and yell and shut down the government even though I still don t have the votes!    So, I mean I guess Ann Coulter has to figure out how this is all gonna end,  Toobin exclaimed,  because she s the person that is driving the federal government at this point!  God help us!  he concluded. Coulter has been criticizing the president with a running update on her Twitter account on the number of miles of the border wall that have been built.  Miles completed yesterday--Zero,  she tweeted.  Miles completed since Inauguration--Zero. Here s the video of Toobin blaming Coulter for the shutdown:

        Report: Standard & Poor s claims gov t shutdown will cost more than border wall
    Estimates cost to U.S. economy at $6 billionThe impact of the partial government shutdown  on the U.S. economy adds up to at least $6 billion, more than the price tag for President Donald Trump s proposed border wall, according to information reported from financial rating agency Standard & Poor s.Is this worse than initial estimates? The rating agency said Friday the impact  likely worse than what we had previously expected,  according to ABC News.S&P previously estimated the impact at about $1.2 billion of real Gross Domestic Product for each week of the political impasse over the border wall along the Mexico border. But as the shutdown continued, that amount began to increase.  Although this shutdown has ended, little agreement on Capitol Hill will likely weigh on business confidence and financial market sentiments,  S&P said in a statement obtained by ABC News.  Here, both direct costs, on lost productivity from furloughed government workers, and indirect costs, from lost economic activity to outside businesses because of the shutdown, amplified with each week the government remained closed,  the statement read.On  Friday, Trump signed a bill to reopen the government for three weeks as Congress and the president continue negotiations. The 35-day partial shutdown or the proposed wall along the Mexico border was the longest in history. We had expected that other indirect costs were likely just delayed, with businesses recouping some of those losses once the government reopens its doors. But, with a five-week closure, we suspect that more of those economic activities indirectly tied to the government may have been outright canceled,  Standard & Poor s stated.According to USA Today, costs associated with the shutdown include lost productivity from furloughed workers, uncollected tax revenue from lost business, back taxes that weren t collected, uncollected fees from National Parks that were closed, interest due on late federal payments, agency costs for conducting the shutdown and startup, and delays in companies filing initial public offerings.What s next?Standard & Poor s also expressed caution regarding whether the shutdown is truly over. Federal workers have told media they are also concerned about the possibility of having to live through another partial shutdown.  Government workers who were furloughed under the partial shutdown have been promised they will receive all back pay.  Although this funding battle has ended, the next one starts in a few weeks, which may reduce growth expectations if businesses and financial markets begin to expect that Congress and the president will repeat the experience again and again,  the statement from Standard & Poor s read.

        Trump says he will be making a major announcement about the shutdown
    Some think he will declare a national emergencyPresident Donald Trump tweeted Friday that he would be making a major announcement about the government shutdown and the border wall. I will be making a major announcement concerning the Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border, and the Shutdown, tomorrow afternoon at 3 P.M., live from the @WhiteHouse.Some suspect that the president will be announcing a national emergency at the border, something that he has suggested doing in order to circumvent objections from the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. The partial shutdown of the government is close to the one month mark, and is the longest in history. Many federal workers who are now missing paychecks have taken to social media to complain about their hardships. In response, some companies have offered free meals, loans, and other benefits to help workers bridge the gap until the shutdown ends. The disagreement between the president the Democrats lies in whether the budget will contain funding for the border wall that Trump has promised since before he was elected. Trump has claimed that it is perfectly within his powers to declare a national emergency on the border and have the military build the border wall. Many of his critics have said this is an abuse of the power. Democrats have made their case with a video of Trump when he made a statement before reporters with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). In that meeting, he openly said that he would take the blame for any government shutdown and that he would not blame Schumer for it.  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,  Trump said.  Because the people of this country don t want criminals and people that have lots of problems, and drugs that are pouring into this country.  So, I will take the mantle,  he added.  I will be the one to shut it down, I won t blame you for it. Later, he said that the Democrats were fully to blame for the shutdown.  The Democrats now own the shutdown!  he tweeted emphatically.

     Pleased to inform you ...  
	President Donald Trump is poised to address the nation on Tuesday night   
	on prime-time networks, and directly from the Oval Office.

	Trump made the announcement Monday via Twitter.
What did he say? 
	On the 17th day of the partial government shutdown, Trump wrote,  I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border. Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. Eastern. 

	This particular public address would mark the president s first address from the oval office since taking office.

	It is unclear which networks will be airing the president s address. The New York Times confirmed that  [t]he four major broadcast networks   ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC    received the White House s request for the president to speak during the aforementioned slot.  [P]roducers had not decided whether to grant him the time,  the Times added. The president has vowed that he will not end the partial government shutdown until Democrats promise to fund a border wall at the U.S-Mexico border.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has refused to bend on giving the president any money to fund a border wall. The president s prime-time address comes on the heels of threatening to declare a state of national emergency within the U.S. in order to get the border wall   one of his campaign promises   built. Anything else? 
	Trump also reportedly plans to visit the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday to address the crisis there.

	On Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted,  President @realDonaldTrump will travel to the Southern border on Thursday to meet with those on the frontlines of the national security and humanitarian crisis. More details will be announced soon.

    Sinema is reportedly the only member of Congress who is  religiously unaffiliated 
	Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.)   the country s first openly bisexual senator   took her oath of office on Thursday by placing her hand on a copy of the U.S. Constitution, and not the Bible.
What are the details?Vice President Mike Pence, who swore Sinema in as a U.S. senator, ended his part of the ceremony with   ... so help you God? 

	Sinema responded,  I do. 

	A spokesperson for Sinema told the Arizona Republic that the newly minted senator, who previously served as a U.S. representative, is  always sworn in on Constitution. 

	 Kyrsten always gets sworn in on a Constitution simply because of her love for the Constitution,  the spokesperson said.

	The spokesperson added that the book was from the Library of Congress and contained texts of the United States and Arizona state constitutions.

	A recent release from the Pew Research Center reported Sinema is the one member of Congress who is  religiously unaffiliated. 
	At just over 88 percent, the overwhelming majority of those serving in the U.S. Congress identify as Christians.
What else?Hemant Mehta at the Friendly Athiest lauded Sinema s decision to be sworn in on the U.S. Constitution.
 To be sure, Sinema isn t an open atheist, and there were a lot of books other than the Bible this year for newly elected members of Congress,  Mehta wrote.
	 But it s still nice to see a government official show people that her allegiance is to our country and our laws, not a holy book or the Ten Commandments,  Mehta added.  Sinema did the same thing in 2013 when she was first sworn into Congress.

     Can we have a serious discussion about border security now? That d be great. Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) asked Monday to have his congressional salary withheld during the partial government shutdown. When one of his Democratic colleagues criticized the gesture, he used her own words to point out the hypocrisy of her position.Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) called Crenshaw out on Twitter: We aren t paid until Feb 1st, so no pay to withhold now,  Omar wrote.  Vote to reopen the government like we did & give hardworking Fed employees their paychecks. That s caring! Stop this virtue signaling Congressman, the American people need this to end now, not Feb. 1st. Crenshaw responded by redirecting Omar s message toward her fellow Democrats who had also asked for their pay to be withheld. To my Democrat colleagues who are also (rightfully) withholding your pay during the shutdown your colleague @IlhanMN would prefer you stop virtue signaling and end the shutdown,  Crenshaw wrote.  Can we have a serious discussion about border security now? That d be great. Although House Democrats have been passing legislation that would reopen the government, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has refused to take a vote on because they don t include border wall funding, Democrats are apparently unwilling to even come to the negotiating table at this point.President Donald Trump extended an invitation to congressional Democrats for a lunch meeting Tuesday to discuss border security   and no one accepted. Today, the President offered both Democrats and Republicans the chance to meet for lunch at the White House,  press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.  Unfortunately, no Democrats will attend. The President looks forward to having a working lunch with House Republicans to solve the border crisis and reopen the government.

Congressman, do you think it s appropriate to fly first class while 57 TSA agents aren t being paid?  the person asked Davis on the Chicago-to-Washington, D.C., flight, apparently regarding the Transportation Security Administration s 57,000 employees required to work without pay, the Huffington Post said.

The Post said a tipster shared the clip with the outlet and asked to remain anonymous; the Post added that it hasn t been able to identify the person who confronted Davis. Flights for members of Congress to and from their home jurisdictions aren t affected by the partial government shutdown, the outlet said.And now the rest of the storyDavis  office bought him a coach ticket for the flight in question, but he was automatically upgraded because of his frequent flyer status, Davis spokeswoman Ashley Phelps told the Post in an email.

Davis actually was among a handful of  GOP defectors  who voted yes on  piecemeal bills to reopen parts of the federal government  earlier this month, a Chicago Sun-Times columnist wrote, adding that the decision was  a move to help inoculate themselves against Democrats coming after them in 2020.

    Are we heading towards a compromise, and how will America receive it?President Donald Trump signaled Thursday that he was willing to make a concession to Democrats on funding for his border wall in order to strike a deal and reopen the government. The government has been in a partial shutdown for 34 days, and is affecting about 800,000 federal employees directly. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders indicated that the president was willing to accept less than the $5.7 billion for border wall funding in a continuing resolution deal, as long as it contained a  down payment  for the wall. Trump then addressed reporters on negotiations between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to reopen the government on a continuing budget resolution.  Well one of the ideas suggested is they open it,  Trump said, apparently referring to the government,  they pay a sort of a prorated down payment for the wall, which I think, people will agree, that you need.   In fact I see a lot of the Democrats,  he explained,  almost all of them are breaking and saying,  look, walls are good, walls are good.  Big different from what you had two or three weeks ago.  The president also referred to other alternatives to seeking funding from Congress for his wall.  Look, I have other alternatives if I have to,  the president said.  And I ll use those alternatives if I have to. We want to go through the system. We have to have a wall in this country.  Now Mitch is negotiating with Chuck Schumer and we ll see what happens,  he added. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters that she didn t understand what Trump was referring to with a  prorated  down payment for the border wall.

	President Donald Trump dismissed a proposal from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to temporarily reopen the government without having a deal in place to fund a border wall.
Why is the government shut down?
	After failing to reach a budget deal, the U.S. government partially shut down on Dec. 22. President Donald Trump has declared that he won t sign any spending bill that does not include funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, but so far Congress has refused to comply. Trump has said that he is  absolutely  prepared to keep the government shut down for  
	months or even years  if Congress does not fund his border wall.

	On Monday, the shutdown entered its 24th day. This is now the longest shutdown in U.S. history, breaking the previous record held by a 21-day shutdown during the Clinton administration.
What did Graham propose?
	In an interview on 
	 Fox News Sunday,  Graham said:

	During the interview, Graham also said that he had tried unsuccessfully to float a plan for border security in return for promises for Dreamers and immigrants with Temporary Protected Status. He also said he supports Trump declaring a national emergency to build the wall, if the president decides that this is his best course of action.

	Democratic lawmakers have 
	also tried, unsuccessfully, to pass legislation that would reopen the federal government while negotiations continue.
What did Trump say?
	Speaking to reporters Monday at the White House before he flew to New Orleans, Trump rejected the idea that he would reopen the government without a budget deal in place.

	 I m not interested,  he said.  I want to get it solved. I don t want to just delay it. I want to get it solved.

        Tax refunds to be paid during shutdown, Trump administration announces
    The decision is a reversal of a longstanding policyGood news for tax return filers who are expecting a 2018 refund: The White House Office of Management and Budget announced Monday that it would be making tax refund payments even if the government shutdown continues. Acting OMB Director Russell Vought told reporters that the administration is attempting to make the shutdown as  painless as possible consistent with the law.  The Trump administration reversed a long-standing policy which would have prohibited the IRS to issue refunds during the partial shutdown that began Dec. 22, the Wall Street Journal reported. The IRS is among the many agencies affected the decision to close the government while Congress tries to work out a deal on the border wall.Was there a law that would have prevented refund payments?Prior to Vought s announcement, TheBlaze reported on Friday that the administration and its predecessors had stated that refunds could not be made during the closure. The IRS, according to a 2017 law, doesn t typically conduct audits, issue refunds, or otherwise work with taxpayers outside of the standard filing season, which would include a government shutdown.Tax season begins Jan.29, according to the IRS website. The deadline to file is April 17, which means taxpayers will have an additional two days to file this year.

        Colossal TSA failure allowed firearm onboard plane departing Atlanta. Is the shutdown to blame?
    On a flight headed for TokyoA passenger managed to smuggle a firearm aboard a plane leaving Atlanta s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Jan. 3, the Transportation Security Administration announced over the weekend, leading many to wonder if the government shutdown is to blame for the security breech. TSA agents, who police security checkpoints at every passenger airport in the U.S., are required to work during the shutdown but are not being paid for their work. The predicament has led to an increasing number of agents missing work over the last three weeks.What are the details? TSA has determined standard procedures were not followed and a passenger did in fact pass through a standard screening TSA checkpoint with a firearm at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on the morning of January 3,  the TSA said in a statement, according to CNN.Delta Air Lines said the passenger boarded a flight headed for Narita International Airport in Tokyo. Sometime during the flight, the passenger disclosed he was carrying the firearm, and the airline immediately informed the TSA. The passenger was cooperative and  was met by Japanese authorities upon landing,  the Washington Post reported.TSA said agency officials have  held those responsible [for the security breach] appropriately accountable. Is the shutdown to blame?TSA dismissed the suggestion the government shutdown, which is now the longest in U.S. history, is to blame for the security lapse. The perception that this might have occurred as a result of the partial government shutdown would be false,  TSA said.  The national unscheduled absence rate of TSA staff on Thursday, January 3, 2019, was 4.8% compared to 6.3% last year, Thursday, January 4, 2018. So in fact, the national call out rate was higher a year ago than this year on that date. TSA did not, however, provide statistics specific to Hartsfield-Jackson Airport   the busiest airport in the world   or for the security checkpoint responsible for the security failure.Meanwhile, TSA Assistant Administrator Michael Bilello said on Twitter Sunday that  security standards remain uncompromised at our nation s airports.

        Report: Rod Rosenstein   who currently oversees Mueller probe   plans to leave DOJ after William Barr gets confirmed
    Very interesting
	Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein   who is overseeing the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller   is reportedly planning to leave the Justice Department once a new attorney general is confirmed, which could come within a matter of weeks.
What are the details? 
	On Wednesday, ABC News and CNN reported that Rosenstein told President Donald Trump that he intends to leave the department after attorney general nominee William Barr is confirmed.

	Barr s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee is set to begin Jan. 15, and The Washington Post reported that Rosenstein does not have a definitive timeline for departure.

	Rosenstein took charge of overseeing Mueller s Russia probe after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation.

	Rosenstein also reportedly once discussed secretly monitoring the president without his knowledge, but a source familiar with the situation said that Rosenstein was being sarcastic when he made the purported remarks.
	If confirmed, Barr would replace appointed acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and would assume oversight of the Mueller investigation.

	ABC News also reported that there is no indication that Trump is attempting to force out Rosenstein, despite their rocky past. Also, Rosenstein told senators during his 2017 confirmation hearing that he would not remain in his post if he believed that he was being pressured to influence any investigations.What else? On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued remarks about the reports of Rosenstein s purported departure.

	 I know the deputy attorney general has always planned to roughly stay around two years,  Sanders told  Fox & Friends  co-hosts.  My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team that he wants around him.
	 I haven t spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I ll leave any announcements for him or the president to make when they want to do that, but certainly I don t think there s any willingness by the President or the White House to push him out,  she noted.

        TSA announces $500 bonus for workers during shutdown
    Compensation for those who worked Dec. 22 also expected to show up in bank accounts this weekTSA Administrator David Pekoske announced this weekend that each uniformed screening officer who worked over the holidays will receive a one-time $500 bonus this week.  I have approved awards of $500 for each uniformed screening officer, in recognition of their hard work during yet another busy holiday travel season, maintaining the highest of security standards during an extraordinary period,  Pekoske tweeted Friday. And he said that those who worked Dec. 22 would also receive one day of pay by Tuesday.  As I announced earlier today, we have processed compensation to all TSA employees who worked on Saturday, December 22nd, the day immediately following the start of the lapse in funding,  he tweeted. This is considered one  missing day  of pay, so this payment will make our employees whole for Pay Period 25. You ll receive that by no later than Tuesday.Pekoske said he was able to approve the payments as the longest partial government shutdown in history continues  because of unique authorities provided TSA in law.  While I realize this is not what you are owed for your hard work during pay period 26 and what you deserve, I hope these actions alleviate some of the financial hardship many of you are facing,  he continued.How many federal workers are affected?About 800,000 total federal workers have been furloughed or worked without pay during the standoff between Republicans and Democrats over funding the Trump administration s border wall. There are about 51,000 TSA officers, who are considered  essential  workers and are required to report to work without pay. How has the shutdown affected airport screenings?At some airports across the country, the number of TSA officers calling in sick has been on the rise as the shutdown continues. This morning, TSA experienced a national rate of 7.7 percent unscheduled absences compared to a 3.2 percent rate one year ago, Sunday, January 14, 2018. Most importantly, security standards remain uncompromised at our nation s airports,  Michael Bilello, TSA assistant administrator for public affairs, tweeted Sunday.

     Where s Mitch is my question Newly-elected Democrat members of the House of Representatives had a plan to confront Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in person to pressure him to end the government shutdown, according to The Hill.The problem was, they didn t know where to find his office.Here s how their journey went: They walked over to the Russell Senate Office building to deliver the letter to McConnell. But, he doesn t work from that office.Undeterred, they set their sights on McConnell s Capitol office. When they arrived, they...delivered the letter to McConnell s deputy chief of staff, Don Stewart, who dutifully agreed to deliver the letter  as I do with every single letter that comes into this office. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seemed to believe McConnell was avoiding them. Where s Mitch is my quesion,  Ocasio-Cortez said. He seems to be running away from us. As a last resort to salvage the grand political gesture, the group then decided to deliver copies of the letter to the Senate Republican cloakroom and to McConnell s Russell office. Unfortunately, they didn t bring enough copies.Not to worry, however, as Stewart allowed the Democrats to use the copy machine in McConnell s office.The group then sat at the back of the Senate chamber, soon leaving once they realized nothing was taking place on the Senate floor at the time.(H/T Hot Air)

        Let them eat ... steak? Unpaid guards serve federal prisoners lavish holiday meals during shutdown as prisoners mock guards
    Roast beef, surf and turf, Cornish hens ... you name it
	Federal inmates are chowing down on steaks while their prison guards are working on an unpaid basis due to the partial government shutdown.
The shutdown is in its 17th day at the time of this article. Really?Yes. According to a Monday report in The Washington Post, inmates at dozens of federal prisons across the U.S. ate steak and feasted on holiday pies on Christmas and New Year s Day.  Several workers who spoke to the outlet voiced their frustrations that the prisoners received the treat of steak while many unpaid prison guards were scrambling to figure out how to feed their own families. Joe Rojas, who is president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told NBC News that he was disgusted by the irony.  [The prisoners] are getting a lavish meal and we are working the holidays away from our families, wondering if we can pay the rent or make it home,  Rojas said. He noted that some inmates even went as far as to mock guards over the meals.  They re using federal workers in a game of chicken. Who s going to blink first? We re a pawn,  Rojas told the Post.  I didn t sign up for this. I signed up for this job to protect society and to have a good government job so when I retire I can have a pension, not to be used in a game of chicken. Rojas added that it s not as if the prisoners at these facilities are serving time for white-collar crimes.  These inmates are not here for singing too loud at a church,  Rojas said.  These are dangerous felons. We re working with killers. We re working with terrorists. All these guys do is think and hatch plans and figure out how to get weapons. It s like a Molotov cocktail waiting to explode. According to NBC News, inmates at a federal prison in Illinois ate surf and turf, while prisoners at a Brooklyn federal prison ate Cornish hen and Boston cream pie over the holidays. Sandy Parr, a food service foreman at Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota, said,  You re giving a gift to somebody who committed a crime, but yet you won t pay the people who are supervising them? It s frustrating and maddening. June Bencebi, who is a case manager at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, said that she worked both holidays   without pay   while inmates queued up multiple times for second servings.  A lot of the staff were upset over the fact that we don t know where our next meal is going to come, and these inmates were served so much food they were able to get on the serving line twice,  Bencebi said.Has the Bureau of Prisons said anything about this outcry?In a statement, the Bureau of Prisons said that such special meals are  planned weeks in advance, including as happened here in advance of the government shutdown.   The dinners are presented in order to  promote morale for the inmate population because they are separated from their families.   On Christmas, a facility may serve a special meat choice such as Cornish hen or a special dessert,  the statement added.

        Small family business offers jobs to federal workers who aren t being paid during shutdown
    A Pennsylvania T-shirt company is doing its part to help furloughed workers earn money to pay their billsA small family business in Pennsylvania is doing its part to help local federal workers who ve been furloughed during the partial government shutdown, KDKA-TV reported.The 123shirt.com in Robinson Township placed an ad on Craig s List that offered jobs to federal employees who want to earn money to help make ends meet. The job pays $18 an hour. You just listen to all the news coverage, and you [know] somebody s got to do something,  shop owner Larry Barasch told KDKA.  So this is what we decided to do. So far, four Transportation Security Administration workers have taken him up on the offer.  We said anyone with a valid U.S. government I.D.   come and work,  he said. What is the job?Those who go to work for the shirt company are helping print T-shirts that read,  Stronger Than Hate.   We re not giving them hard tasks. We re just saying just help,  Barasch told the news station. They re desperate,  he added.  When you re living week-to-week, day-to-day, you still have a mortgage, you still have to pay for food, you still have to pay for utilities,  Barasch said.  I mean what are you supposed to do? Live off a credit card? But helping those who aren t receiving a paycheck isn t the only good deed being delivered.The money raised from the T-shirts goes to the Tree of Life Synagogue Victim s Fund, which has special meaning for Barasch s family. Eleven people were murdered at the synagogue when a gunman opened fire there in October. My uncle Judah Samet was the Holocaust survivor who missed the shooting by four minutes,  Barasch said. What else?Last month, Barasch presented an $18,000 check to the Tree of Life Victim s Fund.

        Commentary: There s a simple solution to the government shutdown. Privatize it!
    Almost everything the government currently does could be done better by the private sectorThe panic that ensued on social media after the government began its partial shutdown in December proves once again that the federal government s power over Americans reaches too far. The partial shutdown is now the longest in American history.With Americans growing increasingly dependent on the federal government for their basic needs, it s time for Americans to take a step back and realize just how much power they have relinquished. The solution? Increased privatization.After the House of Representatives voted to end the partial government shutdown without funding for the border wall, GOP representatives were slammed online for voting to continue the shutdown.The pushback can seem understandable at first, since Americans rely on federal agencies daily   and largely without even realizing it. The Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Labor, and Transit are just a small list of the federal agencies impacted by the government shutdown.Operations for these agencies have been curtailed or even ceased during the partial government shutdown. The Washington Post even estimates that 800,000 out of 2.1 million federal employees are on  unpaid status  since the shutdown began last month. Of those, 380,000 have been furloughed.Newly elected Congressman Ben Cline, who represents Virginia s 6th District, faced heavy criticism from his constituents for voting to continue the shutdown. Many federal workers are your constituents, including many who voted for you. How are you serving them by voting to keep them unpaid and out of work?  one of them wrote.Another called on Cline to distance himself from President Donald Trump and follow a different path than his predecessor, Rep. Bob Goodlatte. Work to open the government, don t be Trump s handmaiden like Goodlatte,  the commenter said.Rep. Denver Riggleman, who was elected to represent Virginia s 5th District in 2018, faced similar criticisms.The angry commenters are everywhere, from Facebook posts to replies and hashtags blaming President Trump for the shutdown. However, the commenters fail to see that the partial government shutdown should be a red stop sign to the American people.Placing the employment of millions of Americans at the whims of an ever-partisan government gives the institution more power than the founders ever intended for it to have. Furthermore, with 2.1 million people employed by the federal government, it begs the question as to why the federal government employs so many people in the first place.The solution to the shutdown crisis? Privatize the federal agencies. Many of the functions currently being performed by furloughed employees could feasibly be done by the private sector.For example, the TSA s functions were performed by the private sector prior to 9/11.Twenty-two airports in the nation have privatized security   those workers are still getting paid.Studies also show that private security agents are better at detecting weapons in travel bags than the TSA.In a 2010 article for Reason Magazine, American TV personality John Stossel argued that free enterprise provides more for the American people than the federal government ever will. Stossel then gave examples of several times when the private sector served the American people better than the government. [F]or years there was a gap in the ring road surrounding Paris that created huge traffic problems. Then private developers made an unsolicited proposal to build a $2 billion toll tunnel in exchange for a 70-year lease to run it. They built a double-decker tunnel that fits six lanes of traffic in the space usually required for just two. The tunnel s profit-seeking owners have an incentive to keep traffic moving. They collect tolls based on congestion pricing, and tolls are collected electronically, so cars don t have to stop. The tunnel operators clear accidents quickly. Most are detected within 10 seconds   thanks to 350 cameras inside the tunnel. The private road has cut a 45-minute trip to 10 minutes. He further bet the readers of his book,  Myths, Lies and Downright Stupidity,  that they could not name ONE thing that government does better than the private sector.He has yet to pay. Stossel also believes that the Food and Drug Administration should be privatized, arguing that food is  safe  because of competition in the market   not government regulations. He points to Chipotle. After Chipotle s stock fell by more than half after several food poisoning incidents, the restaurant chain implemented food safety methods, including food inspection, than the federal government requires.The partial government shutdown should show Americans that the vast majority of federal agencies should be privatized. When millions of Americans rely on the federal government for employment, food safety, transportation, and environmental protection, the government s failure to efficiently function damages operations that it should have no control over in the first place.

        Nancy Pelosi hits Trump with a bizarre conspiracy theory after ending the government shutdown
    This is just getting weird nowHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) didn t back down from her attacks on President Donald Trump after they agreed to end the partial government shutdown, instead she hit him with a bizarre conspiracy theory. The Democratic leader made the accusations from her social media account on Friday.  Roger Stone s indictment makes clear there was a deliberate, coordinated effort by top Trump campaign officials to subvert the will of the American people during the 2016 Election,  she tweeted. Pelosi was referring to the indictment and arrest Friday morning of one of the president s oldest friends and former campaign aides, Roger Stone. He was arrested at his home and charged with lying to Congress about being an intermediary between WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the Trump campaign. Pelosi then asked if Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin was extorting President Trump.  What does Putin have on @realDonaldTrump, politically, personally or financially?  she asked rhetorically. She then implied that the president was attempting to weaken NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in order to help Putin s foreign policy schemes. The speculation that Trump is doing the bidding of Putin because of some compromising information held against him has been made by many of the most virulent of the president s critics. Trump has denied all allegations of this sort. Pelosi added in a statement,  Lying to Congress and witness tampering constitute grave crimes.   All who commit these illegal acts should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,  she said.  We cannot allow any effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from appearing before Congress. Here s the latest on the arrest of Roger Stone:

        Pelosi sends letter to President Trump asking him to delay State of the Union because of shutdown
    She said another option could be delivering the address in writing instead of in personSpeaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (R-Calif.) asked President Donald Trump on Wednesday to delay his State of the Union address or submit it in writing instead.Here s what we knowIn a letter to Trump, Pelosi noted that the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security were no longer being funded during the shutdown,  with critical departments hamstrung by furloughs.  She continued:Pelosi noted that while the Constitution requires that the president   from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union,  it does not require him to actually make the speech in person to Congress. While some presidents, including Washington, had given this address in person sporadically, it was Woodrow Wilson who started the modern tradition of addressing Congress in person in 1913. During the 19th Century and up until the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, these annual State of the Union messages were delivered to Congress in writing,  she wrote.  And since the start of modern budgeting in Fiscal Year 1977, a State of the Union address has never been delivered during a government shutdown. What else? The president is not a member of Congress and does not have the right to speak to Congress without the invitation of the chamber he is addressing. Due to seating constraints in the Senate chamber, for all practical purposes this means that he cannot deliver the State of the Union in person without the invitation of the speaker of the House. Pelosi had invited Trump to give the State of the Union address shortly after being elected as speaker of the House on Jan. 3. Her Wednesday letter does not expressly rescind this invitation, but rather merely asks President Trump to  work together to determine another suitable date  for the address, or to merely deliver it in writing. The government shutdown has now reached day 26. Trump has said that he will not sign a deal to reopen the government unless it contains the funding he requested for a border wall. Congress has so far not indicated that it s ready to agree to his demands.

        WATCH: Trump took a hilarious jab at Jim Acosta when he saw him in the White House
     I appreciate your sales pitch! The strained relationship between President Donald Trump and the media took another downward turn when the president threw a humorous jab at CNN s Jim Acosta, one of his more vociferous critics. Trump had just taken questions from the media from the Oval Office when he saw CNN s chief White House correspondent and decided to mock one of the tweets Acosta had sent to undermine the president.  Good job yesterday, I appreciate your sales pitch,  said the president. I didn t see any danger on the border Mr. President,  responded Acosta. That s because we had a wall,  Trump fired back.The president was referring to a tweet Acosta had posted of himself near the border barrier in McAllen, Texas, ostensibly posted to show that there wasn t an immediate crisis demanding a wall.  I found some steel slats down on the border,  Acosta tweeted.  But I don t see anything resembling a national emergency situation,  he added,  at least not in the McAllen TX area of the border where Trump will be today. Many noted that his intent backfired because the presence of a border barrier had created the tranquillity Acosta noted. Trump took up the same argument when he jabbed at Acosta. The interaction was caught on video, but the sound is somewhat drowned out by other reporters and photographers. Here s the video of Trump s jab at Acosta:

    Must be nice
	Despite the partial government shutdown, which is now the longest in United States history, 30 Democratic congressional lawmakers flew to Puerto Rico this weekend for a winter retreat to vacation and meet with more than 100 lobbyists and corporate executives.
What are the details?
	According 
	to the Washington Examiner, 30 Democratic lawmakers   including their families and chiefs of staff   flew to Puerto Rico on a chartered 737 jet on Friday, where they planned to meet with 109 lobbyists and corporate executives, attend several parties, and see a special showing of the hit Broadway play  Hamilton. 

	Those attending the retreat, hosted by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC, also partook in some business, including attending a roundtable to discuss Hurricane Maria cleanup.

	 We are excited for you to join us for CHC BOLD PAC s 2019 Winter Retreat in San Juan, Puerto Rico! Each year, this retreat serves as a way for our CHC BOLD PAC Members and friends in the D.C. community to come together to escape the cold and discuss our shared priorities for a stronger and more prosperous country,  a memo for the event said, according to the Examiner.

	Lobbyists and corporate executives from Facebook, Amazon, Comcast, R.J. Reynolds, Verizon, Microsoft, Intel, and PhRMA were in attendance, in addition to representatives from major unions like the National Education Association.

	Officials from BOLD PAC did not reveal which lawmakers made the trip. But, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) was spotted on a beach by a Fox News producer on Saturday:

	Retreat participants stayed at a seaside resort where rooms go for $429 per night, the Examiner reported.

	Additionally, the chartered jet carried just 250 pounds of donated medical supplies.
What did the PAC say?
	Given the situation in Washington, the trip has garnered negative attention. However, BOLD PAC chairman Rep. Tony Cardenas (D-Calif.) said the criticism is unfounded.

	He told the Examiner in a statement:

	Lawmakers are expected to return Monday evening.

        Trump confirms he is  absolutely  willing to keep shutdown going for years
    At a news conference, he confirmed that he had made that assertion to Sen. Chuck Schumer 
	During a Rose Garden news conference Friday, President Donald Trump confirmed that he told Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) that he was willing to keep the government shut down for  months or even years  if Congress did not give him the funding he wanted for his border wall.What happened?
	After a meeting with Trump on Friday morning, 
	Schumer told reporters,  He said he d keep the government closed for a very long period of time ... months or even years. It s very hard to see how progress will be made unless they open up the government. 

	During the news conference, CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett asked the president if he had actually told Schumer that he was willing to keep the government shut down for  months or even a year or longer. 

	 I did. I did,  Trump quickly responded.  Border security   I did say that. I absolutely said that. I don t think it will, but I am prepared, and I think I can speak for Republicans in the House and Republicans in the Senate. They feel very strongly about having a safe country, having a border that makes sense. Without borders, I ve said it many times, you don t have a country. I hope it doesn t go on even beyond a few more days. It really could open very quickly. 

	He also said that the meeting with Schumer and other congressional leaders this morning  may have been somewhat contentious, but I think it was productive. 

While the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a spending bill that included border wall funding in December, the newly elected Democratic majority in the House has already passed legislation to end the shutdown without wall funding. The Senate has yet to approve either bill.

        Federal office takes serious heat for suggestions to furloughed workers who can t pay bills
    The Office of Personnel Management was accused of being out of touchThe Office of Personnel Management sent out some sample letters for federal workers to use if they found themselves unable to pay rent or other bills during the government shutdown, but some of the suggestions in the letters were heavily criticized, according to CBS News.About 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed during the shutdown, putting some in precarious financial situations. So, the OPM offered some guidance to how they might appeal to landlords and creditors.Two pieces of advice that were heavily criticized included  ...trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments  and  consult with your personal attorney  if you need legal advice.
        
        Users on Twitter quickly pointed out that federal workers who were struggling to pay basic bills during the shutdown would not likely be able to afford incurring legal fees by consulting a personal attorney about their inability to to pay their bills.
        
        Other users were appalled that federal workers are being encouraged to send apologetic letters to creditors, banks and landlords in hopes of receiving a break for not having enough money, while those responsible for the shutdown in Congress feel no financial pain from the situation.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, for example, was reportedly vacationing in Hawaii the past few days, as the shutdown continued with no sign of a potential deal. White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said he believes Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer would be open to making a deal with Trump, but Pelosi is the obstacle. And I think the reason [Democrats left town] is because Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,  Mulvaney said Friday, according to the New York Post.  She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don t expect to hear from the Democrats again. They told us last night that they were not countering our last offer.

        NORAD Santa-tracking program, postal service not impacted by partial government shutdown
    Not included on this year s naughty list
	One of the most vital important government services that relates to Christmas (at least for children) will continue despite  the partial government shutdown.

	 NORAD s Santa tracker will be fully staffed with more than 1,500 military personnel and volunteers who are running the program from Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado. The program is funded through the Department of Defense s budget that was approved earlier this year, the Associated Press 
	reported. The agency will be tracking Santa Claus and answering calls from children, just as it has for 63 years.

	Volunteers typically field tens of thousands of calls and emails from around the world, 
	according to the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Children often ask for Santa s location or discuss their Christmas wish lists. NORAD is a
How many kids follow it?
	Last year, 
	NORAD Tracks Santa had 126,000 phone calls, 18 million website hits, 1.8 million followers on Facebook, and 179,000 additional followers on Twitter, the Associated Press reported.
	Volunteers said they enjoy seeing the holiday through the eyes of children, the Associated Press noted.

	 They re all really sweet, small voices,  Madison Hill, a volunteer who helped answer phones for two previous years, told the news outlet.
	
	 I had a little girl tell me good night instead of goodbye,  she added.  It s really sweet. 

	Many TV stations also air videos of NORAD s Santa tracker during their newscasts.
What about the post office?
	On another Christmas-related matter, the U.S. Postal Service is also continue to process packages with just one full business day to go until Christmas, 
	according to published reports.
	In a tweet on Saturday, the postal service said it also would not be impacted by the government shutdown.

	 All Post Offices will remain open for business. Because we are an independent entity that is funded through the sale of our products & services, and not by tax dollars, our services will not be impacted by a gov t shutdown,  the postal service tweeted.
	The government shutdown is hinging largely on a disagreement over how the U.S. should proceed to secure its border along Mexico.

        Seattle city government reveals that the soda tax is about money   not the health of residents
    The city actually expects an increase in revenue from the tax this year, not the decline that would come from less soda consumptionThe 2019 budget for Seattle reveals that the city does not expect soda consumption to go down as a result of the city s soda tax. Instead, it expects consumption, and the revenue raised by the tax, to increase. When it was first introduced, the soda tax was hailed as a way to force Seattleites to embrace healthier habits.What are the details?Since January, the city of Seattle has slapped a 1.75 cents per ounce tax on soda and other sugary drinks. This led to a 75 percent jump in the cost of a 36-pack of soda at Costco. In protest, Costco posted signs informing members that locations outside of Seattle still carried soda at a lower price. The tax was introduced as a way to encourage people to buy healthier drink options as an alternative to soda. Supporters compared it to existing taxes on cigarettes. According to a study by the city government before the implementation of the tax, the goal of the tax was to  help improve the health and well-being of children and the public s health more generally. But according to the city budget, this has not been the case.In just the first nine months that the tax has been in effect, it has raised nearly $17 million. This is $2 million more than the $15 million expected for all of 2018, which means that Seattle residents are buying more soda than anticipated. And their government is banking on that number going up, because revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 has not yet been announced.The city s 2019 budget states that Seattle expects to raise $21 million from the soda tax over the coming year. It also stated that large declines in soda consumption were  no longer expected. The Seattle Times reported that a few members of the Seattle City Council called out Mayor Jenny Durkan for using the tax to gain revenue for the city instead of improving the health of its residents. However, the council ultimately approved his budget. What else?In Philadelphia, where a similar soda tax has been in effect, a supermarket owner blamed the tax for the closure of one of his stories. Jeff Brown argued that more and more potential customers were doing their grocery shopping outside city limits to avoid the tax.

        Mitch McConnell issues surprising statement on possibility of Trump announcing a national emergency
    Probably not what many want to hear Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) indicated that he was willing to go to extraordinary lengths to reach a deal with Democrats in order to prevent President Donald Trump from declaring a national emergency. McConnell told reporters that he was considering legislation that would prevent the government from going into a shutdown if lawmakers couldn t agree on a budget.  I don t like shutdowns,  he told reporters.  I don t think they work for anybody and I hope they will be avoided.   I d be open to anything that we could agree on on a bipartisan basis that would make them pretty hard to occur again,  he added.McConnell said that the fact the shutdown happened at all is an embarrassment.  I think this is an example of government dysfunction which should be embarrassing to everyone on a bipartisan basis,  he told reporters.  I am for whatever works - which means avoiding a shutdown, and avoiding the president feeling he should declare a national emergency,  he added.  Exactly how to do that, as you all know, has been quite challenging.  The president has hinted that declaring a national emergency was an option he was considering in order to circumvent needing approval from Congress, where Democrats have control of the House of Representatives. An alleged draft of the order has already leaked to the media. Critics of the president have opined that such a move would almost certainly result in legal challenges. A recent poll showed that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had the worst net approval rating among prominent politicians after the heated debate over the partial government shutdown.

        Nancy Pelosi reverses her decision on Trump s State of the Union speech
    Was this part of some negotiation behind the scenes?In an abrupt change of heart, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced that the House of Representatives would invite President Donald Trump to give his State of the Union address. Pelosi began a firestorm of controversy after she released a letter asking the president to postpone the State of the Union address while the government was partially shutdown. The Speaker cited national security concerns for postponing the speech, which were immediately debunked by many experts including CNN s Phil Mudd. The president responded by canceling a trip planned by Pelosi and other Democratic lawmakers. After that, she formally said the House would not be inviting him to make his speech until after the government shutdown ended. On Friday, Trump announced that they had reached a deal to fund the government for three weeks without funding for his border wall. Pelosi has apparently relented about the State of the Union because the shutdown ended. In a letter posted to Twitter from the Speaker s chief of staff Drew Hammill on Monday, she formally invited the president to give his address before Congress.  When I wrote to you on January 23rd,  Pelosi wrote.  I stated that we should work together to find a mutually agreeable date when government has reopened to schedule this year s State of the Union address. The letter indicated that Pelosi and the president agreed to have him give the address on February 5, and she formally invited him to do so. Trump accepted the invitation in a statement on Monday.  It is my great honor to accept,  the president said in the statement.   We have a great story to tell and yet, great goals to achieve! The president has been hinting at the possibility of declaring a national emergency in order to use emergency powers to order the military to begin construction on his border wall without the approval of Congress.

BLAZE,https://www.theblaze.com/news/jim-demint-commentary-donald-trump-braveheart,"
        Commentary: President Trump s  Braveheart  moment
    Too many Republicans have abandoned himLike almost everyone who s ever seen it, I love  Braveheart,  Mel Gibson s Oscar-winning epic about Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace. For all the film s violence and gore, the toughest scene to watch is bloodless. It comes when Wallace, on the cusp of once again outsmarting and outfighting the English on the battlefield, signals to his noblemen to charge and rout the enemy  when they betray him. Saddled in their high horses, they smile smugly at the upstart commoner, lead their cavalries away from the fight, and leave Wallace to be destroyed.            I thought about this scene a lot over the last month as President Donald Trump fought valiantly during the partial government shutdown to win funding for the border wall he was elected to build.            In his first two years in office, President Trump has done more to advance conservative goals than any president in a generation. He has accomplished more than most conservatives and Republicans would have thought possible. He not only fulfilled his promise to appoint originalist judges, he has appointed more appellate judges than any president in history over two years. In Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump found two of the finest judicial minds of this generation. He signed a historic tax reform that eluded both Presidents Bush. He moved the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. After decades   and trillions of dollars   of foreign wars, Trump has challenged the bipartisan establishment consensus and put America First in our foreign policy. He has ended China s exploitation of American trade policy, and defended our military and economic interests around the world. He guided historic, bipartisan reform of our criminal justice system through a deeply divided Congress. He has gotten U.S. taxpayers out of the international abortion business. He has cracked down on illegal immigration and guided the economy to unprecedented levels of employment, wage growth, and consumer and business confidence.            Donald Trump has been America s own William Wallace against The Swamp in D.C.            And yet, every time the going has gotten tough, when a major conservative victory hung in the balance, when the president has called on his Republican bannermen in Congress to do their jobs, they have turned tail.            For two years, Republicans enjoyed majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate. And yet, congressional Republicans could not muster the votes to repeal Obamacare. They did not end the taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood. They passed ballooning spending bills that ignored the president s plan to balance the federal budget.            And of course, they abandoned him in this monthlong government shutdown. A shutdown fight is a test of wills and party unity. Nancy Pelosi had no trouble unifying her caucus in part because Senate Republicans never lifted a finger to unify theirs. From the first hours of the shutdown, Senate Republican leaders made it clear they were more interested in avoiding blame than in winning a fight. They could have kept the Senate open and forced Democrats to block bills and amendments to re-open the government. They could have forced either a private negotiation or a public debate. But they sat on the sidelines. Instead, they said it was the president s fight to win or lose on his own, even after Democrats used the Senate Republicans  indifference to avoid negotiating at all.            Last week, as the Senate headed toward decisive votes on the president s plan to fund the wall and re-open the government, Senate Republicans lashed out at Vice President Mike Pence, blaming the White House for putting them in a difficult position. Like the treacherous Scottish nobles, Beltway politicians think first and foremost of themselves. Border security was a winnable fight for Republicans. The president understands what congressional Republicans apparently don t: You can t win if you won t fight.Likewise, House Republican leadership were little better. When Democrats were in the minority in 2016, they held a sit-in on the House floor to focus national media attention on their push for gun control. Yet, House Republican leadership sent their caucus home every weekend this month. If corporate tax cuts were on the line, I m willing to bet DC leaders would have had an all-hands-on-deck daily messaging blitz. But border security is something main street voters care about, not K Street and Wall Street, so we see little conviction from them.            After the shutdown, the president is still well-positioned to fight again soon. His rescheduled State of the Union address on Feb. 5 gives him a unique opportunity to frame the coming debates about the budget, the debt ceiling, and next year s round of spending bills ñ especially the bill covering immigration, the border, and the Department of Homeland Security. But the president cannot win these fights on his own.            For two years, all conservative eyes have been on President Trump s remarkable success. But this year, those eyes should turn to congressional Republicans, to hold them accountable before the 2020 campaign and ensure they join rather than duck the fights ahead. The president deserves their support; it s up to grassroots conservatives to make sure they give it to him.

        US adds 304,000 jobs in January, nearly doubling economists  expectations
    The unemployment rate also rose slightly to 4.0 percent
	The United States added 304,000 new jobs in January, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate climbed slightly from 3.9 percent to 4.0 percent.
Here s what we know
	Before the jobs report had been announced, economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted that the country would add around 172,000 jobs. The actual number of 304,000, 1.8 times the estimate. According to the New York Times, the U.S. economy has now added jobs for 100 consecutive months.

	While the new jobs report was higher than expected, the jobs report for December was adjusted down by 70,000 jobs from 312,000 jobs created that month to 222,000.

	The average monthly gain for all of 2018 was 223,000.

	Immediately following the release of the jobs report, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 51 points. However, the S&P 500 index rose less than 1 point, and the Nasdaq dropped by 37 points.
How did the shutdown affect jobs?
	While the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the partial government shutdown cost the U.S. gross domestic product $11 billion ($8 billion of which is expected to be recovered later in the year), the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that it had little effect on hiring.

	According to the Labor Statistics report:

	Federal employees, who were furloughed but still had to work during the shutdown (roughly 800,000), were considered as employed for the BLS establishment survey, while those who were furloughed but did not work or get back pay (roughly 380,000) were considered to be unemployed during this period. This boosted the unemployment numbers, but the federal employees  eventual return to work was not included as new jobs added.

        Mick Mulvaney suggests Trump could still declare national emergency for border wall funding
    Says border security will happen  with or without Congress  
	Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney suggested Sunday that President Donald Trump could still declare a national emergency to obtain funding for a $5.7 billion wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
What did he say?
	 It s still better to get it through legislation,  Mulvaney said on  Fox News Sunday.   That s the right way to do it. But at the end of the day, the president is going to secure the border one way or another. 

	Mulvaney added,  He ll do it with or without Congress. 

	Asked if Trump will budge on the $5.7 billion amount for the project, Mulvaney said:  The president s not married to a number, he s married to border security which is the right thing for the President of the United States to do. 
Trump on Friday signed a bill that ended the partial government shutdown for three weeks. According to Mulvaney, Trump made the move because Democrats have indicated they are willing to negotiate on the border wall issue. The president and Congress now have until Feb. 15 to reach an agreement.

	One concern is whether another partial shutdown could happen if both sides fail to reach an agreement.

	 No one wants a government shutdown,  Mulvaney said.  But when a president vetoes a bill that s put in front of him on a spending package, sometimes that has the effect of shutting the government down. We don t go into this trying to shut the government down. 

	On Friday, Trump said that if he doesn t get a  fair deal  from Congress, the government will either shut down again or he will  use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States to address this emergency. We will have great security. 
Anything else?	CNN reported Thursday that Trump staffers are already preparing a draft proclamation to declare a national emergency to secure funds for the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Such a move could be met with legal opposition from immigration activists and land conservation groups, which would tie up the process.

     We d like to show you around! As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi claims victory over President Donald Trump s  immoral  border wall following the end of the longest U.S. partial government shutdown in history, wives of Border Patrol agents blasted Pelosi in a letter saying, she should look past Trump and instead observe what agents do every day and why a wall or barrier would help them.Jill Demanski wrote the following to Pelosi amid the shutdown, during which her husband wasn t receiving a paycheck, Fox News reported:During a  Fox & Friends  interview Monday, Demanski and her friend Renea Perez   another Border Patrol wife   insisted that a wall or barrier is necessary for the sake of agents  safety and their ability to perform their duties. It can be overwhelming,  Perez said.  They definitely need a wall or barrier in the high-traffic areas. It will allow them to do their job more efficiently and give them more time. Demanski underscored that point:  I don t think it s fair that they re asking one or two agents to handle groups of hundreds of people crossing over at one time, and we see with these caravans more and more coming. We don t think it shows that they are worried about our agents  safety. Don t make this about TrumpPelosi has shown no signs of bending on the president s push for a wall, despite his offers of concessions   and despite her stated support for a wall when former President Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat, was in office.But Demanski noted that  it is not President Trump that is necessarily asking for the wall. Border Patrol and our agents and experts here have been asking for it for years,  she told  Fox & Friends.  We finally have a president that has come here and seen first-hand the need for it and has had our back,  Demanski continued.  I don t know of many presidents that could really have gone through the turmoil that he s gone through to try to help us get this. So again it s Border Patrol and the agents that are asking for it; it s not Trump. So you can support a wall without being a supporter of Trump; they don t have to go hand in hand. Tough times for Border Patrol families, tooPerez and Demanski told  Fox & Friends  that going without paychecks during the shutdown was hard   but that they were willing to through the hardship to make things safer for agents. Bills don t stop, so we were feeling like we were forgotten,  Perez told the show.(H/T: IJR)

        Report: Trump is prepared to compromise in order to secure border wall funding
    
	President Donald Trump will use his address from the White House Diplomatic Reception Room on Saturday to propose an immigration compromise with Democrats, Axios reported.

	Trump s announcement comes as the partial government shutdown enters its fifth week. The government shut down several days before Christmas over a stalemate between Trump and Democrats. The president says he will not sign spending bills that exclude money for the border wall, while Democrat refuse to approve funds for the wall.
What are the details?
	In exchange for the border wall, Trump will offer Democrats a deal that includes protections for illegal immigrants who are in the U.S. legally under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, a hallmark Obama-era policy.

	From Axios:
Vice President Mike Pence and Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser and son-in-law to the president, reportedly crafted the deal. Whether Democrats will accept such a proposal remains to be seen.The renewed effort to end the shutdown comes after Trump stopped House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from using military aircraft for an overseas trip. According to Axios, it was that controversial incident that proved to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that Pelosi is unwilling to compromise, so Trump needed to offer a deal that would gain traction on Capitol Hill.Pence, Kushner, and McConnell met on Thursday to finalize the bill, which is the  culmination of Kushner and Pence s conversations with some Democrats and an inventory of proposals they discussed,  Axios reported.Reporters with CNN and the New York Times independantly confirmed Axios  report.Meanwhile, Democrats are offering new legislation to re-open the government that includes just $1 billion for border-related spending   but not a wall.How did Democrats respond?Before Trump even officially announced his proposal to the American people, Democrats, including Pelosi and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), announced their opposition to the proposal. Unfortunately, initial reports make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people s lives,  Pelosi said in a statement.This story has been updated.

        Trump blames Paul Ryan for the border wall not being built   here s why
    And he promises that the wall will be builtPresident Donald Trump blamed former House Speaker Paul Ryan for Republicans  failure to begin construction on the border wall he promised voters since 2016. The president explained the accusations in an interview with The Daily Caller published Wednesday.  Well, I was going to veto the omnibus bill and Paul told me in the strongest of language,  Please don t do that, we ll get you the wall,   Trump said.  And I said,  I hope you mean that, because I don t like this bill,  although I love the bill for what it did for the military,  he continued.  And therefore, if it weren t for the military, I would have vetoed it. The president went to explain why funding for the military was pivotal in his decision to sign the omnibus funding bill. He then turned back to the subject of Paul Ryan.  But another very big factor was the fact that Paul told me in the strongest of terms that,  please sign this and if you sign this we will get you that wall.  Which is desperately needed by our country,  he explained.   Humanitarian crisis, trafficking, drugs, you know, everything,  he added,  people, criminals, gangs, so, you know, we need the wall. The president said that Ryan  went lame duck,  and didn t fulfill his promise to fund the wall.  And once he went lame duck it was just really an exercise in waving to people and the power was gone so I was very disappointed,  he added.  I was very disappointed in Paul because the wall was so desperately needed.   And I ll get the wall,  he concluded. The border wall became a contentious issue at the center of the debate over the partial government shutdown. Trump said that he would not sign any funding bill without $5.7 billion for his border wall, while Democrats promised that they would not vote for any bill that contained funding for the wall. Here s the latest in the border budget battle:

        Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw giving up paychecks till border security is funded:  Our national security is at stake 
    Honorable, of course
	Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) has announced that he plans to give up his paychecks until the partial government shutdown is over   and border security is addressed and funded.
What did he say? 
	In a tweet posted Thursday, Crenshaw, wrote,  I cannot in good conscience get paid while federal employees  financial futures hang in the balance because of this partial government shutdown. 

	 I ve asked the Chief Administrative Officer to withhold my pay until we have come to an agreement to adequately fund border security,  he added. 
	
	Crenshaw shared a copy of the signed letter on Twitter, which was addressed to Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko.

	A portion of the letter read,  I am writing to request that my pay be withheld during this partial government shutdown until an appropriations agreement has taken effect.
	 Our national security is at stake, operating both with weak borders and a weakened federal infrastructure,  he added.  Many of my constituents are fellow public servants affected by the shutdown, and I cannot receive a paycheck while they go without. 

	Crenshaw, a U.S. Navy SEAL veteran, supports funding for construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Anything else?
	As recent as Tuesday, Crenshaw tweeted about the need for such border fortification.

	He wrote,  The problems on the border need to be addressed. 400,000 illegal aliens being apprehended per year while crossing an open border is completely unsustainable.
	 The problem must be solved in a multifaceted way. Physical barriers are a necessary part of that solution. Just ask the migrant caravan when they arrived in Tijuana, where the wall prevented them from overrunning our border agents. Walls mitigate movement. Period,  Crenshaw continued.

	 Walls are necessary,  the newly minted lawmaker added,  but of course we recognize that they aren t the only solution. Some places require different methods, as the President s plan recognizes. Drones, sensors, more patrols, etc. It all works together, and physical barriers are a part of that. 

	Crenshaw continued,  A wall in one location frees up manpower resources in another. This is important when understanding why we are okay with building in some areas and waiting on others. 

	In conclusion, he wrote,  Dismissing a wall or fence as an  ineffective  or  4th century  solution is an attempt to undermine the plan without providing any logical reasoning. Don t succumb to lazy arguments. Let s think this through, and reopen the government with adequate funding for border security.

        Phil Mudd swiftly dismantles Nancy Pelosi s  Kardashian moment  over Trump s State of the Union speech
     It s national security nonsense! 
	Former CIA and FBI official Phil Mudd had  strong words  when he was asked by CNN s Wolf Blitzer if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had a reasonable rationale for 
	wanting to delay the president s State of the Union speech.

	 Do you believe that this is a real national security threat?  Blitzer asked before listing all of the important government figures who would be in attendance should the speech continue as scheduled.

	 You re gonna have all one hundred senators,  he said,  435 members of the House, the diplomatic core, the Supreme Court justices, you re gonna have members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the entire Cabinet, with one so-called designated survivor who doesn t come because of a God-forbid some sort of security incident. 

	 Is this a legitimate security concern?  he asked.

	 Heck no!  exclaimed Mudd,  I mean this is political genius, I give Nancy Pelosi credit for her political sense. 

	 It s national security nonsense!  he added to laughter from the panel.
 This is a Kardashian moment, this is fake! 
	Pelosi had claimed 
	that because of the government shutdown it would be too difficult to provide security for all the members of government who would be attending the event, and she implied that she would force the president to delay the speech.

	Mudd made mincemeat of that rationale, even as he praised Pelosi s political maneuvering.

	 We re talking about less than 60 acres in the huge national security threats of U.S. senators, U.S. congressmen, members of the Cabinet, Supreme Court justices, and guests of, for example, the president, and we can t secure 58 acres?  Mudd explained.  Are you kidding me? 

	 There s 48,000 plus flights every day in this country, Wolf,  he continued,  they re still flying and the FAA, which in the midst of this crisis is still operating, can manage 40,000 plus flights and we can t do 58 acres? 

	 I applaud her for coming up with the genius of trying to corner the president on this,  Mudd concluded,  but from a national security perspective, this is a Kardashian moment, this is fake! 

Here s the video of Mudd ripping down Pelosi s protestations:

        Ocasio-Cortez breaks with Dems, votes against bill to reopen gov t because it would fund ICE
     ...our community felt strongly about not funding that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was the only Democrat to vote against a House funding bill Wednesday, citing funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement as the reason for her opposition, according to The Hill.It was the 10th funding measure the House as voted on, and would fund the government through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. Most of our votes are pretty straightforward, but today was a tough/nuanced call,  Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Instagram.  We didn t vote with the party because one of the spending bills included ICE funding and our community felt strongly about not funding that Ocasio-Cortez was previously criticized by some on the left for voting for a funding bill earlier this month that would ve funded ICE. She has in the past questioned  why we are funding [ICE] at all. The bill still passed the Democratic-majority House 234-180. Ten Republicans voted in favor of it.Does it really matter?At this point, the repeated passing of funding bills in the House is just a matter of going through the motions, because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear the bills won t be voted on in the Senate.Predictably, McConnell blocked Wednesday s measure after Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) requested the Senate take it up for a vote.The Senate will vote Thursday on bills that could reopen the government. One of the bills includes Trump s requested $5.7 million border wall funding in exchange for three years of protection for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and some immigrants who are under Temporary Protected Status.That bill would need some unexpected Democratic support to get the necessary 60 votes to pass. If it fails, The Senate will vote on a bill to fund the government at current levels through Feb. 8.

        Sarah Sanders just issued a severe ultimatum to Democrats about the border wall
    Setting up another showdown in three weeksIn the aftermath of what has widely been deemed a political defeat for President Donald Trump in his effort to build a wall on the southern border, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued an ultimatum to Democrats.After Congress passed a bill to open the government for the next three weeks while border security is negotiated, Trump tweeted that  in 21 days, if no deal is done, it s off to the races.  Sanders took things even a step further. In 21 days President @realDonaldTrump is moving forward building the wall with or without the Democrats,  Sanders wrote.  The only outstanding question is whether the Democrats want something or nothing. 
        
        Can they really do it without Democrats?Their comments raise an obvious question, however: If they can build the wall without Democrats, and without conceding anything to Democrats, why was part of the government just shut down for more than a month?House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has not wavered in her assertion that Democrats will not agree to fund the border wall in whole or in part, has not changed tune even with the government temporarily funded.  Have I not been clear on the wall,  Pelosi said at a press conference Friday.So, it s unclear whether this three-week period will get the two sides any closer to a long-term solution.Back to the national emergency solutionIf no deal is reached, Trump said he will declare a national emergency to have the wall built, an idea he has flirted with in past weeks before deciding against it. The legality of such a move is unclear, and would surely be challenged in court. We ll work with the Democrats and negotiate and if we can t do that, then we ll do a obviously we ll do the national emergency because that s what it is. It s a national emergency. PolitiFact summarized the potential legal hurdles a national emergency declaration would face, in terms of actually using it to get the wall funded and built:

        White House announces no raises for VP, Cabinet members, which hasn t happened since 2013, anyway
    Extension of pay freeze was included in bills that didn t pass before 115th Congress adjournedThe Trump administration has frozen pay raises for Vice President Mike Pence, Cabinet members, and select appointees amid the partial government shutdown, the White House announced Friday evening.Has this happened before?Mainstream media decried the possible pay hikes but later admitted that House Republicans initiated a freeze on raises for senior-level officials back in 2013. And Congress has since renewed the freeze every year.The extension of the long-standing freeze on raises was included in bills that were not acted on before the 115th Congress ended, according to published reports.The raises, had they gone through, would have represented a pay hike about $10,000 a year, starting on Saturday. Pence s salary would have risen from $230,700 to $243,500. Salaries for cabinet secretaries earning $199,700 a year would jumped to $210,700. During a press conference on Friday President Donald Trump said he  might consider  freezing the raises, the New York Times reported. The news outlet also noted that In March, Republicans tried to end the freeze but Democrats kept it in place. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later said the administration was  exploring options to prevent this from being implemented while some federal workers are furloughed  and described the situation as  another unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.  The Office of Personnel Management reportedly stated that  it would be prudent for agencies to continue to pay these senior political officials at the frozen rate until appropriations legislation is enacted that would clarify the status of the freeze. About 800,000 federal employees are approaching their third week without pay. Correctional officers, Transportation Security Administration agents, and other federal employees are not being paid because budgets for their departments were not approved prior to the shutdown. Any end in sight?Trump and Democratic lawmakers are in a stalemate over how to fund security measures   Trump wants a $5 billion   along the U.S.-Mexico border. Union leaders for federal workers have accused the president lacking empathy for the federal employees who are struggling now that their paychecks are on hold. The workers have gone without pay since the shutdown began Dec. 22. Trump has confirmed that he told Congress he could keep the government closed for more than a year, if needed. But he has also said he doesn t expect the shutdown to last long, The Hill reported.

        WATCH: Trump blames Democrats, makes the case for a border wall in prime-time speech to the nation
    Here s the full video of what he said 
	President Donald Trump made his case to the nation for the border wall in a prime-time televised speech, while blaming Democrats for the government shutdown and citing the dangers of illegal immigration.

	Trump referred to the  tragic reality  of illegal immigration, and said he was dedicated to stopping the humanitarian crisis. 
	The president also blamed Democrats for the government shutdown, saying that their reticence to fully fund border security was forcing his hand on the issue.

	 The only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government,  Trump said.

	He also said that he had agreed with the Democrats  demand that the barrier not be a concrete wall.

	 At the request of Democrats, it would be a steel barrier, rather than a concrete wall,  Trump said.  This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. 

	Trump cited some of the families that were hurt by illegal alien crimes and murders that would have been prevented with more forceful immigration enforcement .

	Many were predicting that he would declare a  national emergency  on illegal immigration and use the powers stemming from such a declaration to order the military to build his wall.
CNN s Jim Acosta reported before the speech that many of the president s advisers were encouraging him to declare an emergency despite the legal repercussions that such a proclamation would inspire.  Trump has been reaching out to friends and advisers to ask about national emergency declaration at the border,  Acosta tweeted.  Several of those folks have told Trump it  probably won t work  from a legal standpoint, I m told.   He is receiving advice that he should do it anyway to please his base,  Acosta added. The president did not announce a national emergency during the prime time speech. The Democratic response
	Newly elected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) gave a Democratic response after the president s address.

	 The president has chosen fear,  responded Pelosi.
 No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down,  Schumer said.

    The organization created a relief fund to help those affected by the partial government shutdownGoFundMe has launched a fundraiser on its platform to help the 800,000 federal workers who aren t getting paid during the partial government shutdown. The organization has partnered with Deepak Chopra to create a relief fund for workers who ve been either furloughed or have been required to continue working without pay for the past month. Chopra is an Indian-born American author and alternative medicine advocate.  Government workers, through no fault of their own, can t afford to put diapers on their newborns,  GoFundMe CEO Rob Solomon wrote in news release on the website.  Employees of the most powerful nation in the world are being forced to work without pay and line up at diaper or food banks. It makes no sense. GoFundMe and Chopra kick-started the  Government Shutdown Direct Relief Fund  with donations of $10,000 each. The campaign s goal is set at $200,000. Lebanese billionaire Ayman Hariri also donated $10,000, according to the site s list of donors.Where will the money go?The donations will be given directly to nonprofits that are assisting federal employees with food, counseling, housing support, and other needs. The fund will provide support to the National Diaper Bank Network, which is helping supply diapers to parents who are affected by the shutdown. Some of the money will also be given to the World Central Kitchen, which has been providing meals to workers in Washington D.C. A full list of the recipients is expected to be released in the coming days, according to the website. What else did GoFundMe say?How much has been raised?More than $170,000 had been raised by Tuesday morning since the page was launched over the weekend.

    CNN says they have proof of how Trump is planning to circumvent CongressPresident Donald Trump is planning to declare a national emergency at the border and use the powers from such a declaration to order the construction of a border wall, according to a draft of the order published by CNN. Trump has indicated that he is considering taking the drastic action in order to circumvent Congress, especially the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.  The massive amount of aliens who unlawfully enter the United States each day is a direct threat to the safety and security of our nation and constitutes a national emergency,  reads the draft order. CNN also reported that the administration is looking at various alternate sources for funding the border wall, which add up to more than $7 billion. He had asked Congress for $5.7 billion for his border wall, but has so far been rebuffed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that Democrats would not sign on to any deal that included funding for Trump s border wall.  Now, therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C 1601, et seq.), hereby declare that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States,  the draft says. Critics of the president have warned that if he were to take such an action that it would likely be met with legal challenges. Even some Republicans have cautioned against using the emergency powers of the executive in this manner. On Thursday, the president offered to sign on to a continuing resolution on the budget as long as it included a  down payment  on the border wall. And he hinted that he was still considering declaring a national emergency.  Look, I have other alternatives if I have to,  the president said to reporters.  And I ll use those alternatives if I have to,  he explained.  We want to go through the system. We have to have a wall in this country.

        Texas landowners bracing for legal fight as Trump pushes plan to build border wall
    Plan could impact landowners living in Rio Grande Valley for generationsPresident Donald Trump s arrival in McAllen, Texas, Thursday was met with opposition from some residents along the border who say they will fight any attempt the federal government makes to purchase their land or take it away through eminent domain, according to The Associated Press. Some have already hired lawyers in anticipation of a legal battle. Why? You could give me a trillion dollars and I wouldn t take it,  Eloisa Cavazos, who owns land along the Rio Grande river that separates the U.S. and Mexico in Texas.  It s not about money. The government is reportedly surveying land along the Texas border and plans to start construction on the wall next month, the outlet reported.The president has said he could declare a national emergency to fund the wall if Congress fails to reach an agreement.According to legal experts cited by the AP, Trump will not likely be able to waive eminent domain if he declares a national emergency. Under eminent domain, the government must demonstrate the land is needed for public use and offer compensation to landowners. The wall in the McAllen region is a priority for the Department of Homeland Security because it s the busiest area for illegal border crossings, the report states.On Wednesday, the DHS reported that it detained 27,518 adults and children traveling together on the southern border in December. The figure marked  a new monthly high.  And in November, more than 23,000 parents and children were caught illegally crossing the border in the Rio Grande Valley, the report states. The figure is more than triple what it was compared to last year. The Trump administration wants to build  more than 215 new miles of wall, including 104 miles in the Rio Grande Valley and 55 miles near Laredo,  according to the report. Homeland Security officials say the wall would curtail the number of Central American families attempting to illegally enter the U.S. Other security efforts have included the president sending troops to the border in response to a migrant caravan that made headlines prior to the November election. A border security spokeswoman told the AP that the troops had a visible presence in the Rio Grande Valley but closed their base camp on Dec. 22.Any chance of an agreement?The president and congressional Democrats are gridlocked over how to implement further security measures along the border, which ultimately led to a budget stalemate and a partial government shutdown now entering its third week.Trump met with Democrats Wednesday in the Situation Room. The meeting reportedly ended with Trump walking out after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reiterated that Democrats would not support the president s request for more than $5 billion in funding for a wall. In March, Congress funded  33 miles of walls and fencing in Texas,  the report states. The government also has announced plans to cut through private land. Among the landowners are families who have lived in the Rio Grande Valley for generations.

        Report: Republicans are pushing for a compromise on the border wall   here s how they want to entice Democrats
    Will Trump agree to a compromise to open the government?Republicans are quietly orchestrating a large immigration bill that would fund the border wall, but entice Democrats with some concessions, according to a report from CNN s Manu Raju. Raju reported that the deal would included $5.7 billion for the border wall that President Donald Trump has promised for more than two years, and it would give Democrats what they want in return   support for amnesty through DACA. DACA is the amnesty granted by former President Barack Obama to some illegal aliens through  deferral  of deportations. The program has been excoriated by Republicans, including the president, but he has also said in the past that he could support some form of the policy. The report says that the plan is still in early stages, but that Republican Senators hope it will lead to a breakthrough to end the government shutdown, now in its third week. Raju said that Trump s son-in-law and top aide Jared Kushner, indicated that the White House would be interested in a deal that would get funding for the border wall and could pass the Senate. He did not say whether Trump would sign the proposed legislation.  Kushner came to the Capitol today after talks at the WH collapsed,  he tweeted.  Graham has pushed a bigger immigration deal including DACA and the border wall, something Kushner has been open to.   Kushner left without taking questions,  Raju added. Earlier Wednesday, talks between the two sides broke down completely when the president walked out of a meeting after Pelosi said she would not even consider a deal on a budget with border wall funding. Democrats excoriated the president in a press briefing following the meeting, while his allies criticized the Democrats for stonewalling.

        A  depressed  Lindsey Graham says Trump should use emergency powers to build the wall
     I just don t see a pathway forward Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said President Donald Trump should use national emergency powers to fund the border wall, after initially questioning the legality and wisdom of such a move, according to CNN.Negotiations between Trump and congressional Democrats over how to reopen the government and whether to fund a wall on the U.S. southern border have gone nowhere, leading Graham to believe there are no other options. Speaker Pelosi s refusal to negotiate on funding a border wall/barrier even if the government were to be reopened virtually ends the congressional path to funding for a border wall/barrier,  Graham said in a statement.  It is time for President Donald Trump to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier. Graham made it clear he was not happy about this reality. I think we re stuck,  Graham said, according to Politico.  I just don t see a pathway forward. I don t see a way forward. I have never been more depressed about moving forward than I am right now. I just don t see a pathway forward. Trump has already said he will  probably  use emergency powers to build the wall if Congress doesn t agree on a bill to include wall funding, which at this point seems unlikely. If this doesn t work out, probably I will do it, I would almost say definitely,  Trump said.  This is a national emergency. Declaring a national emergency is by no means a quick and easy path toward a border wall. Legislators on both sides agree that using emergency powers for the wall would spur legal challenges, and even Republicans have doubts about whether the need for a wall can be considered an emergency.Graham said the move would  get challenged in court for sure as to whether or not this fits the statutory definition of an emergency.  I hope it works,  Graham said.

        Homeland Security slams  fake news  CNN, sets the record straight over  grossly misrepresented  story
     More #FakeNews from @CNN 
	The Department of Homeland Security is pushing back against 
	a CNN report that claimed Transportation Security Administration agents have staged a  sick out    and thereby potentially compromising airport security   because they are required to work during the partial government shutdown, despite not being paid.
What did CNN claim?
	Citing  two senior agency officials and three TSA employee union officials,  CNN claimed  hundreds  of TSA agents at four major U.S. airports participated in a  sick out,  a retaliatory measure for being forced to work without pay.

	The report stated:

	Union officials predicted the number of agents calling out from work would increase if the government remains partially shut down.
How did the DHS respond?
	DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton characterized CNN s report as  fake news. 

	 More 
	#FakeNews from @CNN. Security operations at airports have not been impacted by a non-existent sick out. CNN has the cell numbers of multiple @TSA public affairs professionals, but rather than validate statistics, they grossly misrepresented them,  he wrote on Twitter.

	Meanwhile, the TSA said in a statement  security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change  during the shutdown.

        Fox News  Shepard Smith tears into Trump over  long broken  promise of Mexico paying for the wall
     We remember the promise. How could we forget it? Even if the government shutdown ends with President Donald Trump getting funding for a southern border wall, the president will still have failed to keep his promise to voters, Fox News host Shepard Smith said Wednesday.Smith criticized Trump for the White House s reported refusal to agree to bills that would separately open certain areas of the government, which Smith said were  ready to go  and had  bipartisan support.  Republicans and Democrats, all good to go, they can pass it and we re ready, and the White House says no,  Smith said, taking a shot at a White House statement citing a border crisis, which Smith said was  arguably of their own making. Hot Air noted that Smith may have overstated the Republican support for the bills some. He then turned toward Trump s repeated promises over the years that Mexico would pay for the border wall:Smith also said that Trump s claim that a new trade deal with Mexico would pay for the wall isn t true, because the deal hasn t been finalized (and it wouldn t pay for the wall even if it was). So that doesn t pay for anything,  Smith said.

        Nation of Islam reportedly received hundreds of thousands from the US government to train prisoners
    The money was used by the radical group to teach its view of religion to prisonersAccording to a report by the Washington Examiner, the National of Islam has received hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars since 2008, to fund a program in which it taught its radical religious views to prisoners.What is the Nation of Islam?The Nation of Islam is a black nationalist group under the direction of Rev. Louis Farrakhan. Farrakhan has a long history of anti-Semitism. In February he gave a speech that contained racist lines like  the powerful Jews are my enemy  and  the Jews were responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood.  During that same speech he also said,  White folks are going down. And Satan is going down. And Farrakhan, by God s grace, has pulled the cover off of that Satanic Jew and I m here to say your time is up, your world is through. In October, Farrakhan tweeted that he wasn t an anti-Semite, he was  anti-Termite.  The comment was met by widespread backlash, but Twitter refused to suspend his account or remove the tweet. Both conservative groups and liberal ones like the Southern Poverty Law Center have condemned the Nation of Islam for its racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric.What does this report say?According to the Examiner, since 2008 Farrakhan and other Nation of Islam leaders have received at least $364,500 from both the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice. The money was designated for religious services, guide services, study services, and  other related programs,  all led by the Nation of Islam.One of these payments was for Nation of Islam leader Verbon Muhammad to  provide Nation of Islam religious services  for inmates. In 2017, Muhammad had said that the group did not  allow white people in our meetings, period.  A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons told the Examiner that  [c]ontracts are retained six years after final payment, so we are not able to provide details regarding the original contract on which the Nation of Islam began contracting with the Bureau of Prisons. Ironically, the Examiner noted that Farrakhan has also told Nation of Islam adherents to refuse money from the federal government.  If they offer you anything, look carefully into it,  he said in 2013,  lest the Nation will no longer be tied to the principles that the Hon. Elijah Muhammad desired for us: to make us an independent nation on some of this Earth that we can call our own.

        Ann Coulter predicts that Trump  will fold  on border wall, says Matt Drudge sets national agenda
    Coulter isn t pulling any punchesConservative commentator Ann Coulter predicted that President Donald Trump  will fold  on his demands for border wall funding and that the government will reopen as a result. The government shutdown is in its 13th day after Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement   primarily over funding for Trump s planned border wall. What did she say?Coulter, who was guest on Wednesday s  Mark Simone Show  on WOR-AM in New York, said that despite Trump shutting down the government, it all appeared to be tough talk to no end.  [H]e actually did shut down the government,  Coulter said.  Though, don t worry, he ll fold in the end.  Coulter s comments echo those she made in December during an interview with the Daily Caller.  Trump will just have been a joke presidency who scammed the American people, amused the populists for a while, but he ll have no legacy whatsoever,  she said. Coulter, who published  In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!,  also sang the praises of Matt Drudge who owns and operates the Drudge Report.The conservative firebrand credited Drudge with pushing Trump not to be moved on demands for his much-promised border wall.  The one person who deserves the most credit of all, for going ballistic when Trump caved on wall funding right before Christmas   which I think we got him to take back   is Matt Drudge,  Coulter said.  He was the one who put it up as the siren.  Coulter pointed to Drudge s site, which ran a headline  Trump in Retreat  after Republicans and Democrats in December argued over the spending bill.  [Drudge] really does set the national agenda, as he did with this,  she added.  If he doesn t build the wall,  Coulter warned in conclusion,  the next president will be a Democrat.

        Trump eyes path to citizenship as part of revamp for foreign worker visa program
    Skilled, talented workers welcome, president says
	President Donald Trump s administration wants to change the foreign worker visa program to include a pathway to citizenship that s more direct. The announcement comes as Trump continues to spar with Democrats over his plan for a $5.7 billion wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
What does this mean?
	 H1-B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship,  Trump wrote Friday on Twitter.  We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S. 

	The H1-B visa program allows companies to hire foreign workers for some skilled occupations.

	Trump has said he will consider a broader reform of immigration, but not before funding is secured for a concrete or steel wall along the border and more technology and personnel to oversee the barrier.

	His tweet arrives at the end of week three in the partial government shutdown. Trump and Congress are deadlocked over how to fund the border wall, one of his key 2016 campaign promises. Trump suggested this week that emergency disaster funds could be used to help fund the project. He has also said he might declare a national emergency to push through the border wall project if Congress cannot reach an agreement to fund it.
	The president didn t say specifically how the visa program would be overhauled. But his administration has talked about it since last year.
What is the background?
	During his presidential campaign, Trump suggested an increase in prevailing wages for H-1B visa-holders. That would force companies to consider unemployed U.S. workers for entry-level jobs instead of bringing in workers from overseas.

	 This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program,  the Trump campaign stated in August 2015. 
	His campaign website also stated:

        House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer admits walls work, says they re not immoral or racist
    He can t defend Pelosi s extreme rhetoricSome of the primary Democratic objections to the border wall are that a wall is ineffective, immoral, and racist. On Wednesday, a top Democrat went on Fox News and disagreed with all three of those talking points, according to Hot Air.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) spoke with Fox News host Bret Baier about the border wall, and the congressman s stumbling responses might make you wonder if anyone even knows why they oppose the wall at this point.Hoyer starts off on message, saying,  We don t think the wall works and as you know an awful lot of Republicans don t think the wall works as well. So, Baier asked Hoyer if he agreed with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that a border wall is an  immorality.  That s when Hoyer started to waver. Look, I don t think this is an issue of morality, it s an issue of  does it work?   Hoyer said.Baier persisted, pivoting to a quote from former Rep. Beto O Rourke in which he called the border wall a  racist reaction to a racist myth.  I don t talk in those terms and I don t think that s the way we ought to look at it,  Hoyer said somewhat evasively.Circling back around to the question of effectiveness, Baier took the Democrats  position to it s logical conclusion. If walls don t work, why do we have walls anywhere? Should we take down other walls? No, no,  Hoyer responded. Obviously they work some places,  Hoyer said.Apparently just not at the border between the United States and Mexico.That wasn t even Hoyer s only television mishap of the day. Earlier Wednesday, Pelosi sent a letter to President Donald Trump asking him to reschedule the State of the Union due to the shutdown. On CNN that afternoon, Hoyer took Pelosi s words and ran a bit too far with them, saying  The State of the Union is off. Hoyer s office later admitted that the congressman  had not read Speaker Pelosi s letter and mischaracterized it.

        Democratic Rep. says she knows the real secret goal that Trump wants, and it s not a border wall
    This is why there cannot be a deal between themDemocratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.) told MSNBC s Chris Hayes that a deal could not be made with President Donald Trump to reopen the government because his real secret goal was to clear the U.S. of all immigrants and people of color.   This has never been about a wall Jayapal enthusiastically agreed to Hayes  claims about Trump s true goal for the border wall while referring to a statement made about  white supremacy  by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).  Donald Trump is at the border,  said Hayes,  and shutting down the government over this entirely ridiculous enterprise because he almost certainly correctly thinks his political fortunes are dependent on the Steve Kings of the world and the people who love him. People animated by bigotry and fear,  Hayes continued,  people who have come to view their identity as existentially under threat from desperate Honduran moms in flip-flops. Those people cannot be appeased, because what they want is not policy, what they want is an ethnically pure America, and thats why this impasse can t be solved in any normal deal-making terms.  Hayes then brought in Rep. Jayapal. who agreed with him whole-heartedly.  Do you think a deal can be made,  asked Hayes,  or do you think this is fundamentally existential and cannot be made?   It is fundamentally existential if he continues to insist on a wall, and you know, you just said it so beautifully, Chris,  Jayapal responded, gushing over Hayes.   This has never been about a wall,  she claimed.  He actually could have gotten funding a couple of years ago,  she explained,  or a year ago, for a wall. It was part of a deal that was proposed, not all of us agreed with that deal, but it was proposed to him and he turned it down because his ultimate goal, as you said, to make America pure in the sense of not having immigrants, not having folks of color here, and shutting down every form of legal immigration. She also claimed that Muslims and Latinos had been injured and harmed because of the rhetoric issued from the White House about immigrants. Jayapal added to her claim on Twitter after the segment on MSNBC. Trump has never been interested in being a president for the whole country,  she claimed.  People of color and immigrants know this too well,  she added.  His wall was never about policy: it has always about Trump s efforts to lead a more  pure  America.

        Breaking: Trump tells congressional Republicans he won t sign spending bill without border wall funding
    A bill needs to be approved by Friday to prevent a government shutdown
	After meeting with Republican congressional leaders, President Donald Trump has stated he will not sign a continuing resolution that does not include funding for a border wall. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) made the announcement to the media after meeting with Trump for nearly 90 minutes.
	Congress needs to pass a continuing resolution in order to fund the government after Friday. Failure to do so would result in a government shutdown.
What s the story?
	The White House has seemed to change its position several times on whether or not Trump would sign a spending bill without a border wall.

	On March 23, Trump signed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill that included $641 million for a 33-mile stretch of border fence, but not for a wall. At the time, Trump said he was  forced  to sign this bill in order to get funding for the military, and promised he would  never sign a bill like this again. 

	On Nov. 28, Trump told Politico that he was  firm  on getting $5 billion from Congress for the border wall, and that he would be willing to shut down the government over this issue.

	On Tuesday, the White House signaled that it was unwilling to shut down the government over the border wall. Speaking to Fox News, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said,  At the end of the day, we don t want to shut down the government, we want to shut down the border. 

	During that same interview, Sanders said that the Trump administration had identified  a number of different funding sources  through which it could fund the wall without Congress.
This announcement was met with opposition from some GOP leaders in Congress, including members of the Freedom Caucus. On Thursday morning, Trump tweeted that people were focusing too much on the border wall, and that existing measures were already keeping the country safe.
	Later that day, however, Trump tweeted:

        The only GOP congressman representing a border district says Trump s wall is not the answer
     The border is not this homogenous thing The only Republican congressman who represents a border district doesn t believe sealing off the entire border with a physical wall is the right solution it s much more nuanced than that.Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas) told Rolling Stone in an interview published Friday that while illegal immigration is a problem that needs to be addressed, it s not as simple as most Washington politicians are trying to make it.Hurd is a former undercover CIA agent. His district includes 820 miles of border territory, and is larger than 26 entire states. He agrees that a physical wall is useful in some places, but that it would be inefficient to use that same solution across the entire border.The congressman also said that in addition to securing the border, more emphasis needs to be placed on addressing the root causes of illegal immigration from Central America, such as violence and lack of economic opportunity. Mexico deports more Central Americans than we do by almost two-to-one,  Hurd said.  This is a shared problem, so let s address the root causes as well on that. Here are some of his main points from the interview:A physical barrier is only helpful in areas where there is city-to-city contact on both sides of the border. Many areas of the 2,000-mile border have natural physical barriers.We need operational control of the border.To summarize Hurd s ideas for reducing illegal immigration, he suggests using technology such as radar and LiDAR (radar with light instead of sound) to police much of the border, securing urban areas with physical barriers, increase security at ports of entry where most illegal drugs enter the U.S., and administer aid to Central American countries to entice more of their citizens to stay. You do those things, put that together, it s a big package, but it s also what is needed in order to make sure our country is safe,  Hurd said.(H/T The Hill)

        Illegal immigrants fired from Trump National Golf Club during gov t shutdown: report
    Award-winning workers let goAbout a dozen employees at Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y., were fired Jan. 18 after it was learned they are illegal immigrants, according to published reports. Among the employees were those who won awards for their work performance, had the keys to Eric Trump s weekend home and knew to serve President Donald Trump his chicken wings as two orders on one plate, according to the Washington Post. What happened?A Jan. 18 meeting with a human resources rep from Trump headquarters ended it all. An audit found that their immigration documents were fake, the report stated. Unfortunately, this means the club must end its employment relationship with you today,  a Trump executive told the employees in a recorder that one of workers gave to the Post.  I started to cry,  Gabriel Sedano, a former maintenance worker from Mexico, told the news outlet.  I told them they needed to consider us. I had worked almost 15 years for them in this club, and I d given the best of myself to this job. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have managed the president s businesses since he took office. But the Trump organization is now getting rid of employees who were hired by submitting bogus paperwork. The January firings follow the release of undocumented workers at a Trump club in New Jersey last year.  We are making a broad effort to identify any employee who has given false and fraudulent documents to unlawfully gain employment. Where identified, any individual will be terminated immediately,  Eric Trump told the Washington Post in an email. Anibal Romero is representing the workers who were fired from the New York and New Jersey clubs. He told the news outlet that Trump s businesses have had  a pattern and practice of hiring undocumented immigrants, not only in New Jersey, but also in New York.  We are demanding a full and thorough investigation from federal authorities,  Romero said.The president s hard-line stance on immigration and asylum led to a partial government shutdown over an impasse with Congress on his demand for a border wall along Mexico. Trump signed a bill to reopen the government Friday for three weeks so that Congress and the president can resume negotiations on border security.Anything else?Trump also built his 2016 campaign partly on protecting American jobs. On immigration policy,  America First  means protecting the jobs, wages and security of American workers, whether first or 10th generation,  Trump said in 2016.  No matter who you are, we re going to protect your job because, let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we re babies.

According to the California Democrat, it was pure Trump.
	 He said,  That s news! Go tell the press.  So I am,  she added to reporters.

	Pelosi also said she prays Trump will  resist  a government shutdown. During the Oval Office meeting, Trump said he d take responsibility for a shutdown if his border wall isn t funded.
 I told [Trump] about Solomon, King Solomon After the meeting, Pelosi said she spoke about the closed-door portion to reporters, NBC News said.

	 I myself thought we would open the meeting with a prayer, which I did once we privately had the meeting outside the press   if you call that private because there were many people in the room,  she said, according to the network.

	 I told [Trump] about Solomon, King Solomon, when he was to become King of the Jews he prayed to God and said,  How can I ever follow King David, King David, King of the Jews? I need you to give me great understanding and wisdom, Lord,   Pelosi added, NBC News said.  And after he prayed and prayed and prayed, a guy came to him and said,  Solomon, because you did not ask for longevity, great wealth, or vengeance against your enemy, I will give you more wisdom than anyone has ever had   the wisdom of Solomon.  
Anything else?Pelosi has noted before that she prayed for Trump, the network said, after his 2016 election to office and repeated the assertion in 2017.
Speaking of prayer, Pelosi last year met with the Dalai Lama at his temple in Dharmsala, India, and said the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader  prayed for me that I would rid myself of my negative attitude about dwelling on the negative too much. Pelosi has called herself  a devout, practicing Catholic,  yet her staunch pro-choice position on abortion stands in opposition to the church.

        Federal employees  union sues Trump administration over shutdown
    The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) filed suit against the United States Government on Monday, claiming that their member employees should not be forced to work without pay during the current partial government shutdown. The suit was filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims and alleges that the government is violating the Fair Labor Standards Act by not paying some government workers their earned overtime on their regularly scheduled payday. According to the suit,  Employees who are classified as non-exempt from the overtime requirements... were not paid on their Scheduled Payday for work performed after the commencement of the shutdown in excess of the applicable overtime thresholds. The suit seeks to recover  liquidated damages under the FLSA for themselves and all other FLSA non-exempt Excepted Employees in the amount of any overtime payments to which they were entitled on the Scheduled Payday. As a result of the partial shutdown, over 400,000  essential  federal government employees have been working without pay since December 21st of 2018, including border patrol agents. In a statement provided to CNN, AFGE president J. David Cox said,  Our nation s heroes, AFGE members and their families deserve the decency of knowing when their next paycheck is coming and that they will be paid for their work... Our intent is to force the government and the administration to make all federal employees whole. The government has partially shut down three times in the last decade. On each occasion, when the government reopened, Congress passed an appropriation ensuring that  essential  workers who continued to work during the shutdown received all their back pay and overtime. It is highly likely that Congress will do so again when the current shutdown ends, which will likely render the lawsuit moot. Of course, the lawsuit cannot force the shutdown to end, or force the government to be able to predict to employees when Congress will break the current political logjam over funding for President Donald Trump s border wall.

        House Democrats announce plans to end shutdown without wall funding after being sworn in Thursday
    This will go over like a lead balloonHouse Democrats have announced plans to pass a funding bill that will end the shutdown   but will not provide funding for President Donald Trump s border fencing/wall   immediately after being sworn in as the majority party on Thursday. It s unclear what fate will await the Democrats  measure in the Republican-controlled Senate. The government has been partially shut down since Congress was unable to reach a funding deal on December 21st. Republicans and Democrats believed they had reached a deal to fund the government through most of 2019, but plans were scuttled when President Trump prevailed on Republicans in the House to insist on a provision that would provide $5 billion in funding for a border wall with Mexico. Democrats in the Senate promptly threatened to filibuster any funding measure that provided for a border wall, and the two sides have been at an impasse ever since, with no end in sight.  As a result of the November elections, however, Democrats will take over control of the House of Representatives when the new Congress is sworn in on Thursday, and they plan to introduce their own funding measure, according to Politico. According to Politico, House Democrats plan to immediately pass a two-part funding measure; one that would fund the Department of Homeland Security through February 8th, and one that would fund the rest of the government through the end of the current fiscal year. Senate Republicans have not yet commented on the Democrats  plans, but it seems unlikely that the government will re-open unless President Trump changes his public stance in either case. Trump has promised to oppose any plan to re-open the government that does not include funding for his signature campaign progress. Thus, even if both chambers do ultimately pass a funding measure that does not contain wall funding, a presidential veto would keep the government closed, since Trump almost certainly retains enough support in both chambers for his wall plans to sustain a veto, at least for now. Democratic leaders in both chambers, meanwhile, have likewise promised that they are content to allow the government to remain partially shut down forever rather than fund a border wall, which means that unless either side blinks, the government will remain shut down for the foreseeable future. Right now, the political calculus for both sides remains murky. A recent poll conducted by Reuters indicated that President Trump is bearing the brunt of the blame with the public for the shutdown; however, the three most recent government shutdowns appear to have not been major factors in the 2010, 2014, and 2018 elections. Thus, President Trump may well feel emboldened to risk a lengthy shutdown in the hopes that voters will continue to not view a shutdown as catastrophically as the media.

        President Trump: The shutdown will continue until the wall is funded
    No questions asked.During a Christmas call with U.S. troops, President Donald Trump made it clear that there won t be a quick end to the partial shutdown of the government unless Democrats cave on their refusal to fund the border wall that was a signature promise of his campaign. President Trump made the remarks on Tuesday morning in response to a question about when he thought the government would be reopened. In response, Trump said,  I can t tell you when the government is going to be open. I can tell you it s not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they would like to call it. In response to a question from a reporter in the Oval Office, President Trump touted some of the progress that has recently been made on border security, and also explained some of the claims he has made on Twitter in recent days about sections of the wall that are already under construction.  One other thing people don t understand or know... we ve renovated massive amounts of very good wall   wall that was good but was in bad shape.... And in addition to that, and I think very, very importantly, we ve built a lot of new wall. So it s all being built; the new piece, the new section, it s very, very exciting what s going on there, and you ll see it because in January I m going there. ... So, while we re fighting over funding, we re also building, and it s my hope to have this done, or completed   all five hundred to five hundred-fifty miles   to have it either renovated or brand new by election time,  Trump said.Trump also reiterated his claim that he already has sufficient funding to build a wall in the $25 billion that Congress approved for border security during the last round of funding talks, but that  We want the wall money to be increased, because I want to finish it. Negotiations between Republicans and Democrats over the wall funding issue appear to have hit a stalemate since the shutdown. The House passed a bill last week that included the full $5 billion in wall funding requested by the president, but the bill failed in the Senate due to the threat of a Democratic filibuster. President Trump has publicly urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to use the so-called  nuclear option  to end legislative filibusters, but McConnell and his aides have indicated that they do not currently have the required 50 votes in the Senate to activate the drastic measure. Senate Democrats responded Trump s wall demands by offering additional money for border security measures, but have publicly remained steadfast that they will not vote for any bill that includes funding that is earmarked for a wall or physical barrier. Both House Minority Leader (and presumptive incoming Speaker of the House) Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have publicly stated that they would be willing to keep the government shut down forever before approving funding for Trump s signature promise. The stalemate raises the specter of a prolonged, intractable government shutdown that may well drag into 2019 if the parties are not able to reach an agreement.

        What s going on now? Not much of anything. Lawmakers left the Capitol on Friday night with no deal to fund the government and no votes scheduled for the weekend. Some even went back to their home states.So, the government will partially shut down beginning midnight Friday. Most of the government, including the Pentagon, Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services is funded though September. But the shutdown will still impact about 800,000 federal workers who will either be sent home without pay, or will work with uncertainty about when their pay will come.Trump is holding out for border wall funding, while Democrats are insisting that there is no way they will approve the $5.7 billion in funding being requested for the wall. Without Democratic support, a bill funding the border wall can t get enough votes to pass, even though Republicans were able to get a bill through the House.

        President Trump threatens to close border with Mexico as standoff over wall continues
    Government shutdown will likely carry into next year as congressional Democrats refuse to budge
	President Donald Trump threatened Friday to close the U.S. border with Mexico, holding firm on his insistence that congressional Democrats get on board with funding a wall to help stave off illegal immigrants pouring into the country from the south.

	Meanwhile, America s government shutdown   now in Day 7   will likely carry into next week and the new year as Congress refuses to budge in the standoff.
What are the details?
	In a series of tweets, President Trump announced that his administration could be forced to seal America s U.S.-Mexico border if  obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with. 

	He went on to say that he would consider such closure to be a  profit making operation  given how much the U.S. loses in trade with Mexico under NAFTA.

	The president then reiterated his threat to close the border if wall funding isn t secured, and added that his administration would also cut off foreign aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador for taking money from the U.S. while not preventing its citizens from migrating to America in caravans.
What has Congress been up to?The Senate held a pro-forma session Thursday. According to ABC News, no lawmakers showed up during the holiday break, and the office of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) notified members Thursday that there would be no votes this week.

        Communist Vietnamese government enacts strict Internet censorship laws
    Here we go againThe communist government of Vietnamese has enacted a series of Internet censorship laws that will help the government monitor and censor what its citizens view online. The law passed last June and goes into effect today. According to NPR, the law places strict controls on Internet companies that operate in the country. It requires companies like Facebook and Google to open physical offices in Vietnam and to turn over user data to the Vietnamese government upon request. It would also require social media companies like Facebook and Twitter to remove comment deemed offensive by the government authorities. The Vietnamese government claims that the law is necessary to provide cybersecurity for Vietnamese citizens, but the law s opponents point out that it actually does very little to provide cybersecurity, and quite a lot to allow the communist government to oppress its citizens  free expression. Facebook, Google, and other companies have vociferously protested the law through the Asia Internet Coalition, their joint lobbying group in the region. The Vietnamese government has not yet published guidance on how the law will be implemented, and the tech giants are currently weighing the extent to which they will comply. The Vietnamese government has claimed that Google is taking steps to open an office in Vietnam in compliance with the law, but Google has not yet confirmed this claim. Google has already faced severe criticism in Western nations for agreeing to create a censored version of their signature search engine at the behest of the Chinese government. The new Vietnamese law presents perhaps the biggest challenge for tech companies who are facing a bevy of legislation from governments who are increasingly wary of the power large Internet companies possess. Regulators in the United States and European Union have scrutinized Facebook and Google for their handling of users  personal data, and European countries in particular have asked social media companies to help crack down on  hate speech.

        China warns government departments to clean up social media accounts
    The State Council issued stricter guidelines in an effort to attract younger people The State Council of the People s Republic of China has warned government departments to clean up its social media accounts in an effort to boost its image to attract younger people.

	Officials issued stricter social media guidelines late Thursday, Reuters reported. The State Council said more regulation was needed for authorities  profiles, and it pledged to get rid of dormant accounts and  shocking  comments on official channels.

	 This has a negative impact on the image and the public trust in the government,  the cabinet said on its website.

	Some government agencies have large followings. For instance, the Communist Party s Youth League  has 7.7 million followers on Weibo.
What s the story?
	The new rules come amid the government s push to reach younger generations who get most of their information on popular platforms such as Weibo, WeChat, and a news aggregator called Toutiao.The move also is in line with the Communist leadership s ongoing attempt to control the sharing of information with the public, especially financial news and posts from bloggers and livestreamers, Reuters noted.Facebook, Twitter, and other global social media platforms are banned in China.
	Government accounts  cannot express any personal emotions or opinions, and normally should only repost information from government websites or from sources recognized by the government,  the State Council said.

	Paying for fake followers and fabricating social media data are also disallowed.

	Earlier this year, the Yueyang municipal government s official Weibo account called an internet user an  environment protection b***h  when it shared a post that concerned a waste incineration plant. It later issued an apology, according to Reuters.
What else?
	The State Council has also tightened its regulations on financial news and other information provided to the public.

        Nancy Pelosi insulted Trump s  manhood  after bitter debate over gov t shutdown
    He s not gonna like that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was so angry after a contentious meeting with President Donald Trump over funding of the border wall that she insulted his manhood. In the angry confrontation, Pelosi and Trump quarreled over whether a bill funding the border wall would pass the House of Representatives, and the president grew tired of arguing and finally said he would take responsibility for any government shutdown. Pelosi reportedly insulted the president immediately afterward during a meeting of the Steering and Policy Committee.  It s like a manhood thing for him,  Pelosi said.  As if manhood could ever be associated with him,  she added.  This wall thing. According to Julie Davis, the congressional correspondent for the New York Times, Pelosi  crowed  about forcing the president to  fully own  any future shutdown of the government.Pelosi also compared Trump to a skunk, according to CNN s Manu Raju.   It was so wild,  she told her colleagues.  It goes to show you: you get into a tickle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you. Raju reported that Pelosi told Democrats that at the end of the meeting, Trump said,  We can go two routes with this meeting: with a knife or a candy.   Exactly,  Pelosi told them she said. Many Democrats and liberals praised the once and likely future House Speaker for what they saw as standing up to the president. His allies and supporters decried the incivility of her statements. Here s CNN s report on Pelosi s insults to the president: That is a pretty nasty thing to say, let s just say that,  said CNN s Erin Burnett about Pelosi s insult,  and it s gonna make President Trump mad.

        Trump forgoes Florida Christmas trip, stays at White House amid government shutdown
    Melania and Barron on their way back to Washington
	President Donald Trump is forgoing a trip to south Florida for Christmas as the government remains partially shutdown due to a budget stalemate, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Saturday.

	 Due to the shutdown, President Trump will remain  in Washington, D.C. and the First Lady will return from Florida so they can spend Christmas together,  Sanders said.
Trump s wife, Melania, and his son, Barron, already left for the  Winter White House  on Friday. 
	The Senate adjourned Saturday without a plan to reopen the government, but plans to reconvene on Dec. 27.

	Politico reported that it obtained a White House staff email that said the president could leave at noon on Saturday, which would have been a day earlier than planned. The plan was scrapped when it became clear that the government was not fully reopening. I am in the White House, working hard,  Trump tweeted Saturday. ...We are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed Border Security (Gangs, Drugs, Human Trafficking & more) but it could be a long stay,  he added.Some media outlets criticized Trump for continuing his plans to travel to his luxury resort while the government furloughed hundreds of thousands of workers and stopped some federal services just ahead of the holidays.
	At issue is Trump s demand for $5 billion to fund the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats have said they instead want to spend $1.6 billion on drones, sensors, and other security measures. If Trump agrees to that plan, it would mark a sharp reversal of his insistence on the wall.

	White House aides reportedly took notice of how it would appear should Trump continue his travel plans amid the shutdown.

	 Maybe he thinks if the government shuts down, he can golf more comfortably,  House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday.
What is the impact?
	The partial shutdown will cause more than 800,000 federal workers to face furloughs or to work without pay. The shutdown also impacts funding for the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Interior, Treasury, Agriculture, State and Justice, along with national parks and forests.

	Funding was already approved for the Defense Department, Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, according to published reports. Those areas are expected to continue operating as usual.

        Schumer tells Trump to  abandon  border wall plan amid government shutdown
    Dems want to use drones, other tech instead
	Senate Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) ordered President Donald Trump to  abandon the wall  Saturday, saying the president does not have the Senate votes required to fund it. His comments came hours after a partial government shutdown over a funding impasse on Trump s 2016 campaign promise to build a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Could it pass in the Senate?
	 It will never pass the Senate, not today, not next week, not next year,  Schumer said from the Senate floor.  So President Trump, if you want to open the government, you must abandon the wall, plain and simple. 

	A partial shutdown of the government began at midnight Saturday after the House and Senate adjourned without a funding agreement. The shutdown could last a few days, both sides of the issue 
	told Fox News. The Senate adjourned Saturday and is scheduled to meet again on Thursday.

	Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday:  I won an election, said to be one of the greatest of all time, based on getting out of endless & costly foreign wars & also based on Strong Borders which will keep our Country safe. We fight for the borders of other countries, but we won t fight for the borders of our own! 

	The president also wrote that the border crisis is real and will not end without a wall or  steel barrier. 
Vice President Mike Pence and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney met at the Capitol on Saturday with Schumer in hopes of continuing negotiations that would end the stalemate, according to the report.
	Productive discussions are ongoing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told the news outlet.

	 When those negotiations produce a solution that is acceptable to all parties   which means 60 votes in the Senate, a majority in the House, and a presidential signature   at that point, we will take it up here on the Senate floor,  he said.

	A Schumer spokesman indicated that  the vice president came in for a discussion and made an offer. Unfortunately, we re still very far apart. 

	The stalemate centers on was funding for Trump s signature 2016 campaign promise for a border wall to curb illegal immigration. The president wants $5.7 billion for the project. A bill that would fund it passed the House on Friday. Sixty votes are required in the Senate, which means Democratic votes are needed in addition to support from the GOP.
What else is proposed?
	Schumer called Trump s plan a  bone to the hard right.  Democrats are instead proposing $1.3 billion for  border security. 

	 I ve heard the president and his allies in the media say that Democrats don t support border security,  he said.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Democrats have always been for smart and effective ways to secure our border. We are pushing for technology, like drones and sensors, and inspection equipment.

        Republican border negotiator says  next to nil  chance of another shutdown
    Current government funding runs out on Feb. 15
	A member of the bipartisan committee tasked with reaching a border security deal said that the chances of another government shutdown in February are  nil, or next to nil. 
What s the story?
	After the government had been shut down for 35 days, President Donald Trump announced a plan on Jan. 25 to fund the government for three weeks while a more permanent spending bill was being created. This plan passed both houses of Congress and was signed by Trump the same day.

	On Feb. 15, those three weeks run out, and so far Congress has not put forward a bill to fund the government that both parties can agree to. Trump has said that he won t sign a bill that doesn t include $5.7 billion for a barrier along the southern border. Democrats have indicated that they won t vote for any bill that includes this provision.
What did the committee member say?
	Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.) sits on the bipartisan conference committee that s working on solving this border security impasse. In two separate interviews on Friday morning, he seemed optimistic that an acceptable compromise could be reached by the Feb. 15 deadline.

	 In this situation there is no appetite on either side of the aisle and I think in either chamber for another partial government shutdown,  Fleischman said during 
	an interview on Fox and Friends. He said that the chances of another shutdown happening when the current short-term funding bill ran out were  nil, or next to nil. 

	Fleischman repeated this sentiment during an interview with 
	Bloomberg News the same morning, saying that the chances of a shutdown were  next to nil  and that there was  no appetite in the room on either side, in either body  for a shutdown.

	Fleischmann told Bloomberg that the committee was  working toward a grand compromise.  He added that this  is not going to be a deal that everybody gets what they want. But I think we re gonna see wall funding, new wall border funding, and other things that are very important to keep the American people safe. So I think we re gonna see a deal made, a deal struck, the government kept open, we are making progress. So I m very pleased. I ve been pleased from the inception, I m pleased right now.

BLAZE,https://www.theblaze.com/news/lisa-murkowski-shutdown-mcconnell-trump,"
        Analysis: Ignore Lisa Murkowski. There s only one senator you need to watch in the shutdown fight.
    And he ain t budgingMedia outlets were abuzz last night with the news that Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) had called for the partial government shutdown to end, wall or no wall. By this morning, the rumor mill had begun to speculate that Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) were also grumbling behind the scenes about wanting the shutdown to end, regardless of whether the funding package includes money for the border wall or not. This is all public posturing for votes and should be ignored. Some senators in blue or purple states will feel the need to leak to the media that they are not on board with the shutdown for political purposes. However, only one senator s voice really matters in this fight: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). See, McConnell knows that Trump has willingly become the face of this particular shutdown. Recent polling shows that voters   to the extent they care   split the blame for the current shutdown between President Donald Trump and the Democrats in Congress. Right now, Republicans in the Senate are taking almost none of the public blame, which allows McConnell to wait this out more or less indefinitely. A recent Politico poll, for example, showed Trump taking 47 percent of the blame for the shutdown, compared to 33 percent for congressional Democrats. Congressional Republicans are taking only 5 percent of the current public pressure. McConnell knows two things: 1) The shutdown is broadly unpopular (although probably not an election game-changer, based on past experience), and 2) any senator who votes to override a Trump veto will face a brutal blowback from Trump s supporters. In other words, as long as President Trump insists on the wall funding, there is no vote a Republican senator can cast that won t cost them politically. But that s OK, because McConnell has a simple fix for this problem: He simply won t schedule one. There is no reason for McConnell to put members of his caucus on record with a vote that places them between the Scylla of Trump s base and the Charybdis of moderate general election voters, so he won t. As long as Trump maintains his public position, expect McConnell to just remain hunkered down, not doing much of anything and definitely not scheduling a vote. In order to override a Trump veto, Democrats would have to pick off 20 Republican senators, which appears nowhere near close to happening, and convince McConnell to allow the floor vote in the first place, which he probably won t do until more than half the caucus wants one. And that seems like an extremely unlikely result in the current political climate; Republican senators have learned, after all, that they cross Trump and his rabid voter base at their peril. Unless and until the list of public defectors reaches 20, the chances of a Senate vote happening remain close to zero, and thus the public posturing of Murkowski et al should be ignored as the backside-covering gestures that they are.

        Breaking: Trump announces plan to reopen government for three weeks
    This deal, which does not include funding for a border wall, would still have to be approved by CongressPresident Donald Trump has announced a plan to reopen the government for three weeks until Feb. 15. This is a temporary measure, and if a shutdown agreement is not reached by the end of this deadline, the shutdown will presumably restart. The bill still has to be approved by both houses of Congress.How long has the government been shut down?The partial government shutdown has now been going on for 35 days. President Donald Trump has said that he will not sign any bill to fund the federal government that does not include $5.7 billion in funding for a wall on the border between the U.S and Mexico. Democrats in Congress have so far been unwilling to agree to any bill that contains funding for a border wall.Roughly 800,000 federal workers have had their paychecks frozen until the shutdown ends. These include air traffic controllers, TSA agents, and border patrol agents. On Thursday, the Senate voted down to separate bills, one from each political party, that would have ended the shutdown.What happened today?On Friday, Trump announced during a news conference at the Rose Garden a plan to reopen the government temporarily until Feb. 15.The temporary funding measure would include back pay for furloughed workers. It would not include funding for a border wall, which Trump said he hoped would be included in any long-term funding plan.Trump said in his news conference that he had an  alternative  to a deal, but had  decided not to use it at this time,  referring to an emergency order that he had considered declaring if a deal could not be reached. Over the next 21 days,  Trump said,  I expect Democrats and Republicans to act in good faith...If we make a fair deal, the American people will be proud of our government, for proving that we can put country above party. He said that the wall  should not be controversial.  Trump told reporters that the  walls we are building are not medieval walls. They are smart walls  that are  operationally effective  and equipped with technology. He added that he never proposed or wanted a concrete wall  from sea to shining sea  because natural barriers were already in place. The steel wall he said would be in  specific, high risk locations  identified by Customs and Border Protection.He warned that, without funding from Congress, the government would be forced to release illegal immigrants currently in custody into the U.S. population.Trump wrapped up the news conference by saying that if a deal wasn t reached by Feb. 15, either the government would shut down again or he would use his power to declare an emergency to get the wall built.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortex (D-N.Y.), who objected to the bill s continued funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This legislation ultimately failed in the Senate by a vote of 52-44.Both bills were expected to fail in the Senate.  I think it certainly puts everybody on record, and if nothing else I would hope at least that this would get the conversation going again,  Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said, according to Politico. What comes next?It s back to the drawing board for both sides.Democrats in the House of Representatives are working on another funding bill that would include $5 billion for border security, but with the stipulation that this security not include a wall. Even if this bill passes the Senate, President Donald Trump is unlikely to sign it.The government has been partially shutdown now for 34 days. Trump has said that he will not sign any bill to fund the federal government that does not include $5.7 billion in funding for a wall on the border between the U.S and Mexico. Democrats in Congress have so far been unwilling to agree to any bill that contains funding for a border wall.During a news conference on Jan. 4, Trump said he would be willing to keep the government shutdown for months or years, although he said he hoped it wouldn t  go on even beyond a few more days.

        Is Paul Ryan to blame for gov t shutdown? Trump says former GOP leader  screwed him 
    Paul held a GOP majority in the House until just last year
	President Donald Trump was forced to concede last week: He signed a stop-gap bill to temporarily fund the government for three weeks, ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.

	Unfortunately, another shutdown could be on the horizon. Lawmakers are expected to hit the ground running this week to ensure it will not happen again. However, Trump will likely not concede again   he wants funding for a border wall and has signaled he is willing to hold out for an extended period of time to get the financing.

	But if it had not been for former House Speaker Paul Ryan s seemingly weak leadership in the waning months of his congressional tenure, border wall funding may have long been secured. At least that s what Trump reportedly voiced last week during a roundtable at the White House.
What did Trump say?
	Trump said Ryan  screwed him  by not securing funding for border security   and specifically, the wall   while Republicans still controlled a majority in the House, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told the Washington Post.

	More from the Post:
The Post s story detailed Trump s capitulation and the internal dialogue that happened prior to Trump publicly announcing the deal to re-open the government.However, at the Wednesday meeting, Trump promised  there would be no caving  to Democrats   the government would remain shut down until border wall funding was secured. Everybody who spoke up applauded him for not caving, but warned him that any further movement toward the Democrats  direction would be a problem,  Krikorian said.By Friday, Trump conceded, announcing a plan to re-open the government. Many viewed the deal as a severe political blow to Trump s agenda.

        Trump says Pelosi was  actually reasonable,  so he agreed to delay SOTU until after shutdown
    Didn t expect to hear that from himAfter weeks of escalating tensions between President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over the border wall and government shutdown, Trump offered a rare positive word about Pelosi when explaining why he ultimately decided to delay the State of the Union address, according to The Hill. It s really her choice,  Trump said of the decision Thursday.  I would have done it in a different location but I think that would be very disrespectful to the State of the Union to pick some other place. What she said, I thought, was actually reasonable. We ll have the State of the Union when the shutdown s over,  Trump concluded.How did we get here?On Jan. 3, Pelosi invited Trump to deliver the State of the Union at the House. The shutdown had already started at the time of that invitation. Trump accepted that invitation.On Jan. 16, Pelosi sent another letter to Trump citing security concerns stemming from the shutdown and requesting that Trump delay the speech until the government reopened.On Jan. 23, Trump wrote Pelosi dismissing those security concerns, saying the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security assured him there would be no security issues.  I look forward to seeing you on the evening of January 29th in the Chamber of the House of Representatives,  Trump wrote.Later that day, Pelosi replied saying she would not allow the speech to be held at the House until the government was reopened. At that point, Trump reportedly began considering alternative locations for the speech.Wednesday night, Trump admitted that it was  her prerogative  to delay the speech, and agreed to do it when the shutdown ends. I am not looking for an alternative venue for the SOTU address because there is no venue that can compete with the history, tradition and importance of the House Chamber,  Trump wrote on Twitter.So when will we get the speech?Nobody knows. Congress is still gridlocked over how to proceed to fund border security or open the government. Maybe we should just go back to having a written State of the Union sent to Congress.

        WATCH: College students blame Trump for shutdown. But their tune changes after learning crucial fact.
     It is pretty surprising 
	While the partial government shutdown was in effect, Campus Reform s Cabot Phillips visited George Mason University in northern Virginia to get impressions from students.Not surprisingly, most of the students who took part in the video interview blamed President Donald Trump for the shutdown, which at that point was the longest in American history.
        Image source: YouTube screenshotThen Phillips added a twist.Likely banking on students not knowing that Trump already offered Democrats a deal to end the shutdown   which included extended protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, $800 million in humanitarian aid, and more border agents and immigration judges   Phillips posed that very scenario, asking students if Democrats should  compromise on their end  if Trump were to make the latter concessions.They answered with a resounding yes. OopsPhillips then informed students that Trump did make that very offer with those very concessions. And wouldn t you know Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected it?Upon learning this crucial fact, the surprised students were then singing a different tune   and agreed Democrats should come to the negotiating table with Trump rather than letting the shutdown continue. It was the wrong move for [Pelosi] to turn it down,  one student said.Check out the clip:

        Lindsey Graham urges Trump to reopen the government   here s why
    Says Trump should reopen it at least three weeksRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) said Sunday that he backs the temporary opening of the government, now in day 23 of a partial shutdown.Why is that a good move?The South Carolina senator told  Fox News Sunday  that President Donald Trump should reopen the government so negotiations can resume on a $5.7 billion wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Graham told host Chris Wallace he hopes Trump will consider one more attempt to negotiate a deal to fund the project.  Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we are almost there, I would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug (to) see if we can get a deal,  said Graham, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee.If no agreement is reached, then the president should move to declare a national emergency, Graham said on the news program. Other Republicans have said they are not in favor of an emergency declaration to build the wall. Graham also said he does not believe it s likely an agreement can be reached.  Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House, said even if he opened up the government, I ll give you one dollar for the wall,  Graham said.  As long as that s the case, we re never going to get a legislative package, no matter what the Senate does. Democrats have rejected Trump s plan for a $5.7 billion border wall project. They have also refused to resume talks until the government is reopened. The partial shutdown began Dec. 22.Graham said Trump told him, he wants to first make a deal, then open up the government. The president has blamed Democrats for the stalemate.Anything else? I m in the White House, waiting,  Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday.  The Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people await their pay. They are having fun and not even talking!  Under the shutdown, 800,000 federal employees are furloughed and government services have been cut across the nation. Some employees, such as air traffic controllers and government airport security workers, are working without pay.  The shutdown is real,  Jennifer Lawless, a politics professor at the University of Virginia, told Reuters.  The wall is hypothetical. And at some point soon, the Republicans are going to remember that it s real people in their districts who aren t getting paid, real people who aren t able to access government services, and real people who vote.

         We are going to have fatalities  among veterans if shutdown continues, union leader says
    About one-third of the federal workforce consists of veteransVeterans groups say the continuing government shutdown will have a disproportionate negative impact on veterans the longer it goes on, potentially leading to deaths, according to ABC News.The federal government has been shut down for nearly three weeks, and federal workers will soon begin missing paychecks. That financial hardship can be particularly dangerous for veterans. Financial instability is one of the main causes of suicides among the veterans  community,  a statement from the Union Veterans Council read.  These hardworking men and women who sacrificed so much for their country should not have their families held hostage by lawmakers that cannot relate to living paycheck to paycheck. Significant number of veterans impacted: Veterans make up one-third of the federal workforce, and the veteran population can be more susceptible to suicide. One union leader thinks the government shutdown could lead directly to veteran deaths, calling it  shameful  and said it was  slapping every veteran in the face who has served their country.  If this shutdown does not stop, we are going to have fatalities,  said Edward Canales, a local union president with the American Federation of Government Employees.  We re going to have suicides. Federal employees increasingly upset: The government shutdown over whether or not to fund a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border has left some federal employees, including veterans, feeling used and mistreated for political purposes. It s not acceptable as a veteran, as a federal employee, as an air traffic controller to use my profession and my livelihood as a political football,  Air Force veteran Toby Hauck told ABC News.How to get help: Between 2008 and 2016, more than 6,000 veterans committed suicide each year, with veteran adults 1.5 times more likely to commit suicide than non-veteran adults.Veterans who are struggling with a crisis, or those who know a veteran in crisis, can contact the Veterans Crisis Line by calling 1-800-273-8255 or by sending a text message to 838255.

        TSA agents calling in sick by the hundreds at airports across the country during shutdown
    TSA workers are essential employees who are required to continue working without a paycheckTransportation Security Administration agents are calling in sick by the hundreds at several major airports across the country, according to agency and union officials, CNN reported. Call-outs have increased by as much as 300 percent at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, according to the report. Typically, about 25 to 30 employees call out on an average shift. TSA agents are considered essential federal employees and must continue reporting to work despite not being paid during the partial government shutdown that began Dec. 22. There are about 55,000 TSA employees among the 420,000 federal workers required to stay on the job through the shutdown. This will definitely affect the flying public who we [are] sworn to protect,  Hydrick Thomas, president of the national TSA employee union, told CNN. Workers who worked the week before the shutdown are expected to receive a partial paycheck this week. What about security lines?So far, security line wait times haven t been affected, a DFW spokeswoman told KTVT-TV. But some believe that could soon change. This problem of call-outs is really going to explode over the next week or two when employees miss their first paycheck,  a union official at DFW told CNN.  TSA officers are telling the union they will find another way to make money. That means calling out to work other jobs. Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham airports in North Carolina have seen about a 10 percent jump in TSA call-outs, local union president Mac Johnson told CNN. That number will get worse as this drags on,  Johnson said.But in Chicago, the number of sick calls was normal Monday at Midway and O Hare airports, union leaders told WBBM-TV. Union officials have stressed that the call-outs aren t part of an organized effort but they expect the numbers to rise if the shutdown lingers on. There are also fears that new agents may quit their jobs since they aren t receiving a paycheck. What else?The union for federal employees will rally Thursday asking Congress to end the shutdown.  Get them to do what the American people want and reopen the government and stop the damage to the American people,  Jeanne Schulze of the American Federation of Government Employees told KTVT of the upcoming rally.Federal agencies have encouraged affected workers to apply for unemployment or ask landlords and creditors to work with them during the shutdown.

        Hundreds of TSA officers aren t showing up for work because of the gov t shutdown
     This will definitely affect the flying public Transportation Security Administration officers are calling out from work in higher numbers as the government shutdown continues and forces them to work without pay, according to CNN.A federal worker pay period ended Friday, meaning workers could begin missing paychecks if the shutdown continues. They were paid last week and would normally get paid again on Jan. 11.How many? Different airports have seen varying levels of increased absences. TSA employee union president Hydrick Thomas said as many as 170 employees have called out each day this week at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. A Texas TSA official said call outs have increased by 200-300 percent at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. North Carolina TSA union president Mac Johnson said Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham airports have seen 10 percent more call outs, and also said the absences are  creating a vulnerability. Why are they calling out? Some federal officials told CNN the absences were in protest of delayed paychecks. Others have said some TSA employees can t go to work because they can t afford childcare during the shutdown, or they ve had to find temporary non-government jobs to pay the bills. The problem of call outs is really going to explode over the next week or two when employees miss their first paycheck,  a DFW union official told CNN.  TSA officers are telling the union they will find another way to make money. That means calling out to work other jobs. What s the impact? TSA spokesman Michael Bilello said the absences have not yet caused a significant disruption in TSA s ability to perform security functions. Call outs began over the holiday period and have increased, but are causing minimal impact given there are 51,739 employees supporting the screening process,  Bilello said in a statement.  Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change. Bilello said additional absences in coming days and weeks could result in longer lines as some airports may have to close some TSA lanes.Thomas said he thinks the shutdown and resulting absences will impact travelers. This will definitely affect the flying public who we are sworn to protect,  Thomas said.

        Breaking: House Democrats vote to end gov t shutdown   and send Trump an ultimatum
    No end in sight to the standoff Democrats voted to end the government shutdown on Thursday after seizing control the U.S. House of Representatives, but they thumbed their nose at a threat from President Donald Trump over his promised border wall. Newly elected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) made it clear that they would not vote for border wall funding, and the bill to reopen government did not have one dollar for Trump s promise from the 2016 campaign. Trump had threatened to veto any legislation unless it had funding for his border wall   he is demanding at least $5 billion for his immigration security project. The bill passed 239-192, with five Republicans voting with Democrats to stop the partial government shutdown. The shutdown is in its 13th day. While the president and many of his allies have tried to pin the blame of the government shutdown on the Democrats, his opponents continue to publicize video where Trump said directly to Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) that he would take the blame for the shutdown. Pelosi laughed when she was asked if there was any way where she could see funding one dollar for the border wall.  A dollar?  she responded.  A dollar. One dollar, yeah, one dollar. The president blamed the political motivations of the Democrats in a tweet Thursday.  The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election,  he said.   The Democrats know they can t win based on all of the achievements of  Trump,  so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security - and Presidential Harassment,  he added.  For them, strictly politics! Here s the latest on the government shutdown:

        Don t expect your tax refund anytime soon if the government remains shut down
    You might have to wait on those plans to catch up on mortgage payments
	As tax season looms closer, Americans shouldn t expect to receive their tax returns if the government is still shut down when they file.
What? Seriously? 
	Indeed.

	While President Donald Trump and Democratic congressional leaders fight out common ground on a spending bill, Americans might end up waiting on their annual tax returns.

	The partial government shutdown, which is in its 14th day, will delay payouts of any refunds if the government is still shut down at the time of filing and processing.

	The Internal Revenue Service is just one among many federal entities impacted by the partial government shutdown.

	According to CNN,  The IRS is currently working under non-filing season shutdown plans, and will be updating it ahead of the upcoming tax season as soon as Friday. 

	A 2017 law stipulates that the IRS typically does not audit, issue refunds, or otherwise work with taxpayers outside of the standard filing season   which includes the time period during a government shutdown.

	Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the Tax Foundation, told CNN,  To the extent that individuals are relying on the refund, any delay is going to be a negative. 

	Clearly.
 This filing season was always going to be challenging,  Pomerleau added.  The IRS was still figuring that out. Individuals were still figuring that out even with the full funding. 

	At the time of this writing, the IRS has yet to announce when individuals and businesses will be able to submit their income tax returns.
Anything else? 
	If you re sad about the possibility of not getting what could be a much-needed refund sooner than later, don t worry: if it makes you feel any better, senior Trump administration officials are reportedly on track to receive raises of at least $10,000.

	On Friday, The Washington Post reported that  hundreds of senior Trump  appointees will receive said annual raises. These raises are set to go into effect beginning Saturday.The Washington Post calls the raises an  unintended consequence of the shutdown  in that when lawmakers failed to pass spending bills on Dec. 21, the existing pay freeze lapsed. The White House has yet to offer comment on the matter at the time of this writing. The raises are expected to cost taxpayers about $300 million over a period of 10 years. Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.)   who is also new chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee   is especially troubled by this news.  At a time when more than 800,000 federal employees aren t getting paid, it is absolutely outrageous that the Trump administration would even consider taking advantage of the shutdown to dole out huge raises to the vice president and its political appointees,  Lowey told the outlet in an email. J. David Cox Sr., national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told the outlet that all federal employees deserve a raise.  It is wonderful that the president has decided to lift the pay freeze for top executives and his political appointees: They deserve a pay adjustment, as do all the people who work under them,  Cox said.  Leadership is about the principle that  officers eat last.  The administration should make sure that the rank and file receive a pay adjustment before their bosses do. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) said that Trump would be well advised to issue an executive order stopping the raises.  It looks like Trump has protected his own appointees, and everyone else gets screwed,  Beyer sniped.

        Meeting between Trump and Democrats on gov t shutdown just ended explosively   here s what happened
    The blame game continued into media briefings afterwardAccording to the participants of a meeting between the president and Democratic leaders on Wednesday, the meeting ended prematurely with a walk-out, but they agree on little else that happened. President Donald Trump tweeted about the incident shortly after the event was reported and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) spoke to reporters with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).  Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time,  the president tweeted.  I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up,  he continued,  are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO.   I said bye-bye, nothing else works!  he concluded. According to Democrats, the meeting ended much more explosively.  Again, we saw a temper tantrum, because he couldn t get his way and he just walked out of he meeting,  said Schumer to reporters. Schumer said the president told them he would not re-open the government because Democrats wouldn t do what he said. He called the president  cruel, callous,  and accused the president of using millions of people as pawns.  And then a few minutes later,  said Schumer,  he sort of slammed the table, and when leader Pelosi said she didn t agree with the wall, he just walked out and said we have nothing to discuss. Both agreed that Trump called the meeting a  waste of time  and that he got up and left abruptly. House Minority Leader Mike McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that it was Schumer, not Trump, who raised his voice, and that the president addressed him in a very respectful tone. He called the Democrats  behavior  disturbing  and  embarrassing.  I want to solve this problem,  said McCarthy.  People are hurting. So I tell the Democrats: get back into the room.  I think the president made his position very clear today that there will be no deal without a wall,  said Vice President Mike Pence about the meeting.  There will be no deal without the priorities the president has put on the table. Democrats agreed the president also said  bye bye  as he walked out on the meeting. The partial government shutdown is into its third week, with both sides blaming the other, but so far federal employees have not missed out on a paycheck yet   that will occur for the first time on Friday.
