The most notable part of this report is what s not in it,  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said, noting that the FBI didn t interview Kavanaugh or Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing him of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school. It looks to be the product of an incomplete investigation that was limited, perhaps by the White House, I don t know,  she added, accusing the Trump administration of blocking the FBI from doing its job.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) echoed her disappointment in the scope of the investigation and lamented the decision to keep the report private. Why shouldn t America see all the facts?  he asked. The White House produced just one copy of the FBI s findings, and Republicans and Democrats had to take turns looking at it in a secure room at the Capitol. The fact that there s only one document in there for 100 senators is another example of constraining the ability of all senators and the American public to see the whole truth and nothing but,  Schumer said.A number of Democrats expressed their anger on Twitter, calling the investigation  inadequate,   stunted,  and  incomplete. This FBI report is blatantly incomplete & inadequate straitjacketed by the White House. In a word, a cover-up.Why not do a real investigation? Why limit Senate access to the report? Why limit public access to it?There can only be one of two answers: the Republican majority doesn t care about allegations of sexual assault, or they re worried of what a true investigation would uncover.White House officials defended the probe as thorough, despite reportedly ordering restrictions on its scope and having agents interview a limited number of people. A number of former classmates and acquaintances who knew Kavanaugh at the time of the allegations have said that they contacted the FBI directly, but officials never followed up with them.The White House sent out a statement around 2:30 a.m. Eastern time, saying it had sent the FBI s report to the Senate, calling the process the  most comprehensive review of a Supreme Court nominee in history.  The White House has received the Federal Bureau of Investigation s supplemental background investigation into Judge Kavanaugh, and it is being transmitted to the Senate,  deputy press secretary Raj Shah wrote on Twitter.  With this additional information, the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. .@WhiteHouse statement on @FBI supplemental background investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaugh:  The White House has received the Federal Bureau of Investigation s supplemental background investigation into Judge Kavanaugh, and it is being transmitted to the Senate. (1/3)Asked about Republicans affirming that the FBI report provides no new evidence corroborating Kavanaugh s accusers, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said firmly:  I do not agree with that statement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) scheduled a vote to move forward with Kavanaugh s nomination Wednesday, before any senators had seen the report.McConnell filed for cloture late Wednesday, a procedural step that, if passed by the Senate on Friday, will allow the full chamber to vote on Kavanaugh s nomination the following day.Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) lambasted the idea that there was enough time for all 100 senators to review the FBI report before a cloture vote. They re letting senators come in one at a time and trying to force a vote by Saturday,  said Kaine, Hillary Clinton s 2016 running mate.  There s not 100 hours between now and Saturday. McConnell said earlier this week that the full report would not be made public, despite assertions from both parties that he should do so. There will be plenty of time for members to review and be briefed on the supplemental material before a Friday cloture vote,  McConnell said late Wednesday after filing for cloture.Kavanaugh has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct during his years in high school and college, and denied the allegations before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a fiery hearing last week. Ford also shared her own emotional testimony, which led to the FBI s probe.Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was the first lawmaker to note the timing of McConnell s cloture filing in a message on Twitter, saying that the clock is now running on Kavanaugh s confirmation. Senate rules mandate a brisk time frame once the chamber votes on cloture, and if it passes, senators will have just 30 hours to debate the nomination before it moves on to a final vote.Mitch McConnell just filed cloture (which starts the clock on the confirmation vote) and we haven t  (as of now) even seen the FBI report yet.Five senators are still undecided on Kavanaugh s nomination, and it s unclear if a vote would pass due to Republicans  slim 51-49 majority. GOP Sens. Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Maine) have all expressed misgivings about the nomination, and two Democrats up for re-election in red states, Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), have not yet said how they plan to vote.McConnell has plowed forward regardless, saying he would  not be intimidated  in his effort to see Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court. There is no chance in the world that they re going to scare us out of doing our duty,  the majority leader said during a floor speech Wednesday.Marina Fang and Antonia Blumberg contributed reporting.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

With this additional information, the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,  deputy press secretary Raj Shah said on Twitter. Hours earlier, NBC News reported that more than 40 people  with potential information into the sexual misconduct allegations  against Kavanaugh, including multiple high school and college classmates of the judge, had tried to contact the FBI to no avail.Attorney Alan Abramson told the outlet that he d reached out to the bureau on behalf of his client, who he described as a friend of Deborah Ramirez, the Yale classmate of Kavanaugh s who has accused the judge of thrusting his penis in her face at a college party.Abramson said Ramirez had told his client in the early  90s  about an incident that happened during Ms. Ramirez  freshman year at Yale.  He said his client was willing to provide this  pertinent information  to the FBI   but said he had not heard back from the bureau.On Thursday, HuffPost guest writer William Scheuerman wrote that he lived in the same residential hall at Yale as Kavanaugh, and that he d called the FBI to suggest a list of people they should contact. The FBI didn t get in touch with him, Scheuerman said, or with the other friends and neighbors who tried to contact the bureau.Kenneth Appold, a professor at Princeton Theological Seminary who d been a suitemate of Kavanaugh s when the alleged incident with Ramirez occurred, told The New Yorker that he d also not been contacted by investigators despite having reached out to the FBI and submitting a statement through the bureau s website. Appold said he had not been present at the party where the alleged incident had taken place, but said an eyewitness told him about it soon after it occurred. I can corroborate Debbie s account,  Appold told the magazine.  I believe her, because it matches the same story I heard 35 years ago, although the two of us have never talked. According to The New Yorker, several other former Yale classmates of Kavanaugh s said they d reached out to the FBI about the judge  but had not received a response.  Two high school acquaintances of Kavanaugh s said they d submitted sworn declarations to the FBI but had not been contacted by the bureau. Several former classmates of Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump s Supreme Court nominee, tried to share their stories with the F.B.I. as it investigated sexual-assault allegations against him. https://t.co/Mli3bLcVroAlso on Wednesday, CNN published several more examples of former Yale classmates of Kavanaugh s whose attempts to contact the FBI with information had amounted to naught. The outlet noted that none of these individuals claim to be direct witnesses of the alleged incident with Ramirez.Liz Swisher, a former classmate of Kavanaugh s who had ... questioned Kavanaugh s truthfulness about his drinking at Yale in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN she had not been contacted by the FBI. Chad Ludington, another former classmate who said he often drank with Kavanaugh during their early years at Yale, also filled out a form, but had not been contacted back by the FBI as of Wednesday afternoon. [...] Mark Krasberg, an assistant professor of neurosurgery at the University of New Mexico who was also a classmate of Kavanaugh s and Ramirez s without direct knowledge of the alleged incident, had also not heard back from the FBI despite numerous attempts to reach out to lawmakers  offices and FBI offices directly.Quoting security experts, CNN noted that it s not unusual for the FBI to ignore requests from people who reach out to them with information. As a general matter, if the FBI is conducting an investigation ... they decide who they need to talk to,  said Carrie Cordero, a former counsel to the U.S. assistant attorney general for national security.Still, Democratic lawmakers have expressed alarm at the FBI s apparent overlooking of potentially important witnesses in their probe of Kavanaugh. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in a statement Wednesday that she had  serious concerns that this is not a credible investigation. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told CNN s Wolf Blitzer that the FBI s investigation did not appear to be sufficiently thorough.  [It] doesn t sound like the complete, thorough investigation that frankly senators deserve and would be due if you had a thorough background check,  Gillibrand said.  There are witnesses who can corroborate, and possibly substantiate, those kinds of allegations, that still have not been interviewed.  @SenBlumenthal on allegations of sexual misconduct and excessive drinking levied at #SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh https://t.co/EFcoh3Huf6 pic.twitter.com/QOzrJ4sLziAccording to The New York Times, the FBI reached out to 10 people and interviewed nine as part of its probe into Kavanaugh s past. Ramirez said she was interviewed by two agents at her lawyer s office in Boulder, Colorado, last week; and three former classmates of Kavanaugh s   Mark Judge, Tim Gaudette and Chris Garrett   were reportedly also questioned as part of the investigation. Other than Ramirez, at least two other women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct: Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who claims the judge sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers; and Julie Swetnick, who has accused Kavanaugh of being present during a  gang rape  in the early 1980s. Neither woman was interviewed by the FBI. Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the misconduct allegations against him. Speaking to The New Yorker, Ramirez said this week that she was troubled by what she described as the FBI s apparent lack of willingness to substantiate her claims. I am very alarmed, first, that I was denied an FBI investigation for five days, and then, when one was granted, that it was given on a short timeline and that the people who were key to corroborating my story have not been contacted,  she said.  I feel like I m being silenced. The White House refused to say on Wednesday whether the Trump administration had limited the scope of the FBI s investigation into Kavanaugh.Earlier in the week, President Donald Trump had claimed the bureau would have free rein to interview whomever they needed.This story has been updated with details of Scheuerman s account.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

President Donald Trump and key Republican senators quickly expressed satisfaction with the report, calling it a  thorough investigation  and a  comprehensive review.  But dozens of interviews with Kavanaugh s former classmates at Yale University revealed that FBI investigators interviewed just a small fraction of the witnesses who could shed light on the allegations and declined to speak with several people who contacted the bureau with relevant information. The FBI reached out to 10 people in the course of its dayslong investigation and interviewed nine of them, according to The New York Times. The bureau spoke with Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh s who has accused the judge of thrusting his penis in her face at a college party; Mark Judge, a Georgetown Prep classmate of Kavanaugh s who Christine Blasey Ford said was present during Kavanaugh s alleged attempt to rape her at a high school party; Leland Keyser, a high school friend of Ford s who she said attended that party; Patrick  P.J.  Smyth, a prep school classmate of Kavanaugh s who Ford said was also at the party; Chris Garrett, a prep school classmate of Kavanaugh s; and Tim Gaudette, another prep school classmate of Kavanaugh s. But the investigators ignored countless accounts from Kavanaugh s former classmates, friends and residential hall neighbors, many of whom spoke with HuffPost, that could paint a more detailed picture of the circumstances surrounding the allegations at hand. Multiple former classmates said they had information about Kavanaugh or Ramirez that they were willing to share but were never contacted by the FBI or never heard back after they reached out to the bureau. Here are some of the people the FBI should have interviewed:Brett KavanaughChristine Blasey Ford. Ford alleged that a drunken teenage Kavanaugh pinned her on a bed during a house party in the early 1980s, groped her and covered her mouth when she tried to scream while his friend Mark Judge looked on. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation.Julie Swetnick. Swetnick alleged that she witnessed Kavanaugh at parties during the early 1980s where women were  gang raped.   He was very aggressive   very sloppy drunk, very mean drunk. I saw him   go up to girls and paw on them, try to, you know, get a little too handsy, touching them in private parts. I saw him try to shift clothing,  Swetnick told NBC News.Ford s lawyers gave the FBI the names of more than a dozen witnesses who the lawyers said  would have challenged the credibility of Judge Kavanaugh s testimony before the Senate Committee.  The list includes: Jeremiah Hanafin. The former FBI agent and polygraph examiner who conducted Ford s polygraph examination regarding her allegation against Kavanaugh.Russell Ford. Christine Blasey Ford s husband. He detailed in a sworn declaration to the Senate Judiciary Committee that his wife told him and their couples therapist in 2012 that she was sexually assaulted when she was in high school.Keith Koegler. A friend of Christine Blasey Ford s. She told Koegler in 2016 that she was assaulted by a man who was then a federal judge. Shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement and before Kavanaugh was nominated to the court, she emailed Koegler and named Kavanaugh as her assailant. Adela Gildo-Mazzon. Another friend of Ford s. Ford told Gildo-Mazzon in 2013 that she was sexually assaulted by a man who was then a federal judge. Rebecca Olson. A friend of Ford s whom she confided in last year. She told Olson that she was sexually assaulted by a man who was then a federal judge.Kirsten Leimroth. A family friend of Ford s. She named Kavanaugh as her assailant and told Leimroth at a restaurant in July 2018 that she feared what would happen if her name and her accusation became public. Jim Gensheimer. Another Ford friend who was present at the restaurant in July 2018. Gensheimer described the conversation in similar terms. Monica L. McLean. An ex-boyfriend of Ford s said this week that she helped her friend McLean prepare for a polygraph examination in the 1990s. Ford testified during her Senate hearing that she had never done so. McLean rejected the ex-boyfriend s account.Thomas Kane. Kane, a Georgetown Prep classmate of Kavanaugh s, has called Ford s allegations  absurd.   Brett would never do anything like that. If it had happened, I would know about it. We all would have known about it,  Kane told The Washington Post. Sean Hagan. A fellow Georgetown Prep student who could help explain why Kavanaugh and several of his friends referred to themselves as  Renate Alumnius  in a Georgetown Prep yearbook. With the phrase, The New York Times reported, the young men were boasting about their conquests of women   and one student named Renate in particular. Hagan said the students in that circle were  very disrespectful, at least verbally  about her.  I can t express how disgusted I am with them, then and now.  Sixty-five female former high school acquaintances of Kavanaugh s who wrote a letter in support of him to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  For the entire time we have known Brett Kavanaugh, he has behaved honorably and treated women with respect,  they wrote.Chad Ludington. A former Yale classmate. Kavanaugh wasn t truthful about his drinking habits when he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ludington said.  There were certainly many times when he could not remember what was going on,  Ludington told The New York Times about Kavanaugh.  When Brett got drunk, he was often belligerent and aggressive,  Ludington said, adding that Kavanagh was involved in a 1985 incident at a bar that led to the arrest of Chris Dudley. Kerry Berchem. A former Yale classmate who claimed to have a series of text messages that suggest Kavanaugh was talking with former classmates about Ramirez s allegations days before The New Yorker made the story public. If Kavanaugh was aware of the allegations before the report, that would refute testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee about when he learned about them. Berchem contacted the FBI about the messages but never heard back from investigators, according to an email Berchem sent to the bureau, obtained by HuffPost:Kathleen Charlton. Another former Yale classmate. Charlton, too, said she has information that indicates Kavanaugh was contacting former Yale classmates before The New Yorker made Ramirez  allegations public. Charlton contacted her senator about the information and spoke to an FBI special agent who assured her she would hear back from the bureau, she told the Times. The FBI never took a statement from her. Mark Krasberg. A Yale classmate. Krasberg tried multiple times to get  important evidence regarding the Debbie Ramirez investigation  into the FBI s hands, he told The New York Times.  Lynne Brooks. A former Yale classmate. Brooks has disputed Kavanaugh s account of his drinking habits in college.  It is not plausible to me that he remembers everything that he did when he was drinking,  she said. William Scheuerman. A former Yale classmate who lived in Kavanaugh s residential halls. Scheurman contacted the FBI with a list of residents at the time of the alleged Ramirez incident, pulled from a yearbook from the time. The FBI never returned his call after he notified the bureau about his tip, he told HuffPost.  In reality, it seems this  investigation  is just another partisan game being played to win over a few wavering Senate votes,  he wrote. Bryan Cole. A former Yale classmate and college friend of Ramirez s. Cole wasn t surprised by Ramirez  allegation.  That it would happen to a woman and she would not feel comfortable to speak about it doesn t surprise me either a bit,  he told HuffPost.  Among some groups, that was the culture. There s no excuse for that behavior, and unfortunately, guys like Kavanaugh still felt they could behave that way, especially when drinking,  Cole said.James Roche. One of Kavanaugh s freshman-year roommates. Kavanaugh has  not told the truth  about his drinking, Roche said in a statement.  Although Brett was normally reserved, he was a notably heavy drinker, even by the standards of the time, and that he became aggressive and belligerent when he was very drunk.  Roche has offered to provide his account to the FBI, but the bureau never contacted him. Kavanaugh strongly denied Roche s claims. More than 20  names of witnesses provided to the FBI by Ramirez s lawyer. Ramirez s lawyer provided the FBI with a list of  more than 20  additional witnesses  likely to have relevant  information to share that might be able to corroborate Ramirez s account, her lawyer said. Those witnesses were not interviewed, Ramirez s lawyer said in a letter. Those witnesses include: Kenneth Appold. Appold, a former Yale classmate, soon learned about the alleged exposure incident and heard that Ramirez was the victim and Kavanaugh the perpetrator, he told The New Yorker. Appold was one of the many witnesses Ramirez s lawyer recommended the FBI speak to, but the bureau never did.Richard Oh. A Yale classmate who remembers overhearing a female student tearfully recounting an incident similar to the one Ramirez described.Elizabeth Swisher. Swisher, a former Yale classmate, described as a lie Kavanaugh s claim he had  never had a blackout  from drinking in college.  I saw him very drunk many times and there is no way he remembers everything about every night,  she told the Times. Chris Dudley. Dudley, a friend and former Yale classmate of Kavanaugh s who was arrested during the 1985 bar incident described by Ludington. Dudley has vouched for Kavanaugh s claim that he never blacked out from drinking.  I will say it again, we drank in college. I was with Brett frequently in college, whether it be in the gym, in class or socializing. I never ever saw Brett blackout. Not one time,  Dudley said in a statement released by the White House.Chris Munnelly. A former Yale classmate who was a freshman when Kavanaugh was a senior. Munnelly cast doubt on the notion that Kavanaugh drank too much and that DKE, the fraternity to which Kavanaugh belonged, was an out-of-control party frat.Dan Murphy. A former Yale roommate of Kavanaugh s. Murphy, too, backed up Kavanaugh s description of his drinking habits.  I never saw Brett black out or not be able to remember the prior evening s events, nor did I ever see Brett act aggressive, hostile, or in a sexually aggressive manner to women,  Murphy said. Daniel Lavan. A former Yale classmate. Lavan saw Kavanaugh  on multiple occasions stumbling drunk where he could not have rational control over his actions or clear recollection of them,  he told The New York Times.Elizabeth Rasor. Rasor told The New Yorker that her ex-boyfriend Mark Judge told her  ashamedly of an incident that involved him and other boys taking turns having sex with a drunk woman. Tad Low. Low, who was a year behind Kavanaugh at Yale, contacted the FBI about an alleged incident at the DKE fraternity house.  During the 1987ñ88 school year, I was an eyewitness to a shocking ceremony taking place inside the DKE fraternity house that involved a semi-circle of cheering frat brothers watching a local prostitute perform a public sex act,  Low wrote in a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. A  low level  employee at the FBI heard his tip, Low said, but asked no additional questions and didn t give him a reference number, The New York Daily News reported.Steve Kantrowitz. Kantrowitz, a former Yale classmate of Kavanaugh s, disputed Kavanaugh s claim in a Fox News interview that he was a virgin for many years after high school.  Perhaps Brett Kavanaugh was a virgin for many years after high school,  Kantrowitz tweeted.  But he claimed otherwise in a conversation with me during our freshman year in Lawrance Hall at Yale, in the living room of my suite. Yale s DKE fraternity members during Kavanaugh s college years. HuffPost contacted dozens of members from the Yale chapter of the fraternity. The vast majority did not respond to requests for comment, and some declined to comment. Dozens of women who were Yale students when Kavanaugh was on campus and a member of DKE told HuffPost that DKE was a fraternity known on campus for mistreating women.  The guys from DKE were pigs. Horrible men,  said one woman who graduated in 1985 and requested anonymity to speak frankly about her experiences at the school.Hundreds of Yale classmates and residential hall neighbors of Kavanaugh s and Ramirez s. More than 40 people  with potential information into the sexual misconduct allegations  against Kavanaugh, including multiple high school and college classmates of his, tried to contact the FBI, to no avail, NBC News reported. Beyond Appold, several other former Yale classmates said they had reached out to the FBI about Kavanaugh  but had not received a response,  according to The New Yorker. Two high school acquaintances of Kavanaugh s said they submitted sworn declarations to the FBI but were not contacted by the bureau, the magazine reported. HuffPost spoke to dozens of former classmates who had some information to share about Kavanaugh and Ramirez and the general party culture that Yale was drenched in at the time, off the record. The FBI interviewed none of them.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Susan Collins (R-Maine) on Sunday said Christine Blasey Ford s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee made her question whether then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh should withdraw from consideration.But Kavanaugh s  forceful denial  to the committee of Ford s sexual assault allegation against him ultimately led her to vote in his favor, ensuring his confirmation to the highest court in the land, she told CNN s  State Of The Union.  I was certainly undecided,  Collins told CNN.  And after hearing Christine Ford s very compelling and painful testimony, I thought,  Oh my goodness, he perhaps needs to withdraw.  She continued:  But then when he came back with such forceful denial, and the anger and anguish that he showed, and then the lack of corroboration (for Ford s claims) led me back to the fundamental issues that are fundamental to our legal system of presumption of innocence and fairness.

On Friday, a day before the Senate voted on Kavanaugh s confirmation, Flake and Collins announced they would likely vote in his favor, all but guaranteeing him a seat on the bench. The Senate on Saturday narrowly confirmed Kavanaugh, 50-48. Every Republican but Murkowski voted in favor of him, and every Democrat but Manchin voted against him. Hours later, Kavanaugh was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice as hundreds of Me Too activists protested outside the Capitol.Three women in recent weeks have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during the early 1980s. Ford, in powerful testimony on Sept. 27 to the Judiciary Committee, alleged Kavanaugh pinned her down, groped her and tried to remove her clothing at a small party in suburban Maryland when they were both high school students.Kavanaugh vehemently denied ever sexually assaulting anyone in his weepy, defiant testimony to the panel following Ford s appearance. At one point, Kavanaugh claimed the mounting sexual misconduct allegations he faced were part of a left-wing  political hit  sparked by  revenge on behalf of the Clintons. Kavanaugh was part of the special counsel team whose investigation led to then-President Bill Clinton s impeachment in the late 1990s.Collins on Sunday conceded that Kavanaugh  stepped over the line  at times during his eyebrow-raising testimony. I did believe that he should not have take the shot at the Clintons and that in his questioning with certain senators, responding to their questions, particularly Amy Klobuchar, that he stepped over the line,  Collins said.Klobuchar (D-Minn.) had asked Kavanaugh if his drinking as a youth had ever caused him to black out, prompting the nominee to angrily reply,  I don t know. Have you? .@SenatorCollins to @DanaBashCNN:  I did believe that he should not have taken the shot at the Clintons and that in his questioning with certain senators, responding to their questions, particularly Amy Klobuchar, that he stepped over the line.  #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/9rJt9hyVriDespite Ford testifying that she was  100 percent  sure Kavanaugh assaulted her, Collins in her Sunday comments cast doubt on the woman s memory. I do believe that she was assaulted,  Collins said.  I don t know by whom and I m not certain when, but I do not believe that [Kavanaugh] was the assailant. Following the committee hearing, the White House had directed the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh. But the inquiry was limited in scope and failed to interview either him or Ford, as well as several people claiming to be able to corroborate allegations against him.Sen.

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) says she will oppose Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump s nominee to the Supreme Court. I believe Brett Kavanaugh is a good man,  Murkowski told reporters on Friday after voting against bringing his nomination to a final vote.  In my view, he s not the right man for the court at this time. Murkowski, a key GOP moderate, said she did not come to a decision until walking onto the Senate floor on Friday. The long-awaited announcement comes as a relief to Democrats and women s groups who view the appellate court judge as a serious threat to the Affordable Care Act and reproductive rights, which Murkowski supports. Her decision probably also had something to do with loud opposition to Kavanaugh from Alaska Natives, who were crucial to Murkowski s re-election in 2010.Murkowski was also under pressure to reject Kavanaugh s nomination based on the allegations of sexual assault that were leveled against him late in the confirmation process. Last month, the Alaska centrist called for a pause in the process to hear from Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Kavanaugh of assaulting her in high school when they were both teens, as well as an investigation of the charges. The FBI conducted a limited probe of the allegations but the report proved inconclusive. It s unclear, however, whether Murkowski s opposition to Kavanaugh will be enough to stop him from being confirmed. The Senate is expected to hold its final vote on the nomination on Saturday when several other moderate senators could help get him a seat on the Supreme Court.Nominated by Trump in July to replace former Justice Anthony Kennedy, the 53-year-old Kavanaugh is viewed by legal experts as a reliable conservative who will tilt the balance of the Supreme Court to the right for decades.Murkowski, like fellow Republican centrist Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, supports abortion rights. Democrats and progressives groups hoped to sway her vote with an intense monthslong lobbying campaign, arguing that Kavanaugh would roll back abortion rights for millions of women in America. They had some reason to be optimistic: Both GOP senators bucked Trump when they helped vote down last year s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.But Murkowski stayed quiet on the matter, even after Democrats released an email Kavanaugh wrote in 2003 as a White House official for George W. Bush in which he seemed to question whether Roe v. Wade   the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide   was  settled law. While both GOP senators faced pressure to reject Kavanaugh based on his views on abortion rights, Murkowski was also urged to reject the nomination by advocates for Alaska Natives who had concerns with the judge s record on climate change, voting rights and fishing rights. Alaska Native rights groups were particularly concerned about how the conservative judge would vote on a case they fear could destroy the way of life for tribal communities who rely on subsistence fishing in protected federal waters.Alaskan tribal representatives, including leaders of the Hughes Tribal Council, the Ruby Tribal Council, the Tanana Tribal Council and the Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, spoke out against Kavanaugh s nomination.Murkowski got even more reason to oppose Kavanaugh last month when Alaska Gov. Bill Walker (I) and Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott (D) came out against the nomination, voicing concern about the judge potentially voting to strike down the Affordable Care Act s Medicaid expansion and its protections for patients who have pre-existing conditions.Murkowski, 61, isn t up for re-election until 2022   a timeline that surely gave her some breathing room on Kavanaugh s nomination. She owes little to the GOP establishment, having mounted a successful write-in campaign in 2010 with the help of tribal communities and Alaska independents. None of this has been fair,  Murkowski told reporters on Friday about the Kavanaugh confirmation process.  Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

During his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh tried to dispel fears that he would rule on a partisan basis, arguing that  a good judge must be an umpire ñ a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy. But Kavanaugh s blatant display of partisanship during his testimony last week, when he dismissed Ford s accusations as part of  a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election  and  revenge on behalf of the Clintons,  made his earlier claims he would  call balls and strikes and not   pitch or bat,  ring hollow. Essentially what he did is he took his mask off and he revealed himself as a politician who wears a robe,  said Loyola Law School professor Jessica Levinson.Kavanaugh s confirmation would complicate the image of the court carefully crafted by Chief Justice John Roberts, experts say, particularly when it comes to the forthcoming 5-4 decisions that help Republicans win elections and make it harder for Democrats to do the same.Over the past 12 years, the five Republican-appointed justices have issued a series of rulings that have greatly benefited the Republican Party. But each of those cases has been carefully decided to protect the court s integrity from challenges that the conservatives are helping the political party they are affiliated with.  John Roberts is so good at masking that in legalese that it doesn t feel quite as troubling,  Levinson said.The results, however, have been the same. Shelby County v. Holder made voting more difficult for minority and low-propensity groups who traditionally support Democrats. Citizens United allowed corporations and the wealthy to freely spend on political campaigns, creating a flow of money that helped Republican secure control of state legislatures and governors  mansions across the country, allowing them to gerrymander districts to the party s benefit and write even more restrictive voter laws. Janus v. AFSCME Council 31 made it more difficult for public employee unions to collect dues, a policy that has been shown to hurt Democrats in state elections. Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute allowed state election overseers to more easily purge voters from the rolls. And Abbot v. Perez upheld a number of Texas legislative and congressional districts that a lower court had ruled were illegal racial gerrymanders. I think having Judge Kavanaugh on the court would make the split legitimacy issue even worse, said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California-Irvine.  Judge Kavanaugh expressed a kind of raw tribal partisanship that we don t normally hear from judges, and if he were on the court no doubt those on the left would think he decided the way he did, at least in part, because of his Republican Party leanings. There are no shortage of cases that Kavanaugh could wind up hearing on the Supreme Court where questions about his political preferences would arise.Thanks to the court s 5-4 rulings gutting voting rights laws, upholding restrictions on voting and enabling free spending by Republican-supporting corporations, Republicans have taken power in countless states and passed a raft of new voting restrictions since 2010. Voters in 24 states will face more stringent voting procedures than they did in 2010 in this year s midterms. And voters in nine states will face new voting restrictions enacted since the 2016 election. Some of these restrictions are already being litigated in state and lower courts.Gerrymanders in Maryland, in favor of Democrats, North Carolina, in favor of Republicans, and Wisconsin, in favor of Republicans, are all likely to be heard by the court in the very near future.Court watchers also believe that there is a very high likelihood that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross s decisions to include a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census will come before the court. The inclusion of the question, which critics state is designed to reduce participation by immigrants, could lead to an undercount of the U.S. population in certain regions and thus the malapportionment of electoral votes and congressional seats in a manner that could hurt the Democratic Party.If Kavanaugh is seated for these and other cases, he should expect a high number of recusal requests. I think we ll see motions filed for the justice to recuse himself and not to hear those cases,  Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program for the Brennan Center for Justice said.But the court has no independent system to vet recusal requests. Instead, it is up to the judgment of the justice.Kavanaugh could choose to recuse himself from cases where his vote could be seen as tainted by the promise he made in his testimony about those working against him on behalf of the Clintons.  What goes around comes around,  he said.Or he could simply cast the votes that he is expected to, thereby further gutting the Voting Rights Act, upholding racial gerrymanders and knocking down campaign finance restrictions.He could use the same line that the late Antonin Scalia liked to give after he cast one of the five votes by justices appointed by Republican presidents to end an election recount in Florida and install a Republican president in the White House.

As the Senate debates the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, numerous false claims have been repeated to undermine the credibility of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford,  her lawyers said in a statement to HuffPost. Whatever the outcome, Senators deserve to know the truth:An FBI investigation that did not include interviews of Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh is not a meaningful investigation in any sense of the word.  We believe Christine Blasey Ford and we fully support her,  they concluded.  Senators claiming to want a dignified debate should not repeat lies constructed by the Judiciary Committee that were cynically designed to win support for Judge Kavanaugh. The statement was signed by attorneys Debra S. Katz, Lisa J. Banks and Michael R. Bromwich.Kavanaugh is set to be confirmed Saturday, after several weeks of defending himself against Ford and other women s accusations of sexual assault and misconduct. Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) all announced Friday they would support Kavanaugh, giving him the 51 votes necessary for confirmation.Ford testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh pinned her down in the presence of his friend, groped her and attempted to take her clothes off during a gathering in the summer of 1982.The FBI did not question Ford about the incident in an investigation requested by several senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee, including Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who said he d only help advance Kavanaugh in a procedural vote if the bureau further examined Ford s accusations.On Thursday, Ford s lawyers called the FBI investigation  a stain on the process, on the FBI and on our American ideal of justice. If the FBI had interviewed Ford, her attorneys argued on Friday, she would have provided evidence that corroborated her accusations, including  medical records and access to the phone  she used to contact a reporter about Kavanaugh s misconduct prior to his nomination.The attorneys slammed committee Republicans for refusing to allow other witnesses to testify, including the former FBI agent who administered the polygraph test to her in August.They also rejected claims that Ford s testimony was delayed because of her fear of flying. They said the timing of the hearing was affected by Ford taking measures, including speaking to the FBI, to protect her family from threats.President Donald Trump, who nominated Kavanaugh to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy in July, stood by his pick throughout the confirmation process, labeling Ford s accusations  false  and arguing that she was part of a Democratic  con job. Trump mocked Ford at a campaign rally on Tuesday, a move some senators called  just plain wrong  and  unacceptable. Read Ford s lawyers  full statement below:As the Senate debates the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, numerous false claims have been repeated to undermine the credibility of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.  Whatever the outcome, Senators deserve to know the truth:In her testimony, Dr. Ford said:  It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court.

Kavanaugh will  undermine the [Supreme Court s] claim to legitimacy,  Post said, calling the judge s confirmation  an American tragedy. Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate on Saturday afternoon and quickly sworn in as a justice on the nation s highest court. He had apparently concluded that the only way he could rally Republican support was by painting himself as the victim of a political hit job,  Post said of Kavanaugh and the way the judge had attempted to defend himself from the accusations of sexual assault and harassment.  He therefore offered a witches  brew of vicious unfounded charges, alleging that Democratic members of the Senate Judicial Committee were pursuing a vendetta on behalf of the Clintons. If we expect judges to reach conclusions based solely on reliable evidence, Kavanaugh s savage and bitter attack demonstrated exactly the opposite sensibility.  The former dean of Yale Law School: Kavanaugh s  very presence will undermine the court s claim to legitimacy; it will damage the nation s commitment to the rule of law. It will be an American tragedy.  https://t.co/eujA0hPm9uPost, who described Kavanaugh as a  casual acquaintance  whom he d known for a decade, said he d been  shell-shocked  by the judge s behavior.  This was not the Brett Kavanaugh I thought I knew,  he wrote.  Having come so close to confirmation, Kavanaugh apparently cared more about his promotion than about preserving the dignity of the Supreme Court to which he aspired to join. Post, a Sterling Professor of Law at Yale Law School who specializes in constitutional law, went on to lambast the senators who voted for Kavanaugh as caring  more about controlling  the court than the institution s legitimacy. There will be hell to pay,  he warned.Former Yale Law School Dean, Robert Post, on Justice Kavanaugh* :  There will be hell to pay.  https://t.co/cqFJpWVRNB pic.twitter.com/EIrNwhvJTQReferring to a Wall Street Journal editorial penned last week by Kavanaugh in which the judge admitted to having been, perhaps,  too emotional at times  during his hearing before the Senate Judicial Committee and in which he vowed to be  an independent and impartial  judge, Post stressed that Kavanaugh  cannot have it both ways.  He cannot gain confirmation by unleashing partisan fury while simultaneously claiming that he possesses a judicial and impartial temperament,  said Post.Kavanaugh, Post continued, will therefore  join the court as the black-robed embodiment of raw partisan power inconsistent with any ideal of an impartial judiciary.  His very presence will undermine the court s claim to legitimacy; it will damage the nation s commitment to the rule of law. It will be an American tragedy,  Post concluded.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

And their chief propagandist has lashed  malignant feminism  in America for challenging Kavanaugh s confirmation.Russian TV pundit and media official Dmitry Kiselyov, chosen for his role by Russian President Vladimir Putin, earlier this week dismissed the sexual assault accusation against Kavanaugh by research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford as  like a joke.  Kiselyov said Kavanaugh s confirmation was held up by  malignant feminism,  which he blasted as a  tool for extortion. The  plague of malignant feminism is moving from America to Europe and toward Russia as well,  he charged on  Vesti Nedeli  (News of the Week) on Rossiya, a state-owned channel that reaches 90 percent of Russian households. It involves  infected ladies [who] project their sexual fantasies onto men who have a successful life and career, accusing them of attempted rape,  he said.  Kiselyov has called women  monkeys  and  witches  on Russian TV and has said he believes feminists should be imprisoned or committed to mental institutions, The Daily Beast reported.HIs rants eerily echo recent attacks on women by Trump.On Thursday, Trump ripped Kavanaugh protesters as the  very rude elevator screamers,  and he insisted   with no evidence   that they were  professionals  who were  paid  by Democratic donors. Trump appeared to be referring to two victims of sexual assault who confronted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) last week on an elevator to challenge his support of Kavanaugh.The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad. Don t fall for it! Also, look at all of the professionally made identical signs. Paid for by Soros and others. These are not signs made in the basement from love! #TroublemakersTrump also mocked Blasey at a Mississippi rally earlier this week and lamented the  scary time  that  young men  are facing as they re threatened by false claims of sexual assault. He said women, meanwhile, are  doing great. President Trump:  It s a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of. Full video here: https://t.co/eIalSfbn4x pic.twitter.com/QOIB2tE8DFTrump himself has been accused by more than 15 women of sexual misconduct, with allegations including groping, workplace harassment, forcible kissing and assault. Kiselyov said other  victims  of such malignant feminism in the U.S. have included Fox News contributor Kevin Jackson, who was fired for calling Kavanaugh s accusers  lying skanks  (and  leftist women skanky ), and Les Moonves, the former chairman of CBS, who was forced out amid multiple accusations of sexual misconduct. He also scoffed at accusations of rape against Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo by American Kathryn Mayorga. She was in Las Vegas at the time of the alleged attack and didn t go there to  study the Bible,  smirked Kiselyov.The state-funded English-language news channel RT has also praised Kavanaugh and blasted protesters. It has also linked protesters to liberal donor George Soros as part of a conspiracy   exactly as Trump has done.Attitudes like Kiselyov s are also being driven home by the Russians on social media, according to Hamilton 68, which tracks Twitters activity to bots linked to the Kremlin. Kavanaugh was the top trending subject being pushed by Russian bots. The Hamilton 68 dashboard, which attempts to track Russian influence operations on Twitter, is charting a lot of Kavanaugh activity right now. https://t.co/lEIzRgORs4 pic.twitter.com/jPgFpEwKynNew Knowledge, another organization tracking known Russian bots, revealed similar findings.The #KavanaughHearings continue to be a popular topic for a Russia-linked disinformation network we re tracking at @NewKnowledgeAI - driving support for the nominee and attempting to discredit Dr. Blasey Ford. https://t.co/WflbSsFV5I pic.twitter.com/bgOXIhHXDQDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The male-dominated party s answer to Me Too is: deny and attack. Republican senators, President Donald Trump and their allies in the conservative media put on a show of male anger, resentment and victimhood to force through the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh last week, even though he was credibly accused of sexual misconduct by three women. And with his elevation to the Supreme Court, over the objection of so many women and sexual assault survivors, Republicans demonstrated their hard-line commitment to male supremacy.  Female protesters   victims of sexual assault   were derided as  clowns,  part of a mob and George Soros-funded terrorists (harsh terms not used to, say, condemn white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year), Trump said it s a scary time, not for the many women bravely talking about being raped and assaulted, but for the men who had to listen.This outpouring of unearned grievance was expected from a party that s never really valued women, said Jennifer Pierotti Lim, co-founder of Republican Women for Progress.  We re about a year out from the start of the Me Too movement and I think that the GOP as a whole has really abdicated their messaging here,  said Lim, who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.  In that vacuum, all we hear is the message from Trump and it comes out loud and clear.  The party has long used women for political advantage, without prioritizing or considering their concerns or viewpoints, Lim said. Her point was driven home on Friday by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who explained why she was casting the deciding vote on Kavanaugh in an eagerly awaited 45-minute speech. Seated behind Collins, neatly captured by the TV screen, were two other female Republican senators: Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (Miss.). They were fairly silent on the Kavanaugh turmoil during the previous weeks. The three women together make up half of all female Republican senators. These few women were being used to make the show of male supremacy go down easy. Definitely as a Republican woman my bar has become very low on how the party uses women as a means to an end, every time I think they can t get lower, things likes this happen,  Lim said. Twenty-seven years ago, the country watched as Anita Hill testified before an all-male Senate Judiciary Committee and was asked insulting and demeaning questions. The country s eyes were opened to the issue of sexual harassment, said Ellen Bravo, a longtime activist.  The silence around harassment was forever shattered, Bravo said.  It just wasn t enough.  Clarence Thomas made it onto the Supreme Court anyway.  This time around, the same thing is true,  she added, noting the huge outcry from women in regard to sexual assault that Christine Blasey Ford helped unleash.  In the years since Hill s testimony, the Democratic Party has actually diversified. This year, there were four Democratic women on the committee, two of color. And this mattered. The Democratic senators   men and women   were strong advocates for hearing Ford s story, once it was reported by The Washington Post. It was a sharp contrast to the behavior of Democratic senators during the Thomas hearings.Yet on the Republican side, little had changed. Once again, it was all men on the GOP side of the Judiciary Committee who listened to Ford s testimony. This time around, they were too afraid to directly question the woman who was reporting her story. However, they were more than ready to unleash their anger after Kavanaugh s tirade. Some of the men were the same ones who were on the committee and heard Hill s testimony in 1991. The party didn t learn. Indeed, when asked why there were no Republican women on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) speculated that they didn t want to do so much work (comments he quickly tried to walk back).Without more women in the party, this will be the GOP: a bunch of men who can t see outside the tunnel vision of their masculine worldview. To truly fight sexual harassment, one strategy that has proved successful is hiring and promoting more women.  If all the important meetings have 50 percent women, none of them happen in strip clubs,  Frank Dobbin, a professor of sociology at Harvard University who s studied the effectiveness of anti-harassment training, recently told HuffPost, explaining the research he s done on combating harassment. The GOP is laughably far from that goal. Fewer than 12 percent of Republican senators are women. In the House, there are just 23 women out of 235 Republican representatives   less than 10 percent. (It s telling that the lone Republican in the chamber Saturday who didn t vote for Kavanaugh was Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of the party s few outspoken women.)Even at a time when men still dominate executive boardrooms and C-suites, these percentages are shockingly low.No wonder those Republican senators were so easily entranced by Kavanaugh s sob story   their empathy clearly lies with men. They hardly even have to work with women at all. In fact, the vice president, Mike Pence, reportedly won t even dine alone with a woman who isn t his wife. And the president has said he can  grab them by the pussy. None of this is likely to change.The GOP has been downright hostile to the women in the party who are running, Lim said. During the primary season, the party has typically funded men and left women with little resources. The RNC has long purported to support getting more women into office, but they don t do anything,  said Lim, who added that a lot of the GOP women running in primaries this year couldn t get enough funding from the party.  So nobody takes them seriously. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Thomas, of course, made it onto the Supreme Court in 1991 even though Anita Hill testified that he had sexually harassed her.Smith had decided to speak up after the lewd comments by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump about assaulting women surfaced on a 2005  Access Hollywood  tape.  It felt like we were continuing this sort of  wink wink, nod nod  agreement that you just put up with stuff like that when you re in certain social circles,  she said.  I just wasn t willing to continue to do that.  Smith s shocking allegations, which Thomas denied, didn t make much of a wave at the time. They came during the final heated days of the 2016 presidential campaign and before the Me Too movement coalesced amid a barrage of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men.Smith, an attorney, now lives in Alaska. And as sexual assault allegations swirled around Kavanaugh, she felt compelled to add her voice to those opposing his ascension to the high court. With her daughter and other women from the state, she traveled to the nation s capital to make that case to Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of the few Republicans who was wavering on Kavanaugh s nomination.She and 17 other women met with Murkowski for an hour Thursday, and Smith told her about what happened with Thomas.  There was one person [in the group] who started crying  as other stories were related to Murkowski, Smith recalled.  She said she was motivated to come because her 11-year-old daughter asked her why women weren t believed as much as men. Smith had watched Christine Blasey Ford s Sept. 27 testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which the California women detailed her allegations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers growing up in the Washington area.  I felt for her,  Smith said.  You could tell that she wasn t somebody who was used to being in the national spotlight. ... I know from my own experience that there really is no glory in doing this. The personal toll for Smith has been hard. She recently wrote a piece in The Anchorage Daily News, saying she still isn t sure whether it was worth it to come forward about Thomas. But she said she s been blown away by some of the reactions to her story, which has been gratifying. There were three different kinds of reactions,  she said. One was Thomas  defenders and trolls, who thought she was a Democratic hack or looking for fame.The second group was people in her life who thanked her for speaking up.  But the third reaction was the most important to me, and that was that scores of women who are friends, acquaintances, people I barely know, have come to me with their own stories. In many cases, I m the only person they ve ever told,  she said.  In some cases, I ve been able to put them in touch with resources so they can press charges against their assailants. And that to me makes it worth it. The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh on Saturday   but without Murkowski s vote. Smith said she hopes that her story, and the stories of the other women from Alaska, had an effect on the senator. And even though Kavanaugh will now be on the court   meaning that sexual misconduct allegations have been lodged against one-third of the six men on it   she is hopeful. We re not there yet. We are far from it,  she said.  There s just a lot more work to do. But I have to think that these moments, these national debates that we re having now, are moving that in the right direction. Even in the face of the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The president also noted that he would be signing off on the appointment later on Saturday. Kavanaugh will be sworn in afterward.I applaud and congratulate the U.S. Senate for confirming our GREAT NOMINEE, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, to the United States Supreme Court. Later today, I will sign his Commission of Appointment, and he will be officially sworn in. Very exciting!The confirmation comes more than a week after Christine Blasey Ford gave emotional testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in which she described her alleged assault. Ford said Kavanaugh held her down on a bed, covered her mouth with his hand, and tried to forcibly remove her clothing while the two were in high school. In his own testimony, Kavanaugh refuted the claims, at times yelling, crying and interrupting senators. I couldn t help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say  hysterical,   House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said of Kavanaugh s testimony.Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) was the sole Republican lawmaker not to support Kavanaugh s confirmation. In a thinly veiled threat, the president told The Washington Post that Murkowski will  never recover from this.  The people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did,  Trump told the Post after Saturday s vote.Trump applauded Kavanaugh earlier on Saturday, saying that he  will be a great Justice.  He also praised Maine Senator Susan Collins (R), who had announced her support of Kavanaugh the day before, essentially securing his confirmation.An FBI investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh ended earlier this week but produced little of substance. Key witnesses, including Ford herself, were never interviewed by the intelligence agency despite Ford s lawyers  repeated attempts to contact the FBI.Kavanaugh has been accused by two other women of sexual misconduct. Deborah Ramirez said Kavanaugh exposed his penis and thrust it in her face at a college party. And Julie Swetnick said she was the  victim of one of these  gang  or  train  rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present  at a party in approximately 1982. Kavanaugh will now take his place on the highest court in the nation.This story has been updated with Trump s comments on Lisa Murkowski.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But it hasn t stopped many from continuing to rail against a government that seems determined to silence them. I don t think there s any of us who feel like shutting up at this point, and I don t think any of us plan on shutting up even after his confirmation,  rape survivor Robyn Swirling, who publicly confronted Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) last week, told HuffPost on Friday. The Supreme Court is a real damn important institution in our democracy,  she said.  Our voices need to be heard every minute that the legitimacy of that institution is in jeopardy. Many survivors who spoke to HuffPost voiced similar concerns that the legitimacy of the highest court in the land is at stake. That s why they re refusing to back down. We are going to fight until the end   because we believe we can have an impact on this process and we believe that it s critical that senators understand the trauma and impact of sexual assault,  said Jess Davidson, survivor and executive director of the advocacy organization End Rape on Campus.Since President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh in July, it s been a historic few months. Three women have accused the judge of sexual assault or misconduct, one of whom, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, delivered an emotional testimony in front of the entire country about her accusation that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her when the two were in high school.In the days since Ford s testimony, thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Washington, D.C., and other cities. Hundreds were arrested on Thursday for  unlawfully demonstrating  at the Senate office buildings. And dozens have occupied the offices of senators, repeating their stories of experiencing sexual violence until lawmakers were forced to listen.As of Friday afternoon, Kavanaugh appears to have the votes he needs to secure a confirmation. A final Senate vote is expected on Saturday. But survivors know the movement they ve sparked has already spread across the country. No matter what happens with the Kavanaugh nomination, we ve already won,  said Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of the South Asian social justice organization Equality Labs.Soundararajan said that the gaslighting of survivors and communities of color by politicians will be remembered. Kavanaugh s supporters may have political power, she said, but  they don t have people power.  They think that they re winning, but they have basically ignited a movement that s never going to go away,  she said.  We will all remember the way that we saw Orrin Hatch telling survivors to grow up. We will all remember Mitch McConnell defending the perpetrator. We will all remember how the Republicans chose to send a prosecutor to interview Ford but the minute that prosecutor tried to bring that same line of questioning to Kavanaugh, they removed her and it became men stumping about how he was such a great guy. There s no greater evidence of the patriarchy than that. Although hopeful for change, survivors are still suffering the inevitable effects of being forced to defend their humanity time and time again. That ache was only heightened when Trump, who has himself been accused of sexual assault by more than 20 women, mocked and smeared victims of sexual assault twice this past week. Watching Dr. Ford discredited, mocked and shamed triggers memories for myself, as it does for thousands of people across the country,  said Morgan McCaul, a University of Michigan student and survivor of former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University trainer Larry Nassar.  It isn t easy to see a fellow victim s pain, your pain, deemed to be less worthy than a political appointment. Swirling said she s watched as survivors of all genders, but especially women, have been  actively re-traumatized  by this entire process. It is just extremely disheartening and frankly really hard to watch my government be so explicit in how little they care about the experiences of sexual assault survivors,  she said.As a survivor of multiple rapes, Alison Turkos said she s quite literally fighting for her livelihood. As a survivor I ve had to fight back before. This is not new for me,  she said.  I refuse to remain quiet as if my voice doesn t matter. Amanda Nguyen, founder of the national civil rights nonprofit Rise and creator of the Sexual Assault Survivors  Bill of Rights, evinced a similar resilience on Friday. Many survivors and allies are possibly feeling discouraged today, but I have seen firsthand what steadfast perseverance in the face of injustice can do,  Nguyen, herself a rape survivor, told HuffPost.  We will continue our work so that no one else experiences the same struggle I faced.  Soundararajan told HuffPost that no matter what happens with Kavanaugh, survivors will persist. If this is the battle they want to choose,  she said,  they re going to lose the war. Need help?

Two days after she cast the vote that could both define and end her political career, Heidi Heitkamp was back home in North Dakota, and near tears.On this reservation near the Canadian border on Monday, far from the drama of Washington, the women of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians had a gift for the Democratic senator.A ribbon skirt, decorated with the colors of the rainbow, was meant to tell her grey skies would soon pass.  This is for everything you ve done for us,  said tribal member Cathie Gladue, presenting her with the skirt as Heitkamp began to tear up.  And it s especially for the stand you ve recently taken. It was an honorable stand for all women, of all colors.  The stand she took   choosing to believe Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when both were teenagers, and to dismiss the then-Supreme Court nominee s angry denials   is one Heitkamp and almost all of her supporters acknowledge has put her political career in jeopardy. Running for re-election against Republican GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer in a state President Donald Trump won by roughly 36 percentage points, Heitkamp already was seen by analysts as the senator most likely to lose re-election. And  Republicans now crow that her vote last week against Kavanaugh s confirmation signed her political death warrant.Some public polling has shown her down double digits. Democrats insist the margin is much closer.A Heitkamp loss harms an already tough path for Democrats to a Senate majority; it likely means they need to sweep GOP-held seats in Nevada, Arizona and Tennessee to have a chance of winning Congress  upper chamber. In the wake of the battle over Kavanaugh, Republican Senate candidates in red-leaning territory are running on a backlash to the Me Too movement, hoping it can expand the GOP s 51-49 majority in the Senate. Heitkamp knows she s an underdog. And so, in an frequently emotional 48 hours after she cast the vote, as she traveled to a farm-town parade, a small-dollar fundraiser near her hometown, a panel in front of energy executives in Bismarck and finally up to this reservation, her supporters worked relentlessly to buoy the senator s spirits, as she simultaneously tried to defend and move past her vote against Kavanaugh.It was a vote Heitkamp, a moderate former state attorney general who grew up in a town so small her seven-member family made up one-tenth of the population, made clear was directly related to Ford s Senate committee testimony that she was  100 percent certain  it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her and to Kavanaugh s angry, partisan testimony in response.  First and foremost, I believed her,  Heitkamp told the crowd of about 250 who gathered at a garage to eat bratwursts, drink beer and snack on homemade desserts at the Oktoberfest-themed small-dollar fundraiser in Wyndmere.  And I think it was really, really important for our future that we believe her.  This has been a tough week for me,  Heitkamp said.  The political rhetoric is,  You can t vote that way if you expect to come back.  And I tell people, Ray and Doreen Heitkamp didn t raise me to vote a certain way so that I could win. They raised me to vote the right way.  The crowd responded with a standing ovation.Asked if she was planning on supporting Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee s Sept. 27 hearing, Heitkamp delivered a one-word response:  Yep.  But she said supporting him after Ford s testimony would ve been a betrayal of her long-time supporters.  It s beyond Kavanaugh himself,  Heitkamp said in an interview in the back seat of a campaign staffer s SUV.  It s an affirmation of why they support me. People say politics is local. In North Dakota, politics is personal. That was on display Sunday night in Wyndmere, where Heitkamp seemed to know every attendee on a first-name basis. The crowd, filled with farmers furious over the Trump administration s trade war, was hopeful but not optimistic the rest of the state s voters would side with her. What drives people s votes is whether you have an R or a D next to your name,  said Gary Friskan, a soybean, wheat and corn farmer.  This is a red state. Still, he hoped Heitkamp s  middle of the road  style would appeal more to voters than Cramer s loyalty to Trump. (The congressman once compared voting against Trump to sleeping with women other than his wife.)  The commercials for her opponent keep trying to turn her into [Hillary Clinton]. Baloney!  he scoffed. Friskan said he and other soybean farmers had lost tens of thousands of dollars because of the trade war, and were worried about losing customers in China and elsewhere permanently if it continued. Heitkamp s fight against the trade war had been a key part of her message, but she s now airing television ads defending her vote against Kavanaugh instead.   I voted for Neil Gorsuch,  Heitkamp says in the 30-second spot, referring to Trump Supreme Court pick confirmed last year.  So I know there are plenty of other conservative judges who can fill this job without tearing this country apart. Heitkamp also has engaged in a mini-media blitz, appearing on CBS   60 Minutes  and CNN to explain her opposition to Kavanaugh and has become an unlikely online fundraising superstar, bringing in at least $1 million in the days following her vote.The fight over Kavanaugh intensified the spotlight on her race   reporters from at least three national outlets were at the fundraiser in Wyndmere.She admits a victory in the Nov. 6 election would be of the come-from-behind variety. To try to make that happen, she said her campaign is focused on identifying and turning out 150,000 to 160,000 supporters (she won her first term in 2012 with just over 161,000 votes).Republicans, meanwhile, say no amount of money or campaigning can save Heitkamp. No matter how much she tries to run to the middle, she can t escape the left-wing resisters and black-masked antifa activists that now define the Democrat Party to much of middle-America,  said Andrew Surabian, a GOP strategist and former Trump White House official.  The overreach from national Democrats during the Kavanaugh fight was simply the last straw. She is a walking dead candidate at this point. Heitkamp, 62. started her Monday in the state capital of Bismarck, sharing a stage with Cramer at the conference on energy production, a key subject in the state. She told the crowd her bipartisan approach to energy issues would make her more effective for the state than Cramer.The 57-year-old Republican sought to keep the focus on Kavanugh, saying the newly minted Supreme Court justice would be good for energy production.As Heitkamp traveled on to the Chippewa reservation, the Kavanaugh vote was far from her mind. She met with tribal leaders at the Sky Dancer casinos, where the front doors were still plastered with fliers advertising a rally with Heitkamp that had been set for Saturday; it was canceled because she was still in Washington voting against Kavanaugh s nomination. She visited the house of Twila Martin Kekahbah, a former tribal chief, and discussed the unemployment, housing, drug addiction and crime problems on the reservation.She went to the local community college, where a group of tribal leaders was educating voters on how to grapple with a North Dakota law that requires voters to present IDs with residential street addresses. Many tribal members use P.O. boxes instead. Heitkamp and many other Democrats believe the law was passed in response to her 2012 win, when tribal members played a key role in propelling her to an upset over then-Rep. Rick Berg.At the college, she delivered a modified version of her stump speech, tearing into Cramer as someone  with a fundamental lack of understanding on tribal issues. It s part of a harsher line she s taken on him in recent weeks, prompted in part by Cramer s own questionable comments throughout the debate on Kavanaugh. Cramer, in a recent interview with The New York Times, seemed to disparage the Me Too movement that promotes solidarity among sexual assault victims. He called it a  movement toward victimization  that the female members of his own family can t relate to.His comments sparked an emotional response from Heitkamp, including her decision to reveal to the New York Times that her mother was a victim of sexual assault.  It demonstrates someone who is not knowledgeable of what happens to a victim, it demonstrates a callousness, and it s an approach with a certain level of arrogance,  she said.  He s demonstrated a lack of knowledge, he s demonstrated a lack of empathy. Cramer s campaign didn t respond to a HuffPost email requesting a comment, but a North Dakota GOP spokesman referred to the candidate s comments on Tuesday to The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead. Cramer told that news outlet that Heitkamp s response showed she was  unhinged  and that the Me Too movement had been  weaponized   for political purposes at the expense of victims.  Empathy was a subject Heitkamp returned to again and again as she campaigned over the last few days. She mentioned it in her speech in Wyndmere, in the HuffPost interview and during her time on the reservation. We ve lost the ability to be empathetic,  she said at Kekahbah s house.  And our nation is divided. A few minutes later, the women at the gathering formed a circle around Heitkamp.  We re going to just enclose her, and give her all the power we can,  Kekahbah said.Then, she whispered a prayer.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The message blinked onto my phone in the middle of Christine Blasey Ford s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. It came from a rape survivor I interviewed during the 2016 election season, when women were literally becoming ill from watching a man who had bragged on tape about grabbing women  by the pussy  ascend relatively unscathed to the presidency. Twenty percent U.S. households tuned in to watch Ford describe what was probably the worst moment of her life, when, she said, two boys laughed uproariously and turned up the music to drown out her screams while one tried to force himself on her. Women openly cried on the subway as they listened to the testimony on their headphones. I realized halfway through the hearing that my teeth were sore from clenching. As a sexual assault survivor, I pictured myself sitting in front of a callous Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and being grilled on live television by a female prosecutor he had hired because he didn t know how to talk to me. I thought about what it would feel like for my rapist to become a Supreme Court justice   and to replace the swing vote on my most intimate rights. Ford did the best she could under those circumstances and was, by nearly all accounts, extremely credible. The most cynical Republicans had to admit that they at least believed she had been assaulted, and even Donald Trump called her a  very credible witness.  It s just that no matter what she said or how credible she seemed, her story had no effect on their desire to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the highest court in the land. The spectacle was a pointless charade. A woman annihilated herself before the country so that a handful of Republicans could pretend they cared what she had to say.And so women let out a collective primal scream. Women in their 50s, 60s, 70s began calling into C-SPAN   dry, sober C-SPAN   to announce to the world that they, too, had been sexually assaulted decades earlier. Rape survivors angrily confronted politicians in elevators and hallways demanding to be heard, driving one Republican senator to hide in a bathroom. The sharing of stories became so compulsive, so casual, that a cab driver of mine, a woman from Trinidad, volunteered two minutes into a ride that she had been raped twice by a diplomat. I asked if she tried to report the assaults, and she laughed.  Please, they don t even believe white women,  she said.  Why would they believe me?  On Saturday the Senate will likely confirm to the Supreme Court the kind of man many women have known or dated at some point in our lives   the wealthy, entitled frat boy who cries, shouts and lies when you confront him with his behavior, because he has rarely had to face a consequence in his life. And that man will be the deciding vote on major abortion cases, potentially blocking access to the procedure for generations of women. It seemed as if something had changed since the 2016 election. Women got angry, and they poured out their stories, and they mined their pain on social media, and they got up in politicians  faces and begged to be heard. Nationwide polls after Ford s testimony showed that more than half of U.S. women surveyed said they opposed Kavanaugh s nomination and fewer than a third said they supported it. Republicans pretended to listen to them. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) called for a limited FBI investigation shortly after being confronted by sexual assault survivors in an elevator, and he and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) made a show of being undecided up until the last minute. But ultimately, all of the party s unease with the Me Too movement coalesced around the figure of poor, put-upon rich white guy Brett Kavanaugh. A line was being drawn. He was not going to be another guy who went down for a 30-year-old claim, no matter how credible the witness or how many lies he told under oath or how many more people came forward to support her claims. Somehow, Republican men assumed the mantle of victimhood. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) decried the  physical intimidation  of members of Congress by women. Trump lamented that  it s a scary time for young men  but said that young women are  doing great. The government cupped its hands over women s mouths and turned the music up.

Trump also referred to reports that if Democrats gain a House majority in next month s midterm elections, they might pursue impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh. I ve been hearing that now (Democrat) are talking about impeaching a brilliant jurist, a man that did nothing wrong, a man that was caught up in a hoax set up by the Democrats using the Democrats  lawyers, and now they want to impeach him,  Trump told reporters gathered on the White House lawn.Trump suggested that the U.S. public will respond to the drama that ensnared Kavanaugh s confirmation process by changing how they vote in November s elections.  I think a lot of Democrats are going to vote Republican,  he said.Other GOP leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have been insisting that the fight over Kavanaugh has energized the Republican base.Trump s comments came two days after the Senate narrowly confirmed Kavanaugh for the high court. All but one Republican backed him after a brief and limited FBI investigation found no corroboration of the assault allegations Christine Blasey Ford lodged against him. All but one Democrat opposed Kavanaugh.Like Trump, many of Kavanaugh s supporters initially deemed Ford s Sept. 27 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee  credible. But last week, Trump took to mocking her, and his Monday comments continued the criticism of her credibility.On Saturday, Trump said on Fox News that there should be  consequences  for those who accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Steve King (R-Iowa) is prematurely celebrating a possible end to Roe v. Wade now that the Senate has confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Shortly after Kavanaugh s appointment was confirmed, King shared a photo of a sleeping baby wearing a bow and wrote,  Soon, babies like this little angel will be protected in the womb by law. The identity of the baby in the tweet was unclear.Soon, babies like this little angel will be protected in the womb by law. pic.twitter.com/tXYnETjI5SKing, whose white supremacist views the GOP has largely ignored, is one of the most vocal opponents of abortion in Congress.Like other Republicans, he sees Kavanaugh as a justice who would sweeten the chances of reversing Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that affirmed women s constitutional right to legal abortion.But while Kavanaugh s past rulings on access to abortion and contraception may hint at an end to Roe v. Wade, his presence on the Supreme Court doesn t necessarily guarantee it.Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who supports abortion rights but voted to confirm Kavanaugh, argued during a speech on the Senate floor on Friday that Kavanaugh was not going to vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.Collins said he privately assured her that  decisions become part of our legal framework with the passage of time and that honoring precedent is essential to maintaining public confidence. During his hearing in early September, Kavanaugh also described Roe v. Wade as  settled Supreme Court precedent  and acknowledged that it was  reaffirmed many times,  making it a  precedent on a precedent. People responded to King s tweet to highlight the hypocrisy of sharing a photo of a baby girl while supporting policies that hurt women s access to health care, opposing commonsense gun laws in light of school shootings, and supporting a Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexually assaulting a girl when he was a teenager.

Susan Collins (R-Maine) threw her support behind embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a crowdsourced effort to finance her eventual 2020 opponent raised more than $1 million.The whopping sum brought the total amount raised to just about $3.2 million   far more than Collins  last challenger spent in total in the 2014 midterm race. More than 100,000 pledges have been made as of Saturday afternoon, with around 30,000 of those coming in the previous 24 hours.The Crowdpac page was so popular it briefly crashed Friday afternoon. The effort is jointly led by the Maine People s Alliance, Mainers for Accountable Leadership and activist Ady Barkan, who co-founded the progressive Be A Hero campaign. Although she is known as a centrist, Collins  vote all but guaranteed Kavanaugh a seat on the Supreme Court bench. The nominee was confirmed Saturday by a margin of 50-48, one of the narrowest in U.S. history.The left is now dead set on kicking her out of office. Sources told HuffPost that major donors have already pledged an additional $1 million to support voter registration efforts in Maine in an effort to unseat her. She was previously one of a handful of undecided senators before announcing her intention on Friday afternoon to confirm Kavanaugh. Earlier in the day, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he would vote yes, but Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) indicated she opposed the nomination, placing Kavanaugh s fate in the hands of Collins and Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat facing reelection in right-leaning West Virginia. Manchin released a statement immediately after Collins  announcement also pledging his support for Kavanaugh.Before Collins began speaking shortly after 3 p.m. Eastern time on Friday, the Crowdpac page stood at $1,945,000, a representative for the fundraiser told HuffPost. The site charged donors  credit cards when Collins officially voted in favor of Kavanaugh, and the page will remain open for an unspecified amount of time to collect further donations. Organizers told HuffPost the funds will sit in an escrow account until a Democratic opponent emerges. In a statement issued last month, Collins  spokeswoman sharply dismissed the Crowdpac effort as a bribery attempt.Kavanaugh stands accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. His confirmation process was disrupted when the first woman, Christine Blasey Ford, came forward publicly to detail her story in an early September interview with The Washington Post. Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 27, telling senators that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a high school party in 1982.In a Saturday appearance on CNN, Collins suggested that she does not believe the incident happened as Ford says.

This is the worst vote she s ever made in her life,  Be A Hero co-founder Liz Jaff told HuffPost.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) seemed aware of the efforts to unseat her.

We communicate not only with words, but with our body language and demeanor.

It made me sad because I didn t think it was what we would want a president of the United States to do,  she said.Heitkamp s Kavanaugh vote could leave the senator, who is currently trailing in the polls in North Dakota (a state that Trump won by 36 points), even more vulnerable in the midterms. But the senator stressed at a Sunday Oktoberfest event in Wyndmere, North Dakota, that her vote had been based on what was  right  and not political calculus. The political rhetoric is you can t vote that way if you expect to come back. I tell people Ray and Doreen Heitkamp didn t raise me to vote a certain way so that I could win. They raised me to vote the right way,  she said, referring to her parents.CNN noted that Heitkamp received a standing ovation from the event s attendees.Yesterday, I was on @60Minutes to explain why I voted against Judge Kavanaugh to serve on the US Supreme Court.

The Republican base is very much activated. I think the Democratic base was already there,  Ryan told the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. I ve seen it traveling around the country in the last few days, traveling around Wisconsin,  he said.  The Republican base is definitely animated after this. Republicans are defending more than 20 House seats in the midterm elections, just under a month away. Kavanaugh was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court on Monday. His Senate confirmation on Saturday followed weeks of public outcry and debate after three women accused him of sexual assault or misconduct in the 1980s.The allegations threatened to derail the nomination as one of the accusers, California research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford, delivered powerful testimony about the alleged assault before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 27.Ford accused Kavanaugh of pinning her down, groping her and attempting to remove her clothing at a high school gathering in 1982. The details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget,  Ford said in her statement before the committee.  They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult. An angry and belligerent Kavanaugh also testified before the committee, prompting the ACLU, along with hundreds of law professors around the country, to publicly oppose his nomination over concerns about his  fitness  and  judicial temperament.  Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), the swing vote on the committee, voted with his Republican colleagues to move Kavanaugh s nomination to the full Senate but said he could only go forward with the process if Republican leaders agreed to authorize an FBI investigation into Ford s allegation.Following a limited, five-day investigation, Kavanaugh s nomination moved to the Senate floor, where he was confirmed, 50-48. Every Republican but one, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), voted for him. Every Democrat but one, Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), voted against him.Ryan on Monday praised Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who was also considered a swing vote before voting to confirm Kavanaugh and who said in a speech on Friday that she didn t believe Ford s allegation should keep the judge from serving on the country s highest court.

What was done last night in the White House was a political rally,  the former secretary of state told CNN s Christiane Amanpour in an interview published Tuesday. Kavanaugh, who was confirmed by the Senate in a 50-48 vote on Saturday, was sworn in on Monday night by President Donald Trump. During the televised event, Trump apologized for the  terrible pain and suffering  Kavanaugh and his family endured during his confirmation process, which featured multiple sexual assault or misconduct allegations. Trump said during the ceremony that Kavanaugh had been  caught up in a hoax  orchestrated by Democrats. It further undermined the image and integrity of the court. And that troubles me greatly,  Clinton continued.  It saddens me, because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government. Clinton added that Trump s comments are  true to form,  coming from a man who has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 20 women, and who continually attacks and smears survivors of sexual assault.    He has insulted, attacked, demeaned women throughout the campaign, really for many years leading up to the campaign, and he has continued to do that inside the White House,  she said.  .@HillaryClinton told @camanpour the swearing in of Brett Kavanaugh was a  political rally  that  further undermined the image and integrity of the Court @JeffreyToobin:  Hillary Clinton is right  pic.twitter.com/mIMEBWwGzaClinton last week expressed support for Christine Blasey Ford, who testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when the two were in high school. Clinton called Ford s emotional testimony  very credible,  adding:  Why would anybody put themselves through this if they did not believe that they had important information? Kavanaugh, during his Judiciary Committee testimony, ranted that the allegations against him were  revenge, on behalf of  Clinton and her husband, the former president.Ford received an onslaught of online harassment, character assassination and death threats after coming forward, forcing her to move from her home and be separated from her two children. Even after Kavanaugh s confirmation, Ford is unable to return home because of security concerns. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) told reporters Friday that he plans to vote for Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump s nominee to the Supreme Court, following the completion of the FBI investigation into allegations of sexual assault leveled against him,  unless something big changed.  I don t see what would,  he added. The FBI started its probe last week after Flake, the Senate Judiciary Committee s lone swing vote, said he could only move forward with the process if Republican leaders agreed to authorize a limited, week-long investigation into Christine Blasey Ford s accusation against Kavanaugh. The psychology professor has accused the nominee of pinning her to a bed and groping her when they were both high school students.Kavanaugh has denied the allegation, as well as those from two other women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. After reviewing a copy of the FBI s report pertaining to the investigation on Thursday, Flake told reporters on Capitol Hill that he saw  no new  information to corroborate the allegations. The senator, who is retiring this year, said he broke with his party by calling for the investigation in order to restore some legitimacy to the process amid heightened partisan rancor in recent weeks.On Monday, Flake said:  It does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover, for example. We actually need to find out what we can find out. Yet the limited investigation does seem to be giving senators cover to confirm Kavanaugh anyway.Democrats, however, said the investigation failed to interview a number of key witnesses, including many of Kavanaugh s classmates from Yale University. One woman has accused Kavanaugh of misconduct during their time at the school.   It looks to be the product of an incomplete investigation that was limited,  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters on Thursday.Flake s announcement comes as a blow to Democrats, who view Kavanaugh as a serious threat to the Affordable Care Act and women s reproductive rights. If the Senate confirms Kavanaugh, Republicans will cement a reliably conservative majority on the court and tilt the balance of power further to the right for decades. The 53-year-old conservative judge is seeking to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, who sometimes sided with the court s liberals on issues like abortion, gay rights and affirmative action. The Senate is expected to hold its final vote on the Kavanaugh nomination on Saturday. Marina Fang contributed reporting.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Is it though?  asked John Oliver of  Last Week Tonight  on Sunday.  Is it? Because this seems like a way less scary time for young men in America than for old men in America. Oliver noted that there was no step in the confirmation process that had a chance of changing Republicans  plan to get Kavanaugh on the court. Not Blasey Ford s testimony, not the wildly inadequate FBI investigation, not a letter signed by 2,400 law professors saying that they oppose his appointment,  Oliver said.  Not even retired Justice [John Paul] Stephens arguing that after watching Kavanaugh s testimony, he no longer felt that he was fit to serve on the court. Oliver was also highly critical of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), whom he said:  disappoints at a rate normally associated with dinners cooked by divorced dads.  Collins engaged in some spectacular bad-faith bullshit because in announcing her yes vote, she waxed indignant about the dark money that she felt had corrupted this process,  Oliver said.He agreed that there was a lot of dark money involved and that some of the ads in favor of Kavanaugh were misleading.  This entire process wasn t about principle,  he said.  It was just about getting what you want, no matter how you have to do it or what damage it does to Dr. Ford, to other survivors or to our fundamental trust in the Supreme Court. It was borderline pathological. Check out the video above to see what Oliver had to say about the Brazilian presidential election."

Susan Collins (R-Maine), considered a moderate swing voter, fulfilled her promise to vote in favor of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation.The Judicial Crisis Network was very pleased. The dark-money conservative advocacy group, which campaigned for Kavanaugh, announced Tuesday that it is launching a six-figure television and digital ad campaign in Maine to thank Collins for ultimately supporting the judge s successful Supreme Court bid.Never mind that part of Collins  speech last week decried the  dark money  spent on anti-Kavanaugh campaigns. The Judicial Crisis Network, which spends big in attorneys general races and judicial elections, dropped at least $1.5 million to promote Kavanaugh during his contentious confirmation battle. The group s new 30-second TV spot on Collins begins with photos of NBC News  Brian Williams, MSNBC s Rachel Maddow and CNN s Don Lemon as a voiceover says,  Washington is divided more than ever.  In the midst of the chaos, one leader stood out,  the narration continues, flashing to a picture of Collins, whom it praises for being  a reasonable voice in Washington.  As Kavanaugh s confirmation vote loomed late last week, Collins was one of a handful of senators yet to announce a stance on the judge, whom several women had accused of sexually assaulting and harassing them when they were in high school and college. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) voted to oppose Kavanaugh, but Collins joined Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and red-state Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) to ensure his confirmation. He was confirmed in a 50-48 vote, one of the narrowest margins in U.S. history.Collins is now facing a wave of criticism for supporting Kavanaugh. The Judicial Crisis Network s ad buy will likely do little to protect her seat, given the whopping sum her opponents have raised so far.Thanks to a crowdfunding effort, the as-yet-undetermined Democratic challenger for Collins  seat in 2020 has already amassed a war chest of around $3.65 million, as of Tuesday afternoon. Around $1 million of that was raised in the 24 hours after Collins officially sided with the controversial nominee.The crowdfunding page is steered by activist Ady Barkan, who co-founded the progressive Be A Hero campaign, the Maine People s Alliance and Mainers for Accountable Leadership. Barkan kicked off the campaign in mid-August to fund Collins  eventual opponent if she chose to vote for Kavanaugh.An organizer of the crowdfunding campaign told HuffPost the page will be able to receive donations for an undetermined amount of time.Collins  office issued a statement last month dismissing the fundraiser as a bribery attempt.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Members of the media and various senators, she added, have urged her to  shut up  because her allegations were unhelpful.She alleges that Kavanaugh was present at parties during the 1980s where  gang rapes  took place. She didn t accuse Kavanaugh of assaulting women during these sessions, but did claim he used to spike girls  drinks to make them more inebriated. She blamed the Senate Judiciary Committee and the White House for preventing the FBI from interviewing her or any corroborating witnesses in its investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh.  How can they say the claims were not credible when they made no effort to discover whether they were or not?  she wrote.Below please find a statement from my client Julie Swetnick regarding the Kavanaugh nomination. I urge you to read it. pic.twitter.com/kBHL7cm8PiAfter she came forward, her story was subsequently questioned, causing some Democrats to worry that it undermined the strength of other accusations against the judge and fuel the Republican effort to push through his nomination. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) called Swetnick s accusations  outlandish.  Well you know at some point there were a lot of folks coming forward making all sorts of accusations,  said Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) told CNN.  It turns it into a circus atmosphere and certainly that s not where we should be. The Senate narrowly confirmed Kavanaugh on Saturday following weeks of partisan back-and-forth. The accounts of three women, including Swetnick, cast doubt on Kavanaugh s denials of any past misdeeds. His emotional, aggressive response to the allegations also caused many to question his temperament and fitness to serve on the nation s highest court.Ultimately, all Republican senators except Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) voted to confirm him. Only one Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), voted in favor. Kavanaugh was sworn in during a private ceremony later in the day. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

She said Kavanaugh proceeded to grope her, attempted to take her clothes off and covered her mouth when she tried to scream. Ford was 15 at the time of the alleged assault. Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense,  said Ford in her testimony.

He is being held in the Polk County Jail on a $500,000 bond.Patrick posted a series of public Facebook messages in late September, complete with photos of guns and ammunition, threatening to target congressional Democrats and  weak Republicans  if Kavanaugh s confirmation failed, as well as any law enforcement officers  that tried to interfere or come to his house,  Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said during a press conference on Thursday afternoon.Patrick boasted about buying weapons and ammunition, said he was  willing to kill and ready to die  for his cause and claimed to be making arrangement to sell his home  to fund my plan to kill Democrat office holders and their families,  according to authorities. Getting ready if Kav is not confirmed,  Patrick wrote in one post.  Whoever I think is to blame, God have mercy on their soul. According to Judd, Patrick wrote that he would wake up in the middle of the night with these violent thoughts and he tried to rally others to join him. I can t do this by myself, I need more conservatives going into liberal homes at night killing them in their sleep,  Patrick said.Polk County deputies received a tip alerting them to his posts on Wednesday morning and within five hours obtained and executed a warrant on Patrick s home, the sheriff said. FBI agents from a joint terrorism task force worked with local authorities, according to Judd. A .308-caliber hunting rifle, a Desert Eagle handgun and ammunition for both weapons were found in Patrick s home.When he was arrested, Patrick said he didn t think he would get in trouble because he never specifically named any individuals in his threats, according to the sheriff. He also said he  didn t intend to hurt anyone  despite having a rifle in his home that Judd said  is certainly a common deer rifle   it s also a common sniper rifle. Patrick s threats focused on the polarizing nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. Many conservatives have backed the Supreme Court nominee because they believe he will overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights decision. In September, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford came forward with sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh. He denied her accusations, as well as allegations of sexual misconduct from two other women.Last week, Ford and Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, fanning flames on both sides of the political spectrum. After the hearing, Republicans postponed a full Senate vote to give the FBI time to investigate Ford s claim. The FBI investigation was finished on Wednesday. On Friday, senators voted to end debate on Kavanaugh; a final vote on his confirmation is expected Saturday. People need to calm down and chill out,  Judd said during his press conference, referring to both conservatives and liberals, before returning to Patrick s alleged misdeeds. When you threaten people   not just congressmen, not just law enforcement officers   when you threaten to kill, we re going to lock you up.  the sheriff said.  This is serious. Words matter. "

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said during a Senate floor speech Thursday that  some commentators have called this our Atticus Finch moment,  referring to the fictional attorney who defended his African-American client from a white woman s false rape accusation.  (Several conservative commentators cited Finch this week.)  We all remember that Atticus Finch was a lawyer who did not believe that a mere accusation was synonymous with guilt,  Cornyn said.  He represented an unpopular person who many people presumed was guilty of a heinous crime because of his race and his race alone. The Senate is likely to confirm Brett Kavanaugh on Saturday as the next justice on the Supreme Court after Republicans held a successful procedural vote on Friday. For the most part, Republicans have said they do not believe Christine Blasey Ford s claim that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when the two were high school students. At one point in  To Kill a Mockingbird,<U+2033> which takes place in 1930s Alabama, Finch defends his client, Tom Robinson, from a white lynch mob. Robinson is ultimately convicted of the false rape accusation, even though Finch thoroughly discredited his accuser. Cornyn said Finch s spirited defense of his client in the face of threats and intimidation is an example Republicans should follow.  We could learn from Atticus Finch now, during this time when there has been such a vicious and unrelenting attack on the integrity and good name of this nominee,  Cornyn said. During a very brief hallway interview Friday, I asked Cornyn about this analogy   if Republicans are Atticus Finch, does that mean Kavanaugh is a black man in the Jim Crow South?  I ll refer you back to what I said about it,  he said. A Cornyn spokesman declined to comment. The  Mockingbird  analogy doesn t hold up. The context of the accusations against the two men couldn t be more different. Kavanaugh has lived a life of extreme privilege; the fictional Robinson lived in an age of racial terrorism. As the Pulitzer Prize Board explained when it selected Harper Lee s novel for its 1960 fiction award, the book is about more than just a trial.  What starts out quietly as a picture of small-town life is developed with authentic artistry into a climactic courtroom clash, in which not only a Negro prisoner is on trial but also the cherished, age-old mores of the South itself,  the Pulitzer jurors wrote. The Los Angeles Times republished the Pulitzer citation when Harper Lee died in 2016, along with some helpful footnotes, including one for the phrase  age-old mores of the South itself.   When the jurors were writing, the Civil Rights Act outlawing discrimination was still three years away,  the footnote explained.  It had been six years since Emmett Till was killed, six years since Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. As the Civil Rights movement began in earnest, America s problems of racism and discrimination had become part of the national conversation. As Jamelle Bouie reported for Slate, during the Jim Crow era rape accusations by white women against black men could be pretexts for lynching:  In real-life Depression-era Alabama, nine black Americans were lynched between 1929 and 1939; two of the victims were accused of  rape.  Unlike the jury deciding Robinson s fate in  Mockingbird,  the decision before the Senate is not whether Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent, but whether he belongs on the Supreme Court or should remain a federal appeals court judge.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But none of it matters, because once again, they re likely about to vote to carry out his agenda.This time? Confirming an accused sexual predator to the Supreme Court, selected by an accused sexual predator, so they can secure a conservative majority on the court and ensure Trump s judicial legacy for decades to come.Of the Republican senators who have condemned Trump through words but not action, perhaps the chief offender is Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).Flake said Friday that he planned to vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh  unless something big changed.  I don t see what would,  he added.Flake took a tiny stand last week by calling for an FBI investigation into the multiple allegations against Kavanaugh, thus delaying the confirmation vote. It does no good to have an investigation that gives us more cover,  Flake said Monday.  We actually need to find out what we can find out. But after the White House imposed limits on the scope of the probe that Democrats criticized as a sham, the investigation likely did just give lawmakers the political cover to push through Kavanaugh s nomination.Like Flake, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) appeared undecided and pushed for a delay in the confirmation process, urging the Senate to hear testimony from one of Kavanaugh s accusers, Christine Blasey Ford.On Monday, she said she was  confident that the FBI will follow up on any leads that result from the interviews  in its investigation of the assault and misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh. She also expressed concern about the president, calling his attacks on Ford  just plain wrong. Yet after much anticipation and drama, Collins announced Friday afternoon that she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh.Though not a senator who was on the fence about the Supreme Court nominee, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) also tried to assume a principled stand, sort of.Late Wednesday night, Sasse   another Republican senator who has expressed concern about Trump but has backed his policies and appointees   took to the Senate floor with an emotional speech.He first called out lawmakers for a  broken  process and for  grandstanding  for  soundbites,  before hailing the Me Too movement as  very important  and again criticizing Trump s inability  to restrain his impulse to divide us. Joining other Republicans who expressed concern about Trump openly mocking Ford earlier this week, Sasse called the president s disgusting rant  wrong  before recounting the stories of two of his friends who are survivors of sexual assault.Spoiler alert: By Friday morning, Sasse announced he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh, whom he had defended throughout the confirmation process.So much for taking a stand.This is a developing story.

Pres. @realDonaldTrump:  You don t hand matches to an arsonist and you don t give power to an angry left-wing mob - and that s what they ve become.

Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob.  pic.twitter.com/E9r4Xrnrrw In their quest for power, the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob,  said the president, who was in Kansas to drum up support for Kris Kobach, the controversial secretary of state and hardline conservative who s vying to be Kansas  next governor, and GOP congressional candidate Steve Watkins. Each of you will have a chance in just four weeks to render your verdict, on the Democrats  conduct, at the ballot box,  Trump continued, warning of the  profound stakes  in the upcoming elections   especially given the potential future openings on the Supreme Court.  If you allow the wrong people to get into office, things could change. They could change and they could change fast,  Trump said.  You don t hand matches to an arsonist and you don t give power to an angry left-wing mob   and that s what they ve become. The Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern.  At one point in his speech, Trump claimed Democrats, who he referred to as the  party of crime,  had introduced a bill called the  Open Borders Bill    though, as CBS News pointed out, no such bill exists. Trump just making stuff up:  Every single Democrat in the U.S. Senate has signed up for the open borders - and it s a bill. And it s called The Open Borders Bill. What s going on? And it s written by - guess who - Dianne Feinstein. Trump reiterated his staunch support of Kavanaugh, his second Supreme Court pick since taking office. Kavanaugh was accused by at least three women of sexual misconduct but Trump insisted the allegations were part of an elaborate smear campaign engineered by the Democrats   a conspiracy theory that was repeatedly pushed by Republican leaders in the lead-up to Kavanaugh s confirmation vote.  Since right from the moment we announced [Kavanaugh s nomination], radical Democrats launched a disgraceful campaign to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish and destroy,  Trump said at Saturday s rally, prompting loud boos from the crowd.  Brett Kavanaugh is a man of great character and intellect. The president singled out Democratic Senators Cory Booker, Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren, who he again referred to by the derogatory nickname  Pocahontas,  for the  horror  they put Kavanaugh and his family through.   If Democrats are willing to cause such destruction in the pursuit of power, just imagine the devastation they would cause if they ever obtained the power they so desperately want and crave,  Trump said.According to The Washington Post, Trump s support for Kavanaugh was met with great enthusiasm from the Topeka crowd.  Kavanaugh s name elicited thunderous applause, with supporters cheering, fist-pumping into the sky and holding up babies in celebration,  the paper wrote. You don t hand matches to an arsonist, and you don t give power to an angry left-wing mob. Democrats have become too EXTREME and TOO DANGEROUS to govern. Republicans believe in the rule of law - not the rule of the mob. VOTE REPUBLICAN!Trump said earlier on Saturday that he was  a hundred percent  certain that Christine Blasey Ford, the California professor who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers, had named the wrong man.  [T]here is no one with a squeaky clean past like Brett Kavanaugh,  said Trump.  We re very honored that he was able to withstand this horrible, horrible attack by the Democrats.

Susan Collins (R-Maine) resolutely defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh both on his judicial philosophies and against sexual assault allegations, sounding no different than right-wing GOP senators like Orrin Hatch of Utah or John Cornyn of Texas.She validated and rewarded the Trumpian tactics of Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who stacked the deck against Christine Blasey Ford and the others who alleged sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh. Despite his clear and repeated lies, Collins lauded Kavanaugh s  forceful  testimony to the committee denying all of the accusations.Even after that, some in the Beltway media over the weekend were still locked in time, describing Collins, as they always have, as a  moderate.  One New York Times reporter actually characterized her speech as  reasoned [and] carefully researched. But these descriptions were fewer and far between compared to the past. And in Maine, where it matters, a Portland Press Herald editorial called the speech anything but reasoned and careful, clearly identifying what was either naivete or political spin:Even in areas where experts in the field raised warnings, Collins put her judgment ahead of theirs... Only Collins appears to believe that Kavanaugh considered Roe v. Wade  settled law  or that he was deeply committed to preserving precedent, something legal scholars say is inconsistent with the way the Supreme Court works. It makes precedent when it wants to, and it takes only five votes to do it.Similar to the characterizations of the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) despite facts to the contrary, Collins has consistently been described as a  moderate  or a  maverick  by many establishment Washington political reporters, treating her with kid gloves in discussing possible political motivations.Often in a Washington bubble themselves, they ve allowed Collins to perpetuate a myth that she s a principled bridge-builder who rises above partisanship, so much so that she believes it herself and thinks she s invincible. Collins appears to have no idea what she s about to face if she s seeking re-election in 2020 (and she implied she will in a CNN appearance on Sunday defending her support for Kavanaugh), drunk on the standing ovation she received from Republicans on the Senate floor and the accolades that no doubt came in from President Donald Trump s base all across the country.Yes, she voted to protect funding for Planned Parenthood, voted to end the ban on gays serving openly in the military and has defended the environment. These high-profile votes, in a GOP caucus that is so extreme, allowed her to distinguish herself   and allowed some in the Washington press to distinguish her   as someone who was anything but right-wing.But this was always simplistic. Collins voted with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the White House almost 90 percent of the time in the first year of the Trump administration. Her much-heralded vote against Obamacare repeal was negated by her vote for the GOP tax bill. She insisted that in backing that latter bill she got a promise from McConnell that the Senate would consider several fixes to Obamacare   pledges that never materialized. Collins refused to support marriage equality as that debate heated up in Maine over the years and as LGBTQ activists came under vicious verbal assault by extremists in the GOP. She finally came out for marriage equality in 2014, two years after the state became one of the few in which marriage equality was achieved via a ballot measure. Thus, she never actually lifted a finger to help Mainers get equality.She announced her evolution just in time for her re-election bid in 2014, having garnered the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest national LGBTQ group. That backing, along with endorsements of her from abortion rights groups, helped her thwart her Democratic challenger.Collins has since voted to confirm a constant stream of stridently anti-choice, anti-LGBTQ judges nominated to the federal courts by Trump.That includes Kyle Duncan, confirmed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, who wrote the amicus brief for Louisiana and 14 other states to uphold same-sex marriage bans and fought to uphold transgender bathroom restrictions. It includes backing Steve Grasz for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, who received a unanimous  unqualified  rating from the American Bar Association. He d called Roe v. Wade  moral bankruptcy  and sat on the board of a group that promotes  conversion therapy  for LGBTQ minors. Collins voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, who, like Kavanaugh, promised her and the world that he respected precedent, even calling the Obergefell marriage equality ruling  absolutely settled law.  Four months after joining the court Gorsuch wrote a vigorous dissent inviting states to challenge Obergefell.Kavanaugh   who was staff secretary in George W. Bush s White House while it promoted a federal amendment banning same-sex marriage    didn t even go as far as Gorsuch in his hearings, simply saying that Obergefell is law and he  applies the law. Collins  party-line votes on district level and appeals court judges   posts that are a top priority of McConnell s   haven t gotten much media attention. That has only helped Collins   and McConnell   continue to promote the myth of her as a moderate while she votes with the GOP s right-wing on the issues that mattered most to it.Whether she is trying to avert a 2020 primary from the right that Trump could lead against her   he has already threatened Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) with political retribution for voting against Kavanaugh   or she truly believed what she was saying, Collins this time couldn t keep her political machinations under the radar. The allegations against Kavanaugh   and the outrage over him they sparked   placed a glaring spotlight on her vote.Nor could Collins even get cover from her good friends in the Senate   Murkowski was joined by conservative Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota in opposing Kavanaugh, even though the latter lawmaker conceded the vote could harm her re-election bid this year. So Collins stood as the sole so-called  moderate  woman in the Senate to have abandoned millions of women across the country and many others who will be hurt by the court s likely lurch to the extreme right. In this moment, the mask of moderation has been ripped off Collins. There will be those who say that she s untouchable   as they have said in the past   and that Mainers who re-elected her before will do so again. They ll tell you that she ll have plenty of money from the Koch brothers and others, and she surely will.But we re in a different time, both nationally, with regard to the political energy of women and the Me Too movement, and in Maine. Already, people in Maine running a grassroots campaign have raised $3.5 million via crowdfunding to funnel to the Democratic opponent who takes on Collins in 2020. Several potential candidates have emerged in the past few days, as Democratic officials look to a deep pool of possible contenders in the state.Polls in recent weeks found voters in Maine would be less likely to vote to re-elect Collins if she voted to confirm Kavanaugh. And in a Suffolk University poll in early August, she had only a 49 percent favorable rating, down from an impressive 67 percent in a Portland Press Herald 2016 poll. University of New England political science professor Brian Duff told the Press Herald last week that voting against Kavanaugh  would be the more popular choice in Maine and easier for her to recover from, especially if she is able to vote for another conservative appointee later.  Two years, he said, is a long time in politics and  it s hard to see a primary challenger emerging with any strength just because she voted  no  on Brett Kavanaugh. Now that she s voted yes, however, Collins can t put her mask back on.The Human Rights Campaign and several other national LGBTQ groups slammed her for backing Kavanaugh, as did Planned Parenthood and NARAL. It seems implausible that any of these groups would risk their members  outrage by backing Collins in 2020.And what does Collins do about Trump in her re-election year? In 2016, she announced in a scathing Op-Ed that she wasn t voting for him that year, vocally distancing herself from his bigotry and recklessness as Hillary Clinton took Maine in the election. In 2020 Trump   who tweeted accolades to Collins over the weekend   presumably will be on the ballot with her. Will she dare endorse him   or dare to not?As Kavanaugh rules with the far right of the court on issue after issue, as he undoubtedly will, Collins will sink even further, having taken full ownership of this Supreme Court nomination in the end.Collins had a good gig, promoting herself as something she s not. She s now been fully exposed.Michelangelo Signorile is an editor-at-large for HuffPost. Follow him on Twitter at @msignorile. "

Beyond the sexual assault accusation, a number of his Yale classmates have said Kavanaugh lied under oath about his drinking habits. This is one of the reasons I chose him is because there is no one with a squeaky clean past like Brett Kavanaugh,  added Trump, who was thrilled that Kavanaugh was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice Saturday.  We re very honored that he was able to withstand this horrible, horrible attack by the Democrats. Trump also insisted women were  extremely happy  about Kavanaugh s confirmation because they re apparently relieved the men in their lives are less likely now to be accused of sexual assault.  Women were outraged at what happened to Brett Kavanaugh,  he added, according to pool reports.Trump on AF1 was asked about women angry about Kavanaugh s confirmation. I don t think they are,  he said. Women are  extremely happy,  he said,  because they re thinking of their sons, they re thinking of their husbands and their brothers, their uncles, and others. He called protests against Kavanaugh  all phony stuff. Asked if he was certain Ford named the wrong person in her sexual assault, he responded:  A hundred percent.  He seemed to cite the FBI report, but it hasn t been released publicly, so it s not known what he might have been referring to.Ford testified under oath last month that she was  100 percent  certain it was Kavanaugh who she said pinned her on a bed at a high school house party, tried to remove her clothing and placed a hand over her mouth when she attempted to yell for help.The  mistaken identity  narrative was initially floated by Republicans before the Ford testimony last month. Conservative lawyer Ed Whelan suggested in a bizarre series of tweets that a classmate of Kavanaugh s may have assaulted Ford. He named the man and included a photograph of him. He later apologized profusely for insinuating the man was responsible for a crime. He stepped down as the president of a conservative  ethics  think tank in the wake of the scandal.Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she knew the other man named by Whelan very well and that he did not assault her.When asked by Sen Dick Durbin (D-Ill.)  with what degree of certainty  Ford believed Kavanaugh had assaulted her, she responded:  100 percent. Despite Ford s statement, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) also said that she does not believe Ford was assaulted by Kavanaugh.  I do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh was her assailant,  she said on CNN s  State of the Union  in an interview set to air Sunday.  I do believe that she was assaulted. I don t know by whom. I m not certain when. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

And for many, that news feels devastating.Several women have publicly accused Kavanaugh of sexually harassing or assaulting them when he was in high school and college in the 1980s. The discussion surrounding those accusations has been particularly difficult for sexual assault victims, who have heard politicians dismiss survivors  pain amid a barrage of news coverage and heated conversations about Kavanaugh. The judge s controversial Supreme Court bid has also triggered memories that many survivors have worked extremely hard to move past. The Kavanaugh hearing  may cause individuals to re-remember the abuse, have memories and flashbacks. People may also experience guilt and shame if they reported or did not report. Anger and helplessness are also common,  said Elizabeth L. Jeglic, a licensed clinical psychologist, psychology professor at John Jay College and a sexual violence prevention researcher.If you ve been struggling with Kavanaugh s nomination and recent news that the Senate is likely voting him onto the Supreme Court, here are some expert tips for self-care right now: Our breath is one of the simplest and most effective tools we have to calm our nervous system,  said Liz Arch, a certified domestic violence counselor advocate and creator of Primal Yoga. She noted that when someone is stuck in a trauma response, events from the past can replay in their nervous system as if they are happening in the present.  Conscious breathing can help pull us out of the past by giving us a direct anchor to the present moment,  Arch said, adding that it s important to take deep breaths from your abdomen.  When we re anxious, stressed, or panicky, our breath becomes shallow and rapid and shifts into our upper chest. Learning to breathe into our belly   known as diaphragmatic breathing   in particular taps into our parasympathetic nervous system and stimulates the vagus nerve, which has a calming effect on body and mind.   Naming feelings is the only way I have found to keep from drowning in them,  said Alle C. Hall, a writer from Seattle who experienced sexual assault trauma and described the journey of accepting what happened as being  a process.   I keep my feeling list very simple: Joy, shame, pain, anger, sad and lonely,  Hall said. Whenever she finds herself stewing over the Kavanagh vote, she puts her survival practice into action, she says.  Just now, I went to my Facebook page and posted,  I feel sad.  And I feel a surge of energy and personal power. Never fails.   The group-think will be strong and can add to self-righteousness or toxic indignation in the immediate aftermath,  said Nancy Irwin, a trauma specialist and primary therapist at Seasons in Malibu. A Facebook and Twitter hiatus  can allow us to be in acceptance, which is more easily done in calm, quiet and solitude,  she said.Try turning off all social media notifications from your devices, temporarily deleting apps from your mobile devices and tablets, and putting your phone in airplane mode whenever you re not using it. I have been encouraging my clients to not watch the news for a while, as they are being triggered by the constant coverage and this contributes greatly to the feelings of despair and sadness,  said Ginger Poag, a licensed clinical social worker and trauma specialist who has been helping women to cope with the Kavanaugh media coverage over the past few weeks.  I am getting many phone calls where women have been triggered by the news, and trauma that occurred 30 years ago is coming up for them once again. Many of the women have never told anyone of the abuse,  Poag said, noting that staying away from the headlines can help you stop fueling the fire. Watching the news as a bystander can feel radically disempowering and can shut us down into freeze or collapse,  Arch said.  If scrolling through your news feed for hours makes you feel helpless or hopeless, take action instead. Taking action can include signing petitions, attending rallies and donating to causes and organizations that feel supportive and empowering.  Find ways to mobilize, even if it s simply getting together with a group of trusted friends to laugh, cry, hug or shout,  Arch added.The country is extremely divided now, but that also means that people are talking about these polarizing issues and are becoming inspired to take action in the face of political despair. If you re feeling down, take a moment to recognize the good that could potentially come from the news of Kavanaugh s likely confirmation. Michael Brustein, a clinical psychologist in New York City, noted that it s important to stop and realize that many people are very upset and that you are not alone.  The political regression may spur social progress, as it may elicit more civil engagement from the underserved,  he said. Sexual assault victims everywhere can find themselves triggered by news reports about current events and be reminded of their own abuse histories,  said Nikole Benders-Hadi, a board-certified adult psychiatrist at Doctor On Demand.  The confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh and how it has evolved to include sexual assault allegations is one such example, and I do worry about the mental health impact on my patients.  Benders-Hadi recommended that anyone feeling particularly triggered by current events reach out to friends and family for support  to help you process new emotions that are surfacing. She also has one tip for those who find themselves in a support system role:  The most important thing we can do for all victims of assault is to support and validate their feelings,  she said. I encourage my clients to try to fill their time with something positive, such as getting coffee with a friend or taking a walk in nature, which is very healing and therapeutic,  Poag said. This can help you keep your mind off a traumatic or upsetting event and shift your focus. Irwin suggested going to a movie, preferably a comedy.  Our heart muscles have been tensed and strained heavily over the past few days and weeks. Comedy and laughter can relax and restore,  she added.Oftentimes we turn to alcohol if we are feeling overwhelmed or anxious, but experts say that in times like these, self-medicating is not the answer.  It is important to not drink during this period of time, because our emotions become more intensified with alcohol, and in turn, can cause us to feel worse and out of control,  Poag said. Sexual assault prevention lines are there for support even if the abuse happened a long time ago,  Jeglic said. The National Sexual Assault hotline offers free, confidential help by trained staff members who can provide support, information and referrals.  These resources can be an important step in addressing any feelings of re-traumatization that can take place in response to current events,  added Jhumka Gupta, a public health researcher and assistant professor at George Mason University s Department of Global and Community Health who studies the public health impacts of violence and sexual assault on women. My grave concern is that trauma survivors are being triggered by current events to the point that they are having difficulty functioning or finding themselves experiencing persistent or intolerable suffering. It is necessary to have professionally managed trauma therapy if you are in this category,  said Drew Pinsky, a trauma expert and host of KABC Dr. Drew Midday Live. Pinsky added that if you have had previous treatment and are now having trouble functioning, it would be a good idea to revisit the care of a mental health professional.  Trauma-informed treatment works, and without treatment, your nervous system is literally stuck in the traumatic experience, often experiencing the event biologically, again and again,  he said. Trauma survivors may resist treatment because they have an incorrect sense than an incident is behind them or that talking to a professional will mean that the trauma will have to be relived or revivified to resolve, Pinsky said.  That is not the case,  he said.  Well-trained professional will make sure you are only exposed to tolerable doses.  He said that whether it s your local county services, a local university or another training facility, there are numerous treatment options available. You deserve to feel OK.Need help?

Kevin Cramer, believes the Me Too movement makes women weak   and said that s what female members of his family think, as well. Discussing the reactions of his wife, two daughters, mother and mother-in-law to the Me Too efforts to spotlight sexual abuse, Cramer told The New York Times,  They cannot understand this movement toward victimization.   They are pioneers of the prairie. These are tough people whose grandparents were tough and great-grandparents were tough,  he said, seeming to suggest that women who are tough can t be sexually assaulted. Cramer, who polls have shown is ahead in his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in next month s election, also cast doubt on the credibility of Christine Blasey Ford and her allegations that newly minted Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers.Cramer told the Times that Ford, and many of the women who have come forward with stories of sexual misconduct by powerful men during the Me Too movement, shouldn t automatically be believed. Heitkamp, who last week voted against Kavanaugh s ascension to the Supreme Court, responded to Cramer s comments by telling the Times that her mother had to deal with the trauma of sexual assault.  I think it s wonderful that his wife has never had an experience, and good for her, and it s wonderful his mom hasn t,  she said.  My mom did. And I think it affected my mom her whole life. And it didn t make her less strong. Heitkemp, who conceded her vote against Kavanaugh likely would cost her politically in her conservative state, also ripped into Cramer s suggestion that the Me Too movement makes women weak.  It did not make my mom less strong that she was a victim. She got stronger and she made [her children] strong,  she said.  And to suggest that this movement doesn t make women strong and stronger is really unfortunate. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court on Saturday, following accusations by three women of sexual assault or misconduct by him that spurred a limited FBI investigation into Ford s claims. The judge has denied all allegations against him. Shortly after Ford s allegation surfaced publicly last month, Cramer dismissed it as  absurd.  He downplayed the seriousness of her charge because Kavanagh and a friend who Ford said was part of the incident were young and supposedly drunk. This case is even more absurd because these people were teenagers when this supposed alleged incident took place; teenagers,  he said during an interview on a local North Dakota radio show. They were drunk. Nothing evidently happened in it all, even by her own accusation,  Cramer added.  Again, it was supposedly an attempt, or something, that never went anywhere.

Even though evidence shows that Judge Kavanaugh lied repeatedly under oath, every Republican (with the notable exception of Sen. Lisa Murkowski) plus Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin have decided to blindly and stubbornly stand by their man.There s a word for that in Spanish: It s called machismo.Machismo is more than just sexism, chauvinism or even misogyny; it s the belief that men are superior to women. It also refers to the culture that enforces that belief, one which protects male domination and social standing through subjugation, stereotypes and a gentlemen s agreement to have one another s backs.Machismo also fuels violence against women and sustains the culture of impunity we re witnessing today.We in the Latino community are all too familiar with machismo and its effects. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 13.6 percent of Latinas are rape survivors, and 35.6 percent of Latina women have experienced sexual violence other than rape during their lifetimes. Members of our community are also less likely to report sexual assault, oftentimes because of their immigration status and fear of being deported for reporting a crime.Yet, the reality is that machismo and the violence it breeds are not confined to the Latino community. The Me Too movement has shown us that machismo and its effects are present throughout our society   Latinos just happen to have named it.Nearly one in three women will experience sexual assault or violence in their lifetime. Sixty percent of sexual assaults go unreported, largely due to the survivor s reasonable fear of being shamed, retraumatized, revictimized or simply not believed.And when it comes to our political institutions, the Senate has long been the epicenter of machismo.It s a workplace where female senators contend with endless inappropriate remarks, inequities and condescension. It s a lawmaking body that refuses to adequately fund efforts to stop violence against women or impose stronger workplace protections to prevent harassment. The Senate Judiciary Committee is the same group that humiliated law professor Anita Hill and patronized Justice Sonia Sotomayor during her nomination hearings. And it s full of machistas who are well-versed in brushing sexual assault allegations under the rug.That s why it s no surprise that so many senators dismissed Dr. Ford s claims after listening to a testimony that even they found to be moving and credible. The fact they re choosing to confirm Judge Kavanaugh after his belligerent, partisan and unhinged performance only adds insult to injury.Politics doesn t explain how Republican senators (male and female) can simultaneously find Dr. Ford credible and be convinced Judge Kavanaugh did nothing wrong. It doesn t rationalize why they are willing to take the risk of confirming someone to a lifetime tenure on the Supreme Court who is potentially lying under oath about sexually assaulting women, especially when there s a long list of other conservative candidates they could swiftly appoint instead. Politics simply doesn t justify how they can ignore the wave of sexual assault survivors    including many of their constituents   begging the Senate to vote against someone another woman identified with  100 percent  certainty as her aggressor.The mere fact that some of our elected officials are willing to put politics above convincing allegations and the collective pain of so many women is a testament to machismo in and of itself.With a full Senate vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation all but decided, the outcome boils down to one question: Is this spectacle an expression of machismo s lasts gasps for air, or did it signal machismo getting a second wind?This could ve been the moment when the Senate reflected how far we as a nation have come in the Me Too era and conducted a fair, thorough and meaningful inquiry. But in order to do that, it would ve had to put its machismo   not just its politics   aside.Dolores Huerta is a labor leader, women s advocate and civil rights activist who co-founded the United Farm Workers. Andrea Nill Sanchez is a director at The Raben Group."

We saw her. And we believed her. The powerful letter comes just days after Kavanaugh was narrowly confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite Ford s allegation that the judge pinned her to a bed and forcibly groped her when the two were in high school. Both Ford and Kavanaugh testified about the allegation in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in September, and the entire country listened. The gut-wrenching letter was also signed by photographer Amanda de Cadenet, author Glennon Doyle and actresses Tracee Ellis Ross and America Ferrera. At the end of the note, readers are invited to sign the letter as a show of support for Ford.  We remembered our trauma and the trauma of our loved ones,  the women wrote, recalling how they gathered to watch Ford s testimony.  We remembered the times we had not been believed. We remembered the times we had been believed, and disparaged anyway. We remembered how long ago we d put our pain in a box and tucked it away so we d be able to survive in a world that didn t care,  the letter continued.  We were quiet because you d been called to open the box. We were afraid for you. Because we remembered.  A few days ago while trying to figure out what to do with these feelings post-Kavanaugh a group of friends were talking and thought if WE feel this way how must #DrBlaseyFord feel. So we wrote her a love letter. Please sign and share if you are so moved. She will see it. <U+0001F495> https://t.co/JlkKIeUF26Ford s testimony drudged up painful memories and trauma for women and sexual assault survivors around the country. Calls to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network s (RAINN) National Sexual Assault Hotline spiked during and in the days following Ford s emotional testimony. Other sexual assault survivors felt compelled to share their own stories of sexual violence, with many phoning into C-SPAN or confronting senators in the halls of Congress. Burke and the other women thanked Ford for her patriotism and unwavering courage in coming forward.  You raised your right palm toward that committee and you lifted your head toward the sky and you closed your eyes. You stood there, in front of the world, utterly vulnerable,  the letter reads. We witnessed you show up for duty not as a superhero, but as a fully human woman,  the letter continued.  You showed us that the new hero   the kind of heroism called for in this moment   is a woman facing the patriarchy with no weapons other than her voice, her body, and the truth. The letter reiterated that Ford s  sacrifice was not made in vain.   You showed a world of discounted people what courage looks like. You showed us that survival is ongoing and that the journey, while fraught, is also essential. You reminded us that we are neither powerless nor alone because we have the truth   and we have each other. Two other women have also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Kavanaugh has denied all accusations against him. Tuesday was his first day sitting on the Supreme Court.Head over to the Me Too website to read the powerful letter in full. Need help?

The uncorroborated mud and partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members will not have the final say around here,  he said, in reference to the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.The physical intimidation.I don t usually pay much attention to the ravings of craven ghouls, but this line stood out. What ever could he be referring to? Which members of the Senate had been physically intimidated? And then it clicked. McConnell was talking about the survivors of sexual assault who had walked alongside him in an airport and asked if he believed survivors.  Sen. McConnell, why do women have to bare their whole soul to you?  one of the women asked as he ignored them and turned to shake a white man s hand. In that moment, he saw himself as the victim.How many stories does @senatemajldr need before he finally believes women like @traceyecorder & @nainadevi ? pic.twitter.com/BSF85xMMHHSimilar scenes played out all over the nation this week. Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) was also confronted in an airport by survivors, this time on an escalator. He went into a men s bathroom to escape them. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told a rape survivor who confronted him in a hallway to ask if he believed her to  go to the cops.  Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) was cornered in an elevator and forced to look into the eyes of the women who yelled at him. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) was challenged by two women who walked alongside him at an airport to tell them how he would support survivors of sexual violence.  I know this is enjoyable to y all,  he said. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) literally shooed female protesters away as they approached him, urging them to  grow up.  This week I kept coming back to a historical anecdote that opens Good and Mad, Rebecca Traister s new book on women s anger. The year was 1972, the place the Democratic National Convention. The National Women s Political Caucus was at odds with the eventual Democratic presidential nominee, George McGovern, and his campaign over a controversial abortion plank that these women had fought hard to ensure would be in the Democratic Party platform. McGovern had let them down, even inviting an anti-abortion activist to speak. As Nora Ephron described the scene in an essay published at the time, Gloria Steinem yelled through her tears at McGovern s campaign manager, Gary Hart,  You promised us you would not take the low road, you bastards. Later, she spoke to Ephron about her deep frustration with men in power, crying again.  It s just that they won t take us seriously,  she said.  And I m just tired of being screwed. It is 2018, not 1972, and women are still tired of being screwed by the powerful, who are still predominantly rich, straight, white men. When even a woman like Christine Blasey Ford   someone practically precision-engineered to win the sympathy of conservatives, the  perfect  victim, as was too often said   could not break through to Republicans, something fundamentally shifted. The day after Ford and Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Maria Gallagher and Ana Maria Archila confronted Flake as he entered an elevator. The two women shared their stories of having been raped, revealing details they had not shared with their own families, and refused to let him ignore them.  Don t look away from me!  yelled Gallagher.  Look at me and tell me it doesn t matter what happened to me.  The footage went viral, and just hours later, Flake called for a one-week delay in the final confirmation vote to allow for an FBI investigation limited in time and scope. No, this encounter and his actions did not change Kavanaugh s likely confirmation. But it changed the conversation, opening up more space for more women and their allies to try something more radical to force their elected officials to really, truly, maybe listen.On Thursday, I couldn t stop thinking about a line Reese Witherspoon s character says in  Big Little Lies :  I love my grudges. I tend to them like little pets.  I ve begun looking at my rage with that same deliberate affection. Women are told by the culture that rage is ugly and unfeminine. But as Traister argues in Good and Mad, what is worse for women than being angry is dampening that anger, pushing it down and never giving it proper expression.  What is good for us is opening our mouths and letting it out, permitting ourselves to feel it and say it and think it and act on it and integrate it into our lives, and the daily expression of our thoughts and experiences,  she writes. This integration will not   and cannot   look the same for every woman. No survivor is obligated to tell her story publicly (or at all), and certainly not in the ways we ve seen in recent days. It s amazing that this even needs to be said explicitly, but it should not be incumbent on women to perform their pain on the off chance that someone powerful will choose to give a shit. But the lesson of the past two weeks is that a straightforward appeal to the conscience of conservatives is a losing proposition. A more radical approach is needed now. Anger won a weeklong delay. Confrontation made tomorrow s yeas just a little more expensive. Confrontational activism is so effective because it is so personal. It involves entering someone s immediate space. It involves a demand that the powerful individual see the person confronting him (or her) and listen   even if he (or she) doesn t want to.  The lesson from my elevator confrontation is that when we force political leaders to connect with us, with our humanity, we can breathe life into democracy,  Archila said in a statement on Friday morning.  And isn t that what women s rights activists have been screaming from the rooftops for decades? The personal is political, and the political is personal. Judge Kavanaugh s confirmation is no different. It will likely personally affect nearly every marginalized group in this nation.It feels fitting that the final blow to the anti-Kavanaugh resistance came on Oct. 5, when resident nice white lady Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced she would be voting yes on the nominee, exactly one year after Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey s first report on Harvey Weinstein s predatory behavior was published in The New York Times. Three hundred sixty-five days later, women s stories are out there. The curtain has been ripped away, and what s behind it is ugly and horrible and true. The overwhelming feeling of many women who fought Kavanaugh s confirmation is one of exhaustion and even existential despair. This is understandable. But give that grief time to settle and then tend to what s likely living just underneath it: anger, fury, rage. I know it feels like nothing matters.I also know that because of this hellish fortnight, people are going to run for office, and found organizations, and write books, and raise their kids differently.They *want* us to feel like nothing matters, so that we do nothing.I was talking to my therapist this week about how frustrating and depleting living through the last two weeks   and covering them professionally   has been. She urged me to try something different instead of experiencing my rage and despair as a sinking pit in my chest. She told me to  feel it in your fists. Feel it in your fists. To others who understand what the sinking pit is like, I d urge you to do the same. Grasp that anger, that fury, that rage, and feel it burning in your fists. November is coming.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Susan Collins (R-Maine) certainly deserves criticism for her 11th-hour decision to support Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court. But the outrage over one woman s vote is now veering into sexist territory.Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women. He broke down in a public, partisan temper tantrum and repeatedly lied to and misled the Senate. Collins, who is known as a moderate, was said to be troubled by the spectacle. She was publicly undecided until the end, joining 49 other senators on Saturday, including five women, to vote for the nominee. In the following days, she said some regrettable things about  believing women  that don t particularly make sense in light of her decision.Progressives trashed Collins for all this. She was labeled  fraudulent  and  a betrayer of women.  She and the other four women who voted for Kavanaugh were essentially called gender traitors in a  Weekend Update  segment on  Saturday Night Live.  The fact that she announced her decision in a 45-minute speech was viewed by some as a shameful grab for attention.It s all a bit over the top. Collins was one of 50 senators who voted for Kavanaugh. There were 45 men who had no problem putting an accused sexual assailant on the bench.Collins is a woman, though, and one with a centrist reputation. The expectations she faced were of a different caliber. No one believed for a second that men in the GOP would empathize with women who ve been sexually assaulted, or that they d even take a woman seriously over the bluster of a white man who went to Yale.But why are Republican men held to such a low standard? Seeing women as human beings shouldn t be something we only expect women to do. In expecting Collins to somehow get women s plight, we re reinforcing the idea that women are the ones that can better recognize the trauma of sexual assault,  said Nikki Usher, a media professor at the University of Illinois.  That reinforces sexual assault and sexual harassment as  women s issues  that men cannot fully understand, which seems to me to be the opposite of what we d want to have happen here. The sexism goes deeper still. Researchers have found that women are judged more harshly for making decisions than men   particularly when the women are leaders in a male-dominated field. (Eighty percent of senators are men.)Think, for example, of how Hillary Clinton was judged for deciding to use a private email server, versus how Donald Trump s been judged for, well, a lot of things. When a man faces a hard decision, he only has to think and focus on making a judgment,  said Therese Huston, the author of How Women Decide, in an interview with Harvard Business Review.  But when a woman faces a similar hard decision, she, especially in business, has to think about both making a judgment, and she also has to navigate being judged.  If a woman takes her time and deliberates before coming to a conclusion, she s viewed as indecisive and  dithering,  Huston said. When a man takes his time, he s seen as strategic. Women are also expected to make  collaborative  decisions. When they do things, it can t just be to their advantage; they re expected to make decisions that serve the greater good. In the case of Kavanaugh, you can see how Collins was in a bind. Was she supposed to act collaboratively within her party? The pressure was obviously extremely high to go along with the boys. Or was she supposed to act collaboratively with her gender? She had four other Republican women senators voting for Kavanaugh to turn to.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) hid behind Collins, waiting until after she made her decision to publicly say he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh. He hasn t been as widely criticized. I d like to see Manchin start to get some serious questioning to the same degree,  Usher said.  How funny would it be if we said, Joe, you ve got a wife and daughters, shouldn t you understand this?

After baselessly arguing that Democrats didn t even read the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh and questioning whether Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) looked confident, Bongino said that he is dedicated to  owning the libs.  That s it. The libs, because they have shown themselves through this Kavanaugh abomination of a process to be   I m talking about the libs on Capitol Hill and sadly some of these radical groups   to be pure, unadulterated evil, what they did to this guy,  he said. You have to lose, I m sorry. We win, you lose, the new rules are in effect. My life is all about owning the libs now. We have got to get this guy appointed on the Supreme Court. With those words, Bongino effectively became a living, breathing meme   the face of the right-wing phrase  own the libs. In July, Eve Peyser in Rolling Stone described the concept of  owning the libs  as  blatant self-sabotage for dumb political reasons.  She wrote,  To  own  someone on the internet is to dominate and humiliate them, and the  libs  can loosely be defined as anyone to the left of Sean Hannity. Peyser said the phrase  own the libs  came about in 2015 when someone  tweeted at Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes, attaching a photo of himself lying face down in a dumpster.  User @randygdub then tweeted,  Thinkin about the one guy who laid down in a dumpster to own libs online and hoping ted cruz does it too. NRATV is no stranger to stirring up controversy. Last month,  Relentless  host Dana Loesch attacked the children s show  Thomas & Friends  for introducing an African tank engine named Nia and even depicted the show s characters with Ku Klux Klan hoods on their heads.The imagery sparked serious backlash on social media. Mattel, which owns the Thomas the Tank Engine brand, told The New York Times that the company is  not associated with images that promote hate and denounce any images of our brands that are being used to convey a message not in line with the values of the company.

Ford, a California psychology professor, told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh held her down on a bed, covered her mouth, and attempted to forcibly remove her clothing when the two were in the high school.  This is the alleged sexual assault victim. Wow,  Lancaster wrote in his post with the picture of a young woman in braces wearing large glasses, according to the News & Observer. The photo isn t Ford. It s actually a meme that has circulated the internet since at least 2012.When contacted by the News & Observer, Lancaster was unapologetic and attacked the media. I didn t say anything,  Lancaster said.  I just said this is her picture. Basically, the media is distorting the facts on this lady. Everything she s said is made up. She has no evidence whatsoever. I support that theory. Then he launched into a further slam on Ford s physical appearance. The media wants you to think she was a beautiful young lady who was on her way home from the tennis courts,  Lancaster said.  I just wanted you to see the real person. I wanted people to see that this is really her. It s not.On Sunday, the executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, Dallas Woodhouse, said Julie Swetnick   another Kavanaugh accuser   is a  criminal  who helped to  facilitate child rape. This woman is a criminal. One way or another.   She either was a part of some massive criminal conspiracy to facilitate child rape, as an adult.  Or more likely, she lied to Congress  and her attorney knew it.   She should go to prison, period. https://t.co/VDKbcB5Pz0Swetnick has alleged she was victim of a gang rape at a high school party where Kavanaugh was present.Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, told HuffPost Woodhouse s comments were  the most blatant example of shaming a sexual assault victim yet. President Donald Trump himself has defended some of the sexual misconduct allegations against him by ridiculing the physical appearance of accusers.  Look at her ... I don t think so,  he said of one. The president also mocked Ford during a campaign rally Tuesday night in Mississippi: I had one beer, right? I had one beer!  Trump said to laughter, pretending to recount Ford s Senate testimony.  How did you get home? I don t remember. How d you get there? I don t remember. Where s the place? I don t remember.

Susan Collins doubled down on white supremacy and patriarchy in America. Women and survivors of all genders will never forgive her for it. In a 43-minute speech last Friday, Collins managed to dismiss survivors, argue in favor of a man accused of sexual assault, and advance Donald Trump s white supremacist political agenda. While a lot of people had been holding out hope for her to vote against confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, I wasn t surprised. Like many people of color, on a gut level, I expected this outcome. We ve seen the system (and white women) fail us over and over again.Collins complained that Kavanaugh was being sentenced by public opinion and denied due process   an argument with which I m familiar. I ve been working on the issue of automatic criminalization for a long time. I ve spoken out, marched and organized against the lack of a presumption of innocence granted to Tamir Rice, Kalief Browder, Stephon Clark, Chikesia Clemons.After listening to the senator s speech, I joked about welcoming her into the movement. But of course she wouldn t do anything like that. Because the people typically impacted by automatic criminalization are not white conservative men.If Kavanaugh s confirmation hearing exposed anything besides his belligerence and questionable grasp of the truth, it was that the power white men take for granted is under threat. And there are white women who will stop at nothing to protect it.Women of color have always known there is no justice for us under this current system. Many of our white sisters in the struggle woke up to that reality with the election of Trump. That awakening continues to this very day. It s time for the 47 percent who voted against Trump to collect their white sisters. We need them all to choose us, their fellow women, over the white men who hurt all of us, but who grant white women a little bit of power along the way.  White women are finally feeling the rage we have felt for the last 400 years. They are feeling the powerlessness we ve wrestled with for generations. It s time for them to stand with us   behind us   to ensure equity and justice for all women, for all people. They don t have to start from scratch. Women of color, particularly black women, have sacrificed for years, laying the groundwork in the process. Exhibit A: Anita Hill, who nearly three decades ago testified before an unsympathetic Judiciary Committee in a world that was nowhere near ready to hear her truth, opened the floodgates for women to speak out about sexual harassment and assault. Dr. Hill faced many of the same threats as Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, but without a national Me Too movement seeing and supporting her. Like many women of color and unlike Dr. Ford, she wasn t extended empathy or permitted any vulnerability. Her testimony before a group of white men (many of whom are still in elected office) who coldly questioned her credibility, marked one of the first times women openly challenged rape culture in America. As Brittney Cooper has written, black women s status at the absolute bottom of the American hierarchy, with no access to male or white privilege, has meant that we literally have nothing to lose and everything to potentially gain by putting our bodies on the line. We ve done this time and again. We cannot keep doing it on our own. In some ways, white women have more to lose by rejecting white male patriarchy. But they also have everything to gain. The treatment of Dr. Ford showed once and for all that whiteness is not enough to protect white women from patriarchy. It s time for white women who are outraged, marginalized and silenced to stand up and speak out for all of our rights. I don t say this to shame white women. I say this because unless we approach these challenges from a place of truth and courage, we will never win.We need them to get comfortable with discomfort, to check their fellow white women when they prop up white supremacy and white male patriarchy, to sacrifice their bodies and support our work with their dollars as well as their voices. That means showing up, and showing out, but also centering and lifting up our voices and experiences. It means voting for women of color who will fight to end rape culture, white supremacy and patriarchy.From the first day of the hearing until this past week, where thousands shared their survivor stories and turned their pain into action, we ve come together to resist this nominee. For two years, we ve fought back against Donald Trump s white supremacist agenda. Now, women are mobilizing en masse like never before: all ages, races, religions, disabilities, sexualities and gender identities. We are running for office in record numbers. We are occupying Senate offices and the Capitol steps, and storming the doors of the Supreme Court.We re revealing our deepest traumas no matter the consequences and we are no longer containing our fury. Instead, we re using it. We will no longer accept the white, male death grip on power as a foregone conclusion. In 2017, during the Women s March on Washington   which I helped organize and which was the largest single-day protest in U.S. history   we came out in search of hope. But hope alone isn t enough. In November, we will replace rape apologists with the women the march inspired to run against them. In January 2019, we re coming back with an agenda to end rape culture, white supremacy and patriarchy in America. Our pussy-grabbing president thinks we ve given up. We haven t. Over the last five weeks, we ve rocked the foundation of the white male patriarchy. And judging from their tantrums, white men (and the white women who support them) are starting to understand that their time in power is coming to an end. This is just the beginning of a women s wave that will not stop until the country, its laws, its policies, its systems provide justice and equality for us all.Tamika Mallory is an esteemed social justice leader, advocate and activist."

Have a topic you d like him to take on? Email askdoyin@huffpost.com.As a mom of two young boys, I felt conflicted while watching Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. I believe women, but I also worry that my sons could someday have their lives forever changed because of something stupid they did during childhood. How do I reconcile these feelings (and protect my sons)?  Kate in HoustonLet s not get it twisted, Kate. Getting caught playing ding dong ditch qualifies as stupid stuff during childhood. Sexual assault is criminal stuff   and that s what Kavanaugh is being accused of here.Last week s hearing was essentially a highly publicized job interview, not a criminal trial, so I m not going to spend time debating this dude s guilt or innocence. But I will address a disturbing trend I ve been noticing lately.Parents all over the country are admitting their fears that their sons will one day be accused of sexual assault and that it could ruin their lives. So let s look at the data. False reports of sexual assault and rape account for only about 2 to 8 percent of reports. This number falls in line with most other falsely reported felony crimes, so the chances that your sons will be wrongfully accused are very low. Plus, only 1 in 3 sexual assault victims reports the crime to the police. So rest easy, Kate: If your sons do sexually assault someone, they ll likely get away with it. (I hope my sarcasm was clear enough for you.)Since 1989, only 52 men have had their sexual assault convictions overturned because they had been falsely accused   compared with almost 800 people exonerated of murder during the same time frame. So if you think for a second that false accusations of sexual assault forever changes the lives of men at a rate remotely comparable with how real sexual assault affects the lives of survivors, then I really don t know what to tell you.And to be honest, I m having a hard time understanding how you can write that you  believe women  but are worried about your sons in the same sentence. That s just another version of  Some of my best friends are black. If you truly believe women, then you d understand that sexual assault survivors are the ones who are never the same afterward. Many of the women (and men) I know who were victims of such heinous crimes have dealt with or still struggle with mental illness, suicidal feelings or living in a state of fear or have spent countless hours in therapists  offices just to remain functional human beings. Hell, one woman I know sleeps with a baseball bat in her bed every night; she was raped at 12 years old. She s 39 now.But look on the bright side, Kate. You know what your boys will never have to do? Fan their keys between their fingers like Wolverine from  X-Men  as they walk to their car at night. Ask a trusted friend to watch their drink when they go to the bathroom at a party so they don t get drugged. Spend the night at a friend s house because some creepy  admirer  won t leave them alone. And you re here wallowing in the myopia of the off chance your boys will be falsely accused of sexual assault? Please take all the available seats.My parents raised three boys, and I promise you they never worried about us sexually assaulting people. Why? Because they taught us to respect the boundaries of others and have a basic understanding of consent. If you want to protect your boys, I suggest you do the same. Because the boys who aren t taught these lessons grow up to become our doctors, teachers, elected officials, coaches, co-workers, neighbors and potential Supreme Court justices who believe they are entitled to do whatever they want with others  bodies without consequences. And no one wins in that scenario.The overwhelming majority of men who commit sexual assault are walking the streets with us today, and they don t have signs around their necks reading,  I M A RAPEY SCUMBAG! BEWARE!  As a dad raising two girls, I m tired of contending with parents who believe it s totally normal for boys to be handsy whenever they feel like it. It s not normal. It s criminal. Teach that to your sons, and they will do just fine.My neighbor and I both have daughters in the second grade. Hers is an excellent reader, speaks multiple languages and excels in sports. My daughter is the kindest kid in the world, but she struggles with school and doesn t play any sports. My neighbor constantly talks about how great her daughter is in front of me and makes passive-aggressive comments like,  School is challenging for other kids, but it s so easy for Samantha. I must be doing something right as a mom.  She makes me feel like the worst mom on the planet. Should I confront her?   Deb in Portland, OregonSamantha is not a perfect child   and I can say that confidently without ever meeting her. Don t be fooled by these social media moms and dads who share only the highlight reels of their kids  lives, Deb. Everyone has their shit. Some people just choose to be dishonest about it.You know what you re doing right as a mom? You re raising the kindest kid in the world   which is a much stronger testament to your parenting abilities than raising a star athlete or star student. Don t freak out about your daughter s academic woes. I struggled big time in school as a kid. It took me longer than most to learn how to read, and I had a horrendous speech impediment that lasted throughout elementary school. Today I m an author, a writer and a keynote speaker   because I have parents who believed in me and provided the extra help I needed when I was young. I have a feeling you ll do the same for your little one too.But this brings up a larger point: the stress you re feeling about parenting. Almost 80 percent of American adults surveyed by Pew said they believe moms feel pressured to be amazing at raising children. I m here to say most fathers don t deal with that. If a dad posts a photo with a kid in a baby carrier while making a ponytail for his other daughter, he s viewed as a hero. (I know this because I ve been the one wearing the figurative cape.) Moms? They don t have the same luxury.Nothing removes the joy from parenting faster than comparison, and comparisons are everywhere. It s about whose kid walked first, read first, learned a second language first, won a tournament first, got into college first, ad nauseum. But does any of that really matter? Parenting isn t a professional sport, and no medals are handed out for raising our kids well. Why? Because the great secret of parenting is that none of us know what we re doing! We re all just doing the best we can while trying not to significantly damage our kids in the process.Should you confront your neighbor? Nah. I could be wrong here, but it seems the main reason you feel inclined to do so is based on your own insecurity. And   going out on a limb again   I believe it s your neighbor s insecurities that prompt her to keep boasting about her kid s accomplishments.If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at will change. When your neighbor goes on about her daughter, simply congratulate her and move on. What that little girl does has zero bearing on your daughter or your parenting abilities.Remember: You are a great mom raising a kind girl. You should believe that with all your heart, and if you don t, just ask your daughter. She ll agree with me.Doyin is a father, husband and author dedicated to creating and celebrating a world of great fathers.

Carlson, referring to toxic masculinity as a  made-up dumb feminist term  and the product of a  bunch of ludicrous low-IQ academics making it up as they go along,  questioned whether Mayer s comments were merely a  pre-emptive strike against further accusations  that would name the singer-songwriter. Tucker s body is definitely not a wonderland https://t.co/nJfNxBW1kl There is more evidence he s hurt women than there is for Brett Kavanaugh, that doesn t mean his rant was surprising. Harvey Weinstein, you ll remember, was a big defender of women too. Do we sense a theme here?  Carlson said.Two women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault and a third alleged he was present during a gang rape. Mayer in the past has made idiotic sex-related comments, but doesn t appear to have ever been accused of sexual misconduct.Carlson went on to question his guest, political commentator Anushay Hossain, whether lines of Mayer s song  Your Body Is A Wonderland  constituted toxic masculinity.  One pair of candy lips andYour bubblegum tongue  in a  @JohnMayer<U+2069> song is what offends  @TuckerCarlson<U+2069>?

A man who is not so inclined is willing to hear out what another is saying, shows respect by not interrupting every few seconds and doesn t mock their opinions or statements of fact. He can t stand it. Toxic masculinity isn t about saying  Your Body Is A Wonderland.  It s actually about men being violent towards women,  Hossain replied.  That song was written for his girlfriend at the time. Hossain continued:  What s so controversial about what John Mayer said? What s so controversial about that he s saying don t feel entitled to women and this is coming on the heels of an intense time in this country. Watch the full segment in the clip above. "

Kavanaugh may have been a rowdy, at times unruly, youth,  writes Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker.  But barring future evidence to the contrary, this doesn t make him a sexual predator. But the three-decade absence of any other sexual misconduct allegation is not proof that the Supreme Court nominee is innocent. And that line of defense betrays a fundamental misunderstanding about the types of men who commit acts of sexual aggression against others. In fact, it is actually fairly common for sexual offenders to commit their crimes only in their teen or early adulthood years, said Kevin Swartout, an associate professor of psychology at Georgia State University. We have this group of guys who offend in high school, and if they offend in college, it s within the first year or two of college,  said Swartout.  By the end of college, they just don t offend anymore. HuffPost talked to Swartout about his research to learn more about this group. While Swartout was not saying that Kavanaugh was among this group of youthful sexual offenders, he did say that his research shows it s possible for young men to assault women and then go on to never behave that way again. Swartout studies the social factors that influence violence against women, as well as how alcohol use is linked to aggressive behavior. In general, he said, people who exhibit antisocial behaviors like sexual assault break down into two groups. Researchers call the first group  life course persistent,  which means that they perpetrate antisocial acts throughout their lives and may even turn into career criminals. But there s another type of antisocial behavior known as  adolescence limited.  These offenses are committed in teen and early adulthood years, but a mix of things like a changing social context, the full maturation of the brain and their entry into adult society lowers the risk of future antisocial behavior. Do they go on to be loving parents and loving husbands and model citizens? We don t know that,  said Swartout.  But I would say that it does make sense that you re not seeing the reports of sexual violence continue. When we think about sexual predators, the image that most often comes to mind is a small minority of men who rack up countless victims over the course of decades. This has held true in investigations into Catholic priests who get transferred from parish to parish and molest hundreds of children over the course of their lifetime, and the series of Me Too investigations inspired by the New York Times  unmasking of Harvey Weinstein, who used his power and influence to rape women and then silence them by threatening their livelihoods.But Swartout s research reveals that most men who commit sexual assault in their teen and early adult years report only doing so within a limited time frame, and that the likelihood of committing rape changes as time goes on and the men transition from high school to college. For instance, his 2015 survey found that many who commit a rape in high school don t do it again once they re in college. He also found that most men who commit rape in college did it once, complicating the mainstream narrative of the serial sexual predator.Why is this? Why would a man rape a woman once but then never rape someone again? The answer may have to do with the friends he has, how much he drinks and what his views are toward women, Swartout explained. Risk factors for rape that are inherent in the individual have to do with that the popular press and social media refer to as  toxic masculinity.  This is a set of attitudes among some men that pit them against women because of the belief that all women are out to get them, that women are inherently untrustworthy and that all interactions with women are adversarial. Swartout declined to speculate on the credibility of Kavanaugh or his accusers, including Blasey and Ramirez. Context also matters, said Swartout, and the two biggest factors are heavy drinking and having a friend group that encourages violence against women.  These guys aren t wearing T-shirts that say,  Hey, I m a sexually violent guy, and if you are, too, come hang out,   Swartout explained. Instead, acceptance of sexual violence against women is more subtle, and it is hidden in a way of speaking to and about women as if they are objects that can be traded or shared.  Comments that objectify women and take away individuality and choice  are key signs that a male friend group might be encouraging or accepting of sexual assault, said Swartout. Research on the influence of male peers on those who commit rape finds that sexual assault perpetrators feel more pressure from their friends to have sex by any means and that their friends make more objectifying statements about women compared with the friend groups of men who don t commit sexual assault.In Ford s and Ramirez s allegations against Kavanaugh, his friends   and their shared laughter at the victim   are prominent in their memories. Ford testified that the most salient memory she had of that day as a teen was the laughter that he shared with Mark Judge, and Ramirez said that a group of people were egging Kavanaugh on as he laughed and shoved his penis in front of her face.Swartout s research shows that diverse friend groups and tightly knit friendships lower the risk of both hostile attitudes toward women and sexual violence against women.  If a young guy [who perpetrated sexual assault] goes off to college and makes friends with a peer network that isn t supportive of sexual violence and doesn t drink as much, that removes some of the risk factors,  he said. Swartout points out that the majority of men who socialize in environments where there s heavy drinking and opportunity to assault women don t victimize anyone. He also noted that you don t have to be a man to express hostility toward women.But the acceptance of non-consensual sexual contact because  boys will be boys,  or the downplaying of assault as an inevitability that girls must put up with, all contribute to social factors that raise the risk of sexual assault. If contexts can change, so can behavior. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Susan Collins, allegedly one of two remaining Republican moderates in the Senate, to save us from Brett Kavanaugh have not studied her record.The Maine senator has reduced the choreography of legislative head-fakes to a sublime art, in order to preserve her bogus reputation as an independent-minded centrist. When a contentious issue arises, Collins will elaborately explain that she hasn t made up her mind yet. She needs to give the issue careful study. And then, wondrously, after very careful and well-advertised study, she almost always votes with Mitch McConnell. Funny how her research invariably leads to that conclusion.She is especially loyal to her party when her vote is pivotal on important legislation or nominations. She has voted to confirm virtually all of President Donald Trump s nominees. Collins also voted for the Trump tax bill (which passed 51-49) and for the confirmation last year of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.In the most drama in which she played a critical role, Collins joined two other Republicans in calling for what turned out to be a rigged FBI inquiry. She then voted to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court   not with ambivalence but almost giddy enthusiasm. In her floor speech on Friday announcing the decision, she did not present her conclusion as a close or difficult question. To hear Collins tell it, Kavanaugh s record on a federal appeals court shows that he s the most even-handed and brilliant jurist since King Solomon.In 2017, according to a tabulation by CNN, Collins voted with her party 87 percent of the time. The average Republican backed the GOP caucus position 96 percent of the time.For the most part, the times when she broke ranks were not decisive. One exception when defying the Republican leadership proved important was her vote (with Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and then-Sen. John McCain of Arizona) in 2017 to save the Affordable Care Act.If anything, though, Collins has become far less of a maverick of late. Under Barack Obama s presidency, she voted with Republicans only about half the time, compared to almost 90 percent today.What s at work? Three things. First, Republicans have become far more unified   in the country and in the Senate   as a far-right party. Second, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) plays serious hardball to enforce caucus discipline. But the biggest influence is Collins  fear of the Tea-Party far right in Maine.The state has twice elected a far-right governor, the thuggish Paul LePage, who prefigured Trump. LePage, who steps down after this year, did not win a majority of votes either in 2010 or 2014. But given the unfortunate habit in Maine of spoilers throwing elections to Republicans, LePage squeaked through both times in three-way contests.Maine as a whole is not a far-right state. Its other senator is Angus King, a moderately liberal independent who caucuses with the Democrats. But the Tea Party right is a majority of the Maine Republican Party.Thus Collins, according to my sources, felt she had more to fear when she runs for re-election in 2020 from a GOP primary challenger than from newly energized Democrats.Both fears may well be exaggerated. She is broadly popular as a Maine icon, and is still the odds-on favorite to win re-election.When Collins does break ranks with her party s Senate leadership, as in her vote to save the Affordable Care Act., it s often because the vote is popular in Maine. Obamacare s Medicaid expansion, for instance, had broad public backing, despite LePage s efforts to delay it.To put it charitably, the popular Collins could afford to take more risks on behalf of whatever principles she still professes. In the Kavanaugh affair, the senator was far from a profile in courage.Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and a professor at Brandeis University s Heller School.

Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) insulted Christine Blasey Ford by suggesting the psychology professor is confused about her assault. She says that Dr. Ford thinks that she was assaulted, which is even more insulting than saying that she gave a very credible account,  Hirono told CNN on Sunday of her GOP colleague, who helped pave the way for Kavanaugh s confirmation by a 50-48 Senate vote on Saturday. To say that she thinks that Dr. Ford thinks that she was assaulted, what is that? Is she mistaken?  Hirono said, adding that  anybody watching  Ford s testimony would conclude she was being truthful about her story..@maziehirono on @SenatorCollins:  She says that Dr. Ford thinks that she was assaulted, which is even more insulting than saying she gave a very credible account.  #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/K6MkLPlAlbWhen asked about Ford s testimony in a Sunday interview on CBS   Face the Nation,  Collins said she is  convinced that Dr. Ford believes what she told us and that she was the victim, a survivor of sexual assault.  However, Collins maintained that  we have a presumption of innocence in this country  and given the lack of evidence she saw that could corroborate the allegation she  could not conclude that Brett Kavanaugh  was Ford s assailant. I do believe that she was assaulted. I don t know by whom. I m not certain when,  Collins added in a separate interview on CNN s  State of the Union. Ford rejected the mistaken-identity theory floated by Republicans and Kavanaugh advocates when she testified under oath last month that she was  100 percent  certain it was Kavanaugh who she said pinned her on a bed at a high school house party, tried to remove her clothing and placed a hand over her mouth when she attempted to yell for help.  The details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult,  Ford said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in September.Still, Republicans and even some Democrats have continued to doubt her memory of the alleged incident, citing the lack of  corroborating  witnesses from the party.  Something happened to Dr. Ford. I don t believe that the facts show it was Brett Kavanaugh,  Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), the lone Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh s nomination, said Saturday before the Senate vote.President Donald Trump, meanwhile, said he s  a hundred percent  certain that Ford named the wrong person when she said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her.Clarification: A previous version of this story and an alert incorrectly framed Hirono s criticism of Collins. Hirono was referring to Collins  comment that Ford  believes  she was assaulted, not to Collins  statements about the identity of the assailant.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

They marched by the thousands. They screamed in the faces of their elected officials. They gritted their teeth and, once again, told horrifying stories of sexual abuse, so that their friends, family and colleagues might be heard too.They were  still doing so Wednesday.This worries the right-wing media and the politicians who read it. Even after Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation to the Supreme Court, conservative news is trying to downplay, belittle and flat-out lie about protesters. Fox News, The Washington Times, Town Hall and The Daily Caller, among other outlets, latched on to storylines about  paid protesters  attending various anti-Kavanaugh rallies. The Blaze called the demonstrators  unhinged  and said their numbers were padded by  liberal celebrities ; a Fox News contributor called them  screaming animals  who should be  tasered, handcuffed and dragged out of the building ; Town Hall even published a column comparing the Kavanaugh protesters to Kermit Gosnell, a doctor who was convicted of murdering three infants. The darkness of evil infiltrated the nation s capital during the Senate confirmation process of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh,  Town Hall columnist Rebecca Hagelin wrote.  You could feel the vitriol in the shrills of protesters interrupting the hearings and the confirmation vote. The list goes on. To conservative media, liberal women are rabid in their efforts to take down Kavanaugh; the wider point about the Me Too movement and the reproductive rights at stake are lost in the outrage. For some of the more extreme, Infowars-style websites on the right, fear-mongering headlines aren t a surprise. But the content pipeline between those sites, Fox News and the president s Twitter account is extremely short.With each day comes another round of stories portraying peaceful protesters as either violent or part of a bad-faith campaign funded by liberal donors. President Donald Trump thinks anti-Kavanaugh demonstrators were a little of both, calling victims of sexual assault who cornered their congressmen  paid D.C. protesters  and  screamers : The paid D.C. protesters are now ready to REALLY protest because they haven t gotten their checks - in other words, they weren t paid! Screamers in Congress, and outside, were far too obvious - less professional than anticipated by those paying (or not paying) the bills!Trump has been using this tactic against protesters since his presidential campaign, and he often gets his ideas for such rhetoric from the media he consumes. This particular outburst likely came from a Fox News segment, in which Wall Street Journal writer Asra Q. Nomani said that protesters are  waiting for their check. Nomani, who once famously wrote about casting her vote for Trump, had been brought on air to talk about her op-ed claiming the  protests and unlawful disruptions  were staged by a  well-funded network.  She later backpedaled and said that  most individual protesters are not paid,  but called the protests  not organic.  Her comments gave the appearance of credibility to this conspiracy theory: Here was a Wall Street Journal writer   a former reporter for the paper, no less   claiming to be a  liberal feminist  and yet implying that there was some sinister connection between billionaire George Soros and protesters.Nomani may have been unable draw a connection between paid organizers and real protesters   of which there were thousands in D.C. over the course of last week alone   but she didn t have to. The headline of her story was all anyone needed:  George Soros s March on Washington.  That, and her comment on Fox News, allowed Republicans to make that connection for her, even though it s not true.If organizers getting paid were a scandal, every Trump rally would be a scandal. But a scandal is what Republicans needed, and Nomani s poor judgment helped give them one. This is how the bad-faith echo chamber works, and GOP lawmakers were happy to join in.As The Daily Beast reports, Sens. Chuck Grassley, John Cornyn and Mitch McConnell were among the politicians calling anti-Kavanaugh protesters a  mob.  McConnell said senators were  literally under assault. Conservative media truly wants its audience to believe that women are being paid to do this. So far, women are not fazed.Ana Maria Archila, the co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy who cornered Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in an elevator to tell him about her sexual assault, was featured in the Wall Street Journal piece   along with her salary. Archila was subsequently forced to defend herself against Trump s  paid protesters  tweet. No one can pay for someone s lived experiences,  Archila said in a statement.  The pain, the trauma, and the rage that I expressed when I spoke with Senator Jeff Flake in an elevator were my own, and I held it for more than 30 years to protect the people I love from it.

Melania Trump also touched on Brett Kavanaugh, the embattled Supreme Court nominee who is expected to be confirmed by the Senate Saturday afternoon after multiple women publicly accused him of sexual misconduct. One of the women, psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee late last month. I m glad Dr. Ford was heard. I m glad that Judge Kavanaugh was heard,  Melania Trump said, dodging a question on whether she believed Ford s accusations. She added that Kavanaugh is  highly qualified for the Supreme Court.  I m against any kind of abuse or violence,  she added.Melania Trump visited four African nations this week, feeding elephants, greeting children, touring a fort which held enslaved people and lighting up social media with her outfit choices. Responding to a question about her white pith helmet   seen as a symbol of colonialism and the exploitation of Africans   the first lady said she wished people would focus less on her clothes and more on her actions.The trip has also been considered an effort to smooth the relationships between the Trump administration and African nations, which the president reportedly referred to as  shithole countries  in a January meeting about immigration.When reporters asked whether the shocking comment came up on her trip, Melania Trump said it did not.

Trump at his rally derided Ford over some details concerning her allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, and Roberts asked why the president felt compelled to do so. The president was stating facts,  Sanders responded.  He was stating facts that were given during Dr. Ford s testimony (last week to a Senate committee) and the Senate has to make a decision based on those facts and whether or not they see Judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court. Considering Sanders  willingness to often make outrageous claims to defend Trump, it s no surprise that many Twitter users weren t happy that the press secretary had just created a new anti-media meme a la  fake news  or  alternative facts.  @PressSec @SarahHuckabee So you think the president mocking Dr Ford was  just stating the facts ? SHAME on you as a woman.@PressSec @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JeffFlake @amyklobuchar 1/Sarah,your version of  the facts  is dubious *Trump was mocking Dr Ford.He was not just stating facts *He was not pointing out inconsistencies; she knew when & that she was upstairsSarah, he wasn t  stating the facts;  he was MOCKING THE FACTS!! You re losing what short and frayed strings of relevance you may have had...you re now a silly joke in pearls.Sarah Sanders @PressSec of course says  the President was just stating the facts  when Trump said the only thing Dr. Ford remembers is that  she had one beer .Not true. Dr. Ford also remembers Trump s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulting her.She said trump was just stating the facts when he mocked the lady....it was a compelling story but poor Bart should just have his will and way because he made good grades n school. Now folks can dress it up how they like but that is what THEY r trying 2 say.Not surprisingly, a Twitter fact-check of Ford s testimony by NBC News showed little of what Trump claimed about her remarks was accurate.Sanders said the president was  stating facts  from Dr. Ford s testimony.But he wasn t.

Thirty-five years ago, the other students in the room chose to laugh and look the other way as sexual violence was perpetrated on me by Brett Kavanaugh,  wrote Ramirez, who has accused Kavanaugh of thrusting his penis in her face at a party when they were both students at Yale University. As I watch many of the Senators speak and vote on the floor of the Senate I feel like I m right back at Yale where half the room is laughing and looking the other way,  she continued.  Only this time, instead of drunk college kids, it is US Senators who are deliberately ignoring his behavior. She went on to thank the witnesses who were not questioned by the FBI as part of its investigation into the accusations against Kavanaugh. Ramirez herself was interviewed by the agency along with nine others, including a close friend of hers and two eyewitnesses to the incident. She criticized the FBI for not speaking to all of the people who she says could corroborate her story. There may be people with power who are looking the other way, but there are millions more who are standing together, speaking up about personal experiences of sexual violence and taking action to support survivors,  Ramirez said.  This is truly a collective moment of survivors and allies standing together. Ramirez s full statement can be read here.After weeks of tumult, the Senate is expected to vote to confirm Kavanaugh Saturday afternoon.Kavanaugh had already completed a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where California professor Christine Blasey Ford went public with her accusation against him. Ford s attorneys released a scathing statement after it became clear that Republicans had the votes to confirm Kavanaugh.Both Ford and Kavanaugh were not interviewed as part of the FBI s investigation, although certain witnesses to the alleged incident were.Ford maintains that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a high school party in 1982 and told her story before the committee late last month. In response to the accusation, Kavanaugh delivered angry and emotional prepared remarks accusing Democrats of concocting a political  hit job.  He received a slew of criticism for his tone, including retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who labeled Kavanaugh unfit for the nation s highest court. The office of Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) went on the offensive by releasing statements this week intended to discredit Ford.To address his critics directly, Kavanaugh published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal late Thursday explaining his behavior. He did not apologize. On Friday, a handful of swing senators revealed how they intended to vote. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), whose hand-wringing over the Kavanaugh accusations sparked the FBI investigation, said he would support the judge. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) joined him, along with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va), a red-state Democrat up for re-election in November. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) will be the only member of her party to oppose the nominee.Protesters have been staking out senators  offices all week, leading chants, holding signs and sharing stories   or attempting to   of their own sexual assaults with elected representatives.

Homeowner Marion Stanford, who made the sign, said she was stunned at the involvement of police in her town of Hamilton, 100 miles southwest of Fort Worth. Here we have a political party that is using women,  Stanford told The Dallas Morning News last week.  I thought the sign represented what is going on now, and we can t just stand quiet. I wanted to tell people we could stop it with voting. Stanford made the sign after listening to Christine Blasey Ford testify that then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed when they were both in high school, tried to remove her clothes, and put a hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. The sign was sharing lawn space with several others touting various Democratic candidates. It was the only one confiscated.Police apparently were tipped by Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, who s up for re-election. He called the homemade sign  Democratic sleaze  on his Facebook page and claimed the painting of the girl was intended to represent Kavanaugh s daughter. Despite the sexual assault allegations against him, Kavanaugh was sworn in Saturday as a Supreme Court justice after he was confirmed by a 50-48 Senate majority.Stanford said the suggestion that the girl in her sign was Kavanaugh s daughter is preposterous. There s  nothing in my sign that remotely suggests it s Kavanaugh s daughter,  she added.Her painting was based on an image created last year   long before Kavanaugh was even nominated   by Washington Post political cartoonist Ann Telnaes. The cartoonist was commenting at the time on President Donald Trump and the Republican Party s endorsement of Roy Moore for the Senate primary in Alabama, despite accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior with three teenage girls when he was in his 30s.Opinion | The Republican National Committee flip-flops and announces support for Roy Moore s campaign https://t.co/5bNaFuDk5c pic.twitter.com/JC0954e5rRIn a shocking turn of events, the GOP and Roy Moore supporters will be more offended by your art than by Moore s actions.Hamilton City Manager Pete Kampfer told The Dallas Morning News that the sign was taken because it  featured a political animal taking an inappropriate position with a young child. Legal experts told the Dallas newspaper that police likely violated Stanford s First Amendment rights. I stand with those women. I stand with the women who want change, who have a voice and are making their voice heard,  Stanford told The Washington Post.  And the whole community is not going to stop me.

The episode centered around Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo, a talking turd in a Santa hat that first appeared in a Christmas-themed episode in 1997. In a hearing that mocked Brett Kavanaugh, Mr. Hankey attempted to defend his offensive tweets. The Poo blamed Ambien, a la Roseanne Barr, who once claimed the sleep drug played a role in a racist tweet she sent that ultimately got her canned from her own TV show. At the end of the program, Mr. Hankey was cast out of South Park and sent to a land  that accepts racist, awful beings like him,  where people  don t care about bigotry and hate.  That place?

Falwell s enthusiastic support doesn t appear to have waned since then, even as progressive evangelicals and evangelicals of color have come forward in recent weeks to voice their disapproval of Trump.In an interview with The Guardian on Tuesday, Falwell said he is standing firmly by the president and  absolutely  believes Trump sets a good moral example.  Ever since I ve known him, he s been a good, moral person, a strong leader, a tough leader   and that s what this country needs,  Falwell said.  He is like Ronald Reagan on steroids,  Falwell added.But not all evangelicals feel the same way about the president.Jim Wallis, leader of the progressive Christian organization Sojourners, said Falwell s description of Trump as a moral person is an example of why Falwell does not speak for millions of evangelical Christians, particularly those of color. The people that Christ told his followers to protect   the poor and vulnerable, the least of these   are the very ones Falwell s tough leader assaults virtually every day,  Wallis told HuffPost.Falwell, who is the son of the late Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell Sr., has in many ways taken up his father s mantle. The elder Falwell s activism in the 1980s helped cement white evangelicals  ties to the Republican Party and expand the political influence of the religious right. The younger Falwell is part of a group of conservative, predominantly white Christians who serve as Trump s informal religious advisers, often speaking up in public to lend their support to the president s policies and tactics. Trump has spoken at Liberty University three times in the past six years, The Guardian reports. In September, Falwell encouraged Liberty students to travel to Washington to rally for then-embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.  Falwell said his support for Trump arises from his belief that the Republican Party has  betrayed evangelicals.   When they were in office, they didn t take actions that were consistent with their campaign rhetoric,  he told The Guardian.He listed several issues that he thinks are crucial to conservative evangelical Christians:  support for the state of Israel, strong national defense, traditional family values, and pro-life.  He also said that a generally prosperous America helps Christians live out their obligation to serve the poor.One of the core beliefs that tie all evangelicals together is an acceptance of the authority of the Bible. But while American evangelicals share a common scriptural text, they vary widely in how they interpret the Bible s commands and how they think those commands should inform their political views. White evangelicals have been among Trump s most reliable supporters, but other evangelicals have very different opinions about the president s performance and what their priorities should be. Evangelicals of color overwhelmingly opposed Trump in the 2016 election. Research indicates that they tend to lean more progressive than their white co-religionists on issues like immigration and racial justice.Over the past two years, some evangelical leaders and institutions have spoken up when they felt Trump s policies contradicted Biblical commandments. Last week, 39 progressive evangelical leaders released a declaration reaffirming their own commitment to fighting economic inequality, defending immigrants and refugees, resisting racism and patriarchy, and caring for the environment.Andre Henry, a black evangelical speaker and writer from Los Angeles, told HuffPost that he thinks it s inevitable that believers interpret the Bible differently. But he wishes that conservative, Trump-supporting Christians who are vocal about supporting Israel would offer that same enthusiastic support to  their poor, women, immigrant, LGBTQ, and PoC neighbors. Henry said he derives his standard of morality from Jesus  command in the Bible to  love your neighbor.   This president incarcerates his neighbor when they re seeking asylum, mocks his neighbor when they ve vulnerably shared their experience of sexual violence, and recommends his neighbors be subjected to humiliating policies like stop-and-frisk,  said Henry.  Call that type of leadership what you will, but it doesn t fit a Christian standard for  moral.  He suggested that Falwell would benefit from listening to people who don t share his privileges. I get the impression that Falwell doesn t see how his social location as a white, affluent, straight man informs his readings of scripture and his ethical conclusions,  Henry said.  He d benefit from really listening to those who are and have been doing theology from the margins.  As a Christian person of color, I think more about compassion for the poor and vulnerable in our society,  Henry said.  The things at the forefront of my mind are climate change, racial justice, and economic justice. Adam Taylor, executive director of Sojourners, told HuffPost that he s become deeply concerned about the tactics used by Falwell and others who often publicly represent evangelicalism. They have made a Faustian bargain with a political party and administration that is far too narrow to adhere to the gospel of Jesus,  Taylor said.  They have been willing to overlook and ignore the propagation of racism, xenophobia, and misogyny while supporting moves towards autocracy that undermine democracy and tolerate lying by public officials. The Christian right has acted as a  tool  of the Republican Party, especially during the Trump administration, Taylor said. Quoting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Taylor said the church is called to be the  conscience  of the state   not its master or its servant. Progressive evangelicals don t believe that God has given the U.S. government, or America itself, a special status among countries, explained Jon Huckins, co-founding director of the Global Immersion Project, a Christian education organization.But other evangelicals like Falwell  associate the United States of America as a kind of second Israel. A  city set on a hill  to do God s divine work in the world,  Huckins said.  That is slippery ground that views our country as nothing short of an idol. The progressive evangelicals who signed last week s declaration   including Wallis, Henry, Taylor and Huckins himself   have a different interpretation of how religion and politics should interact, he added. We will call our nation-state systems and structures to do what is right for the least and last,  Huckins said, referring to a Bible passage instructing Christians to care for vulnerable groups.  But we will not place our primary hope in it. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The report was locked away in a secure room in the basement of the Capitol Visitor Center, where Democratic and Republican senators read it over in alternating shifts, applying or ignoring the evidence contained therein to a decision that will affect millions and millions of lives. The only thing less democratic about the process here is basically everything else about the Supreme Court.But we do know how this profound deficit of the old democratic spirit could be remedied: Senators, just tell me what was in the report. FBI, leak it to me. Here s what some Democratic senators have said about the report, which contained summaries of the FBI s interviews and of which we American citizens are not allowed to know the actual contents.From Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): One: This was not a full and fair investigation. It was sharply limited in scope and did not explore the relevant confirming facts.Two: The available documents do not exonerate Mr. Kavanaugh.And three: The available documents contradict statements Mr. Kavanaugh made under oath. From Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) :  It is simply impossible after seeing the results of the FBI supplemental work   and I hesitate to call it an investigation   that anybody could think that it was in any way shape or form the comprehensive investigation the president promised. From Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.): The most notable part of this report is what s not in it. And here s what the Republicans said about the report.From Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.): What we know for sure is the FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. From Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.): We ve seen no additional corroborating information. There s no actual way of knowing who s telling the truth. Democrats will assume Democrats are telling the truth; Republicans will assume the same of other Republicans. The dozen centrists in the country will believe The New York Times opinion section.Meanwhile, a president whom the majority of the country did not vote for is installing a justice on a Supreme Court that already had a seat hijacked and stolen by Senate Republicans, who were only ever in a position to do so because of decades of gerrymandering and voter suppression.  This is not how a healthy democracy functions. But there is a way to start to correct these profound injustices: What if you just told me what was in the FBI report? You ll all feel much better! I know I will. So, are you a senator? An FBI employee who helped with the investigation? Do you want to do me and the country   nay, democracy itself   a solid? Email ashley.feinberg@huffpost.com.

As someone who has always highly respected women, I never imagined I could be remotely associated with this issue.It turns out, I was wrong.This realization came about after a former classmate of mine, Robyn Swirling, published a piece titled  I Was Labeled The High School  Slut.  It Affected My Whole Life  on HuffPost Personal late last month.The article details how fabricated rumors about her supposed promiscuity spread throughout our middle school and led to years of sexual harassment and abuse.Many of her offenders were young men we grew up with in Bethesda, Maryland   the same hometown as Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford.It had been more than 15 years since Robyn and I were in contact. I was so deeply moved by her story that I sent her a message on Facebook.I thanked her for having the courage to access those dark memories and for sharing them with the world. I playfully acknowledged that we had been  boyfriend and girlfriend  for about a week or two in middle school.I gently asked if I had, in any way, contributed to her trauma. I expected a lighthearted response. I certainly never anticipated what I read.She replied that, in fact, I had.I ll never forget how shocked and speechless I felt in that moment. I was unable to move.I was also very confused. Robyn and I were not particularly close and I could not think of a single instance that she could be referencing. My mind was racing as my heart pounded in my chest.I consider myself extremely considerate of others. Now 32 years old, I m a devoted husband and father, a mindful business person, and an outward advocate for social equality. How could I be capable of sexual misconduct of any kind? As I sat stunned by this news, it didn t take long for me to rationalize that victims of any kind of trauma are more likely to vividly remember events than offenders. I apologized to her but wasn t entirely ready to accept ownership.Although it was late at night and I had family visiting for my son s birthday party, I immediately requested a phone call. I knew that I would not be able to rest until I had more information.The next day, Robyn and I spoke over the phone. She recounted a moment we shared in middle school that left her feeling hurt and emotionally scarred. I have a sharp memory, yet still could not recall this taking place.However, she included a few minor details that gave me clues that she was not making this up. Why would she? I believed her. We discussed how it is common for offenders of abuse to be entirely unaware of the weight of their actions. What may seem like harmless and playful behavior can easily be perceived differently by others and can cause serious damage.We also discussed how cultural influences such as movies, music and peer pressure can play a massive role in shaping male mentalities to seek sexual conquests.I ve never had a history of violence or overly aggressive behavior, yet my careless actions at 14 years old had left a permanent scar on Robyn s life. For that, I can never apologize enough. As our call ended, I told Robyn that, moving forward, my life would likely never be the same. I was willing to do anything in my ability to make this better.I was devastated to learn that I had inflicted lasting pain on another person.This experience forced me to reflect on my past and think hard about other women I may have failed. If I was capable of unintentionally hurting her, surely I may have similarly affected others throughout my life.The next day, I sent messages to a few women with whom I shared intimate moments growing up. I wanted to make sure I hadn t crossed any lines and pressured them to a point of discomfort. I mentioned that if I had hurt them, I was sincerely sorry for my reckless behavior. I was eager to listen, learn and help in any way.I was relieved that the responses I received were appreciative and assured me that I had been respectful. What happened next was astounding.My high school classmate Sasha Tozzi asked my permission to share our conversation on Facebook. After consulting with my wife, I agreed.We were extremely surprised to witness an overwhelming flood of positive reactions as Sasha s Facebook post received hundreds of uplifting interactions.The vast majority of the comments were from women expressing deep gratitude. Many saw hope in our exchange and stated how they could only dream the men from their pasts might extend this sentiment.It was amazing to see such a simple gesture regarding an uncomfortable subject become a powerful message in how we can begin to heal wounds and bridge our gender divides.It s my hope that more men will be inspired to reach out to women they may have harmed. To ask if they had been hurt. And, if so, to sincerely apologize and offer to help   if possible and wanted.I believe this can help spark a cultural shift to bring about the change we need to grant women the respect they deserve.Women have spent far too long coming forward and saying #MeToo. It s time for men to step up, take responsibility for their actions and say #ImSorry.The past week has been challenging for me, but I m eternally grateful for the opportunity for learning and growth.And to Robyn: Once again, I m sorry. But, also, thank you.Do you have a personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost? Find out what we re looking for here and send us a pitch!"

Lindsey Graham used to be their reverent conscience, if you will, of the Republican Party in the Trump years,  Jolly said on  The 11th Hour With Brian Williams  on Monday.  He s turned into a senator that in many opinions   including mine   he s lost his mind. Jolly also had a warning for Republicans: Getting Kavanaugh confirmed will come back to haunt them during next month s midterm elections.  The Republican Party has said to women across the country,  We don t believe you,   Jolly said.

I asked Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) last Tuesday. His answer? Deafening silence.His bodyguard repeatedly pushed me out of the way, even as McConnell paused to shake the hand of a white man beside us.I am the executive director of Positive Women s Network ñ USA (PWN), a national network of women and transgender people living with HIV   but you may know me as one of  those people  who followed McConnell through Washington, D.C. s National Airport last week, as seen in a tweet that quickly went viral. I, and others like me, confronted McConnell and other politicians in airports and offices and elevators earlier this month because they refuse to meet with the people whom they allegedly represent.What happened at the airport that afternoon is only one part of the story. Last Friday morning, I was among dozens of sexual assault survivors of color who occupied McConnell s office during the cloture vote on Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, chanting,  We do not consent! No more rapists in power! Friday afternoon, I was one of six people arrested in the Senate gallery and detained by Capitol Police for seven hours for disrupting Sen. Susan Collins  (R-Maine) speech affirming her vote for Kavanaugh, as we attempted to make a desperate, last-minute appeal to her humanity and her own experience as a woman who has certainly survived patriarchy. I will do it all again whenever and wherever I m needed   and I am not alone. As a woman of color living with HIV and the daughter of immigrants, I want to make it clear: There are tens of millions of us with a lot of skin in the judicial game. Women. People of color. LGBTQ individuals. People with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Low-income folks. People born in other countries who have made the U.S. their home, or who hope to someday. We understand that our rights hang in the balance and, for many of us, our lives are literally at risk. We are survivors not just of sexual violence, but of entire systems designed to harm us.This is no exaggeration. The Supreme Court has the power to interpret, uphold and enforce laws in ways that ensure our democratic and human rights   or it can entrench privilege and power for the already privileged and powerful. That s why our message to Sen. McConnell was not just about surviving sexual violence. We also reminded him that he and his cronies are the past. We, in all our diversity and rage, are the future.  Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, a wealthy, upper-class white woman, is a respected professor at Stanford. She was disbelieved, mocked, and threatened with bodily harm after she publicly announced that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh and after bravely baring her trauma in front of the world. Dr. Ford still cannot return to her home due to continuous death threats. She was not only mocked by the president at a campaign rally, but 50 Senators, including five women, voted to confirm Kavanaugh anyway, in what was the smallest and most partisan margin for a Supreme Court confirmation in 130 years. I watched Saturday s vote from the Senate gallery. There are no words to describe how painful it was to witness survivors of sexual violence screaming about their trauma, asking to be heard by the most powerful, mostly white male decision-makers in this country   and being physically dragged out of the gallery by security as the vote went on. Business as usual. For centuries, we have watched these institutions promote and protect rich white men. Kavanaugh is the epitome of privilege, entitlement, and impunity   yet Trump has cleverly turned him, and others like him, into  victims  in this story. What s more, by elevating someone accused of sexual assault to the highest level of power, the GOP sent a very clear message that sexual violence is no big deal. This is how institutionalized sexism works. When white women buy into it, they are also complicit, in a painful reminder that their solidarity lies with whiteness, rather than as joint survivors of patriarchal and racist systems designed to silence our truths. Ask yourself: How would Ford have been treated if she had been poor, Black, an immigrant worker, a person living with HIV or any combination of the above? As women, transgender people, Black and brown people, low-income people, immigrants, and people living with HIV, we know that the institutions that claim to  serve and protect  us answer to the powerful, elite few   like the 50 senators, representing less than half the country s population, who voted to confirm Kavanaugh. We refuse to allow this corrupt and destructive status quo to remain.So, we will not sit down and shut up. We will keep screaming. We will continue to confront our elected officials wherever we encounter them. We will not be dissuaded by the police or fines or jail time. We are survivors, not just of sexual violence, but of an entire system that was designed to keep us  in our place.  We are accustomed to fighting for our lives, and we have strength in numbers. Most importantly, we have a brave, bold vision for the world we want to live in and of what justice means to us. More women of color are running for office than ever before. We are working together, in the streets and in the halls of power. We are mobilizing our communities to vote and to make sure those in power hear us. We are the future, and Nov. 6 is coming.Women living with HIV are five times as likely to experience sexual assault in their lifetimes as the general population. They are twice as likely to face intimate partner violence. Yet in some states, they can actually be prosecuted and imprisoned for  exposing  their rapists to HIV without disclosing their status if they are assaulted. For these reasons and others, Positive Women s Network started a Day of Action to End Violence Against Women Living with HIV, which will be observed for its fifth year on Oct. 23.

He said that for many years Republicans had been unable to capture those electoral college votes, and then he said there was an expression he wanted to use to describe the state, but he had to censor himself because the media was present. Every Republican thinks they are going to win Pennsylvania, but I got it. I d use an expression, you know there s an expression, but under the rules of Me Too I m not allowed to use that expression anymore, I can t do it,  Trump said.  It s the  person  that got away. President Trump mocks #MeToo movement during rally in Pennsylvania, while speaking on his 2016 presidential campaign:  Under the rules of #MeToo, I m not allowed to use that expression.  pic.twitter.com/N3ppCPVPinThe phrase the president was likely referencing was the Frank Sinatra song title,  The Gal That Got Away,  his cover of  The Man That Got Away  from the 1954 film  A Star Is Born. When someone in the audience shouted for the president to use the words anyway, Trump said:  I would do it except for these people up there,  pointing to the media.  There is an expression, but we ll change the expression. Pennsylvania was always the  person  that got away. Trump, who regularly goes off script and champions himself as an enemy of political correctness, has lambasted the Me Too movement many times, most recently over the sexual assault allegation that California research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford leveled at Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. It s a damn sad situation,  the president said at a rally in Mississippi earlier this month.  We better start as a country getting smart and getting tough and not letting that stuff   right back there, those cameras   tell us how to live our lives. During the event on Wednesday, Trump touted several economic victories during his first years in office and noted that he did  very well  in the last election due to female voters.The president also slammed Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), who is running for re-election in next month s midterm elections, saying he was only in office because his father was the state s former governor. Why do you have such a liberal senator in Pennsylvania? Oh. He s banking on the name of his father, which is no good,  Trump said.  That s why he has to be voted out of office. Last week, The New York Times published a sweeping exposÈ noting that Trump had built his fortune on more than $400 million in today s dollars from his father s real estate empire.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Bush on his way to winning the White House is now taking a victory lap for putting a Bush acolyte onto the Supreme Court.Brett Kavanaugh, confirmed by the Senate on Saturday as an associate justice, served as a White House lawyer for Bush for two years and then as his staff secretary   one of White House s top positions   for three. President McConnell s appointee to the court is exactly consistent with the establishment wing of the party s preferences,  mocked Rick Wilson, a longtime GOP consultant and prominent Donald Trump critic, referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).  This is not Donald Trump s selection. This is Mitch McConnell and the Federalist Society s selection. The irony is amazing. Rather than installing a  populist nationalist  in the mold of former top aide Stephen Bannon or top immigration adviser Stephen Miller, Trump gave a lifetime appointment to the highest court to a former confidante of Bush, the embodiment of the GOP establishment.For his part, Kavanaugh boasted of that relationship in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. I was by President Bush s side for three years and was entrusted with the nation s most sensitive secrets,  he said.  I traveled on Air Force One all over the country and the world with President Bush. I went everywhere with him, from Texas to Pakistan, from Alaska to Australia, from Buckingham Palace to the Vatican. The irony, however, will be lost on Trump s hardcore supporters, said Rick Tyler, a Republican consultant who backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz s presidential run in 2016.  They don t know enough to care,  he said, adding that even if they learned about Kavanaugh s background, they still wouldn t care.  You can t apply logic or ideology to Trump. He s a celebrity. They ll make it all make sense retroactively. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Trump and Bush spoke Saturday after the Senate s confirmation vote.  President Trump and former President George W. Bush had a congratulatory phone call to celebrate Justice Kavanaugh s confirmation,  he said.While Trump seemed to focus on attacking the woman who testified under oath that Kavanagh tried to rape her when they were both in high school   Trump openly mocked her at a campaign rally last week   Bush quietly worked the phones persuading Republicans senators to support his former aide.Maine s Susan Collins, whose decision to support Kavanaugh provided the likely deciding vote, said Bush called her several times to lobby her to vote yes.Trump has attacked for years the Bush family s pro-immigration views and accused the former president of supporting  open borders.  Trump also has repeatedly attacked Bush for his invasion of Iraq   even though Trump supported it at the time   as  one of the worst decisions in the history of the country. During the 2016 GOP presidential primary campaign, he attacked rival Jeb Bush, the 43rd president s brother, for saying that illegal immigrants come to the United States in  an act of love  to better care for their families. He also scoffed at the younger Bush for being  low energy,  while never defining what that even meant.Trump outsourced his high court appointments to the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, two groups dedicated to loading the federal judiciary with conservatives opposed to abortion rights and in favor of strict limits on business regulations.Kavanaugh, whose name was not on the original list of 21 Trump released as a candidate, was added last November along with four other names, with the concurrence of the two outside groups.Some critics have pointed to Kavanaugh s law review article he wrote in 2009 in which he opined that sitting presidents should not be prosecuted as the only reason Trump appointed him   given the danger posed to Trump s tenure in office by special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation. I think he cares a great deal about who s on the Supreme Court,  said John Weaver, who ran Ohio Gov. John Kasich s campaign for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

But with a handful of endangered Democrats up for re-election this year, they agreed to vote immediately on three Circuit Court judges and 12 District Court judges, who were all successfully confirmed on Thursday, and head home on recess.It s another major win for Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose No. 1 priority is filling up federal courts with young, conservative judges in order to tilt the judiciary to the right for decades. Roughly 1 in 6 U.S. circuit court seats is now filled by a judge nominated by Trump. With Thursday s tally, the Senate has now confirmed 84 Trump judges over the past two years, including two Supreme Court nominees. And with Republicans likely to hold the Senate next year, that number is only going to continue to grow.A similar dynamic also played out in August when Democrats agreed to confirm 15 Trump judicial nominees in order to go home and campaign for the election.Progressives are furious that Democrats keep allowing Trump to reshape the courts for generations without putting up a fight, especially after a bitter and bruising fight over Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court. It would have taken only one Democratic senator to say  no  to letting the nominees through this week, but none did. There is no reason Democrats should be making any deals with Mitch McConnell to make it easier to confirm more radical conservatives to the courts. Especially not after Kavanaugh,  tweeted Leah Ghostberg, the co-executive director of the advocacy group Indivisible.Chris Kang, chief counsel for the liberal group Demand Justice, also noted that  in eight years, Obama never had 15 judges confirmed in a single day. Because McConnell wouldn t allow it. Still, Democrats faced a tough decision. McConnell has all the leverage in the fight   only two of his members are considered vulnerable this cycle, while Democrats count a half-dozen senators, most of whom wanted to go home and defend their seats. Moreover, the nominees the Senate confirmed on Thursday likely all would have gotten through even if Democrats objected and forced McConnell to stay in session through the end of the month.More broadly, the stakes in November for Democrats are extremely high. If they succeed in retaining most if not all of their endangered seats, they stand a (currently small) chance of winning the Senate. But even if they don t win, with a larger Democratic minority they could stand a better chance at defeating GOP priorities on health care, taxes, immigration, and border security.November s results also have farther reaching implications. The more seats Democrats hold in 2018, for example, the easier it could be for them to win back the Senate in the 2020 presidential election.Progressives, however, say that Democrats are only giving Trump and McConnell more time to appoint even more lifetime nominees, including a replacement for Kavanaugh on the powerful D.C. Circuit. Congress is facing a packed post-election legislative agenda, and allowing more Trump judges now only gives Republicans more room to work with in coming months.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) on Tuesday morning told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that he believes Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) secretly played puppetmaster to Christine Blasey Ford, who says Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh once sexually assaulted her. According to Cotton, Schumer had help from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and Ford s friend Monica McLean   and he was plotting as far back as July.  Hugh, I believe the Schumer political operation was behind this from the very beginning,  Cotton told Hewitt, who egged him on.The senator likened the scene on Capitol Hill last week   where crowds were protesting Kavanaugh   to his military service in the Middle East, claiming that Americans were  revolted by the crazed mob  Schumer  whipped up  in defense of Ford. Ford, a California professor who knew Kavanaugh as a teen, sent a confidential letter to Feinstein over the summer expressing her concern that the judge who allegedly assaulted her would be considered for a Supreme Court seat. The letter leaked. Republicans seized on that fact, blaming Democrats, although it is not clear who did the leaking. Some on the left criticized Feinstein for keeping the letter quiet for so long, given that Ford s claims were only made public after Kavanaugh s initial confirmation hearings were complete.Cotton went on to claim that McLean once worked for Bharara, who in turn once worked for Schumer, drawing a line between Ford and the Senate Minority Leader. I strongly suspect that Chuck Schumer s political operation knew about Ms. Ford s allegations as far back as July and manipulated the process all along to include taking advantage of Ms. Ford s confidences,  Cotton said.Bharara dismissed the senator s conspiracy theory shortly afterward, saying over Twitter that McLean never worked for him and he couldn t even  pick her out of a lineup.  (Bharara did formerly serve as Schumer s chief counsel.)Ford gave an interview to The Washington Post using her real name in mid-September. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) subsequently invited her to testify before his committee.Other women, including Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, also came forward to share stories about Kavanaugh s alleged sexual misconduct. Cotton did not mention them on the radio program.Kavanaugh denied all of the claims and was confirmed over the weekend.With all the extensions we give Dr Ford to decide if she still wants to testify to the Senate I feel like I m playing 2nd trombone in the judiciary orchestra and Schumer is the conductorCotton s conspiracy theory includes echos of comments made by other Republicans, who have largely suggested they believe Ford was attacked but not that Kavanaugh was her attacker.Late last month, Grassley tweeted that he felt as if Schumer were conducting  the judiciary orchestra,  and he was merely playing  2nd trombone.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has demanded an investigation into the leak of Ford s letter. And as recently as Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump claimed without a scrap of evidence that the protesters on Capitol Hill were paid actors.

Marsha Blackburn   the Republican candidate in a tight race for Senate in Swift s home state of Tennessee   over Blackburn s stance on women s and LGBTQ issues: Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me,  Swift wrote in a lengthy post.  She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.  A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 7, 2018 at 4:33pm PDTThe detailed takedown, understandably, was much appreciated by the Democrat she endorsed, Phil Bredesen, Tennessee s former governor.With polls showing him close to Blackburn but trailing in the conservative state, he pronounced himself  honored  to receive Swift s backing in a tweet that included her posting.As long as she was at it, Swift also plugged Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper, whose district comprises core Nashville. Cooper, though, probably doesn t need her help. First elected in 2002, he s long thrived as one of the few Democrats among Tennessee s nine-member House delegation.Swift s foray into politics was an unprecedented move for her. Indeed, she s been so silent amid the nation s growing political clamor and discord that an entire spectrum of people   including neo-Nazis!   has embraced her as one of their own over the years.That now has changed, as various parts of the conservative world took umbrage with her post.Dan Gainor, writing for Fox News and offering not a shred of evidence to support his claim, ranted that Swift s  open liberalism was clearly designed as a change in the narrative after the Hollywood left lost the Supreme Court fight  over Brett Kavanaugh.Professional bad-faith commentator Tomi Lahren told Swift to stay in her lane:Let s be clear, I m not with Taylor and I m not with Kanye. I m not for celebrities that pop off of sh*t they don t understand. Period.Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (who himself has dabbled in music)  tweeted a zinger: So @taylorswift13 has every right to be political but it won t impact election unless we allow 13 yr old girls to vote.  Still with #MarshaBlackburn(It s easy to see where his daughter, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, gets her cutting tone.)Charlie Kirk, the founder of ultra-conservative Turning Point USA whose events are sometimes attended by neo-Nazis, got very upset on Fox & Friends, claiming that Swift didn t write her own Instagram post and that she was  fed bad information.  What I used to love about Taylor Swift is she stayed away from politics  -@charliekirk11 pic.twitter.com/Nd77XXnQr8Of course, the chagrin was palpable on the site that felt most betrayed by Swift, 4chan. As The Daily Beast first reported, neo-Nazis and trolls who once hailed Swift as their  Aryan goddess  have to deal with being left in the dust by her. Her career is over now,  one 4chan user wrote.  She ll now be used as an example of how bad it is for you to abandon your race. President Donald Trump got involved in the outrage. In comments to reporters Monday afternoon, he echoed other conservatives in opining that Swift doesn t know enough about politics to join the conversation. He also professed to now be less of a fan of the singer. Trump on Taylor Swift endorsing Marsha Blackburn s opponent, Phil Bredesen:  I m sure Taylor Swift doesn t know anything about her. Let s say that I like Taylor s music about 25% less now, okay? It was inevitable that Trump would pile on. Reactions from the right often follow a similar pattern: the dark corners of the internet, like 4chan, get upset; the very loud and proud white conservatives on Twitter get upset; Fox News commentators (especially Tucker Carlson) get upset; then Trump weighs in (though usually on Twitter).In this case, we quickly made it to step four, courtesy of the country-pop star.This story has been updated with Trump s reaction.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

They began their relationship by  making out on a porch  in 2016, she told the paper. Glaringly absent from the story is any reference to the accusation that he forcibly kissed another Vox employee, leading to his ouster a year later. The couple met in 2010, when she had an informational interview with him for a marketing position. She didn t get the job, but they did occasionally run into each other at social and professional events,  the Times piece reads.  In 2016, having heard that he was single again, she sought him out at Brown s annual campus dance, and during the 20th reunion of his class.  I went there sort of on a mission,  she said,  and we ended up making out on a porch.  It stands in awkward contrast to the Times  coverage of the Me Too movement over the weekend, bookended by the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court despite several sexual misconduct accusations against him.On Friday the Times brushed its shoulders off with a piece about the investigation into Weinstein that it broke a year earlier:Culturally, the article hit like a meteor, drastically altering the landscape around how sexual misconduct is perceived, sending the #MeToo hashtag viral and, in turn, triggering an avalanche of accusations against powerful men. It wasn t long before #MeToo wasn t just a turn of phrase   it was a movement.That s a lot for one year   and it felt like it.What we learned over the weekend is that an  avalanche of accusations against powerful men  can t block a Supreme Court confirmation, can t stop the likes of Weinstein from getting a same-day reservation at a fancy restaurant and won t deter the Old Gray Lady from doing a puff piece about an admitted sexual harasser on the same weekend that it takes credit for the Me Too movement s success.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

That s what people say. What the pop star didn t mention in the long list of criticisms many have leveled against her are accusations that she s the alt-right s  Aryan goddess,  a closet supporter of Donald Trump, a ruthless capitalist in need of a moral compass and the pop star to blame, at least in part, for the rise of conservative values in America. To be fair, those allegations are bit harder to shake in the span of a single dance track. But so she did in an Instagram post on Sunday endorsing Tennessee Democratic candidates, former Gov. Phil Bredesen for Senate and Rep. Jim Cooper for the House, for the midterm election. Swift stated that she s a supporter of human rights for all, with special mention of the LGBTQ community, gender equality and racial justice. The singer also revealed she d been  reluctant  to share her political beliefs before but has since been moved to voice her opinion to her more than 100 million followers.The post was received by some conservatives with calls for a boycott of her music, comments about how she should just shut up and sing (because that worked out so well last time), renewed commitments to #TeamKanye and even a predictably condescending tweet from former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.But the move surprised liberals, too, who d long resigned Swift to political Siberia for her silence during the 2016 presidential election and felt her latest statement landed anywhere between welcome and long overdue. Hey @taylorswift13 -You just endorsed a Democrat in the Tennessee senate race with a ridiculous statement saying Marsha Blackburn, a woman, is against womenYou have absolutely no idea what you are talking aboutYour career has never recovered since Kanye ended itSo @taylorswift13 has every right to be political but it won t impact election unless we allow 13 yr old girls to vote.  Still with #MarshaBlackburnThe headlines this week described Swift s statement as her  first foray into politics,  a  dive into political waters.  The notion, however, that Swift has been apolitical up until the moment she hit  post  on Instagram is a bit unfounded.Over the years, Swift and her team have spoken out   and also misspoken   about various politically tinged issues with increasing frequency, and, as her most vociferous critics will remind you, her silence has dangerous implications all its own.In retrospect, the  Reputation  era has been one long test case for a more candid, political Swift. Her road to woke-dom (call it what you want to, OK?) has been bumpy, but the singer has been building momentum to this political coming-out party since at least midway through 2017. We should have seen it coming.In her endorsement on Sunday, Swift made this clear by referring to  events in my life and in the world  that motivated her public political awakening.While she didn t specify, it s not wild to think she s referring to her sexual assault trial, in which she was awarded a symbolic $1 after countersuing a Denver radio host who she said groped her during a 2013 meet-and-greet. Swift was widely praised for her defiant responses during the trial, which predated the allegations against Harvey Weinstein that birthed the Me Too movement. She was later recognized as one of the Silence Breakers for Time s Person of the Year issue, placing her on the cover next to actress Ashley Judd and the movement s other forerunners who stood firmly against abuses of power both personally and politically. Do not accept the blame others will try to place on you,  Swift wrote in the accompanying interview.  You should not be blamed for waiting 15 minutes or 15 days or 15 years to report sexual assault or harassment, or for the outcome of what happens to a person after he or she makes the choice to sexually harass or assault you. Since then, Swift has made her support for other progressive causes, ones that haven t immediately touched her own life, apparent. In March, the pop star announced she d made a donation to the March for Our Lives campaign against gun violence, led by teen activists who survived the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. She advocated to  support gun reform  in the caption of an Instagram post about her donation to the cause, her first comment on the issue. At a concert months later, she also celebrated LGBTQ Pride Month by sending  love  and  respect  to her queer fans with a heartfelt speech while wearing a rainbow dress.  It s very brave to be vulnerable about your feelings in any sense, in any situation,  she told the crowd.  But it s even more brave to be honest about your feelings and who you love, when you know that that might be met with adversity from society. Here was a Swift we hadn t seen before. She was taking stands on issues that might ve alienated the conservative base who helped launch her country career all those years ago.But there were missteps, too. Her most glaring slip went hand in hand with her rebuke of rumors she d tacitly supported white supremacists. In response to a 2017 article about her popularity among the alt-right, legal representatives of the singer slammed the piece and offered a letter as  yet another unequivocal denouncement by Ms. Swift of white supremacy and the alt-right. The letter, however, caught the attention of the ACLU, whose lawyers came to article author Meghan Herning s aid and accused Swift s team of trying to silence her, casting an oppressive pall over the exchange. It all felt like her ill-timed condemnation of the media last year: slightly askew. Swift wasn t denouncing Nazis as much as she was defending herself.Swift s latest gesture is more pointed. She endorsed Senate hopeful Bredesen and longtime House member Cooper unprompted. She chose not to weigh in on Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court nomination or President Donald Trump s statements surrounding it. Instead, she weighed in on a state election and encouraged her young fans   some of whom aren t eligible to vote but very well might be in 2020   to head to the polls.For at least 1.6 million people, the message earned a solid  like.  For others, it at least occasioned an  I told you so  text to detractors who d jokingly misnamed her album  Republican.  But let s not forget who we re talking about here. This is Taylor Swift, pop music s savviest survivor, who s outmaneuvered many of her competitors with a keen understanding of PR and image-making. Her reputation, save for a few Kim Kardashian-sized holes, remains mostly unscathed by controversy because of it.Ahead of her statement this week, she ended her tour   which made stops in plenty of red states across the country   meaning she no longer has an album to promote. Her longtime nemesis Kanye West also conveniently went off the deep end into Trump territory, attracting yet another wave of backlash. For Swift, appearing to be civically engaged without donning a  Make America great again  hat was suddenly good business.What will truly be the test of this new chapter in Swift s celebrity is how and if she continues to engage with these issues when they are not commercially viable.There s no doubting her platform is enormous or that she has the ability to convert apathetic music listeners into ballots. The question is: Is falling back into the public s good graces her political endgame, or has Taylor as we know her been made anew?"

When you re a star, they let you do it,  Trump bragged.Bush s response, captured in the recording, was to laugh.In the aftermath of the disclosure, Bush was ousted from NBC s  Today  show, while Trump went on to be elected president. Two years ago today, my life went from order to chaos in a dramatic instant,  Bush wrote on Instagram on Monday.  I accounted for my small part, while the President and my employer walked away and still haven t accounted for their actions. In July, Bush s wife, Sydney, filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Bush himself has remained largely out of the public eye, although it appears that he has been trying to revive his career. He appeared on  Real Time With Bill Maher  in March. These past couple years have been character building to say the least ñ anxiety attacks, fits of rage, feelings of betrayal and abandonment ñ and I have concluded that I am NOT extraordinary,  Bush wrote on Instagram.  Terrible things can happen at any moment to ANYONE. He added:  On the positive side, I feel grateful to know adversity as intimately as I do, and to have developed more empathy, humility and resilience. And to know you can laugh even in the darkest hour is a blessing. The photo he posted was from his time on the  Today  show, modeling Spanx for men. I remember us all hysterically laughing,  he said.  I still wear them. Shhh. A post shared by William Bush (@billybush) on Oct 7, 2018 at 8:05am PDTBush also took a moment to blast the media and social media. I have an idea,  he wrote.  Let s stop tolerating this escalating war on flaws and the obliteration of people for things we all do. It s fueled by an activist media and (anti) social media and it s barbaric. We are humans and thus fallible. Bush recently revived his Twitter account, @thebillybush, which he d shut down after the  Access Hollywood  controversy. He weighed in on the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, dismissing the  drinking storyline  as  absurd. My cousin Scott was a year ahead of Kavanaugh at Yale...told me last night the drinking storyline is absurd. He drank no more than anyone else. As I assumed. The smear machine is in full swing. This will be a breathless week."

Some were debunked by members of his own administration, and in at least one case, by the president himself.

Wheeler has kept a significantly lower profile than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt, the disgraced agency chief whose resignation in July amid mounting scandals cleared the way for Wheeler s promotion. The most incendiary interactions occurred before Wheeler, whose past social media activity has drummed up controversy before, became acting administrator.In an email to HuffPost on Tuesday, Wheeler said he didn t recall liking the image of the Obamas and clicked on tweets from conspiracy theorists without reviewing the source. Over the years, I have been a prolific social media user and liked and inadvertently liked countless social media posts,  Wheeler said.  Specifically, I do not remember the post depicting President Obama and the First Lady. As for some of the other posts, I agreed with the content and was unaware of the sources. American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic political action committee, first uncovered the social media posts, which HuffPost reviewed. In January 2013, Wheeler liked a photograph of the Obamas sitting at a sports game, depicted looking at a white person s hand holding a banana. The image was posted by a page called Mia mamma Ë vergine, Italian for  My mom is a virgin,  which posts memes and videos.In July 2014, Wheeler joked that Hillary Clinton was in the Bible s apocalyptic predictions, a common right-wing trope painting the former secretary of state as demonic. In a comment under a post from the page Atheist Republic bemoaning Clinton s reverence for the Christian holy book, he wrote,  I think she s mentioned in the Book of Revelations .right after the Four Horsemen. In February, the personal Twitter account Wheeler has maintained since April 2009 retweeted Jack Posobiec, the right-wing provocateur who propagated the debunked  Pizzagate  conspiracy theory that Democratic elites operated a child sex ring at the Washington restaurant Comet Ping Pong. The theory became so popular by the end of 2016 that a 28-year-old man armed with an assault rifle stormed the pizzeria that December, threatening employees and customers. The tweet Wheeler recirculated linked to a CNBC video interview of comedian Bill Murray talking about the difficulty for comics navigating a tense political environment.Last month, Wheeler liked right-wing documentary filmmaker and former convict Dinesh D Souza s tweet casting doubt over Christine Blasey Ford s sexual assault accusations against newly-confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.Five days later, Wheeler liked a tweet from Paul Joseph Watson, an editor at the conspiracy site InfoWars, blaming Hollywood star James Woods  temporary suspension from Twitter on the website s discrimination against conservative views.   This is despicable,  said Heidi Beirich, the director of Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization that tracks hate groups.  The people he s interacting with and retweeting are just not folks a legitimate person should have anything to do with.  She called the image of the Obamas  blatantly racist.  Wheeler s past social media flubs have done little to damage his standing with the president or smudge his reputation as one of the administration s least controversial leaders. In February 2016, Wheeler criticized then-candidate Donald Trump, calling him a  bully  who  doesn t understand how the government works.   No one really knows what his political beliefs are,  Wheeler wrote in a Facebook post, The Washington Post reported last October.In August 2016, Wheeler publicly defended Milo Yiannopoulos after the alt-right troll was banned from Twitter for encouraging his fans to harass  Saturday Night Live  star Leslie Jones, according to an April report from The Daily Beast.A number of Trump administration officials have resigned over past bigoted remarks.Rev. Jamie Johnson, the head of faith-based and neighborhood partnerships at the Department of Homeland Security, resigned last November after comments surfaced of him calling black people lazy and painting Islam as a violent, illegitimate religion. Carl Higbie, the face of the federal government s volunteer service AmeriCorps, stepped down in January after racist, sexist and other prejudiced remarks he made on the radio appeared on CNN. Ian Smith, another former Homeland Security policy analyst, quit in August after The Atlantic published leaked emails showing his ties to white-nationalist activists.  I don t know what to say,  Beirich said.  I m no longer shocked by Trump administration officials doing terrible things.  Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

I support the women, and they need to be heard,  Trump said in an ABC News interview taped last week during her trip to Africa.  We need to support them, and you know, also men, not just women.

She also echoed her husband s criticism of the media. I do stand with women, but we need to show the evidence,  Trump said.  You cannot just say to somebody,  I was sexually assaulted,  or,  You did that to me,  because sometimes the media goes too far. The way they portray some stories, it s not correct. It s not right. Reporters typically follow extensive protocols to corroborate misconduct claims before publishing them. Many survivors do not report sexual assault for a variety of reasons, including fear of retaliation, embarrassment or a lack of security. Sometimes, evidence is not readily available.Trump stood by her husband when he was accused of sexual misconduct during his presidential campaign and dismissed the  Access Hollywood  tape of him bragging about sexual assault as  boy talk. In a 2016 interview with CNN s Anderson Cooper, she claimed her husband s accusers were  organized from the opposition  and suggested that people  check the background of these women. President Donald Trump has repeatedly insinuated that many women saying they were sexually assaulted, including those making such allegations against him, are lying.During his campaign, he mocked his accusers by suggesting they were not attractive enough to be sexually assaulted. Look at her, I don t think so,  he said of People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff, who said Trump attacked her in 2005.  Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you,  he said of another woman, without naming her. At a campaign rally last week, the president undermined Christine Blasey Ford by mocking her testimony that now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school.On Friday, the president also claimed without evidence that sexual assault survivors who demonstrated against Kavanaugh s nomination on Capitol Hill were paid protesters.Need help?

The Senate leader claimed the vacancy shouldn t be filled in the months leading up to a presidential election, citing historical precedent.But on Sunday, McConnell offered a revised version of his reasoning and refused to say he wouldn t push for confirmation of a potential Supreme Court nominee from President Donald Trump in 2020..@senatemajldr: We didn t attack Merrick Garland s background and try to destroy him. We simply followed the tradition in America, which is that if you have a Senate of a different party than the president, you don t fill a vacancy created in a presidential year. pic.twitter.com/u1jm36EEbCDiscussing Brett Kavanaugh s Saturday confirmation to the court, Fox News  Chris Wallace asked McConnell to respond to a clip of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) slamming the Kentucky lawmaker s handling of the Garland nomination. We didn t attack Merrick Garland s background and try to destroy him,  McConnell responded on  Fox News Sunday.   We simply followed the tradition in America, which is that if you have... a Senate of a different party than the president you don t fill a vacancy created in a presidential year. That went all the way back to 1888. Wallace, picking up on McConnell s revised version of his rationale for blocking Garland, pressed him on his mention of party difference. When you blocked Merrick Garland s nomination from President Obama, you basically said that we don t do this in a presidential election year, and that we wait until the election and then whoever the people choose (for the White House), they get to pick the Supreme Court nominee,  Wallace said.  But what you just said now was it s a question of whether or not the party in control of the Senate is different than the president.  If Donald Trump were to name somebody in the final year of his first term in 2020, are you saying that you would go ahead with that nomination?  he asked McConnell.McConnell danced around the inquiry, pointing again to the Senate s voting record in the 1880s. When Wallace tried to ask the question again, McConnell interrupted him:  The answer to your question is we ll see whether there s a vacancy in 2020.  Later Sunday, CBS News  John Dickerson continued to grill McConnell about his reason for blocking Garland s nomination. Your decision to block Merrick Garland is something [Democrats] see as having kicked off a new stage in the partisanship associated with Supreme Court nominees,  Dickerson said on CBS   Face The Nation. McConnell claimed again that he had been merely following historical precedent, but Dickerson challenged him on the facts. John you are not listening to me,  McConnell said.  The history is exactly as I told you.  Dickerson responded that they  have a disagreement about the history.  What I gave you is the history of this. I know the history of this. I ve spent a lot of time on this throughout my career,  @senatemajldr tells @FaceTheNation https://t.co/0cmzAFuc8L pic.twitter.com/ictodS303cThe Republican senator s remarks on Sunday echoed his response to reporters a day earlier when asked a similar question about a potential 2020 Supreme Court nominee. We ll see what it looks like in 2020,  McConnell said.McConnell, asked if he would stick by standard set in 2016 when he kept the seat vacant for a year -- assuming another one arises in 2020 -- notes how long it s been since a nominee was confirmed in a presidential election year. Then says:  We ll see what it looks like in 2020. McConnell s latest comments on blocking Garland leave wiggle room for Trump to potentially nominate another Supreme Court justice in 2020 if an opening occurs then and if the GOP still controls the Senate, despite a looming presidential election. Kavanaugh was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice hours after the Senate narrowly confirmed him, 50-48. His confirmation likely ushers in a fundamentally more conservative tilt on the nation s highest court. He is the second Supreme Court justice appointed under Trump. Justice Neil Gorsuch was confirmed in April 2017 to the seat that McConnell held open during Obama s final 10 months in office.This article has been updated with McConnell s comments on CBS   Face The Nation.

She spoke about her allegations, which were first made public in an interview with The Washington Post, that Kavanaugh had pinned her to a bed during a party when they were both in high school in the 1980s, attempted to remove her clothes and held his hand over her mouth to the point that she feared for her life. Two other women came forward with their own allegations of sexual impropriety after Ford went public.Kavanagh vehemently denied the allegations, and moved to paint the claims as a partisan attack that he linked to  a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election. During her remarks, Ford addressed her hesitation to come forward, saying she was not in front of lawmakers  because I want to be.  I am terrified,  Ford said.  I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.  I understand and appreciate the importance of hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact it has had only life and on my family. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court on Saturday in a narrow 50-48 vote.Lisa Banks, another of Ford s attorneys, told MSNBC that Ford had no regrets about coming forward because she  still believes it was the right thing to do. President Donald Trump stood steadfast beside Kavanaugh, and even moved to discredit Ford, mocking her at a rally shortly after her testimony and doubting the claims.Ford s lawyers on Sunday said she was  horrified  at the president s attacks and compared her ordeal to that of Anita Hill, the woman who publicly testified against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. We thought it was bad back in 1991, and it s even worse today, the political climate and how women are treated,  Banks said.

During a campaign event for Stacey Abrams, a Democrat in Georgia s gubernatorial race, Holder revised a famous quote by the former first lady as he urged Democrats to be as  tough,   dedicated  and  committed  as the Republicans are. Michelle Obama, I love her. ... Michelle always says,  When they go low, we go high,   Holder said as the audience chimed in to repeat the memorable phrase. No,  Holder continued.  No, when they go low, we kick them. That s what this new Democratic Party is about. We re proud as hell to be Democrats. We re going to fight for the ideals of the Democratic Party.  We re not in this just to make a statement. We re in this to win,  he added.Holder later clarified that he s not encouraging people to do anything violent. When I say we kick them, I don t mean we do anything inappropriate, we don t do anything illegal, but we have to be tough and we have to fight,  he said.Holder this summer expressed interest in running in the 2020 presidential electionHis revised message stands in stark contrast to the one Michelle Obama first shared at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.Referencing Trump and his divisive and hateful campaign rhetoric, the first lady offered Democrats advice that she and President Barack Obama give to their children. When someone is cruel or acts like a bully, you don t stoop to their level,  she said.  No, our motto is:  When they go low, we go high.  Holder s new message is far from the civility preached by the Obamas and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, but it shows how desperate Democrats have become as Trump proves to be even more divisive in the Oval Office.In response to the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year, Trump said there were  very fine people on both sides  of the conflict. He s also peddled falsehoods during his ongoing campaign rallies, doubled down on his attacks on the media and Democrats in Congress, and openly doubted sexual assault survivors who were protesting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation.Most recently, during a campaign rally in Iowa, Trump supporters energetically revived the  Lock her up  chant previously saved for Clinton in response to a false claim that Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) leaked a letter to the media from a woman who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were teens.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the name of Stacey Abrams, the Democrat running for governor in Georgia, as Stacy Adams.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The only problem? Trump s claims appear to be based on an off-hand and sarcastic comment made on Fox News. Writer Asra Q. Nomani appeared as a guest on  Fox & Friends,  a show Trump is known to watch, to talk about her Wall Street Journal article linking billionaire George Soros to a number of groups that have organized protests.But she was talking more about his financial support for organizations, not individuals.  She wrote in the Journal:  Yet while most demonstrators are not paid for their efforts, the protests at the Capitol Saturday, and the ones that have included stalking lawmakers inside and outside their offices, are organized by groups of which Mr. Soros is an important patron. Asked on Fox News if protesters were being paid, she cracked that  because people have sent me lots of messages that they re waiting for their check, a lot of sincere people are protesting.  Nomani confirmed to Mediaite that the line about  waiting for their check  was sarcasm. But the sarcasm was lost on Trump, who tweeted about 45 minutes after the  Fox & Friends  appearance: The paid D.C. protesters are now ready to REALLY protest because they haven t gotten their checks - in other words, they weren t paid! Screamers in Congress, and outside, were far too obvious - less professional than anticipated by those paying (or not paying) the bills!Twitter critics were quick to respond: If people were  Paid Protesters  and weren t  Paid  as you say.. Why would they protest again? Oh right! Because none of them were paid or ever expected to be!

This is MY son. He graduated #1 in boot camp,  the #HimToo tweet began. He is a gentleman who respects women. He won t go on solo dates due to the current climate of false sexual accusations by radical feminists with an axe to grind.  Since Brett Kavanaugh s bitter confirmation battle to become the next Supreme Court justice, Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have claimed young men should be afraid of women falsely accusing them of sexual misconduct. Kavanaugh was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice on Monday after a nearly party-line vote Saturday to confirm him. The #HimToo tweet includes a photo of Reynolds  son Pieter Hanson in a Navy uniform, posing with his elbow on his knee and his chin on his fist.My brother is trending on twitter because of my moms ridiculous tweet. I m a mixture of laughing hard and feeling bad for him.  #HimToo pic.twitter.com/YG93x9ikiiA man who said he is the sailor s brother told HuffPost late Monday that his mother can be, well, a mom with maybe some boundary issues. My mom has good intentions. But she wasn t trying to be a proxy. She s posted on Facebook about her single eligible sons and tried to get them dates many times over the years . But she never spoke to my brother nor did he make any of those statements regarding sexual allegations. He s actually a big supporter of women s rights among other things. An upstanding guy in the community, and everyone that knows him loves him.Part of the reason mom can t understand why he s single. But the real reason is he s busy going to school full time, works 3 jobs (one as a volunteer) and is close to opening a new brewery business. He s a vet with an honorable discharge that received recognition by president Obama.My brother is one of the finest human beings I know ... . He at first was very upset but is now taking it in stride and laughing about how mom went viral.He is single. He does go on solo dates. And he s not afraid of the current climate or sexual allegations. As his brother though I m sure he wouldn t mind a date out of this deep down haha. He really is a wonderful person.But despite mom s good intentions, that didn t stop Twitter from piling on and taking up the cause. By Monday evening, #HimToo started trending on Twitter.

She then dropped the mic (or maybe fumbled it) by ending her rant with #HimToo.First of all, don t ever do this, moms. There isn t a single grown-ass man on this planet who wants his mother to don a cape for him on social media listing all the reasons he s afraid of dating. I guarantee it will have the opposite of your intended effect. Thankfully, the son in question, Pieter Hanson, has a great sense of humor and is rolling with his mom s ill-advised rant, and it seems like some people are enjoying a good laugh from it. But let s get real about this. #HimToo is the #AllLivesMatter movement of sexual assault. We roll our eyes at the hashtag and wonder how someone could fail so spectacularly at understanding such a basic concept. The narrative that the president and others in his administration are peddling these days   men suddenly scared of angry women hell-bent on ruining their lives   is laughable.I already covered this in my latest advice column, but it can t be said enough: False reports of sexual assault are minuscule in number compared to actual sexual assaults. To parents who find themselves shook over the idea of their sons being wrongfully accused: Your fears would be better directed toward them being sexually assaulted themselves. The odds are certainly greater. And why are people suddenly finding the need to rush to men s defense? No matter what side of the political fence you happen to find yourself on, it s hardly debatable that men (white men, specifically) are running the show around here. They certainly aren t the victims of radical feminists. Or angry liberals. Or the boogeyman. Or anyone else, for that matter.Don t believe me? There are two dudes here in the U.S. who, between the two of them, faced more than 20 combined sexual misconduct allegations just prior to securing their current jobs. One is the president of the United States, the other holds the most powerful vote on the nation s highest court. So tell me again how sexual assault allegations ruin men s lives?The same way shouting  All Lives Matter!  discounts the fact that black people are more often victims of police violence, we ignore the fact that women are far and away more likely to be sexually assaulted than men when we say  Him Too!  (Yes, I m completely aware that boys and men are also sexually assaulted; however, that s not what the hashtag is addressing in this case.)Since the beginning of time, women s lives have been irreparably damaged not just by enduring such a despicable crime, but by feeling as if they ve been assaulted all over again when they decide to make their allegations public. It s the underage girl who confides in her parents that a family member molested her, only to be mocked by them. It s the college student who was raped by the star quarterback, only to have the police protect him instead of her because they don t want to ruin the athlete s future. It s Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who, after risking everything these past several weeks to come forward with allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, is still unable to go home due to the barrage of death threats against her and her family. These women are the ones who are affected the most by sexual assault allegations because they were the ones sexually assaulted. Many Americans have speculated on social media these past several days that fewer sexual assault survivors will come forward with their stories now, given the way Dr. Ford was treated. Hell, can you blame them?For me, the most disturbing part of this whole #HimToo thing is watching women   and yes, that means mothers   kick dirt on other women who are brave enough to come forward with sexual assault allegations. A female friend of mine once told me she confided in her mom the day after she was raped in high school. Her mom s response?  Please don t say anything. I don t want you to ruin that boy s life.  Needless to say, she is not on speaking terms with her mother today. As a man, it shouldn t even be possible for me to be more pissed off than certain women when it comes to how Dr. Ford, our daughters and all women in general are being treated. Yet here I am. This #HimToo nonsense needs to stop before it s given enough oxygen to fully ramp up. Believing women must become the default response to sexual assault allegations   because as society has shown us, they have a hell of a lot to lose by lying about it.

It s a lot of work   maybe they don t want to do it,  Grassley said, according to The Wall Street Journal.  My chief of staff of 33 years tells me we ve tried to recruit women and we couldn t get the job done. Grassley later returned to the reporters to clarify his remarks, adding that it was also hard to recruit male senators. We have a hard time getting men on the committee,  he said.  It s just a lot of work whether you re a man or a woman, it doesn t matter. He further walked back his comments on the workload, saying female senators generally work harder than men. On average, any woman in the United States Senate, whether they re on Judiciary or any other committee, probably works harder than the average man. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Saturday that the GOP was not avoiding having women on the Judiciary Committee, adding that he would commit to bringing more women on the panel going forward. We ve encouraged several of our women senators to go on the committee, and I intend to do that again at the beginning of the next session,  he told reporters at a press conference. There s been no effort to avoid it,  McConnell added.  I ve tried to encourage them to do it, obviously without success, and we d love to have one of our women senators on Judiciary. And hopefully, that will be the case next year. On Saturday, the Senate Judiciary Committee responded to the media attention by pointing out that the chairman does not determine who becomes a committee member. Republican senators request & select committee assignments based on their preferences. Sen. Grassley encourages but never determines who becomes a member of the Judiciary Committee & does so regardless of gender. Audio without media mischaracterization: https://t.co/72tAJCfDZeAll 11 of the Republicans in the Senate Judiciary Committee are men, while the Democrats have four women, including its ranking member, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).Concern over the GOP s all-male presence on the committee grew after Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were teens. To soften that concern, Republicans recruited a female prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell, to question Ford and Kavanaugh during a hearing on Sept. 27.When Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Friday she plans to vote for Kavanaugh, Republicans all but sealed his confirmation. Republicans will move forward with the vote after the FBI s limited investigation of Ford s allegation proved inconclusive.

Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Friday she plans to support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, paving the way for his confirmation.Collins announced her decision at the end of blistering 45-minute speech in which she defended Kavanaugh s judicial record, criticized his opponents, and laid to waste Christine Blasey Ford s claim that he sexually assaulted her. I believe that [Ford] is a survivor of sexual assault and that this trauma has upended her life,  Collins said, before offering a series of criticisms of Ford s allegations.  I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court. The long-awaited announcement comes as a blow to Democrats and women s groups who view the appellate court judge as a serious threat to the Affordable Care Act and reproductive rights, which Collins claims to support.Women s groups also hoped Collins would have voted to reject Kavanaugh s nomination based on the allegations of sexual assault that were leveled against him late in the confirmation process. Last month, the Maine lawmaker called for a pause in the process to hear from Ford, the woman who accused Kavanaugh of groping her in high school when they were both teens. The FBI conducted a limited investigation of the allegation, but the report proved inconclusive. The Senate is expected to hold its final confirmation vote on Saturday. With Collins and Jeff Flake of Arizona, another wavering GOP senator, on board, Kavanaugh s bid to the high court appears to be all but assured. Shortly after Collins  speech, Sen. Joe Manchin  (D-W.Va.), another potential swing vote, announced his support of Kavanaugh.Nominated by President Donald Trump in July to replace former Justice Anthony Kennedy, the 53-year-old Kavanaugh is viewed by legal experts as a reliable conservative who will tilt the balance of the Supreme Court to the right for decades.Collins, a blue state lawmaker, faced an intense lobbying campaign organized by progressive groups aimed at persuading her to reject Kavanaugh based on his record as a federal appellate court judge and other issues. Causing particular concern to the groups were comments Kavanaugh has made praising Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist s dissent in Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion rights nationwide.In addition to millions of dollars spent on anti-Kavanaugh TV ads in Maine, activists sent Collins  offices 3,000 coat hangers, a symbol of the dangerous method for terminating a pregnancy used when abortion was illegal and many women resorted to risky procedures.In Friday s announcement, Collins dismissed concerns that Kavanaugh would vote to gut Roe. Protecting this right is important to me,  she said, before arguing that Kavanaugh s stance on judicial precedent would protect Roe. She did not mention the judge s public criticism of the landmark ruling nor his recent vote against an undocumented teenager who was seeking an abortion.She also pointed to opposition from women s rights groups on other Supreme Court justices who were nominated by Republican presidents but ended up later voting to enshrine reproductive rights. Suffice it to say, prominent advocacy organizations have been wrong,  she said.Opponents also seized on an email Kavanaugh wrote in 2003 as an official in President George W. Bush s administration in which he seemed to question whether Roe was  settled law.  The email appeared to contradict assurances Collins said Kavanaugh gave her in a meeting in August that he accepted the settled law notion about Roe. He often describes Roe as precedent upon precedent,  Collins said earlier this month, referring to Kavanaugh s confirmation hearing testimony. She further repeatedly expressed confidence he would not vote to overturn the landmark decision.Along with not being swayed by the concerns over Kavanaugh s views on abortion rights, she apparently discounted claims from Democrats that he could be expected to rule in favor of overturning the Affordable Care Act and against upholding its insurance protections for people with preexisting medical conditions.Collins was one of three Senate Republicans who helped defeat the GOP effort to repeal Obamacare in 2017, and progressives hoped she would step up in its defense once more.She also didn t share objections raised by Democrats about the secretive, unprecedented process Republicans used to vet Kavanaugh s record.During his 2003-2006 tenure at the White House working for Bush, he controlled the flow of papers to the Oval Office as staff secretary. During that pivotal time after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the Bush administration dealt with controversial issues like detainee treatment and the Iraq War. Democrats wanted to know whether Kavanaugh expressed his opinions in any documents or emails on such controversial matters as the torture of detainees. I don t see a need for those,  Collins told HuffPost in July, referring to Kavanaugh s staff secretary records.Collins not only voted for Trump s previous Supreme court pick, conservative Neil Gorsuch, but for all of the president s scores of nominees to lower federal courts. That includes one who compared Roe v. Wade to the infamous 1857 Dred Scott decision that ruled slaves could not be U.S. citizens.Collins, 65, is up for re-election in 2020 and some progressives are eyeing a concentrated effort to defeat her as a way to hold her accountable for her record on judicial appointees. But Collins, first elected to her seat in 1996, has worked hard to sustain her popularity among Maine s voters.Alana Horowitz Satlin contributed to this report.

Ford testified that Kavanaugh assaulted her, which she said contributed to lifelong anxiety, phobia and PTSD-like symptoms. Many survivors of sexual violence report lasting depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. But new research published Wednesday in JAMA Internal Medicine draws a clear link not only between sexual trauma and lasting psychological issues, but also physical effects that contribute to disease and even death.What s more, sexual harassment   which previous estimates say anywhere between 25 and 85 percent of women experience in their lifetimes   also contributes to these poor health outcomes. The study, conducted by a research team from the University of Pittsburgh, looked at health outcomes for just over 300 nonsmoking women aged 40 to 60 years old. It found that those who reported a history of sexual assault were more likely to struggle with depression, anxiety and poor sleep.And a history of sexual harassment was tied to higher blood pressure, poor sleep and higher triglycerides   which can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. The study s researchers did not intentionally time the release of their findings to Ford s testimony or the growing Me Too movement. In fact, their initial aim was simply to study the impact of hormonal changes in menopause on heart health. But they were struck by the high levels of harassment and assault reported by the study participants, who answered broad questions about their life experiences and health. Using a common questionnaire, researchers asked women if they d ever experienced or been pressured into unwanted sexual contact.Nineteen percent of the women said they d experienced sexual harassment at work, 22 percent said they d been sexually assaulted at some point in their lives, and an additional 10 percent experienced both. These experiences are really common,  study researcher Rebecca Thurston, a professor of psychiatry, psychology, and epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh, told HuffPost. And [they] do have profound implications for women s lives,  she continued.  Not just on their overall functioning at work or school, but also their mental and physical health. Though the study does not attempt to establish cause and effect, Thurston said there are several ways in which sexual harassment and assault might influence long-term health. Research has long shown, for example, that trauma can negatively influence people s health behaviors. So people who are victims of sexual violence may be more likely to do things like smoke and drink, which in turn hurts overall health.But the stress that accompanies assault and harassment might have a direct physiological effect as well.  Stress, particularly if it s chronic, is linked to elevated stress hormones, which can impact the genome,  Thurston said. Indeed, in the past decade researchers have begun unpack the ways in which stress hormones can alter gene activity and ultimately influence the body s ability to regulate itself. The researchers did not gather data on when in their lives the women said they experienced sexual assault or harassment. However, research shows these kinds of events often occur in late adolescence or young adulthood. Because the women in the study were between the ages of 40 and 60, the findings suggest these health effects last for decades.Thurston said she does hope her work, combined with this political moment that is focused on the stories of survivors, will help shine a light on how much more research is needed to understand how prevalent sexual trauma is and the extent to which it can shape a person s well-being. (She noted that the same might be true in men, she just happens to research women s health specifically.) We re kind of playing a game of catch-up here in understanding how prevalent these toxic stress exposures are, as well as how they impact women s health,  she said. Her team s work was presented at the the North American Menopause Society s annual meeting this week. "

When it comes to the political stuff with you, I m going to say, bring it on,  Gaga told Colbert after he asked if she wanted to voice her opinion of the topic.  Because what I have seen on the news with this debate of Kavanaugh versus Dr. Ford, it s one of the most upsetting things I have ever witnessed. On Friday, senators are expected to vote on whether to advance Kavanaugh after a weeklong delay for an FBI investigation into the allegations against him, with a final vote expected Saturday. Gaga took particular offense to President Donald Trump s remarks at a recent Mississippi rally where he openly mocked Ford for coming forward 36 years after her alleged assault.  I will tell you something, because I am a sexual assault survivor and the truth is, you know, Trump the other day was speaking at a rally and he said,  She has no memory of how she got to the party, should we trust that she remembers the assault?  And the answer is yes!  Gaga said.  And I ll tell you exactly why. I also know that this woman is smart because she s a psychologist. She s no dummy.  If someone is assaulted or experiences trauma, there is science and scientific proof   it s biology   that people change. The brain changes. And literally what it does, is it takes the trauma and it puts it in a box and it files it away and it shuts it so that we can survive the pain,  the singer continued.The  Shallow  singer went onto explain that she believed that Ford was  triggered and that box opened  when Kavanaugh was nominated to the court, prompting her to come forward with her story.  When that box opened, she was brave enough to share it with the world to protect this country,  the singer concluded. Gaga has been a longtime supporter of sexual assault survivors, recording the original song she co-wrote titled  Til It Happens To You  in 2015 for the powerful campus rape documentary  The Hunting Ground.  I didn t tell anyone for, I think, seven years,  Gaga said of her own sexual assault while promoting the film.  I didn t know how to think about it. I didn t know how to accept it. I didn t know how not to blame myself, or think it was my fault. It was something that really changed my life. It changed who I was completely. "

Very proud of the U.S. Senate for voting  YES  to advance the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh!Since Christine Blasey Ford came forward last month to accuse Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were high school students in the 1980s, the nomination has effectively become a referendum on whether senators believe Ford or Kavanaugh. He has denied her allegations, as well as allegations of sexual misconduct from two other women.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said before the vote that its outcome could validate  media bullying and mob intimidation  if Kavanaugh went down. We will either give notice that totally uncorroborated allegations are now, officially, enough to destroy an American s life,  McConnell said.  Or we will declare that our society cannot, must not, will not, set the bar so low. Ford testified about her memory of the assault last week and, because of a last-minute request by Flake, Republicans postponed Senate votes to give the Federal Bureau of Investigation more time to investigate Ford s claim. The FBI wrapped up its investigation late Wednesday, prompting Democrats to complain that the bureau hadn t interviewed enough people with relevant information, such as Ford s friends she d previously told about the assault.  I think I ve made my case as best I could,  said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who teamed up with Flake to make the FBI probe happen.  The materials are what they are, and it is now left to senators to reach their conclusions. I do not think we ve done as thorough and fulsome a job of assessing the facts and the allegations as we should have. Because of the terms of a 2009 agreement between the Obama White House and the Senate Judiciary Committee, only senators and a limited number of staffers were allowed to see the FBI s report. They weren t allowed to disclose any of its contents. Almost all Republicans argued that the FBI report provided  no corroboration  of Ford s claims, but at least one Democratic senator, Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), disputed that.Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said he wished everyone could read the report.  There are things in here that really make me angry.

Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) pointed to Bill Cosby s recent sexual assault conviction as evidence that similar accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh should be more thoroughly investigated.Bustos, who is running for re-election in Illinois  17th Congressional District this November, drew the comparison after  Outnumbered  host Harris Faulkner noted that because of statutes of limitations, Kavanaugh cannot be convicted of any of the crimes he has been accused of by Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick. To your point of these allegations going back a bit, I ve got two words for you, and that s Bill Cosby,  Bustos said.  He was just convicted out of a case that dated back to 2004. Other allegations went back decades. And so if there is an attempt to get to the truth, the truth can be found, and I think that was lacking in this case. Bustos joined the chorus of Democrats who say the FBI s new investigation into Kavanaugh was not nearly rigorous enough. There were dozens of people who were left out of this whole process,  she said.  To me, that doesn t shout out that this is a thorough investigation and that this is an attempt to get to the ultimate truth. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said as much on Wednesday, noting that the FBI didn t interview Kavanaugh or Ford, who accused him of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school. It looks to be the product of an incomplete investigation that was limited, perhaps by the White House   I don t know,  Feinstein said.Kavanaugh s nomination is set for a Senate floor vote on Friday.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

His performance in the hearings changed my mind,  Stevens said, the Palm Beach Post first reported.  The senators should pay attention to this. Retired #SCOTUS Justice John Paul Stevens on Judge #Kavanaugh:  I ve changed my views for reasons that have no really relationship to his intellectual ability or his record as a federal judge I think that his performance during the hearings caused me to change my mind.  pic.twitter.com/RyM6ZKOevxFormer justices do not normally comment on pending Supreme Court nominations, and Stevens is the only living former justice to comment on whether Kavanaugh should be confirmed. Sandra Day O Connor, David Souter and Anthony Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh was nominated to replace, have not said anything about the nomination process. Few figures could be more dissimilar from each other than Stevens and Kavanaugh. Stevens was nominated by Republican President Gerald Ford in 1975. He went on to become the most liberal member of a minority bloc on the Supreme Court. He retired in 2010 and was replaced by Justice Elena Kagan.Kavanaugh has been a partisan political operative, working with Republicans to investigate President Bill Clinton and helping George W. Bush win the Bush v. Gore court case in 2000 before being nominated to a seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. (Stevens dissented in Bush v. Gore.) He was chosen to fill Kennedy s seat because conservatives are assured that he will be a reliable conservative vote, unlike Stevens (or Souter).Stevens also noted on Thursday that the partisan political influence over the high court was  worse  than ever.  I ve never been a political person,  he added. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Their sworn affidavits were significant, since they indicated Ford had not made up her accusation just to smear President Donald Trump s pick for the Supreme Court. They were the first people aside from Ford s husband   who also submitted an affidavit   to say she d told them about what allegedly happened. But the declarations got relatively little attention, as they were almost immediately overshadowed by another allegation from a woman who said she d seen Kavanaugh at parties where rapes had occurred. The evening after the three affidavits from Ford s friends were submitted, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a key swing vote on the Kavanaugh nomination, said she thought they sounded important    like something I need to read and I am sure will come up at the hearing tomorrow,  she said in a brief hallway interview.The affidavits did not come up during the hearing, except for passing references by Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). And Ford mentioned she d told a few friends about what allegedly happened. But in the deluge of news that followed Ford and Kavanaugh s testimonies, those affidavits from Ford s friends have seemingly been forgotten. Even with a crucial first vote scheduled for Friday   which is partly a referendum on Ford s credibility   several senators seemed as though they d never heard of the affidavits in interviews this week.  I have not seen an affidavit to that effect,  Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), another undecided senator, told HuffPost on Wednesday.  I m not sure which affidavits you re referring to,  said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a member of the Judiciary Committee.Another judiciary member, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), said he didn t remember if he d read the documents.  This isn t a test, is it? I ve read so much stuff,  he said. After a reporter described the documents, he said:  That was her husband and some friends. I probably did. I ve read a lot. If it s a test I hope it s multiple choice. Even Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the senator in whom Ford first confided, didn t recall the affidavits.  I can t think of it right now,  she said. In a followup email from her office, Feinstein said the fact that Ford had confided in these people  long before  the nomination meant the case was not a  he-said, she-said  as some have characterized it. HuffPost s questions about the affidavits could fairly be described as having a  pop quiz  quality, since senators this week have been bombarded with questions about even more recent developments. But that doesn t mean the affidavits are irrelevant. They are what we would call  prior consistent statements    in other words, [Ford] was telling people about this before she had the alleged motive to fabricate,  said Laurie Levenson, a former prosecutor and current criminal law and evidence professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.  If this were a court of law, this would be significant, but it s all gotten lost in the partisanship. It s not a court of law, but Republicans hired prosecutor Rachel Mitchell to question Ford during last week s hearing. Mitchell listed several problems she saw with Ford s claims in a memo to Republicans after the hearing, saying she didn t think a reasonable prosecutor would bring a case based on the evidence in front of the committee. One issue Mitchell raised was that Ford s description of the incident had supposedly shifted. Ford told the committee she d confided in her husband, Russell, about a  sexual assault  shortly after they married in 2002. But, Mitchell noted, The Washington Post reported that Ford had told her husband about  physical abuse.  When speaking with her husband, Dr. Ford changed her description of the incident to become less specific,  Mitchell wrote. The affidavits from Ford s friends and husband bear directly on whether Ford has told her story consistently. But Mitchell omitted those from her memo. Russell Ford said in his affidavit that in 2012 his wife told him about a sexual assault she experienced in high school   that she d been  trapped in a room and physically restrained by one boy who was molesting her while another boy watched.  She d told him the attacker s name was Brett Kavanaugh. Another friend, Keith Koegler, said Ford told him her story during a conversation about an infamous sexual assault case at Stanford University. She told him  she was particularly bothered by it because she was assaulted in high school by a man who was now a federal judge in Washington, D.C.,  Koegler said.Rebecca White, one of Ford s neighbors, said that one day in 2017, Ford struck up a conversation about a social media post White had written about sexual assault.  She then told me that when she was a young teen, she had been sexually assaulted by an older teen,  White said.  I remember her saying that her assailant was now a federal judge.  And Adela Gildo-Mazzon said she still has the receipt from the day in 2013 when she met Ford for lunch at an Italian restaurant in Mountain View, California.  Christine told me she had been having a hard day because she was thinking about an assault she experienced when she was much younger,  Gildo-Mazzon said.  She said that she had been almost raped by someone who was now a federal judge. She told me she had been trapped in a room with two drunken guys, and that she then escaped, ran away, and hid.  It s not clear that anything would be different if the memos had received more attention, since Republicans have consistently said they think Ford is mistaken about what happened. According to that theory, these people are just repeating her mistake. Asked about the affidavits last week, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the people didn t really have corroborating information.  Those are not people who witnessed the alleged event,  he said. Levenson said Republicans have set a high bar for corroboration.  Frankly, in these types of settings, you don t get eyewitnesses,  she said.Democrats included Ford s friends on a list of people they thought the FBI should interview as part of its supplemental investigation into Kavanaugh s background. On Thursday, though, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) complained that apparently none of them had been questioned.  It seemed to me it would be reasonable for those four individuals to be questioned by the FBI,  Coons said.Ford s attorneys have also objected in a letter that the FBI didn t interview her friends.

Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.Swing senators whose votes could make or break Kavanaugh s confirmation have hinted as to how they will vote after the findings were released. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), whose indecision last week prompted the FBI investigation, told reporters that he saw  no additional corroborating information  about the claims. Graham has been vocal about his feelings toward Kavanaugh s confirmation. On Wednesday, he told Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic that he thought Kavanaugh was being  treated like crap.  When the crowd responded with resounding boos, Graham responded:  Yeah, well boo yourself. "

The FBI just concluded its investigation into the allegations. This week Trump tried to paint the process, which has transfixed the country, as unfair.  In this realm, you are truly guilty until proven innocent,  he said.  This is a very difficult time. Indeed, it is a scary time for Trump, his party and their female allies. It s a terrifying moment for a male-dominated party grounded in the idea that men are superior to women. Women are growing more powerful by the hour in the U.S. Particularly on the Democratic side, where increasing numbers of women are running for office. Meanwhile, the Me Too movement is still growing. Since Bill Cosby was arrested in 2015, 810 high-profile figures (including some women) have been accused of sexual misconduct, according to a recent tally from Temin and Co., a consulting firm in New York. Nearly 200 of them worked in politics and government.Women who have been mistreated are finally getting a modicum of respect; their stories are getting heard. And the men who don t respect women are freaking out. This is textbook: When women gain power, it threatens certain notions of masculine identity that are grounded in the idea of male superiority. And men get scared. The gloves come off.We see this in the workplace over and over. A good deal of sexual harassment happens to women when they become the boss, researchers have found. The idea is to make women feel as uncomfortable as possible in a male-dominated environment so that they ll go away.That s clearly the dynamic in play now. Trump is trying to make the Kavanaugh nomination a fight between men and women. In his corner are plenty of partisans attacking even the notion that a woman should have the right to get in the way of a man s ascent to power. The argument spins out that the accusations against Kavanaugh have been unfair and unjust. He has portrayed himself as a victim in all this   even as he is poised to take a seat on the highest court in the country. And his defenders have picked up the baton. You ve got nothing to apologize for,  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told Kavanaugh after he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week.  This is the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) blithely ignored questions about Kavanaugh when approached by female sexual assault survivors in Washington this week. He later said such protesters  won t scare us.  They clearly have.  This is a very important time in our country. Due Process, Fairness and Common Sense are now on trial!  Trump tweeted Thursday morning. The thing is, investigating the claims levied against Kavanaugh is actually fair.  Kavanaugh is not on trial. He is gunning for a lifetime appointment that would give him remarkable power over the lives of everyday Americans.Investigating accusations of sexual assault made against a man in that position should be an obvious part of the democratic process. Looking into such a person s character is the Senate s job.This isn t about men versus women. It is absolutely about fairness and equality. Whether that s the rationale that wins in the end is anything but clear. The Senate is set to vote on his nomination within days. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

That is not what the Senate is interested in or asking about,  he told CNN on Thursday, responding to reports that the White House ordered limits on the scope of the investigation and that the FBI did not follow up with former Kavanaugh acquaintances who have publicly refuted his claims that he did not drink excessively, one of several lies he may have told during his Senate testimony last week.Shah insisted the investigation was thorough, adding that Kavanaugh already underwent other FBI background checks   though they did not cover the allegations. A lot of people are coming forward with claims about his high school and college drinking, which the Senate hasn t asked us about,  Shah said.  But also, more importantly, he has already admitted in his testimony that he drank in high school, drank in college, sometimes drank too much, drank underage. He said he liked beer. I don t really know what folks who are demanding an open-ended fishing expedition into those areas want, other than delay, delay, delay. Several former classmates, roommates and acquaintances of Kavanaugh s have publicly refuted his claims that he did not drink excessively at the time of the allegations. Other reporting about Kavanaugh s past has also suggested the judge may have lied about his consumption and instead sometimes drank to the extent that he may have had memory lapses about the alleged incidents.Despite contacting the FBI themselves, many of the people who have spoken out were reportedly not interviewed during the investigation.Democrats have criticized the FBI s probe, the results of which senators reviewed early Thursday. We did not agree that the White House should tie the FBI s hands,  said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.

The final fight. The desperate plea: Cancel Kavanaugh. Thousands of protesters   including sexual assault survivors and their allies  marched on Washington from the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse, where Kavanaugh currently works, to the Hart Senate Office Building in a last-ditch effort to appeal to senators to vote no on his confirmation.As crowds filled the Senate halls, police began making arrests for civil disobedience. Capitol Police had arrested 302 people for  unlawfully demonstrating  at the Senate office buildings as of Thursday afternoon. At 3:30 p.m. ET, police detained 293 people at the Hart Senate Office Building. Nine more people were detained nearly two hours later at the Dirksen Senate Office Building.In a statement to HuffPost, police said they were processing and releasing the individuals on site. Videos at the protest show long lines of demonstrators who were under arrest.Comedian Amy Schumer, as well as actress Emily Ratajkowski were reportedly among those arrested there.Busloads of women from other parts of the country   including survivors from West Virginia   made their way to D.C. in the morning for demonstrations that would take place throughout the day.Caitlin Gaffin, 30, was one of them. She was among nine protesters arrested in West Virginia while occupying the campaign headquarters of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) for more than 10 hours on Monday. Today, with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, she and several dozen other assault survivors and allies met with Manchin to tell their stories.She said Manchin was  teary eyed  as he listened but made no indication of which way he d vote.

We re hoping to be able to appeal to them in some way to show how personal this is for their constituents, for everyone. In D.C., speeches by celebrities like Alicia Keys and Whoopi Golberg are planned. Additional #CancelKavanaugh protests are slated across the country, from Portland, Oregon to New York City. Activist groups across the country have been holding demonstrations all week, ever since Kavanaugh lied under oath during testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, ever since Christine Blasey Ford cried in front of millions of TV viewers when she publicly accused him of forcing himself on her in high school.Since then, other women have come forward against the judge, and many of his former classmates have tried to distance themselves from him or backed up claims by his alleged victims.Trump s  grab them by the pussy  tape will air on loop for 12 hours in front of the Capitol today, courtesy of @UltraViolet, to remind senators that a  serial sexual abuser  is trying to elevate another  sexual abuser   Brett Kavanaugh   into high office. https://t.co/Nlke08d6w0The vote was delayed last Friday by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who called for an FBI investigation into the accusations against Kavanaugh. With less than a week to look into them, the bureau focused on only a few allegations, which reportedly included an interview with another of Kavanaugh s accusers, Deborah Ramirez. Not included in the investigation were Kavanaugh, Ford, classmates who had told the press that he was a  sloppy drunk  in school or allegations that he lied under oath about his excessive drinking.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) vowed that a full Senate vote will happen this week.

Speaking to reporters Thursday afternoon, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said he expected the full Senate to confirm Kavanaugh on Saturday. Yet all eyes are still on Flake and the handful of senators who have indicated that what the FBI turns up in its report will influence their decision on Kavanaugh.

According to a Politico report citing Manchin s aides, President Donald Trump has personally discussed Kavanaugh with Manchin. The senator appears to be leaning in Kavanaugh s favor, the outlet said.Although Heitkamp initially dodged reporters, she told an ABC affiliate in her home state that she would vote against Kavanaugh. The process has been bad,  she told the outlet. Centrist Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) has not indicated which way she is leaning, either, simply telling HuffPost that she was about to read the FBI report. Murkowski did not attend a briefing on the report earlier in the day, preferring instead to hear it in person.A single copy of the FBI report was made available to senators in a small, secure room.A key concern for both Collins and Murkowski is whether, if confirmed, Kavanaugh would overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. Both continued to indicate on Thursday that they did not believe the judge would overturn the ruling. Murkowski just went into FBI report viewing room. Didn t say if she s any closer to making decision on Kavanaugh.  I m gonna read the FBI report,  she said, disappearing into the room.Christine Blasey Ford testified last Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the 1982 party where she says Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and attempted to remove her clothing while grinding against her. Deborah Ramirez subsequently came forward to accuse Kavanaugh of thrusting his exposed penis against her at a Yale party in the 1980s.Kavanaugh passed the committee on Friday pending a  gentlemen s and women s agreement  on the investigation. The White House announced very early Thursday that it had received the FBI s report and sent it on to the Senate, saying the administration is  fully confident  in Kavanaugh s confirmation.While Ramirez was interviewed by the FBI, Ford was not. Attorneys for Ford blasted the report shortly after its release and stated that the FBI s effort  cannot be called an investigation. Democrats similarly criticized the investigation for failing to interview more witnesses   FBI officials reached out to 10 people and interviewed nine.This story has been updated throughout with additional comments from senators.Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

During a conversation with  Today  show co-host Savannah Guthrie published Thursday morning, DeGeneres talked about her experience as a survivor of sexual abuse and how it s shaped her thoughts on Ford s allegation.  As a victim of sexual abuse, I am furious at people who don t believe it,  the comedian told Guthrie of Ford s testimony during a pre-taped interview on  The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Ford, a Palo Alto University psychology professor, publicly accused Kavanaugh in September of sexually assaulting her when the two were at a high school party in 1982. Last Thursday, she appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee and gave an emotional testimony, which caught the attention of the entire country. What you remember is what happened to you, where you were, and how you feel. That s what you remember. @TheEllenShow talks to @SavannahGuthrie about Dr. Ford s testimony and her own experience. Tune in tomorrow for full interview. pic.twitter.com/6F6CGQb8LGAs a survivor herself, DeGeneres said it s not surprising that Ford couldn t remember every single detail of her alleged assault.   You don t remember those things. What you remember is what happened to you and where you were and how you feel. That s what you remember,  she said.  I think anybody who has gone through it, right now, is watching this so angry because you know, how dare you not believe us? DeGeneres spoke about her own assault Wednesday during a conversation with actress Busy Philipps on  The Ellen DeGeneres Show.   I was 15 and I had something happen to me. When I watched Dr. Ford   anyone who has had something happen to them, you just get so angry when someone doesn t believe you or says,  Why did you wait so long?   DeGeneres told Philipps. Are you hopeful in this moment?  -@savannahguthrie I m hopeful, but then I see things that just continue to happen. I see Trump and he s now mocking Dr. Ford...You don t mock somebody.  -@theellenshow pic.twitter.com/43RGoBPvMP It s because we re girls and we re taught not to say anything and go along with it,  she continued.  So you at 14, me at 15, God knows how many people in this audience have had something happen.   Two other women also have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Kavanaugh has denied all accusations against him. Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to confirm Kavanaugh, but the final Senate vote was delayed until an FBI investigation into Ford s allegation could be conducted. The FBI investigation concluded Thursday morning. Senators are currently reviewing the FBI s findings, which are being withheld from the public. A final vote on Kavanaugh s nomination could come as early as Saturday. Watch the full interview below.

The video explains that the Republican party is providing cover for men with histories of sexual assault, from Trump to Roy Moore and now Kavanaugh,  UltraViolet Action said in a statement.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called for a Friday vote even before the FBI findings were sent to the Senate. The White House, which directed the FBI investigation, said it was  fully confident  Kavanaugh will be confirmed.American Bridge 21st Century, a super PAC that supports Democratic candidates, said it planned to show a loop of the recording outside the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Thursday night.

Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) is still on the fence about whether or not to vote to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid multiple accusations of sexual assault and misconduct. Manchin, a key swing vote, told Politico on Thursday morning that although Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s and Deborah Ramirez s sexual assault allegations are  terrible,  he does empathize with Kavanaugh. Basically, it was somebody who is the father of two young girls fighting back, saying,  That s not the dad I am, that s not the person I am,   Manchin said of Kavanaugh s controversial testimony last week.  That s what I saw. Manchin also pointed out that the accusations against the judge stem from when he was in high school and college.  I can understand also a person [Kavanaugh] who from 22 to 53, how he s conducted his life, how he took care of his family, how he basically approached his job in a responsible manner,  he said.  I m not hearing anything from the 30 years as an adult, in his professional life. Kavanaugh has been accused by three women of sexual assault and misconduct. Ford, a Palo Alto University professor, was the first to publicly accuse Kavanaugh in September of sexual assault when the two were in high school. She said Kavanaugh and a friend, Mark Judge, cornered her in a bedroom and the Supreme Court nominee pinned her to the bed, groped her and tried to forcibly remove her clothing. When she attempted to scream for help, Ford says Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth to silence her. Kavanaugh s second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, says he exposed his penis and thrust it in her face during a party in college. Last week, a third woman, Julie Swetnick, accused Kavanaugh of being present when she was  gang raped  in high school.In an interview with Al Jazeera, Manchin reiterated that when deciding his vote he will be looking more closely at Kavanaugh s adult years.  I am looking at the gentleman as an adult from 22 to 53, 31 years of professional service. I am looking at him as a father. As a person in a community, how he interacts with his community. I am trying to put the human side to it,  he said on Thursday.He added that the entire confirmation hearing process has been  horrible.  It s another circus,  Manchin told Al Jazeera.  In addition to Manchin, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) have said they are still undecided on the Kavanaugh vote. If every Senate Democrat votes no, at least two Republicans would also need to vote no in order to stop the nomination.The FBI investigation Flake and other moderate senators called for last week concluded early Thursday morning. After reviewing the FBI investigation, the White House said it s  fully confident  Kavanaugh will be confirmed. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a Thursday statement that the probe found  no hint of misconduct  from the judge. Senators will review the FBI s findings, which are being withheld from the public, on Thursday. A final vote on Kavanaugh s nomination could be as early as Saturday.

An FBI supplemental background investigation that did not include an interview of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford   nor the witnesses who corroborate her testimony   cannot be called an investigation,  the lawyers said in a statement Wednesday night.  We are profoundly disappointed that after the tremendous sacrifice she made in coming forward, those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth. The White House on Wednesday wouldn t say if it had ordered limits on the FBI probe. Bloomberg reported that the White House, which directed the investigation, didn t authorize interviews with either Ford or Kavanaugh.Ford, a Palo Alto University psychology professor, publicly accused Kavanaugh in September of sexually assaulting her when the two were at a high school party. Two other women also have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Kavanaugh has denied the accusations. Last week, Ford gave emotional testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee recounting her story. Kavanaugh also testified, rejecting Ford s claim and at times yelling, crying and interrupting senators. The committee voted to send Kavanaugh s confirmation to the full Senate despite the allegations, but Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), joined by other moderate senators, called for an FBI investigation before the vote. Earlier this week, Ford s lawyers wrote to the FBI urging agents to interview their client.  It is inconceivable that the FBI could conduct a thorough investigation of Dr. Ford s allegations without interviewing her, Judge Kavanaugh, or the witnesses we have identified in our letters to you,  attorneys Michael Bromwich and Debra Katz, wrote to FBI Director Chris Wray. They added that they have  repeatedly asked you to identify the Supervisory Special Agent responsible for this investigation, so that we could contact him or her directly. We have received no response.  Kavanaugh s second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, who says he exposed his penis and thrust it in her face during a party in college, was interviewed by the FBI for two hours on Sunday. Her attorney wrote on Twitter that agents did not reach out to 20-plus witnesses who may be able to corroborate Ramirez s story. The White House received the results of the FBI investigation early Thursday and immediately forwarded the information to the Senate.  With this additional information, the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,  White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah wrote on Twitter.The FBI interviews failed to corroborate the allegations of sexual assault, according to The Wall Street Journal. Dozens of people  with potential information  into the allegations reportedly offered to speak to the FBI, to no avail. On Wednesday, before the findings of the FBI investigation were even sent to the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called for a Friday vote. Senators will review the FBI s findings, which are being withheld from the public, on Thursday.

There, she could cry without judgment, listen carefully to Ford and Kavanaugh,  and watch as senators cast doubt on the whole thing. There, she could also face the inevitable: She could recall memories of her own sexual assault without being completely alone. Whenever she started crying, I would tear up,  Doby said of Ford during an interview. Especially when she was trying to recall details. In my brain, I automatically went to a space of,  What do you remember about your night?  I just kept replaying it over and over again. Doby isn t the only one being revisited by painful memories amid the Kavanaugh controversy as the nominee s accusers speak out about his alleged misconduct. In the days that followed the hearing, the National Sexual Assault Hotline saw a 338 percent increase in calls. Social media feeds flooded with people sharing stories of being abused or harassed, many paired with the reasons they didn t report it.Dear survivors: please eat and drink what you can, when you can. I know you might not want to, or find it hard to, but this is a gentle reminder to do your best. Your body deserves and needs it. Witnessing and remembering can take a huge physical toll. #KavanaughHearingsPeople are being re-traumatized as the battle for Kavanaugh s nomination plays out, according to counseling psychology professor Britney Brinkman.The brain stores traumatic memories much differently than it would regular ones, Brinkman said. So, when Ford describes details such as Kavanaugh s  uproarious laughter,  survivors find themselves face-to-face with their own traumatic event. Often people either feel like they re reliving the experience or they might feel like they are reliving the fear that they felt. It can be really overwhelming,  Brinkman told HuffPost.This is especially true for those who suffer from an assault-related post-traumatic stress disorder. For people whose experience is similar   maybe it happened in high school or at a party   even one detail could feel really triggering from them, making them cry or feel like they can t get out of bed,  Brinkman said.Katie Fisher, 23, from Terre Haute, Indiana, said she had a  rush  of memories during Ford s testimony, causing her to burst into tears. She later tweeted why she felt so ashamed to tell anyone about her assault at the time, and how Ford gave her the courage to speak up now. I felt connected to this woman ... and I felt the shame and the guilt all over again,  Fisher said after watching Ford s testimony. I remembered not being able to be in the same room with [with my attacker]. And I remembered being so scared. But I look at this powerful woman putting her life and reputation on the line and I felt courage. #WhyIDidntReport because I assumed that it was no big deal because it wasn t sexual assault. Watching Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s opening statement made me sob because she stayed quiet all these years  because he didn t actually rape  her. When she said this. I cried.I cried because I felt this. I have never considered what happened to me an attack because it was at a party. He was a friend. We were drunk. I was in a committed relationship. But the anxiety and the fear that came after was real.I was so ashamed to tell anyone because I thought it was so stupid. He didn t rape me or even touch me sexually. But he grabbed me without my consent. And he didn t let go when I said stop. And if I didn t leave, I don t what would have happened.I believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford because I understand not wanting to say anything because he didn t rape you. Her feelings and attack are just as valid as mine. The anxiety and fear that comes after is real. I will never feel the same around this individual.The outpouring of sexual assault stories, though triggering, may also have an upside.More survivors will know they aren t the only ones who are struggling and will be inspired to seek help. Brinkman said the Pittsburgh Action Against Rape center, where she is a board member, has received more calls and inquiries from people looking for  various levels of support. Something similar happened in late 2017, when numerous sexual assault allegations led to the downfall of film mogul Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men across nearly every industry. At the end of that year, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network reported a record number of people reaching out for help.It s a sign that  people are coming out in solidarity  in support of survivors, Brinkman said.There s a downside, too. The way Republicans are openly dismissing Ford s allegation   going as far as making a joke of her   is especially painful for survivors still struggling to understand their assaults.During a campaign rally in Mississippi on Tuesday, President Donald Trump mocked Ford for not remembering certain details of the assault, drawing rebukes from Republicans and Democrats alike.When Doby heard Trump s rant, she turned off the TV. The belief that in order for sexual assault to be found credible, a victim must be able to recall every detail of their experience, is not only ignorant, it s extremely dangerous,  Doby said.  His mockery, accompanied by his followers  laughter, just dismissed my story as a victim and gave permission to abusers as if their actions hold no consequence. Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the accusations against him by Ford and two other women, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick. Ford said during last week s hearing that she is  100-percent  certain it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her when they were high school students.It s not just Trump s behavior, either. Trump s supporters laughed and cheered as he mocked a survivor of sexual assault. On Twitter, people were especially drawn to the women holding Trump signs in the background of his televised performance. Trump s attitude toward women and survivors of sexual assault doesn t appear to shake the loyalty of his female supporters   just like when they remained steadfast as Trump s  grab them by the pussy  recording surfaced.Republicans in general were unmoved by Ford s testimony. A poll by Quinnipiac University conducted after last week s hearing showed that Republican men and women overwhelmingly support Kavanaugh as a nominee, according to The Associated Press.I won t tweet the video, but for those who are seeing it, focus on the crowd. They wait for the laugh lines, look at the woman raising the  Women for Trump  sign, the child in the frame. This is what should worry all Americans who care about how low & fast we are sinking. https://t.co/2xoZYQXNQkListen to this crowd roar and cheer on Trump mocking Christine Blasey Ford pic.twitter.com/n4m1ejlmVYBrinkman said she worries the GOP s reaction to Kavanaugh s accusers may scare other survivors from dealing with their assaults. One of my concerns is 15-year-olds right now seeing this and seeing her being questioned aggressively and told that people don t believe her,  Brinkman said.   They re more likely to think,  Well, no one is going to believe me either so why would I step forward. Why would I report? If I do report, how am I going to be treated?  One popular reason Republicans push back on survivors is false reporting. As the #BelieveHer hashtag in support of survivors picked up steam, so did #ProtectOurBoys, which conservatives use to denounce assault claims they say are fake.Brinkman and other advocates against sexual violence argue that the rates of false reports are small, comparable with false reporting in other crimes. Brinkman also pointed out that the majority of sexual assaults are not reported to the police.Only 2 percent to 8 percent of sexual violence is falsely reported, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. And, of every 1,000 sexual assaults, only 310 are reported to the police, according to RAINN. You have power when so many women are powerless...How can you be speechless?  Sen. Jeff Flake was confronted in an elevator over the Kavanaugh nomination this morning; he later pressed for a delay in a Senate floor vote to allow for an FBI probe.https://t.co/jQ2U85480D pic.twitter.com/c0fY0obnDaBrinkman said she sees a stark contrast in how female survivors are treated compared with male survivors, like the men who came forward to speak out against the sexual abuse by 301 Catholic priests in Pennsylvania. The tone and the narrative about those survivors have been very different,  she said.  Culturally, I think our tone has been much more of one of believing those boys   they re grown men now   affirming them that it wasn t their fault. Meanwhile, Brinkman noted, Kavanaugh s accusers are being dragged through the mud by Republicans. We need to believe women who are telling us they were assaulted by famous men and we need to believe boys who are telling us they were assaulted by their priests,  she said.Though her voice quivered as she recounted the alleged assault that  drastically altered [her] life,  Dr. Christine Blasey Ford stayed strong as she publicly told her story out loud for the first time. pic.twitter.com/5vAUsi8sEpAs Doby watched Ford s Senate testimony, she had flashbacks of the night she was raped at a hotel party when she was 16. Like Ford, Doby can only remember certain details. She can t tell you the name of the hotel, or how she got home. But she can describe the heavy breaths of her attacker, how he carried her away from a hot tub, and how she cried under the stream of a shower. The stories of sexual assault told by Ford and Doby aren t unreliable just because they can t remember certain things, experts said. In fact, those gaps are consistent with the way the brain processes trauma. Jim Hopper, a Harvard Medical School researcher who studies sexual assault s effects on the brain, told Time magazine that chemicals in the brain cause it to focus on the most important details of a traumatic event, while  peripheral details are lost. While painful to watch, Ford s testimony encouraged Doby to publicly share the entire story of her attack for the first time. She did it because she wants other survivors to know that it s OK if they can t remember every single detail. This is exactly what I remember. I don t have proof. I don t have all the details. But that doesn t make my truth any less valid   and [Ford s] either,  Doby said.As the controversy surrounding Kavanaugh continues to play out, Brinkman said it s important for everyone to realize that survivors are having an especially difficult time, and to give them the space they need to heal. For Doby, that meant sharing her own story. Every time I speak up for myself about what happened to me, I grow a little stronger and a little braver,  Doby added.  I think we all do when sharing our truth.

Minnesota, typically known for its picturesque lakes and friendly people, has been thrust into the national spotlight in the past year for being at the center of the Me Too movement.It has lost two state lawmakers and a popular U.S. senator amid sexual misconduct allegations. Most recently, a state lawmaker whose 23-year-old daughter accused him of touching her inappropriately announced he would not seek re-election.But of all the scandals, the biggest one looming over the midterm elections is a domestic abuse allegation against Keith Ellison, 55, the six-term Democratic congressman who is running for attorney general. Not only is it giving a jolt to the Republican side, but it s worrying some Democrats who would ordinarily vote for Ellison.His loss would take the state attorney general s office out of the Democratic Party s control for the first time since 1971 and deprive the state of a liberal advocate devoted to combating the Trump administration s hard-line immigration and health care policies.What s more, if the scandal thwarts Ellison s bid for statewide office, it will likely have halted the rise of one of the activist left s most prominent stars.His defeat would be a  major blow,  said Kathryn Pearson, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota.  I don t know if he recovers. In August, Ellison s ex-girlfriend Karen Monahan accused him of emotionally abusive behavior, referring to it as  narcissist abuse,  a term that has become popular online but has not been recognized by the field of professional psychiatry.Monahan s most potent allegation is that Ellison attempted to drag her off of their bed while shouting profanity at her in August 2016. Monahan s son Austin first revealed the charge in a Facebook post three days before the Aug. 14 primary and tagged several of Ellison s primary opponents. Ellison nonetheless handily won the attorney general nomination of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, or DFL, as the state Democratic Party is known.Both Monahan and her son referenced a video of the event that Monahan captured on her phone. But Monahan, who has shared numerous text messages and some of her medical records with the public, declined to release the video to either media outlets or privately to Susan Ellingstad, the attorney whom the DFL hired to investigate the allegation.Ellingstad cited Monahan s unwillingness to share the video, as well as her shifting justifications for not wanting to share it, in a 15-page report released Monday that concluded the allegation of a physical altercation was  unsubstantiated. A group of aging Republican activists in the upscale suburb of Plymouth listened with rapt attention last Thursday evening as Doug Wardlow, 40, the GOP candidate running for Minnesota attorney general, delivered his standard pitch about prosecuting welfare fraud, the alleged problem of  illegal  voting and enforcing immigration laws.But nothing fired up the crowd as much as when he went after Ellison, saying there should be a criminal investigation of the congressman s behavior. We have an opportunity to once and for all retire Keith Ellison from politics in Minnesota,  he declared, eliciting loud applause as he pivoted to the attack about two-thirds of the way through his speech. Let me just talk to you a little bit about my opponent,  he continued. His girlfriends are doing that for you!  a woman in the crowd deadpanned.After Wardlow spoke, the evening s host, Linda Stageberg, who chairs the local chapter of the National Federation of Republican Women, warned the crowd that if Ellison prevailed she and her husband were planning on  moving to Wisconsin. Although Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump s nominee to the Supreme Court, is being accused of attempted rape, Stageberg saw no contradiction in rooting for Kavanaugh s confirmation   even as she inveighed against Ellison. A lot of us have been praying that Judge Kavanaugh be appointed. And I d like to add Doug to our prayer list,  she told the attendees. An undercurrent of the Ellison attacks remains Islamophobic suggestions about his Muslim faith. Wardlow delved into detail about how a Somali-American-run day care center had defrauded the state s welfare agency and implied that the money might have gone to help finance the Somali terrorist group Al-Shabab.In an interview, Wardlow denied that he was trying to insinuate anything about Ellison s Islamic faith.  I do think he s going to be distracted by his political agenda,  he said.Stageberg told HuffPost about fears around the lack of integration of some of the metropolitan area s Somali immigrants. She believes Ellison would not fight for that integration. He was born Catholic,  said Stageberg, obliquely referencing his conversion to Islam as a young adult.  He doesn t seem to want to fight for America and the state of Minnesota. Wardlow has also nimbly stoked old fears of Ellison as a black radical. His campaign s first digital video,  The Choice,  claims Ellison has  supported cop killers  and features a closeup photo of Ellison looking angry as well as seemingly unrelated footage of teenage protesters burning an American flag.Ellison would be one of Minnesota s first black statewide elected officials. (There have been at least three black jurists elected to the state s Supreme Court.)A progressive Minnesota woman who knew both Ellison and Monahan, but declined to be named because Ellison doesn t want people criticizing Monahan on his behalf, believes Monahan is falsely accusing Ellison. She worries that Monahan knew that the charges against Ellison would stick more because he s black.  This is an all-white state,  the Minnesota progressive woman said.  He s a black man. They re not going to believe him. But it s not just the rock-ribbed Republicans assembled in Plymouth   voters Ellison could never hope to win over   who appear to be swayed by the allegations against him. Some reliably Democratic voters, who spoke to HuffPost prior to the release of Ellingstad s report, were unwilling to cast a ballot for him. I don t have a comfort level, and if it gets to be Nov. 6, and I still don t have comfort with him, I won t cast a vote for him,  said a woman in a Twin Cities suburb who asked to withhold her name for fear of jeopardizing her future in Democratic activism.Tara Engebretson, a real estate agent in Wayzata, was an Ellison fan prior to the allegation but now needs more information to be willing to vote for him. Especially with the way the Kavanaugh thing is landing, we can t keep letting it slide under the carpet,  said Engebretson, who plans to vote for the other Democratic candidates on the ticket.  A third woman active in Minnesota Democratic politics, who also withheld her name due to professional concerns, plans to vote for Ellison   but then she wants him to resign so there can be a special election to fill his seat. Minnesota needs the Democrat to win. I wish the Democrat wasn t Keith Ellison,  she said.The domestic violence allegations threaten to have a sizable impact on the race. In a mid-September poll, Ellison led Wardlow by just 5 percentage points   almost within the margin of error; nearly 1 in 5 voters said they were undecided. Noah Johnson, the Grassroots-Legalize Cannabis candidate, had 5 percent support   enough to win him a spot at the Sept. 21 televised debate.By contrast, U.S. Rep. Tim Walz (D) led Republican Jeff Johnson in the governor s race by 9 percentage points with a smaller pool of undecideds.The allegation against Ellison  has made this race very competitive, like a toss-up,  Pearson said.  Absent the scandal, it would not be competitive. Shortly after the allegations against Ellison emerged, the DFL commissioned an investigation from Ellingstad, an attorney at the Minneapolis firm of Lockridge Grindal Nauen. For his part, Ellison has flatly denied the allegations from the very beginning. He has also refused to try to discredit Monahan, saying in mid-August,  I still care deeply for her well-being. But as the DFL s inquiry carried on for over a month, it became clear that the issue is not disappearing.The allegation is at the heart of Wardlow s campaign video,  The Choice,  which has received 8,000 more views on Twitter than Ellison s upbeat video a couple of days later.  Extreme Keith Ellison has been accused of domestic violence by multiple women. Even the National Organization for Women has called for Ellison to end his campaign,  the ad s narrator says as an image of Ellison in handcuffs during a civil disobedience arrest at a progressive rally appears on screen. NOW and UltraViolet, an online women s group, both called on Ellison to withdraw from the race before the primary. No other women s organizations or progressive groups has called on him to withdraw, however; none of Ellison s congressional colleagues has either.Wardlow s video references an earlier allegation against Ellison that transpired while he was running for Congress for the first time in 2005 and 2006. Amy Alexander, a woman angry about not getting a job at a group Ellison was tied to claimed to have had an extramarital affair with him and said that he subsequently grabbed her and threatened her. Ellison denied it, accused her of attempted extortion and secured a two-year restraining order against her. She tried to get a restraining order against him, but a judge declined to grant it.Conservatives managed to keep the story of Monahan s more recent allegations alive in the local press. In mid-September, the right-wing site Alpha News sued to unseal Ellison s divorce documents with his ex-wife Kim; last Tuesday, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune followed suit.Sensing that the story was getting out of control, Ellison called on the House Ethics Committee to launch its own investigation of the allegation on Wednesday.When Ellingstad finally released her findings on Monday, Ellison expressed his readiness to once again move forward.  At this time, I will be focusing on the issues in this election,  he said in a statement.But conservatives had already worked hard to plant seeds of doubt about the report s independence. The DFL did not do Ellison any favors in this regard, since it tapped a firm whose senior partners had represented the party in partisan matters.Wardlow called the inquiry a  sham  as a result. Alpha News is continuing to report the proverbial controversy with a report Tuesday on the contributions of the firm s employees to the DFL; Fox News has a similar story.Even some Democrats consider the investigation inadequate. Walz, the DFL nominee for governor, told HuffPost that the critics noting this conflict of interest present a  fair critique  of the investigation. Mark Stone, a Democrat and engineer from Becker, said he would have preferred a third-party inquiry and still needs more information before he can feel comfortable casting a ballot for Ellison. I expect that Democrats hold themselves to the same standards that they hold the Republicans [to] and that it s not just rationalization to suit their needs,  he said.  Monahan has her own potential conflict of interest. She has hired Andrew Parker, a right-wing pundit and partner at the Minneapolis firm Parker Rosen, as her attorney and spokesman in matters related to the allegation against Ellison.Parker previously employed Ellison s opponent Doug Wardlow at his firm and defended Wardlow s ability to separate his personal views from his legal practice in a Saturday article in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.Parker admitted to HuffPost that he supports Wardlow s candidacy in a personal capacity but denied that Monahan had any contact with Wardlow s campaign either directly or working through him. I never spoke to Doug Wardlow about my representation until he learned of it in the press,  Parker said.In an interview with The Intercept in which he made similar denials, Parker declined to say whether he was charging Monahan for his services. Parker also provided two different reasons why he had not yet seen Monahan s video in a radio interview Tuesday night. First he said he had not yet met her in person; then he said she did not bring it to their first meeting and has since been out of town.HuffPost spoke with some two dozen Democrats and swing voters in the greater Twin Cities metropolitan area and the Northland region.Even before the report s release, the vast majority of voters either did not know who Ellison was and simply planned to vote for the entire DFL ticket, or considered the details of the alleged incident sufficiently murky that they would nonetheless vote for him unless more incriminating information emerged.  I don t love the allegations against him, but I do like that he called for an investigation,  said Anne Kohler, a Shorewood resident, referring to Ellison s call for a House Ethics Committee inquiry.Wardlow, famous for his work with the anti-LGBT group the Alliance for the Defense of Liberty, is a powerful motivator for many of these voters. I speak to the people that are going to be hurt the most with a Republican in that role,  said Tammy Clore, a small-business owner in Duluth who was door-knocking for Democratic congressional candidate Joe Radinovich.  My women friends of color are really upset that anyone would consider not voting for [Ellison]. Part of the reason that voters are willing to hear Ellison out is because of what happened with Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who quickly resigned under heavy pressure from his Democratic colleagues after he was accused of groping multiple women. Many Minnesota Democrats believe he was forced out and should have stayed around until there was an investigation.  That includes Clore, who calls herself a  Franken progressive  and keeps a copy of Franken s Al Franken, Giant of the Senate on a shelf in her home next to Hillary Clinton s post-election tome, What Happened.Clore wishes there had been an independent investigation of Franken before Democrats pressured him to resign.  He got eviscerated by our own party,  she said.National Republicans have tried a bit to make Ellison a weight around the necks of other Democratic candidates. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super-PAC tied to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), blasted Joe Radinovich, the Democratic contender in Minnesota s 8th Congressional District, for  standing by  Ellison in an August ad, rather than calling for him to withdraw from the race. CLF soon stopped airing the ad, opting instead to focus on the Democrat s past speeding violations and a marijuana citation.Maddie Anderson, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, has called on Democratic House candidates in the state to denounce Ellison and clarify whether they plan to vote for him. But the NRCC s independent expenditure arm, which is flooding the airwaves with ads against Minnesota Democrats, has not made Ellison a theme. It wouldn t be a surprise to me if they did in the future,  Anderson said. Over the course of four days and half a dozen campaign events across the state, however, there was no evidence that Ellison s baggage is hurting other Democratic candidates.   I m out [on the trail] every day. And I can count on my fingers how many times voters have brought it up,  said Dean Phillips, the Democratic nominee in Minnesota s 3rd, a suburban district Democrats hope to flip.  The only people that do are reporters and trolls on the internet. That hasn t stopped Democrats from worrying about it.Their worries have been manifest in what seems like a very Minnesotan form of crisis management: Avoid definitive statements or confrontation at all costs, and hope the problem goes away. Virtually no one would dismiss the allegations against Ellison outright, even as many did so privately. At the same time, virtually no one would renounce his candidacy or explicitly blast him either.Instead, they tended to just defer to the investigation. And yet, since the investigation came out, none of the state s prominent Democrats has publicly hailed the investigation as an exoneration of Ellison. DFL Chairman Ken Martin simply said the party would refer its report to law enforcement, which could decide whether to approve charges. The DFL asked the Minneapolis police to investigate Ellison on Wednesday, but the police declined, citing a conflict of interest. Ellison s son Jeremiah is a member of the Minneapolis city council.The prolonged drama of the allegation and subsequent investigation appears to be affecting Ellison s political strategy. The Minnesota congressman said in a Wednesday radio interview that he was considering stepping down as deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee.  I need to put 100 percent of my time, energy and resources into the race and my office, so it is something I am considering,  Ellison told Minneapolis  WCCO radio. He had previously maintained that he would stay on in the post if elected attorney general.During HuffPost s visit, the DFL made clear it wanted to limit the scope of any story about the allegations. The DFL, which did not respond to HuffPost s inquiries about the timing of the investigation in the days leading up to its release, sought assurances through a campaign staffer that HuffPost would not ask voters in the 8th Congressional District for their opinions on Ellison.When HuffPost asked several women at a canvass kickoff for state House Democrats their thoughts on Ellison, Patty Acomb, a Democratic candidate for state House, took a giant step backward in a dramatic effort to avoid being asked about it.  Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton, who spoke at the canvass kickoff, also visibly blanched when asked about Ellison. I m running state government. I m not involved  in Ellison s race, he said.Minnesota House Democratic Leader Melissa Hortman, whose relationship with Ellison dates to his days as head of Minneapolis  nonprofit Legal Rights Center for low-income residents, offered the most full-throated endorsement of his candidacy of any Minnesota Democrat.  Keith Ellison is a longtime friend and a fantastic Democrat, and he will be an outstanding attorney general,  she said. But she too deferred to the DFL investigation when it came to questions about the allegations against him.The party has not hidden Ellison entirely from view. He was the featured speaker at a DFL canvass kickoff event in northern Minneapolis on Saturday; later that day, he spoke behind closed doors at the party s annual Jim Oberstar Memorial Dinner in Hinckley.For the most part, though, Democratic candidates who eagerly welcome Walz or Sen. Amy Klobuchar to campaign with them are keen to ignore Ellison. Unlike the other statewide candidates, Ellison was not in the DFL campaign literature for Radinovich that Clore distributed at the doors. Ellison was also conspicuously missing from the front of the DFL s Duluth field office where placards for Klobuchar, Smith and Walz hung prominently above a homemade sign that said,  We believe survivors #MeToo. DFL field office in Duluth. pic.twitter.com/6hSwWKaYNjClore, who was wearing a Radinovich T-shirt, sported pins for all the statewide candidates except Ellison. And the DFL nominee for attorney general was notably absent from Democrats  lawns in Duluth s Congdon neighborhood, which overflowed with placards for other Democratic candidates.  One home featured a 2016 Bernie Sanders presidential campaign sign along with signs for Klobuchar, Walz, Smith, Radinovich and state House candidate Jen Schultz. Ellison, the only House member to endorse Sanders  presidential run, was nowhere to be found.The biggest snub for Ellison came on Monday when former President Barack Obama announced endorsements of 17 Minnesota candidates from governor to Congress to state House. Ellison was not among them. Notable absence from @BarackObama s new round of endorsements: Keith Ellison for attorney general in Minnesota. pic.twitter.com/ffg0AQL6ZwPhillips, a businessman challenging Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen, said he has not yet decided whether he will vote for Ellison, though he noted that he  wholeheartedly  disagrees with Wardlow s values. If the allegations are true in the case of Mr. Ellison, they are disqualifying,  Phillips said.Although attorney general candidates often run as a joint ticket with candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, Walz said he had no plans as of yet to campaign with Ellison. We ll wait and see what comes out of this,  Walz said as he stood alongside running mate Peggy Flanagan. He clarified that the DFL inquiry would not be enough for him; he wants to see the results of the potential House Ethics Committee investigation. At the same time, Walz praised Ellison as an  adept legislator  and emphasized that the Kavanaugh case was different. Unlike the Supreme Court nominee, he concluded,  the people of Minnesota will get to have a say and they will get to vote. Some of Ellison s allies privately worry that his relatively cautious approach to beating back Monahan s claims is a mistake. Even as he denies the allegations, Ellison refuses to so much as call her a  liar. Ellison is standing by his approach. I am working as hard as I can to win this election,  Ellison told HuffPost with a sigh.  But if it doesn t work out the right way, I at least want to be able to feel good about who I am. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Ellison would be the second statewide black elected official in Minnesota history. In fact, he would be at least the fourth.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Like many others, I hoped that the FBI inquiry would shed additional light on the serious but uncorroborated accusations against Kavanaugh. The FBI never returned my call.I went to college at Yale with Kavanaugh, lived in the same residential halls, and graduated with him in 1987. We did not move in the same circles: I went to a public high school located in a factory town in upstate New York, while he came from the nation s capital and attended one of its premier prep schools. I have only vague memories of him and his activities.However, his alleged misconduct against another of our Yale  87 classmates, Debbie Ramirez, occurred during the academic year 1983-84 at a party in a  common room  on the first floor of Lawrance Hall, where Kavanaugh and I both lived during our freshman year. The hall was divided into four sections, referred to by the letters of their corresponding entryways. Based on what has been alleged and reported, the incident may have happened near entryway  B.  I lived on the first floor of entryway  A,  and Kavanaugh in entryway  D. Though I did not attend the party, I was able to dig up an old yearbook and draw up a list of people I thought the FBI probably should interview. That list consists of residents of entryway  B  and others who might recall the event. Some of those names have surfaced in news reports, but others have not.I was never able to provide that list to an FBI agent. My first thought was that the FBI probably already had the information I was offering and was on top of things.I have since learned from other former Lawrance Hall friends and neighbors that many of them similarly offered potentially useful tips to the FBI. The FBI has not bothered getting back in touch with them, either. Ramirez  lawyer reported that he provided an extensive list of possible witnesses. He claimed that none has been contacted so far. Kavanaugh s own former roommate similarly asserted that his offer to provide information has been rebuffed. All the evidence at hand suggests that the FBI has not reached out to people it should contact for a thorough investigation.As a professor of political science for 25 years, I have been happy to recommend some of my best undergraduates to the FBI for employment. A number of them presently work for the FBI. I am sure they are doing valuable work.But a serious investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh would require speaking with a broad array of possible witnesses to the Kavanaugh-Ramirez incident. Not an open-ended fishing trip, but conversations with those who attended the party where the event may have transpired, or who lived in dorm rooms in immediate proximity to Lawrance Hall entryway  B.  News about such an incident would have spread fast in our insular little world, and if it occurred there must be others who can speak to it.The FBI has not conducted that investigation. With the White House and Senate Republicans steering things and aggressively pushing for closure, it is hard to imagine how it could have done so. Most likely, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will soon be declaring that Kavanaugh has been thoroughly vetted, and that the investigation has confirmed there is no substance to the allegations against him.In reality, it seems this  investigation  is just another partisan game being played to win over a few wavering Senate votes. The GOP leadership may well succeed in doing so. But who loses? Not just Christine Blasey Ford and Debbie Ramirez, who deserve better for stepping forward and risking so much, but also the American people, who need the FBI to be able to do its job free of hyper-partisan political pressure.William Scheuerman is a professor of political science at Indiana University. He is also a member of the Yale class of 1987."

The report won t be available to the public.Grassley, upon being briefed on the report Thursday, released a statement implying that no misconduct against Kavanaugh could be determined. There s nothing in it that we didn t already know,  he said.  Neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations. This investigation found no hint of misconduct and the same is true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during Judge Kavanaugh s 25 years of public service. The information  is the last addition to the most comprehensive review of a Supreme Court nominee in history, which includes extensive hearings, multiple committee interviews, over 1,200 questions for the record and over a half million pages of documents,  White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said on Twitter.  With this additional information, the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The White House reportedly said the FBI wasn t able to corroborate the allegations against Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. According to The New York Times, the bureau ended up reaching out to 10 people and interviewing nine of them.Dozens of others said they reached out but received no response from the FBI. William Scheuerman, who lived in the same residential college as Kavanaugh at Yale University, called the bureau to recommend people they should speak to. He never got a response, he wrote in a HuffPost guest column.The harsh and unfair treatment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh is having an incredible upward impact on voters. The PEOPLE get it far better than the politicians. Most importantly, this great life cannot be ruined by mean & despicable Democrats and totally uncorroborated allegations!On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called for a Friday vote   before the findings were even released   to end debate on the Kavanaugh issue, with a final vote on his nomination as early as Saturday. Ahead of Thursday s review, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) expressed apprehension that the report was not thorough enough. I m concerned that if they never interviewed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford or her corroborating witnesses, if they never interviewed many of Kavanaugh s classmates from Yale who came forward to be heard about the alleged incident with Debbie Ramirez, that this isn t the investigation I was hoping for,  Coons told CNN.Grassley claimed Wednesday that there was never once a  whiff  of sexual misconduct unearthed in the investigation or any previous FBI probe carried out on Kavanaugh since 1993. Democrats attacked the statement as false, furthering the partisan back-and-forth that has swirled since three women, including Ford and Ramirez, came forward with allegations against the judge. Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the claims.It s likely that Republicans will largely vote in favor of Kavanaugh s nomination, although Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) have said they haven t yet made up their minds. If every Democrat votes no, at least two Republicans would also need to vote no in order to stop the nomination.This story has been updated with Grassley s statements, Coons  comments and details of Scheuerman s account.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, took to the Senate floor on Wednesday night to deliver an impassioned and at times emotional speech about the  very important  Me Too movement, the  widespread legacy of sexual assault  in America and the deep hurt and damage that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation process has wreaked on the country.  Sasse, one of the 11 Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee who voted last week to move Kavanaugh s nomination forward, stressed, however, that a vote for the federal appellate judge should not be a  proxy  for validating women s claims of sexual assault. Sasse didn t say he would not continue to support Kavanaugh s confirmation.This confirmation vote is  about one vacant seat on the Supreme Court  and not a  giant binary choice about the much broader issue of whether we do or don t care about women,  he said. Sen. Ben Sasse says he urged President Trump to nominate someone other than Brett Kavanaugh. https://t.co/joonlSPjKaIn his speech, Sasse condemned President Donald Trump s recent  mockery  of Christine Blasey Ford, the Palo Alto University research psychologist who has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teens. Sasse added that he d urged the president in  June and early July  to nominate an unspecified woman for the Supreme Court seat. Although I ve said many complimentary things about Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his distinguished record of 12 years of service on the D.C. circuit court, I will say that I urged the president back in June and early July to make a different choice   before he announced this nomination,  Sasse said. I urged him to nominate a different individual. I urged the president to nominate a woman,  he continued.Senator Sasse on the floor: We all know that the President cannot lead us through this time. We know that he s dispositionally unable to restrain his impulse to divide us. His mockery of Dr. Ford in Mississippi was wrong but it doesn t really surprise anyone. It s who he is. His voice breaking, Sasse later told the story of two  dear friends  who had been victims of rape and cited statistics about the credibility of the vast majority of allegations of sexual violence.  I ve wept with the victims of sexual assault, and I believe the advocacy groups  data that between one-fifth and one-third of American women have been sexually assaulted at some point in their lives,  Sasse said, adding that, though the Me Too movement was  complicated,  it s been a  good thing.  Still, the lawmaker said Kavanaugh s vote should not be viewed through the lens of Me Too. This is not about choosing between believing our daughters and protecting our sons. That choice is false,  Sasse said. The vote should not be a  proxy for the validation and validity of claims of sexual violence,  he concluded. Some Twitter users reacted to Sasse s speech with skepticism, saying the senator was trying to  have it both ways.   If you are serious ... the world is watching,  author Maureen Johnson tweeted.Minutes after Sasse s speech, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) pushed forward with a key procedural vote on Kavanaugh   despite the fact that the FBI investigation into Ford s allegation against the judge has not been concluded.If you are serious, @BenSasse, the world is watching. If you vote yes on Kavanaugh your name will go down in history as someone who let it happen. All of America will speak against you. You could be a hero here. You could have a conscience. No matter what, no one is looking away,.@BenSasse You can t have it both ways, Senator. We see what you re doing. Making a floor speech claiming you respect women and survivors before validating an entirely corrupted confirmation process absent of transparency will not reflect kindly on you moving forward. Cowardly.hey @BenSasse you know there s something you could do, right? you know you have a choice, right? you can be remembered as someone with morals or you can be a tiny footnote in history along with the rest of the republicans voting through a sexual predator to the supreme court..@BenSasse just put on a master class in trying to have it both ways.I have more faith in the integrity of Kanye West over the integrity of Ben SasseOh I see he s trying to make himself feel better about voting for Kavanaugh by claiming that confirming him doesn t invalidate the claims of Dr. Ford and other assault victims. Actually that s exactly what it does so thanks for that @BenSasseUnless @BenSasse intends to vote no on Kavanaugh, all his words are empty and should be treated as such, even if the press fawns all over itDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The side is no longer Republican or Democrat. Your vote is a statement, and that statement is either  Hell no, this is not OK.

Not only did I know he wasn t telling the truth, I knew that he knew he wasn t telling the truth,  Roche said.  I can tell you that he would come home and he was incoherent, stumbling, he would sometimes be singing   he would throw up and then in the morning have a lot of trouble getting out of bed. Roche isn t the only one countering parts of Kavanaugh s testimony.Former Yale classmates Liz Swisher, Chad Ludington and Lynne Brookes have also made public statements about Kavanaugh s excessive drinking during their youth.Three women   Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick   have publicly accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault or misconduct in the 1980s. The accusations have become a stumbling block for the federal judge as he faces Senate confirmation.Ford has said that she feared Kavanaugh  might inadvertently kill  her as he held her down and groped her while they were high school students in the 1980s. Ramirez alleged Kavanaugh exposed himself at a gathering when they were both in college and thrust his penis in her face.Swetnick referred to the judge as a  mean drunk  who  groped  girls at high school parties. She accused him of being present during a  gang rape  in the early 1980s.Roche told Cooper that he had never personally seen the judge behave aggressively toward women, but he said he knew from experience with Ramirez that  there is zero chance she is making up this story,  adding that he also believes Ford  is telling the truth.

On Wednesday night, McConnell filed cloture, calling for a vote to end debate on Kavanaugh on Friday, with a final vote possible as soon as Saturday, if Republicans clear the procedural hurdle.The nominee s fate is still up in the air. Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) all say they re undecided on Kavanaugh, though an inconclusive FBI report could be the impetus for any of these senators to back him.Senate GOP leadership doesn t intend to make the FBI report on Kavanaugh public, and Republicans who want to release it don t seem willing to force McConnell s hand. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who s supported a public report for days now, suggested that he had no say in the matter and that the decision was  above my pay grade. When HuffPost asked if he d consider withholding his support for Kavanaugh until a version of the report was made public, Kennedy responded,  No, that s silly. Republicans generally have made up their minds on Kavanaugh, barring some massive development in an FBI report focusing on the allegations of a sexual assault 36 years ago. The FBI is unlikely to turn up many conclusive findings, and Republicans don t seem all that receptive to arguments that the nominee has committed perjury or displayed a lack of judicial temperament in his fiery and partisan testimony.Murkowski told reporters on Wednesday that she was taking  everything into account  on Kavanaugh, including President Donald Trump s Tuesday night comments attacking accuser Christine Blasey Ford. Murkowski called those comments  wholly inappropriate. But Republicans have thus far shown incredible tolerance for both Kavanaugh s outright lies and the president s mockery.There wasn t a shortage of Republicans willing to criticize Trump   lightly, in the Senate Republican way   for his taunts about Ford s inability to remember some details from the night of the alleged assault. Even Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he  didn t particularly like  Trump s attacks. Igor Bobic contributed reporting.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The eight lawmakers indicated that statement was false and called on Grassley to issue an immediate correction. While we are limited in what we can say about this background investigation in a public setting, we are compelled to state for the record that there is information in the second post that is not accurate,  the Democrats wrote.  It is troubling that the Committee Majority has characterized the information from Judge Kavanaugh s confidential background investigation on Twitter, as that information is confidential and not subject to public release. Sens. Chris Coons (Del.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) did not join their colleagues to sign the document, although it s unclear why.Grassley s office rejected the assertion, calling the letter  baseless innuendo  on Twitter later on Wednesday and saying it reflected  more false smears from Senate Democrats.  Nothing in the tweet is inaccurate or misleading,  officials wrote on the Senate Judiciary account.  This committee stands by its statement, which is completely truthful. Nothing in the tweet is inaccurate or misleading. The committee stands by its statement, which is completely truthful. More baseless innuendo and more false smears from Senate Democrats. https://t.co/x7VUEKnFRVThe back-and-forth comes the same week the FBI is conducting a new investigation into several allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh from the early 1980s, when he was in high school and college. Three women have accused the judge of sexual impropriety, including Christine Blasey Ford, who gave testimony about her allegation of sexual assault before the judiciary committee last week. Several of Kavanaugh s old acquaintances have gone public in recent weeks about their interactions with the judge, and many have spoken about his involvement in a clique known for heavy drinking. Kavanaugh has denied all the allegations and moved to paint himself as a student focused on academics and athletics who occasionally drank alcohol but never  to the point of blacking out. The FBI is expected to complete that probe this week, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said it will not be made public and that the document will be viewable only by the chamber s lawmakers. McConnell has expressed his strong desire to hold a vote on Kavanaugh s nomination in the coming days once the report is complete.President Donald Trump has grown increasingly antagonistic this week as the FBI inquiry moves forward. He broke his relative silence on the allegations of sexual misconduct during a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday, mocking Ford and the broader Me Too movement. Several Republican lawmakers, seen as crucial undecided votes on the Kavanaugh nomination, on Wednesday lambasted the president s behavior at the rally. There s no time and no place for remarks like that,  Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said during an appearance on the  Today  show.  To discuss something this sensitive at a political rally is just not right. It s just not right. I wish he hadn t done it... it s kind of appalling.

We believe he has disqualified himself from this lifetime appointment and must step aside immediately,  the Washington-based council said in a statement.According to its website, the organization represents over 40 million people and 38 Christian denominations.During his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, the council wrote,  Judge Kavanaugh exhibited extreme partisan bias and disrespect towards certain members of the committee and thereby demonstrated that he possesses neither the temperament nor the character essential for a member of the highest court in our nation. Unusually high traffic has shut our website down.  Here is our statement calling for the withdrawal of Judge #Kavanaugh. pic.twitter.com/r1vsGmqMFKThe council also accused Kavanaugh of lying under oath. In addition, his testimony before the Judiciary Committee included several misstatements and some outright falsehoods,  it said. The council didn t list any specific lies, but several comments Kavanaugh made at the hearing don t add up.The nominee claimed that he  never attended a gathering like the one Dr. Ford describes in her allegation.  However, the calendars he presented in his defense clearly showed that Kavanaugh had scheduled gatherings strikingly similar to the one that accuser Christine Blasey Ford described.He also claimed he never drank beer  to the point of blacking out.  Others who knew him in high school and college have described Kavanaugh back then as a heavy and frequent drinker.In its statement Wednesday, the National Council of Churches also pointed to Kavanaugh s professional history as a matter of concern. Judge Kavanaugh s extensive judicial and political record is troubling with regard to issues of voting rights, racial and gender justice, health care, the rights of people with disabilities, and environmental protections,  the council said.  This leads us to believe that he cannot be an impartial justice in cases that are sure to come before him at the [Supreme] Court. Last week, America Magazine also called for Kavanaugh s withdrawal, rescinding its previous endorsement of the nominee. The national magazine is published by Jesuits, a Catholic religious order for men also known as the Society of Jesus."

Men are having a hard time right now? I mean, c mon,  Milano said, noting that sexual abuse has been  institutionalized  in America.  Women, young people, have had it difficult for generations and generations and generations. In his defense of Supreme Court Supreme nominee Brett Kavanaugh earlier this week, Trump said,  It s a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something you may not be guilty of.  Milano also spoke out against White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who denied that Trump had mocked one of Kavanaugh s accusers, Christine Blasey Ford, during a rally in Southaven, Mississippi.At the rally, Trump attempted to cast doubt on Ford s statement that she d had just one beer at a high school party where she says Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her. The president inaccurately suggested Ford couldn t remember which part of the house she was in or what year it was. I m filled with rage,  Milano said.  For Sarah to just go on and say, you know, he was just stating the facts.

That s 25 countries.At least 70 countries worldwide criminalize homosexuality. This means some of these couples would face serious ramifications back home if they tried to solve the visa problem by getting married in the U.S. Yet under the Trump administration s new rule, this is essentially their choice: wed here or the partner goes home. Couples have until the end of the year to comply.But the directive is more than just another anti-LGBTQ move against foreigners. It s yet another attack on what many in President Donald Trump s base consider the  political correctness  previously foisted upon the world by President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This was made clear in the way the Trump administration framed the change: as an effort to foster equality   for heterosexuals.According to Foreign Policy magazine,  The U.S. Mission to the U.N. portrayed the decision as an effort to bring its international visa practices in line with current U.S. policy.  Quoting from the U.S. Mission s July 12 note to U.N.-based delegations, the article continued: Same-sex spouses of U.S. diplomats now enjoy the same rights and benefits as opposite-sex spouses. Consistent with [State] Department policy [regarding opposite-sex couples], partners accompanying members of permanent missions or seeking to join the same must generally be married in order to be eligible [for a diplomatic visa]. In other words, gay couples were previously getting some sort of special treatment   visas for partners whether they were married or not   while heterosexual couples had to be married in order to get a visa. This is, of course, ludicrous since opposite-sex couples aren t discriminated against anywhere in the world. Critics of the new directive   including Samantha Power, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations   called it  needlessly cruel. Needlessly cruel & bigoted: State Dept. will no longer let same-sex domestic partners of UN employees get visas unless they are married. But only 12% of UN member states allow same-sex marriage. https://t.co/MjZpRVLYcfBut there is a point to this cruelty, and it revealed itself when the anti-LGBTQ Family Research Council responded to the directive almost immediately on its website:The rainbow didn t just color the White House   it colored Barack Obama s entire legacy. For eight years, Americans watched the 44th president s obsession with LGBT activism eclipse every other urgent issue. And the U.S. State Department was exhibit A. No sooner had Hillary Clinton taken over as secretary [then] the White House ordered her to use the agency as a club to beat other nations into submission on sexual politics. ... Fortunately, the Trump administration has real respect for other nations  beliefs   and Secretary Mike Pompeo s agency is proving it. Yesterday, the administration announced a new policy at the State Department that would block diplomatic visas for the same-sex partners of any foreign officials and U.N. employees.This new directive reverses one put in place by Clinton in 2009 that, among other steps, granted visas to partners of foreign diplomats in same-sex relationships. It was part of a broader effort by the Obama State Department to position the United States as a leader on LGBTQ rights. As Clinton stated in a groundbreaking 2011 speech before a U.N. leaders meeting in Geneva, Switzerland,  Gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.  The hypocrisy of the Family Research Council is bald-faced. It claims the Obama administration was trying to impose its  beliefs  and  values  on other countries while the council and other conservative religious groups seek to impose their Christian evangelical values not only on other countries but on all Americans by supporting  religious freedom  laws designed to allow for discrimination. The Obama administration was encouraging human rights and equal treatment worldwide. The evangelical groups are actually trying to legally ensconce the right of a baker or florist to turn away gay people and the right of any employer to fire someone simply for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.The Family Research Council s references to  Obama s obsession  with LGBTQ rights and Clinton s actions within the State Department point to the wider appeal of the new directive among Trump s base, beyond the anti-LGBTQ evangelicals whom the president and the GOP are trying to excite as midterm elections approach.Trump speaks to people who believe, as the Family Research Council noted, that too many groups   African-Americans, immigrants, Muslims, women, queer people   are given  special rights.  And that argument resonates particularly well with white supremacists, a group that Trump has emboldened, most infamously after the deadly Charlottesville, Virginia, rally last year.In recent days, while trying to ram Brett Kavanaugh through confirmation hearings and onto the Supreme Court, Trump even lamented the plight of  young men  in America, who he suggested are the true victims of today s Me Too movement. (And let s be clear: What he really means is straight white young men.) The president then went on to mock Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford and urge his audience in Mississippi to  think about your son. This new directive from the State Department speaks to that same voter base. And it sends another clear message (as if we needed one) that the Trump administration has no interest in protecting minorities and is looking out only for the straight white majority in this country.

Last week, she posted an image on her Teach and Transform Instagram and Facebook pages of a chart she d shared with her students. It sums up many important facets of consent, including what  consent  actually means, what it sounds like and when we need it.A post shared by Liz Kleinrock (@teachandtransform) on Sep 26, 2018 at 3:02pm PDTIn the post, Kleinrock explained that her lesson was inspired by the media coverage of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been publicly accused of sexual misconduct by three women. One of them, psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. I think whenever I tend to look at things spiraling in society, particularly political events that are going on, I like to think about what kind of foundational skills should have been in place earlier to prevent these things from happening,  Kleinrock told HuffPost.The educator also had her students do a writing activity about consent and participate in a role-playing scenario in which they asked her if they could give her a hug. The idea was to give them real-world examples of what consent does   and doesn t   look like. I m saying the word  yes,  but my tone and my body language are so clearly uncomfortable so I ask,  Can you read my body? Can you read my face? How do you think I m actually feeling?   she said.  Or I m laughing and saying,  No, not right now.  I look happy and positive, but the words coming out of my mouth are still no. It s the tone and delivery. Kleinrock pointed out that she didn t even consider mentioning sex while preparing to teach her third-graders about consent. People seem to have a really hard time with this because of the connection between consent and sex, but it never crossed my mind to talk about sex with my class,  she said.  My students are 8 and 9 years old. It s really about respecting space and physical boundaries and interacting with each other. She also noted that she plans on expanding her consent lesson to clarify the idea of  secrets  on her chart and to remind her students to come forward if they learn information about another person being sexually abused or otherwise harmed.In addition to teaching, Kleinrock, who has a background in social-emotional learning and social justice education, serves as her school s diversity coordinator. She was one of the winners of the 2018 Award for Excellence in Teaching from the Teaching Tolerance project.Besides the issue of consent, Kleinrock has also had discussions with her students about race, discrimination, stereotypes, privilege, the Holocaust and slavery.She said,  I m going to say this for the rest of my life: When there are persistent issues in a society, you can t hope to fix them unless you actually talk about what they are.

Grassley requested to see the notes Ford s therapist took in a session in which she detailed the alleged attack, a recording of a lie detector test she took and copies of her exchanges with news media.Ford, now a psychology professor, maintains that Kavanaugh pinned her down and attempted to remove her clothing while grinding against her at a party in 1982. The chairman s request comes five days after she shared her story in a widely televised committee hearing.Grassley accused Ford s attorneys of withholding the information, according to The Wall Street Journal, which viewed the two-page letter.In response, her attorneys Lisa Banks and Debra Katz told the chairman that Ford  is prepared to provide  all the requested information in an interview with the FBI, which for one week has reopened its background investigation into Kavanaugh in light of her accusations against him. As the clock ticks, the attorneys say Ford has not yet been contacted by the FBI.Portions of the therapist s notes were included in a Sept. 16 Washington Post report on the alleged attack. Ford chose to show the paper the notes to bolster her claim. Although they do not mention Kavanaugh by name, the notes say she was attacked by teens  from an elitist boys  school  who went on to become  highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.  She has said that Mark Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh s, was also in the room at the time.She discussed the alleged assault in a 2012 therapy session with her husband after her anxiety   which she believes stems from the alleged attack   interfered with a home renovation.Notes from an individual therapy session in 2013 describe a  rape attempt  in Ford s teens. Critics, including Grassley, have used slight discrepancies between the therapist s notes and Ford s testimony to suggest that the episode did not happen as she says it did. In one instance, the therapist wrote that the alleged rape attempt happened in Ford s  late  teens. She told the committee she was 15 years old at the time.The American Psychiatric Association acknowledges that due process may require psychiatric records be used in some court cases. Kavanaugh s confirmation process, however, is not a formal judicial hearing.  This is a very unique setting that we re dealing with here,  Brown University clinical psychiatry professor Patricia Recupero told HuffPost.Recupero said a full disclosure of Ford s mental health records would be  inappropriate.  Her mental state at the time she was seeing the therapist for help was not in question and is not a relevant component of the inquiry,  Recupero said. In her view, the notes Ford provided simply serve to corroborate Ford s claim that she told her therapist about the alleged attack years before Kavanaugh s nomination.  Allowing people to delve into the therapist s records without due cause will inhibit people from getting help,  Recupero added.Providing confidential medical records to a partisan group of senators could be a privacy risk for Ford, who has received numerous death threats since she publicly accused Kavanaugh.Paul Appelbaum, a Columbia University psychiatry, medicine and law professor, told HuffPost that Ford could reduce her risk by allowing an independent third party to review the records and redact any information not relevant to the issue at hand. In a typical court proceeding, he said, a judge would likely do so.  While that could help protect her,  I think she d need to assume that anything actually provided to the senators would no longer be confidential,  Appelbaum added in an email.

That gave senators an opportunity to question both Kavanaugh and Ford directly, she said. If they had additional questions for either one of them, they had a time and an opportunity, certainly, to ask those,  she said.REPORTER: Bloomberg reports that the White House is limiting the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh. Is that true?SANDERS: If senators had questions, they should ve asked them during the hearing. pic.twitter.com/WlatCpHVX3The FBI background investigation into Kavanaugh isn t a criminal probe, so it s not necessarily improper for the White House to direct the bureau s actions. The White House is, essentially, the bureau s client.Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, told reporters on Wednesday that the background check process is unlike anything else the FBI does. Everything else the FBI does ... the client is the American people. In background investigations ... the client is the White House,  Figliuzzi said.  There s a flaw there because it s essentially like hiring a private detective agency to follow your cheating spouse. You work for your client, you do what they want, and they shape the outcome. But limiting the probe would expose the White House to criticism that it isn t really interested in getting to the truth of the matter, but is simply seeking to   in the words of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.)   give Republicans  more cover. This story has been updated with a quote from Frank Figliuzzi.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Ford, Democratic senators and even some Republicans had been pressing for an investigation. But it was only after Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he wouldn t vote for Kavanaugh without one that the Republican leadership and the White House agreed to call for one. The FBI investigation is an essential step in this process. Neutral investigators will interview key characters in the controversy and, in theory, people will tell the truth because there are criminal penalties if they don t. Though the bureau isn t going to reach any conclusions as part of the background check process, both sides are hoping it will provide some closure and give clarity to senators like Flake   who are on the fence about Kavanaugh s confirmation   some answers as to who is telling the truth.But don t expect too much from the investigation.In 1991, the FBI investigated Anita Hill s sexual harassment claims against Clarence Thomas, who was then up for confirmation to the Supreme Court. The bureau heard from 22 witnesses over three days. But that process was not entirely smooth, and the investigation actually became a tool used to try to discredit Hill. One big difference between Kavanaugh and Hill is that the FBI investigation for Hill happened before she testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. While Ford and her legal team have long been asking for an FBI investigation of her allegations, Hill was initially uneasy about such a probe. Hill and her friend, Susan Hoerchner   who could corroborate the allegations   thought the Senate and its investigators, rather than the FBI, should be the ones looking into the matter.  They didn t use the word  interview,  it was  investigation,   Hoerchner later said, according to the book Strange Justice by Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson. Hill eventually agreed to an FBI investigation, as long as the report that went to the committee could be accompanied by a statement that she wrote. She wanted to make sure her words were not misconstrued by anyone.Two agents, John B. Luton and Jolene Smith Jameson, arrived at her house on Sept. 23, a couple of weeks before she ended up testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. In her memoir, Speaking Truth to Power, Hill remembers that no one else was present with her for the interview with Luton and Jameson   a decision she would later regret. From her recollection of the event: After I answered specific questions about Thomas  behavior, Agent Luton asked if there were other details that I would feel comfortable relating to them. I declined to add anything further. He suggested that I might feel more comfortable giving details to Agent Jameson alone. I again declined to add to the information that I had provided. I thought what I had said was more than enough to convey the nature of what had happened. I still did not trust their role in the process. Moreover, their inquiry was not a demanding or probing one. It was professional but relaxed. ... Before they left, Agent Luton asked me a question he felt compelled to justify. He asked if there was anything in the way I dressed or carried myself that might have led Thomas to believe it was appropriate to talk to me about pronography [sic] or to make otherwise suggestive remarks. Agent Luton said that by asking the question he was in no way suggesting an answer. In fact, he said that while he was certain that I had not dressed or acted inappropriately, he felt obliged to ask. It was difficult to know whether the agent was catering to the myths about sexual harassment or simply anticipating the defense against my claims.The interview lasted about 45 minutes, and although Hill had expected some follow-up questions, there weren t any. Hill s answers in the FBI investigation were later used against her. Hill s testimony was more extensive than her FBI interview, and she revealed more details about Thomas  behavior   such as her allegation that he once asked who put a pubic hair on his Coke can.As Mayer and Abramson noted, her testimony put the FBI under  mounting pressure.  They could either admit that they had done an inadequate job or suggest that Hill had fabricated the new details expressly for the hearings,  they wrote. It chose the latter option.On Oct. 11, both agents issued sworn affidavits essentially suggesting that Hill had embellished her testimony. Luton s affidavit said Hill had failed to mention specific details in her interview with them. Jameson s affidavit was similar, implying that Hill had withheld information despite their best efforts to get it out of her.And as Adam Serwer at The Atlantic noted, Hill had previously told a Democratic Hill staffer about the pubic hair incident, meaning she had been consistent all along and the FBI agents simply weren t thorough enough. There was also a discrepancy between what Hill remembered saying and what the FBI agents remembered hearing. Hill said she told Luton and Jameson that Thomas warned her not to ever speak of his behavior toward her because it would ruin his career. The FBI agents, however, remembered her saying that he told her it would ruin her career.  I remember precisely what I said to the agents because I could not forget Thomas  own words,  Hill wrote in her memoir.  Nor could I forget that the tone of his words had been neither apologetic nor remorseful. The only regret he expressed was that his behavior might appear improper to others. GOP senators later told the press that these remarks showed a  discrepancy  between what she told the Senate Judiciary Committee and what she told the FBI   another reason to doubt her, in other words. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), one of the few remaining Judiciary Committee members who was on the panel in 1991, suggested on Wednesday that he would also be looking to use against Ford the fact that she wants to talk to the FBI. Dr. Ford shared her story with the world in 3 hours of public testimony just last week.Are her lawyers suggesting she has more to share? That would contradict her testimony that she had told the committee everything. https://t.co/7jI5Tkdg6Shttps://t.co/JUdY5CLb8FThe FBI report is not expected to be made public, unless someone leaks it. But Democrats have complained about what seems to be the limited scope of the investigation. The White House originally limited the interviews that the bureau could conduct, and several people who say they have information they d like to give to the FBI   including Ford   said they ve yet to be interviewed by anyone from the bureau.Indeed, what many Democrats fear is that the FBI investigation, rather than doing a thorough job getting to the bottom of Kavanaugh s behavior, will simply provide cover for senators who want to vote for Kavanaugh but are nervous about doing so. After all, in 1991, the Senate approved Thomas to the Supreme Court, despite an FBI investigation and public testimony from Hill. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But that doesn t mean it s better to disappear. Your support is imperative: Research shows that leaning on loved ones can have a multitude of benefits for trauma survivors, such as helping them to adjust back into normal life following their incident.  Being there for your loved one will not take the pain away, but it can help by giving them emotional support, which has been shown to be helpful in trauma recovery,  said Jacquelyn Strait, a licensed psychologist at Winding Way Therapy in Friendswood, Texas.Experts note that it s especially important to be available for a friend or loved one during periods where their trauma may resurface. Triggers can include the anniversary of an incident, such as the October 2017 Las Vegas shooting, seeing someone that resembles their attacker, or a sexual assault case that s all over the news. The political madness of sexual trauma, assaults, Me Too movements   all of it is messy and it makes me uneasy and angry,  said Sarah Renee Langley, a licensed professional counselor and sexual assault survivor, who noted that she herself has benefited from the support of friends and family recently when she s been feeling triggered.Below are just a few ways you can help someone who has experienced trauma:In June 2017, Matt Mika was coaching the congressional GOP baseball team when a gunman opened fire, causing him nearly fatal injuries. Though he s over a year out from the incident, the 40-year-old director of government relations for Tyson Foods said that it s important for people to know feelings associated with the event can quickly resurface and survivors may therefore need support even years after an event.  My parents  neighbors were having a new roof put in, and that really unsettled me. Anything that sounds like that rifle shot or that gunshot can really unsettle me,  Mika said.Brandy Diaz, a sexual assault survivor, added that news stories can also prompt memories of past traumas, like the coverage of Christine Blasey Ford s Senate testimony, in which she discussed her allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in the 1980s.You don t have to make a grand gesture in order to make a difference. Sarah Sauer, a survivor of the Las Vegas shooting, noted that things like a heartfelt note, a meal or offering to do a fun activity helped her feel loved and supported.  Sometimes the best healing can come from a neighbor who happens to be walking to the mailbox but genuinely asks how you re doing and gives you their time to listen,  Sauer, 35, said.Even if you don t know the person extremely well, showing that you are thinking of them goes a long way. Sauer said some of the kindest forms of support she received came from people she hardly knew, like parents of her kids  classmates at school or members of her church.  As superficial as this may sound, the outpouring of love, support and encouragement on Facebook was really comforting,  said Jennifer Birn, 42, who also survived the Vegas shooting.  Most people don t have the privilege of seeing how their friends and colleagues would react if something terrible happened to them, but surviving a trauma, you do, and people say things often not thought or said until it s too late,  Birn added.It may be human nature to want to wrap your arms around a loved one who has just been through a trauma, but that may not be the best thing for them in the moment.  Especially right after the incident, you have to careful about physical touch,  said Mika, who explained that following the attack, he appreciated visits by friends and family but shied away physical contact until he acclimated back into his routine.  It took me a while, even with my girlfriend who has been a saint throughout all this. I didn t immediately want to sleep in the same bed. When speaking with someone about their assault, it s important to do so in a way that doesn t make the survivor feel like the incident was their fault or that they could have done something differently to prevent it. David Spiegel, associate chair of psychiatry at the Stanford University School of Medicine and director of the Stanford Center on Stress and Health, said to refrain from questions like,  Why did you let this happen to you?  or  Couldn t you have avoided it or fought him off? As a general rule of thumb, Spiegel said,  Anything that blames the victim just reinforces inappropriate guilt.  After someone experiences trauma and is dealing with stress, they need to relearn how to relax,  Langley said. This could mean helping a bookworm to rediscover their love of reading, taking a music fan to a concert or making them a playlist of their favorite artist s music.  Whatever it is that your loved one generally enjoys doing, you should encourage that   and even better if you join your loved one in doing the things they want to do so that they have good company,  she said. There is no replacement for connections with other people who have been through a similar struggle,  said Sal Raichbach, a licensed counselor at Ambrosia Treatment Center, which has locations across the country. Raichbach noted that there are many trauma-specific support groups that are free of charge and even meetings that are specific to certain types of trauma, like childhood abuse and sexual assault.  The more you can relate to the people in the group, the better chance they will have at recovering from their traumatic episode and building a support network,  Raichbach explained. As an extra step of support, Langley recommended asking if your friend would like you to accompany them. It s tough to find a balance, but you want to give a trauma victim their space without distancing yourself,  Raichbach said. The best thing you can do is let your friend know that you care and are available should they need it, he added. That way, they don t feel obligated to stick with plans if they aren t feeling up to spending time together. And whatever you do, don t force people to  get over it.   Don t tell people to  forget it.  They can t. Show them that you understand how deeply the trauma affected them and that you want to help and care about them with what they went through,  Spiegel said.The symptoms of trauma can be confusing to someone who has not experienced them firsthand. To gain understanding, try reading up on the subject. The more trauma-informed you can be in supporting others, the more they are able to relax and remember they are safe and supported,  said Lisa Olivera, a therapist in Oakland, California.Mark G. Agresti, a psychiatrist in Palm Beach, Florida, said that a person experiencing trauma has to take the lead in telling you what they want you to know.  You can listen, but don t ask too many probing questions, as that could be threatening and very unsettling for that person,  Agresti said.  Traumatized individuals are only able to reveal what happened to them when they are ready and no sooner.  Attempts to  force it out of someone  can often re-traumatize the person and it is therefore not helpful, he added.Strait said that as part of a support system, you may find yourself the target of an angry outburst or find your loved one withdrawing from you.  Be compassionate and understand that they have strong emotions to work through. Do not take it personally,  she said.It can be therapeutic for a trauma survivor to face the scene of the incident, especially alongside a friend who is there to support them through the process.  Take them back to the place where the trauma occurred to create a new memory there and face down fear. My friend Mimi did this for me,  Birn said.  She had me come back to Vegas over my birthday and coordinated a weekend, off the strip, that was so fun, relaxing and different than one I d associate with Vegas or the festival, and it felt good to go back and not be scared.  Trauma, when it has affected any aspect of someone s life, is something to be concerned about,  said Doug Miller, a licensed clinical psychologist and forensic trauma expert. As a result, the survivor is at a greater risk for suicide, depression and addictions, particularly as the severity of their trauma symptoms increase. Miller said that  periods of acute increases in any symptoms are times of increased concern.  He suggested keeping an eye on your friend and getting familiar with the signs of suicidal thoughts.Need help?

I have NEVER had Christine Blasey Ford, or anybody else, prepare me, or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken at any time,  McLean said in the statement relayed by attorneys Michael Bromwich and Debra Katz. In her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, Ford had said she never coached anyone on polygraphs. Ford appeared before the committee to accuse Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her while the two were in high school. According to her emotional testimony, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, covered her mouth with his hand and attempted to forcibly remove her clothing. In his own testimony, Kavanaugh denied Ford s accusation, at times yelling, crying and interrupting senators.On Tuesday, the anonymous ex-boyfriend sent a letter to lawmakers contending that she had helped McLean prepare for a polygraph test. He also said that Ford never mentioned the alleged assault while the two were dating between 1992 and 1998.The FBI s investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh, which could finish before the end of the week, has been criticized by Ford s attorneys as not thorough enough. On Wednesday, after an NBC report said the bureau had no intention of interviewing Ford, her lawyers demanded they be allowed to speak with investigators.  It is inconceivable that the FBI could conduct a thorough investigation of Dr. Ford s allegations without interviewing her, Judge Kavanaugh, or the witnesses we have identified in our letters to you,  they wrote.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

While in conversation with The Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg, Graham said he didn t  particularly like  President Donald Trump s mockery of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s Senate testimony at his rally in Southaven, Mississippi, Tuesday night. Last week, Ford recounted to the Senate Judiciary Committee her allegation that Kavanaugh had forced himself on her and groped her during high school.

Hundreds of protesters and activists   in many cases women who are survivors of sexual assault   have hounded senators in hallways on Capitol Hill, restaurants and airports over the past few weeks, urging them to oppose Kavanaugh s nomination. The appellate court judge has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women. He denies the accusations, which the FBI is investigating this week. On Monday, female activists at Reagan National Airport in Washington approached several GOP senators   including McConnell   as they returned to the nation s capital after the weekend and asked questions about sexual assault and Kavanaugh. The Kentucky Republican looked straight ahead and kept walking while three women trailed him, attempting to engage him on the issue.  We would like to know if you believe survivors of sexual violence,  Naina Khanna, the executive director of Positive Women s Network USA, said to McConnell in a video posted to Twitter.Addressing the matter on the Senate floor on Wednesday, McConnell also brought up that protesters had heckled Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and forced him to leave a Washington restaurant last month. At least three GOP senators were also targeted by an anonymous person who posted their personal information, including cellphone numbers and home addresses, on the internet. I m not suggesting we re the victims here. But I want to make it clear to these people who are chasing my members around the hall here, or harassing them at the airports, or going to their homes. We will not be intimidated by these people,  McConnell said on the Senate floor.The GOP leader pledged that the protesters are not  going to scare us out of doing our duty. I don t care how many members they chase, how many people they harass here in the halls. I want to make one thing perfectly clear: We will not be intimidated by these people.  He further accused the demonstrators of engaging in an  organized effort to delay, obstruct and intimidate those of us who will be voting this week. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), another senator who was approached by activists at Reagan National Airport on Monday, grew emotional while discussing the incident with reporters on Tuesday. Unlike some of his other colleagues, he engaged with and answered questions posed by the progressive activists.  Look, I know a lot about sexual assault,  Corker said Tuesday without elaborating.  And so the thought that we don t care about that is ridiculous. The Tennessee Republican, who is supportive of Kavanaugh s nomination, added that  the way they re going about it is actually hurting the effort  to raise awareness about sexual assault.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The Palo Alto University professor testified in front of the Senate Judicary Committee on Thursday and recounted her allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in 1982 when the two were in high school. In 1991, Hill also testified in front of the Judiciary Committee that then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her when the two worked together. Hill discussed just how emotional last Thursday was for her and many people who tuned in.  I m the only person who has had to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but I really think that a lot of people have a good sense of what it feels like,  she said.  Because any number of us have been in those situations where we either didn t come forward because we didn t think we d be believed or we didn t think it mattered. We have suffered some indignities that we didn t care to share, but more importantly we thought that nothing would happen even if we shared it. Watch the full Fortune conversation below. Although Hill said she didn t like the way her hearing went, she was additionally disappointed by many senators  reactions to Ford.  I don t think I like the way that she seemed to be very close to this huge panel of senators, some of whom she knew were hostile to whatever she had to say,  she said.  They had already made up their minds about it. During an interview with NPR last week prior to Ford s testimony, Hill said the hearing  cannot be fair and thorough.  Now, the attorney said her fears of an unfair hearing were confirmed.  Does it matter, does it seem to matter, from a point of view of the senators whether or not the character and fitness of the person who is being considered for this appointment? Is that what s in their mind when they are questioning someone who comes forward?  she said.  And I have to say that at least for some of the senators, that didn t seem to matter. It didn t matter then and it doesn t seem to matter now. When asked if she believes if Kavanuagh should be confirmed, Hill responded strongly. I wouldn t confirm him. I wouldn t, because I saw a demeanor that I think was inappropriate for a judge,  she said.  I saw a ... statement that was making allegations without any facts to support them. That s the last thing you want from a judge. ... Anyone who lies in a Senate Judiciary Committee should not be on the Supreme Court. Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh s confirmation. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) sought a one-week delay in the full Senate s vote so that the FBI could investigate Ford s allegations. A final vote is expected to happen sometime this week.

The tactic of the president laying low has been lauded by all sides,  Kilmeade said Wednesday morning of the approach Trump had mostly taken toward Ford s allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually abused her decades ago.But, Kilmeade added,  Last night, he chose to blow it as the FBI is handing in the report as early as today  of its probe into Ford s allegations and similar accusations two other women have lodged against Kavanaugh. I wonder about the wisdom, as much as the crowd loved it, I wonder about the wisdom tactically of him doing that,  said Kilmeade, who normally is one of Trump s loyalists on Fox News.  even brian kilmeade doesn t think trump should have mocked dr. ford last night (though don t give him too much credit; kilmeade s concern is  tactical ) pic.twitter.com/oxs6RmmLBxTrump went on his rant amid chants of  We want Kavanaugh!  Referring to the nominee, he said,  So many different charges. Guilty until proven innocent... That s very dangerous for our country. I have it myself all the time. Let it happen to me. Shouldn t happen to him. He then began belittling Ford s testimony last Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee concerning the assault she said occurred at a party when she and Kavanaugh were teenagers. I had one beer, right? Trump said, referring to what Ford has said about the incident.  I had one beer! How did you get home? I don t remember. How d you get there? I don t remember. Where s the place? I don t remember. Referring to the locale of the alleged assault, he said,  Upstairs, downstairs, I don t know. But I had one beer. That s the only thing I remember. As Kilmeade questioned the tactical aspect of Trump s remarks, several lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle criticized the substance of what he said.Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) called the president s comments  just plain wrong,  while Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said,  To mock her last night like the president did, he s dividing us into tribes and last night was the most basic tribe of all: men and women. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called the mockery  vile  and a  mark of disrespect and disregard.  Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) who pushed for the FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, said,  There s no time and no place for comments like that. And to discuss something this sensitive at a political rally, is just not right. I wish he hadn t have done it. It s kind of appalling. Collins and Flake are among the handful of swing votes in the Senate that will determine whether Kavanaugh gets confirmed to the high court."

It made me feel sort of sick,  Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) told CNN Wednesday morning, hours after Trump ridiculed Ford s accusation at a campaign rally amid laughter and shouts of  lock her up.   I don t understand why he felt he had to do that. Trump used Ford s  powerful testimony  as  a political rally punchline,  King added, and it won t serve him well with senators who are swing votes on Kavanaugh s nomination   particularly Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Susan Collins (Maine) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.).Flake, a vocal Trump critic who has nevertheless rubber-stamped Trump policies and appointees in the past, on Wednesday called the president s rally attack on Ford  kind of appalling.  Well, there is no time and no place for remarks like that, but to discuss something this sensitive at a political rally is just not right,  Flake said on NBC s  Today  show.  I wish he hadn t have done it. Collins told reporters on Capitol Hill that Trump s attacks  were just plain wrong. Sen. Susan Collins, a key GOP swing vote, on President Trump mocking Kavanuagh accuser Christine Blasey Ford:  The President s comments were just plain wrong  pic.twitter.com/dxMloIh25QAsked about Trump s comments, Murkowski said they were  wholly inappropriate and in my view unacceptable.  On whether they would affect her vote on Kavanaugh,  I am taking everything into account,  she said.Trump, in an angry rant at a Mississippi rally Tuesday night, stuck up for Kavanaugh against the sexual assault claims and openly mocked Ford s Senate testimony. So many different charges,  Trump said of Kavanaugh.  Guilty until proven innocent. ... That s very dangerous for our country. I have it myself all the time. Let it happen to me. Shouldn t happen to him. The White House stood by Trump s attacks. The president was stating facts,  press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday.Even Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of Kavanaugh s fiercest defenders on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said,  I didn t particularly like  Trump s attack on Ford. I would tell him, knock it off. You re not helping,  Graham said Wednesday at The Atlantic Festival in Washington.But Graham defended Trump s rant as  a factual rendition,  questioning Ford s accusation and arguing  Kavanaugh was treated like crap. Other Kavanaugh defenders similarly expressed some concern that Trump s comments were not helpful. I wish he would just stay out of it,  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told reporters.Several Republicans refused to comment. You d have to ask the president,  Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said, before disappearing into a Senate elevator.Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said:  I don t really comment a lot on other people s comments    despite commenting on Trump in the past, including expressing the fear that the president might lead the U.S. into  World War III. Scores of Republicans in the past have condemned Trump s misogyny   especially after the release of the 2005  Access Hollywood  outtake of him bragging about groping women   but backed him anyway.Trump s vicious remarks were another chapter in his long history of attacking sexual assault accusers and siding with their alleged abusers. During his presidential campaign, Trump   accused of sexual misconduct by at least 20 women   denigrated some by suggesting they were not attractive enough to be sexually assaulted. She is a liar,  Trump said of People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff, who revealed in 2016 that Trump attacked her while she was writing a profile of him in 2005.  Check out her Facebook page, you ll understand. He said of another accuser:  She would not be my first choice, that I can tell you.  Pointing to yet another, he said:  Look at her. I don t think so. Three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct when he was in high school or college. Ford testified movingly how, when they were in high school, the future nominee and a friend pushed her into a room, where a drunken Kavanaugh held her down, groped her and held his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream.Flake led calls from Senate moderates for an FBI probe into the allegations before the full Senate votes on Kavanaugh s confirmation. Flake said Sunday that Kavanaugh s nomination  will be over  if the probe shows he lied in his Senate testimony. Kavanaugh appears to have been evasive or dishonest about multiple topics, including his drinking.This article has been updated to include more comments from senators.Igor Bobic contributed reporting.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

I just crossed my fingers that justice would be served. I was mentally fatigued,  Dickinson wrote in an essay for Variety published Tuesday. Dickinson, who accused Cosby in 2014 of drugging and raping her in 1982, was in attendance for the comedian s sentence hearing last week at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania. The model and author was joined by other Cosby accusers, including some of the women who testified during the April sexual assault trial to offer evidence of Cosby s prior bad acts.Immediately after Cosby was sentenced, Dickinson threw her head back and laughed loudly in court.  See, I got the last laugh, pal,  she said while staring straight at the disgraced comedian. Dickinson reflected on the powerful moment in her essay for Variety.  I let out an explosive emotional laugh. While other victims wept, I laughed and said,  Who s laughing now?   she wrote.   ... The justice system had done its job. That s a relief, and I felt better, but it does not undo the damage. Dickinson discussed just how hard it is to report your sexual assault story, pointing to last week s Senate confirmation hearings where Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when the two were in high school.  Why do we not report immediately? Men have no idea of the toll an assault takes. I, we, get afraid, feel so emotional that it can be hard to think, even though the attack is etched in our brain,  Dickinson wrote (although it s worth pointing out that men, and people of all genders, can be victims of sexual violence).  Take a look at the Senate hearings. Years ago and surprisingly, even now, victims are intimidated,  she continued.  Intimidated because we know we will be shamed and called a liar or a slut, that we will get hate mail and threats, that telling a new boyfriend will probably end that relationship, that our children and family will look at us differently, and maybe they won t love us, and that we will be labeled. Dickinson wrote that people should  never get a pass  for assault or rape, adding that the statute of limitations on sexual assault cases sends a message that survivors  stories are  questionable.   A  pass  signals to our daughters and sons that this country really doesn t care about women,  she continued,  and that only men can ultimately be trusted to tell the truth.

I m talking about the hundreds of thousands of us who were raised in church and came of age at the turn of the millennium.In our world, we were taught that our bodies didn t belong to ourselves. God owned them, they said, but really, that meant that men owned them. Our fathers. Our pastors. Our husbands. Our politicians. Never ourselves.This is, of course, the foundation of the 1990s evangelical movement known as  purity culture.  A pendulum swing from the free love culture of the 1970s and the AIDS scare of the 1980s, the 1990s were all about abstinence. Evangelicals took it upon themselves to stop a generation from promiscuity. They forged a mascot, a slogan ( True Love Waits ), held  purity balls,  manufactured an endless supply of merchandise   and voila! Purity culture, a subculture within an already-bizarre evangelical subculture, was born.Purity culture taught young girls to bear responsibility for men s lust. When we got dressed in the morning, we were supposed to ask ourselves what our grandfathers would think of our outfits. We wore T-shirts that said,  Modest is Hottest. Our formative years were spent in shame over our bodies, in suspicion of our sexuality, and in earnest ownership over the behavior of men.When I was 13, I went to my female youth pastor, shaken by the first aggressive catcall directed my way. She said,  Welcome to the wonderful world of womanhood,  with an edge of tired sarcasm to her voice. That was it. I shrugged it off and tried to shrug off the hundreds of catcalls in my future.When I was 14, I was lying on my belly reading the Bible on the church floor before youth group. A youth leader told me to sit up. If a girl is horizontal around boys, it forces them to picture you naked, she said. It causes them to stumble.When I was 15, I was violently assaulted on a mission trip. In response, my team leader literally asked me,  What were you wearing? This famous phrase is not just an internet meme. People actually say it to women, and even more destructively, to young girls. They said it to me. I shut up about that assault for a good decade after that. When I was 16, I sat in a dark movie theater with my crush, alarmed by my desire to hold his hand. It was my first official date, and I was too consumed with fear to enjoy it. You see, we were taught that women who have sex before marriage are like a trampled rose. Damaged goods. Undesirable. Unworthy of love.Sometimes the metaphor used in sermon illustrations was a chewed piece of gum. The pastor would chew a piece of gum and then pass it around the room, asking if anyone else wanted to chew it after him. Sometimes it was a piece of tape that had lost its stickiness. Sometimes it was a torn-up piece of construction paper. The sermon illustrations differed, but the message was always the same. With these images seared into my mind, I cut off contact with my crush after that night.When I was 17, I attended a purity retreat where I signed a pledge to  save myself  for my future husband. I didn t even think about what I wanted, because that didn t matter. My body wasn t my own.When I was 18, in college, a guy at my Christian school lectured my friend and me for stretching in the student union. He said it caused him to picture us in the positions we could maintain in bed and that we should work harder to protect his thoughts.We acquiesced. After all, we wanted to be women of God, worthy of our future husbands.When I was 19, another girlfriend of mine went to visit a guy who was housesitting off campus. She kissed him on the sofa after a movie, and then gathered her keys to leave. He forced himself on her. She came back to the dorms in tears. She didn t report it because we knew that girls who had sex were expelled from school.There was so much shame regarding sex in evangelical circles that none of it   consensual or otherwise   was talked about. There was no difference. It was all sin. When I was 20, my Christian boyfriend dumped me.  I want a pure woman,  he told me after one of our kissing sessions. We hadn t even had sex.  Maybe if your cleavage wasn t always out I could have controlled myself,  he suggested. I promised him we could stop making out. That wasn t enough. We already had. I was damaged goods.When I was 21, I was engaged to another Christian man. We stuck to the pledges we had made as teenagers. We sought Christian counsel to prepare ourselves for marriage. Always be available to your husband, they said. If you don t fulfill his needs, he will lust after other women. Until then, continue to be sexless. Try not to even think about it. An impure mind is the start of all sins. By then, I was damn well ready to have sex, yet I did not until after the cake was cut. I had made a promise to other people. My body was not my own.When I was 22, I began to untangle myself from the mess of purity culture. I ve had to unlearn so many ideas about sex and the female body. I had to relearn basic concepts of bodily autonomy, sexual consent, and sex/body positivity. Purity culture uses fear to try to stop women from being autonomous over their bodies. At its core, it is about control. So this is why it is not surprising to me that so many women are rushing to protect Kavanaugh and deriding Ford. The women who grew up being guardians of male sexuality are now approaching middle age, and many of us are still assuming that role and expecting other women to as well.The lingering effects of purity culture run deep. We were taught to distrust women   beginning with ourselves.Carly Gelsinger lives in California with her husband and two daughters.

The bureau was given just a week to probe the claims made by several women who knew the judge socially while they were in high school and university.Here s a quick primer on the investigation, where it s headed and what hurdles the FBI s report may create for Kavanaugh s pending nomination.The Justice Department is probing multiple allegations against Kavanaugh after Christine Blasey Ford, a research psychologist from Northern California, accused the judge of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers in the early 1980s. In a bombshell interview with The Washington Post, Blasey claimed a  stumbling drunk  Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed at a party when they were in high school, attempted to remove her clothes and kept her from screaming by holding his hand over her mouth. She was able to escape, but said the episode left her  derailed   substantially for four or five years. Blasey shared her emotional testimony about the experience to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week amid calls from her lawyers that the FBI investigate the allegations.A second woman, Deborah Ramirez, also came forward with allegations against Kavanaugh in an interview with The New Yorker. She claimed that the judge exposed himself to her at a gathering when they both attended Yale University, saying Kavanaugh later thrust his penis in her face, forcing her to touch it to get away from him. Ramirez noted that she was inebriated at the time, but said she was confident enough in her memories to call on the FBI to investigate the claims.A third woman, Julie Swetnick, has also accused Kavanaugh of misconduct, saying she saw him at parties where women were  gang raped.  Swetnick is represented by the attorney Michael Avenatti, who has made a name for himself as the lawyer for the adult film actress Stormy Daniels and as a vocal critic of the president.Kavanaugh has vehemently denied every allegation, calling them a politically motivated smear during his own testimony to senators last week. He accused lawmakers of crafting  a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election. The bureau has reportedly completed the first four interviews initially authorized by the White House and Republican leaders, including several people close to Kavanaugh and Blasey. The names include Kavanaugh s longtime friend, Mark Judge, who Blasey named as a key witness in her allegations, claiming Judge was in the room when the assault happened. FBI agents have also spoken with Ramirez about her allegations, Kavanaugh s high school classmate P.J. Smyth, whom Blasey said was also at the party, and Leland Keyser, a friend of Blasey s from the time.Debbie Ramirez spoke to the FBI for over two hours this past Sunday.  It was a detailed and productive interview, and the agents were clearly motivated to investigate the matter in any way they were permitted.  Ms. Ramirez identified a number of witnesses, and,  1/Democrats had lambasted the inquiry as being far too constrained, and the White House on Monday authorized the bureau to interview anyone it found necessary to complete its investigation, according to The New York Times. That list could include many more high school and university classmates of Kavanaugh, as well as Swetnick, who was initially excluded from the probe.There have been multiple reports of many acquaintances attempting to reach the FBI to provide their own statements with difficultly, and Blasey s own lawyers said the agency hadn t reached out to her as part of the investigation. Many others have made public comments about Kavanaugh s past behavior, including his involvement in a culture rife with heavy drinking.The investigation is expected to be completed soon, just after Republicans said the FBI would only have one week to dig into the claims. Both The Wall Street Journal and the Times said it could be concluded as early as Wednesday.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters on Tuesday that lawmakers would  have an FBI report this week, and we ll have a vote this week,  as well. Trump himself said his nominee was doing  pretty well  when asked by reporters about the ongoing probe, but noted that  a lot is going to depend on what comes back from the FBI, in terms of their additional   number 7   investigation. Most Republicans have been adamant that the full Senate vote on Kavanaugh s nomination soon, even in the midst of the ongoing allegations. The current inquiry only took place after Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he would not vote to confirm the judge unless the FBI was able to investigate the allegations.  We ought to do what we can to make sure we do all due diligence with a nomination this important,  Flake said last week shortly after he was confronted by two women in an elevator who confronted the lawmaker with details from their own assaults.  This country is being ripped apart here.  Flake is one of five senators who are still wavering on Kavanaugh s nomination. Republicans only have a slim 51-49 majority in the chamber and can only afford to lose two votes if the judge s nomination is expected to pass. Two other Republicans, Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Maine) have often broken with their own party and signaled that they had reservations about Kavanaugh s appointment, and Murkowski last week joined Flake in calling for an FBI investigation. Neither face reelection next month, and Flake is retiring.Two Democrats up for reelection in red states, however, are also among the undecided votes: Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.).Whatever the FBI finds and how that information gets to the public is also a heated debate. McConnell said Tuesday that only senators will be able to look at the bureau s report, but members of both parties have called for the document to be released widely.Trump himself appeared to be growing increasingly frustrated with the delay. At a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday, the president snapped at Blasey and mocked the Me Too movement.BREAKING: President Trump mocks Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Trump s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, during a rally in Mississippi. https://t.co/yjrqDceYv6 pic.twitter.com/iv22aHRwhnDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

And even if it makes us uncomfortable, we often simply shrug or turn a blind eye as awkward bystanders to this behavior.To address this problem, men must first admit that it is, in fact, a problem. So, men, we re asking you to share your own experiences. Have you been involved in a situation you later came to regret? We want to hear your story.

It contained pictures of my son sitting with five other boys on the side of the playground. Apparently, one of the boys had been put in timeout, and the others banded together and sat with their friend. I smiled as I looked at my son s happy face sitting next to his buddies. When I called my mother and told her the story, we both laughed. Then, I opened a new window on my computer to check out the news and watched Dr. Christine Blasey Ford step forward with courage and composure to relay the horror that she had endured as a high school teen. In her opening statement and during her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Blasey spoke of a culture of privilege, parties and predatory behavior.  Later that afternoon, after Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ranted, complained and cried through his own testimony to counter Blasey s allegation that he sexually assaulted her, I sat in silence. The day after my son was born, I told my husband to take a nap. Labor and delivery had been a long process   one that ended in a cesarean section. I d slept that night while Ben took care of our son, so in return, I told him to use the morning to get some rest. As my husband slept, I stared at our beautiful baby boy, and even in the glow of the moment, I found myself in a full-blown panic. I had so much to teach him. About how to be a feminist. To respect people from all walks of life. To learn to use his privilege to help others. My son was already eight hours old, and I hadn t even talked to him about consent yet. That  no  means  no.  And condoms! I forgot to talk to him about condoms! ALWAYS use a condom! I lay there in my hospital bed trying to figure out where to start. Was there a natural progression to these conversations that I wasn t yet aware of? How should I transition from topic to topic to help him understand the larger themes? I knew that my son would be bombarded by a culture that claims to value women s brains while simultaneously marketing movies with our cleavage, as if that faceless woman is someone to be ogled and owned.My panic eventually subsided, and I settled into a habit of talking to him while we changed his clothes or diapers. We d named him Will, because after 4.5 years of trying to conceive and five miscarriages, this little man had a will to live. Our topics of conversation varied. Sometimes it was about consent, like when Will unzipped my sweatshirt without asking. Other times, I explained to him the choices I ve had to make in my own life and what I learned from them.When my son started using the  word  nokay, another wave of panic hit, and consent became a hot topic in our house. My husband was always close by, supporting these conversations while reminding me that Will wasn t leaving for college just yet   so if I didn t get to it all in the first year, our son would be OK. We use proper anatomical terminology, and no subject is considered taboo.  I believe there is power in silence. Oppressive, shameful power that makes us put our heads down and continue to play on our phones even when something unacceptable is happening just feet away. I want to give my son power, but with words.So here I sit, looking at a photo of my little man sitting with his friend who s been put in timeout. And just like that evening in the hospital after Will was born, I pause again. I have no idea what his friend s transgression was. It could ve been a refusal to share something (they re in preschool, after all). It could ve been something more, like pushing or shoving a classmate (again, not unusual for young kids playing on a playground). But what happens when Will is in middle school and hears his friend say something derogatory about a female classmate? Or in high school, when a friend tells him about an incident that she s too scared to talk to an adult about? Or when he s at a frat party in college and sees a young woman being pushed into a dangerous situation? What can I do now to stop the perpetuation of this culture?I m adding another conversation to my list   one about not supporting kids who do bad things. A conversation with my son about observing others and choosing a way to either stop the action or get the help needed to do so. Even if that means standing up to a friend who is doing the bad thing.I know I have a caring, kind and curious little boy. He says please and thank you. He cries when he makes a mistake, and he loves to dance in the living room with his mama. He s learning about personal space, sharing and communication. I know these are lifelong lessons   and that they started in that hospital room. The offender on the playground is not a bad kid, and I would never equate the socialization of kids with the predatory acts of an adult. But if parents don t have these conversations with their children now, if we don t draw a line in the sand and stand up to a culture that has supported predators instead of survivors, then nothing will ever change. I can t go back in time and help Dr. Blasey Ford by intervening or by calling for help. I can t put on a superhero suit and travel around the world stopping every attack on every woman in the world. But I can keep talking to my son   and any other parents and children who want to talk. I can change the present. And I can sure as heck give my son the tools he needs to change the future.Sarah Maloney is a producer. She lives in California with her husband, Ben, and son, Will."

Blasey is the first of three women who have publicly accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.

Julie Swetnick has accused him of being present during a  gang rape  at a party in 1982.Trump on Tuesday defended Kavanaugh s reputation and argued that Kavanaugh   and men in general   were the real victims. A man s life is shattered,  Trump said of the judge. They destroy people,  he later added, referring to Democrats who support the accusations made by survivors of sexual assault.  These are really evil people. During the rant against Kavanaugh s accusers, Trump spoke more broadly about men who are being accused of sexual harassment and violence and blamed Democrats for the movement against the harassment. It s a damn sad situation,  he said.  We better start as a country getting smart and getting tough and not letting that stuff   right back there, those cameras   tell us how to live our lives.  Think of your son. Think of your husband,  Trump continued.  I ve had many false accusations. I ve had so many. When I say it didn t happen, nobody believes me.

We regret that we feel compelled to write to you to provide our views that at the Senate hearings on Thursday, September 27, 2018, the Honorable Brett Kavanaugh displayed a lack of judicial temperament that would be disqualifying for any court, and certainly for elevation to the highest court of this land,  the letter says. The letter is signed by many high-profile law professors, including eight from Yale Law School, where Kavanaugh obtained his law degree. The letter remains open for additional signatures through Thursday, when it will be presented to the Senate.The legal experts fault Kavanaugh for failing to remain open to the necessary search for truth after being accused of sexually assaulting a girl when he was a teen and instead becoming  repeatedly aggressive with questioners.  The signees also criticize the judge for indicating that he believes allegations made by professor Christine Blasey Ford and other women are  a calculated and orchestrated political hit  by members of the Democratic Party rather than acknowledging that the Senate must try to understand and investigate the facts surrounding the allegations. Instead of trying to sort out with reason and care the allegations that were raised, Judge Kavanaugh responded in an intemperate, inflammatory, and partial manner, as he interrupted and, at times, was discourteous to questioners,  the letter reads. The law professors cite two statutes, governing bias and recusal, that require a judge to step aside if he or she is at risk of being perceived as being unfair.Here s a copy of their letter:Signed Law Prof Kavanaugh L... by  on ScribdThe FBI is investigating Blasey s allegation that a drunken, teenaged Kavanaugh pinned her on a bed, groped her and covered her mouth when she tried to scream during a gathering of high school friends.

We have differing views about the other qualifications of Judge Kavanaugh,  the professors state in the letter.  But we are united, as professors of law and scholars of judicial institutions, in believing that Judge Kavanaugh did not display the impartiality and judicial temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our land. Another open letter was also made public Tuesday, this one directed at Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), signed by more than 800 faculty, administrators and staff at colleges and universities who live and work in Maine, urging her to vote no on Kavanaugh s nomination. All of the signatories have students and colleagues who are survivors of sexual violence, and many who signed the letter are survivors themselves. We are at an historic juncture, and your vote, your words, and your actions as our representative will be a focal part of what happens this week,  the letter to Collins says.  Will you send a message to the tens of millions of American women and men who are victims of sexual violence that their experiences will be met with indifference and even disbelief? Or will you make a choice for the greater good, and send the message that survivors can trust that they will be heard if they have the courage to come forward?

Swetnick, who is represented by the high-profile attorney Michael Avenetti, has claimed that Kavanaugh was a  mean drunk  in high school and that he was inappropriate with girls at parties.The claims made by Swetnick, who is several years older than Kavanaugh, are not as specific about Kavanaugh s behavior as those of two other women who have accused him of sexual assault in high school and college. Among Swetnick s more explosive claims is that Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were present when she was gang-raped at a house party in about 1982. Kavanaugh has denied Swetnick s claims, calling them  ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone. The Senate Judiciary Committee, headed by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), called Ketterer a  former Democratic candidate for Congress and weatherman for WJLA Channel 7 in Washington  in a press release about his letter. The Washington Post reported in 1995 that Ketterer was fired by WJLA after he was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder.Ketterer wrote in his letter that he first encountered Swetnick in 1993, and thought she was a  high end call girl  when they met, because Ketterer  weighed 350lbs  and  had never been hit on in a bar before.  He said they never had sex, but had conversations in which Swetnick told him she  liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time  and that she d  first tried sex with multiple guys while in high school and still liked it from time-to-time. Ketterer said he came to regard Swetnick as smart, fun and funny, but also as an opportunist.  I felt she only had interest in my 350 lb self because I was on television and well known,  he wrote.Ketterer said he decided not to see Swetnick anymore due to her  penchant for group sex,  writing in his letter that  A.I.D.S. was a huge issue at the time.  But he claims he tried to reach out to Swetnick when he decided to run for Congress in 1996, thinking she could help him with his primary campaign  because of her personality, great smile and good looks.  When he called her father to get Swetnick s number, Ketterer claims, her father said she had psychological problems.He wrote that Swetnick never mentioned any sexual assaults or Kavanaugh s name to him during their brief relationship. But based on his  direct experience with Julie,  Ketterer wrote, he did  not believe her allegations against Mr. Kavanaugh.

Ford described being held down on a bed while Kavanaugh   who hopes to have a spot on the Supreme Court   covered her mouth with his hand and attempted to forcibly remove her clothing.In his testimony Kavanaugh rejected Blasey s claim, at times yelling, crying and interrupting senators.In a letter to the FBI published Tuesday after a report that the FBI has no plans to interview Blasey, her lawyers said they have repeatedly attempted to make her available to investigators.

Look at me and tell me it doesn t matter what happened to me. You can t see Maria Gallagher s face in most of the now-viral video footage from her elevator confrontation with Sen. Jeff Flake, but once you ve heard it, it s near impossible to forget her voice. She s yelling at an elevated decibel through tears   forceful, clear, direct and deeply pained. Gallagher, along with Ana Maria Archila, both survivors of sexual assault, cornered the Arizona Republican on Friday as he tried to enter an elevator on his way to a meeting on Capitol Hill. As the senator cowered, looking pained, avoiding eye contact, Archila and Gallagher went off at him for nearly five glorious, heart-wrenching minutes. They weren t merely sad that Flake had announced he would be voting to advance Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s nomination out of committee and to the Senate floor. They were, as Archila explained on CNN the following day,  enraged.  This is a refrain I have heard often over the past two years from my women colleagues, friends, family members, random acquaintances on Twitter and interviewees over the past two years. At this point, to say that American women are angry is to state the obvious. Of course, they   we   are. Across the nation, women are angry, and also outraged, and also full of rage, and also burning, and also wanting to burn it all down. This anger can be messy, directed at a plethora of targets in sometimes contradicting ways. But this anger also has the potential to be incredibly potent, especially when it isn t isolated. We have seen women s anger at work before: During the early 20th century fight for the vote, during the 1960s and  70s when women marched for abortion rights and equal pay and racial justice and the right to hold credit cards under their own name, in the early  90s after Anita Hill s moving testimony against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas was met with derision from the white male senators who questioned her. In 2018, we are in the midst of a critical and potentially revolutionary moment; a political moment in which American women are, as journalist and author Rebecca Traister put it,  coalescing in anger again  in ways that are necessarily  messy  and  frenzied,  because  were it any other way, nothing would ever change.   It is this current rage-filled moment and its potential that is at the center of two new and essential books: Traister s Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women s Anger and feminist writer and activist Soraya Chemaly s Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women s Anger. Chemaly s and Traister s books cover similar ground but in different ways. They are perfect companion pieces, working in tandem: Chemaly showing us exactly why women are (and have every right to be) so massively, unyieldingly angry, and Traister drawing a blueprint for how that unyielding anger can be channeled collectively, as well as where this current collective burst of female rage fits into a long legacy of angry American women throttling toward political change.It would be impossible to fit all of the reasons that women are enraged into this essay or even into a book. Women s anger could fill volumes upon volumes, but Chemaly does an excellent job of giving the uninitiated a rundown of female rage. Women are angry because the realities of pregnancy are shrouded in sanitized terms and reproductive justice feels forever fleeting. Women are angry because they are perpetually pushed into the role of caretaker at home, with little institutional support, and then scorned for expressing discontent in that role. Women are angry because they spend their lives navigating public spaces full of harassment and private spaces full of abuse in a society with, as Chemaly writes, a  deep cultural resistance to taking women s fears of male violence seriously.  Women are angry because they spend their youth being overtly sexualized and their later years being rendered invisible. Women are angry because if their skin color is not white, they face increased threats of violence, even from the authority figures that are tasked with keeping communities safe. Women are angry because they are told to bottle up their anger and then that bottled up anger ends up linked to physical pain, both chronic and acute. Women are angry because, according to Chemaly, despite the fact that they report  feeling anger more frequently, more intensely, and for longer periods of time than men do,  they also are more likely to associate that anger with powerlessness rather than power. Women are angry because even when they express all of this pain, it is often not taken seriously. But more important than its existence is understanding that this anger, this female rage, contains untapped potential.  In anger, whether you like it or not, there is truth,  wrote Chemaly.Since the 2016 presidential election   buoyed by the groundwork laid by activists involved with movements like Occupy Wall Street and, most significantly, Black Lives Matter   that truth has become more visible, spilling out of women s bodies and into the streets and onto ballots. As Traister put it, we are seeing the  reemergence of women s rage as a mass impulse.   The key word there is mass. Where Good and Mad shines is in its explicit (and successful) attempt to go beyond an exploration of individual anger and zero in on the effect of collective anger and its political outcomes. We are already seeing the beginning results of this mass impulse. Women are marching in unprecedented numbers. They are seeking elected office, and some of them are winning. They are founding youth-led political movements. They are turning the pain of their Me Too stories into a sustainable rallying cry. After all, anger has always been a key component of social change, from abolitionism to the women s suffrage movement to the fight for abortion access and marriage equality. But the path our collective anger paves always looks neater in hindsight, and the political gains are always peppered with losses. Losses that, like Hillary Clinton s loss to Donald Trump, can set off a whole new wave of anger with the potential to be expressed productively.To understand the way these moments of anger, which add up to movements, have ebbed and flowed in the past might allow us to sustain this current one. It might allow us to make our anger really, truly count.  Our job is to stay angry, perhaps for a very long time,  Traister wrote, specifically directing this advice to the newly woke and the privileged among us.  That it will take a long time shouldn t scare us,  she wrote a few pages later.  It should fortify us. As both Traister and Chemaly drive home, however, there is always a cost to being angry. From Flo Kennedy to Serena Williams, angry women have made history, but they ve also often paid a steep price. Angry women have been taught by the culture that their anger is unhealthy and corrosive and ugly, practically the worst thing a woman can be. Their rage has been erased from history books, like with Rosa Parks, a veteran activist who is remembered in the public imagination as a docile middle-aged seamstress. Or their roles in social change have been downplayed altogether, like with LGBTQ activist Sylvia Rivera, who helped launch the seminal Stonewall Riots. They ve been denied access to professional advancement. They ve been shunned. They ve been arrested. They ve been physically harmed. The truth is that the anger women feel is not distributed evenly among us, and nor are the consequences for expressing that anger. Women are divided along race, class, generational, political and geographical lines, so some of the anger that women feel is (understandably!) directed at each other. That s what makes a political coalition of the majority so difficult to maintain, and also so very formidable and terrifying to those who benefit from the status quo. As both Good And Mad and Rage Becomes Her makes clear, this female rage is not new and the challenges that come alongside it are not new either. We have been here before, and we will likely be here again. The real test is whether our collective anger can sustain.There is a meme making the rounds on social media platforms among women I know and women I don t know this week. In it, Ilana Wexler, Ilana Glazer s character on  Broad City,  looks aghast at someone out of frame.  How  am  I?  she asks, using finger quotes around  am. Every woman I know today pic.twitter.com/5vDKvMzMFaIt works as a mood summarizer specifically because of its exasperated quality.  How are you?  isn t even a question many women can fathom answering at this point, because the baseline is so far from fine.  How am I?  we want to say.  Pretty fucking terrible and pretty fucking pissed off, and we ve been pissed off for millennia and there are no words to express the rage that burns inside of us on a daily basis, threatening to consume our whole bodies and come out of our eyeballs. To be angry at injustice is to be human. At its best, our rage can sustain us and get us through the worst of days and weeks and months and years. It can transform our own lives, and, perhaps most important, the lives of those who have been holding on to far more righteous rage than we can even imagine. What Chemaly and Traister are telling us, in no uncertain terms, is to stand with our angry sisters, rage-filled shoulder to rage-filled shoulder, staring out into a future we hope can be better."

I mean, really. Yes, it deserves a lot of laughter,  she said.She then joked that such a conspiracy would have taken a lot of work.  It would have had to have happened starting 36 years ago,  she said, given that the assault accusation that prompted Thursday s highly charged Senate Judiciary Committee hearing allegedly occurred in the early 1980s. That seems a stretch, even for the vast right-wing conspiracy stories about me,  she said.Although Kavanaugh was only thrust into the national spotlight when President Donald Trump tabbed him to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, the nominee long has been known as a foe of Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Kavanaugh was one of the more aggressive members of the special counsel team whose investigations led to Bill Clinton s impeachment in the late 1990s.During her Tuesday appearance, Hillary Clinton praised Christine Blasey Ford for coming forward with her accusation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, calling her testimony  very credible.  Why would anybody put themselves through this if they did not believe that they had important information?  Clinton asked.After Blasey s allegation became public, claims of inappropriate behavior by Kavanaugh during his youth surfaced from two other women.   Clinton, commenting on Kavanaugh s belligerent committee testimony, said that she found it  unconvincing  and  quite out of bounds.  The former secretary of state quipped that she would know,  as someone who has testified under difficult circumstances.  You never were so emotional,  moderator Jeffrey Goldberg said. Look, for 11 hours, you couldn t have been,  Clinton said, referring to her marathon 2015 appearance before a House committee focused on the 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that claimed the lives of four Americans.Goldberg also pressed Clinton on whether Trump, who surprised most political analysts by defeating her in the 2016 White House race, should be considered a racist. I think he has thrown his lot in with many people and groups whose stated objective is white nationalism, white supremacy,  she said. She cited his widely criticized response to the deadly violence that erupted at last year s white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia,  as one of the most troubling episodes of this presidency.  What he s doing is broader,  she added, when asked a second time whether Trump is racist.  He has been racist, sexist, Islamophobic, anti-LGBTQ. There s a long list.

We will get an FBI report soon. It will be made available to each senator and only senators will be allowed to look at it. That s the way these reports are always handled,  McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill, noting that background investigations are typically added to a nominee s file for senators to access.Still, there s an argument to be made that the extraordinary nature of the current situation merits the public at least being able to view the report s results. There s a growing consensus in the Senate that when the FBI s investigation is complete, the finding should be released publicly with any personal information redacted,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said.Schumer also called on the White House to authorize the FBI both to release its guidelines regarding the investigation and to hold a briefing for all senators on its results once the probe is completed.Over the weekend, the FBI moved quickly to interview a number of witnesses who were said to know more about at least three allegations of sexual misconduct against President Donald Trump s nominee to the high court. It s unclear if the bureau will complete the investigation prior to its Friday deadline, which the Senate Judiciary Committee set last week after hearing from Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of assault.But GOP senators said they expect the FBI to finish its work as soon as Wednesday, meaning that a full Senate vote on Kavanaugh s nomination may occur by the end of this week.The FBI started its investigation after Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), the Judiciary Committee s lone swing vote, said he would only support the nominee in last Friday s committee vote if Republican leaders asked the FBI to take a look at Blasey s accusation.Also on Tuesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said she didn t know if the report should be made public, noting that the FBI likely wouldn t come to any conclusions about what happened.  It depends on what is confidential,  she told reporters.  The committee should have the option [to release the report]. On the other hand, I just don t know what it s going to be because I ve never seen a report like this where there s no conclusion.  Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Judiciary Committee, expressed concern to reporters that releasing the report from an FBI background investigation to the public could dissuade people from speaking with investigators in the future.Not all Republicans agreed that only senators should be allowed to view the FBI report, however. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, said he thought it ought to be made public before the full Senate votes on the nomination. They need to see it all,  Kennedy said Tuesday.  I think its contents need to be made available to the American people. I trust them to decide. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) also said he hopes the report will be made public  because I m afraid it s going to be selectively leaked out  by members of both parties, causing further partisan rancor amid an already vitriolic confirmation process that seemed to shake the foundations of the Senate.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

I don t think you should lie to Congress and there have been a lot of people over the last year that have lied to Congress,  Trump told reporters gathered on the White House lawn.  For me, that would not be acceptable. The president s comments echo those made by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) on Sunday. Flake said lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee would be an immediate dealbreaker on the nominee for him.Trump also said he believes Kavanaugh is  doing very well right now,  but added that the judge s fate will depend on the FBI.Last Friday, the president asked the FBI to reopen its background investigation on Kavanaugh specifically to look into the sexual misconduct allegations against him. Republicans insist the agency must complete its report this week. A lot is going to depend on what comes back from the FBI in terms of their additional ... investigation,  Trump said.Last Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard from Christine Blasey Ford, the psychology professor who has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982. Kavanaugh was also given a chance to respond to the allegations, which he angrily denied. The next day, the committee voted yes on the nomination along party lines under a  gentlemen s and -women s agreement  that the FBI would investigate. It s a very scary time for young men in America,  Trump told reporters.Media reports and evidence provided by Kavanaugh himself have already turned up certain falsehoods in the judge s Senate testimony. A statement made by Blasey friend Leland Keyser does not, as Kavanaugh repeatedly told the committee,  refute  Blasey s story. Various inscriptions in his high school yearbook almost certainly refer to sexual claims and vomiting from intoxication instead of the more PG-rated explanations given by Kavanaugh. And interviews with several past classmates and roommates paint the judge as a heavy drinker from high school through college, despite his insistence that he never drank to the point of  blacking out. The FBI has so far interviewed at least four people, three of whom were allegedly at the party where Blasey said she was assaulted. The fourth, Deborah Ramirez, accuses Kavanaugh of thrusting his exposed penis in her face at a college party. On Monday, a new allegation surfaced: During his college years, Kavanaugh was once involved in a bar fight in which he was accused of throwing ice at another man. The alcohol-related belligerence raises concern among Kavanaugh s critics, some of whom argue that the judge lacks the right temperament to serve on the Supreme Court.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The breakaway UB40, which includes Ali Campbell, addressed the Kavanaugh news in a sly tweet Tuesday. In the words of our good friend [Shaggy]  It Wasn t Me,   the band tweeted, referring to the dancehall artist Shaggy s 2000 hit song.In the words of our good friend @DiRealShaggy  It Wasn t Me    https://t.co/ZYDUTZiFmcAli Campbell s brother Robin is a member of the other UB40. When asked if that band had a response to the story, a representative for Robin Campbell told Billboard:  Obviously, there must have been an assault because the police were called and a report was filed, but this is a case of mistaken identity and has nothing to do with UB40. Representatives for Robin Campbell s band, and for the record label of Ali Campbell s band, did not immediately respond to HuffPost s requests for comment.Several former roommates and acquaintances have disputed Kavanaugh s claims that he did not drink to excess.The 1985 bar fight incident first surfaced in one such statement from Chad Ludington, a classmate of Kavanaugh s at Yale. On one of the last occasions I purposely socialized with Brett, I witnessed him respond to a semi-hostile remark, not by defusing the situation, but by throwing his beer in the man s face and starting a fight that ended with one of our mutual friends in jail,  Ludington said in a statement published in The New York Times on Sunday."

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) released a statement on Tuesday calling on President Donald Trump to renominate alleged sexual abuser Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court should his current nomination fail.Graham opened by sharing his admiration and empathy for Kavanaugh and his family, imploring other senators to  not quit on him,  before diving into the senator s suggestion to the president. I believe Judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court very soon,  Graham said.  However, if his nomination were to fall short, I would encourage President Trump to re-nominate Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. It would   in effect   be appealing the Senate s verdict directly to the American people. Graham also noted that the midterm elections are  only 35 days away  and  a new group of senators  might view Kavanaugh s nomination  very differently after hearing from the voters in their states. The written statement from Graham followed his rhetoric Monday night on Fox News   Hannity.  Here s what I would tell the president: I would appeal the verdict of the Senate to the ballot box,  the senator said on  Hannity.  This good man should not be destroyed. If you legitimize this process by one vote short, we ll be on to the next person. I d hate to be the next person nominated. I would feel horrible that we destroyed Kavanaugh. So what would I do? I would renominate him and I would take this case to the American people and I d ask voters in Indiana, in Missouri, in North Dakota and other places where Trump won   saying who he would nominate if he got to be president   and see if the voters want to appeal the verdict of their senator.  Graham specifically named three states where incumbent Democratic senators are up for re-election in November.Sen. @LindseyGrahamSC on if Kavanaugh loses a Senate floor vote:  I would renominate him and I would take this case to the American people.  #Hannity pic.twitter.com/9r0rdcaeezOn Tuesday, Trump evaded a direct response to Graham s suggestion, although he complimented the senator. This was Lindsey s idea. Lindsey s a friend of mine, at least for the last six months as you know. Lindsey s a friend of mine,  the president said.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). I don t think we re going to find anything new from this supplemental FBI investigation to take Jeff from yes to no,  said Graham.Last week, a day after the testimony from accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh himself, Flake, backed by Sens.

It s a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something you may not be guilty of,  Trump said on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding Marine One.

A floor vote on his confirmation is expected after the FBI finishes its investigation into multiple women s allegations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh when he was in high school and college. Asked if he had  a message for young women,  Trump responded that  women are doing great. Tuesday s exchange with reporters further highlights Trump s inconsistencies when it comes to how criminal accusations should be treated. In this realm, you are truly guilty until proven innocent,  lamented Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women.However, Trump regularly calls for the punishment of people opposed to him who have not been charged with any crimes, such as former FBI Director James Comey and Hillary Clinton, who s still the target of the  Lock her up  chants that were a fixture at Trump s campaign rallies.

Joe Manchin s campaign office, where they had been staging a protest against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for almost 11 hours.Nine women were arrested and charged with trespassing after their hourslong occupation of Manchin s campaign headquarters in Charleston, West Virginia, according to Britt Heurta, a member of Vote With West Virginia Women.Demonstrators had hoped to meet face to face with Manchin (D-W.V.) to persuade him to vote  no  on Kavanaugh s confirmation to the highest court in the land after a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him, Huerta said.Instead, Manchin called the protesters around 11 p.m. Monday, roughly nine hours after the demonstration began, and told them he would not decide how he would vote until the FBI has finished its investigation into the allegations. Even before the sexual assault allegations came out and his judicial record was released, it was clear that [Kavanaugh] was anti-women and anti-union and antiñworking class,  Huerta, 30, told HuffPost.  If Joe Manchin were to vote  yes,  it would really send a bad message to West Virginia women about their autonomy over their own bodies and their right to make their own decision. After their tense phone call with Manchin, 11 remaining protesters decided they would stay in the campaign office until the senator announced his decision on Kavanaugh s confirmation.A Facebook Live video recorded by a protester who avoided arrest shows police ordering the demonstrators to vacate the premises or risk arrest. At this time, we re going to ask you to leave,  an officer can be heard saying in the video.  Those who choose not to will be placed under arrest and charged with trespassing. Shortly before 1 a.m. Tuesday, police escorted nine protesters to a parking lot who refused to leave the office, recorded their information and set a group court date of Nov. 8, according to Huerta. The demonstrators were then released.The video, which had over 8,000 views by Tuesday afternoon, showed at least 10 police officers responding to the scene. Representatives for the Charleston Police Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. We believe survivors, Manchin should believe survivors, and Manchin needs to vote  no  on Kavanaugh,  the woman recording the video can be heard saying.  And thank you to these brave ladies now being arrested for taking a stand and making their voices heard. Huerta, one of the nine women arrested, said the police officers treated her group  very kindly,  though the incident caused her to have  even more empathy  for victims of police brutality.The protesters   some of whom said they were sexual assault survivors   were initially told by campaign staffers that they could stay as long as they want and would not be arrested, Huerta said. The campaign even ordered pizzas for the demonstrators for dinner, but that hospitable attitude dissolved around midnight after their call with Manchin, she added.Representatives for Manchin did not respond to a request for comment, but his campaign released a statement on the arrests Tuesday, reiterating that he would not make clear his decision on Kavanaugh until after the FBI completes its investigation. After a long discussion, the campaign asked the 11 protesters to leave the office,  the statement read.  When the protesters would not leave, the police escorted them off the property. A statement from the Manchin campaign: pic.twitter.com/mkE08VAFKbCaitlin Gaffin, one of the women arrested, said she was  disappointed and disheartened  by the campaign s decision to call the police on them. I m disappointed that it had to come to this after his staff assured us that there would be no arrests,  she can be heard saying in the Facebook Live video.  We had a call with Manchin ... and I hope that he comes to his senses and votes with West Virginia women and votes  no  on Kavanaugh. Three women have publicly accused Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge, of sexual misconduct during the 1980s. Christine Blasey Ford alleged that he pinned her down and groped her at a small gathering in suburban Maryland when they both high school students.Deborah Ramirez said that he drunkenly thrust his penis in her face during a dormitory party when they were freshmen at Yale University, and Julie Swetnick alleged that he was a  mean drunk  who  groped  girls at high school parties.In a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, Kavanaugh vehemently denied sexually assaulting anyone. The committee voted Friday to send his nomination to the full Senate for a vote, on the condition that the FBI spend up to a week investigating the allegations.Four senators who have not taken firm positions on Kavanaugh met separately after the hearing: Susan Collins (R-Maine), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Manchin. The four are seen as swing voters who could decide the outcome of the closely contested confirmation.The protest at Manchin s office this week is just one example of women confronting Republican senators before the full Senate vote on Kavanaugh, which is expected to take place this week.Update: The number of arrested protesters was changed from eight to nine after Vote With West Virginia Women revised its count Tuesday.Need help?

With it comes innocence, boundlessness and permission to explore. But in America, some people are granted the benefits of boyhood well into their adult years, while others never receive these benefits   a fact made stark once again by the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.In the two weeks since Christine Blasey Ford went public with her claim that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while they were in high school, two other women have come forward with detailed allegations of sexual misconduct by him. At the same time, many supporters of the conservative nominee have leaped to his defense, suggesting that the assault, if true, was in keeping with the benign traditions of boyhood. According to these supporters, groping a woman without consent is simply  no big deal.  Many more have claimed that Kavanaugh s accusers and any corroborating witnesses are remembering incorrectly or lying outright, and there are already signs that these beliefs, espoused by no less than the president, may be tipping the investigation in Kavanaugh s favor. Shortly after Republicans in the Senate begrudgingly urged the White House to open an FBI investigation into assault allegations against Kavanaugh, reports revealed the White House was working to limit the investigation s scope (and by consequence, its findings). On the whole, Kavanaugh has been granted a considerable amount of deference and goodwill for someone accused of a violent crime, and it is difficult not to notice the contrast between his defense and others less fortunate, like Kalief Browder. At 16 years old, Browder was incarcerated in New York City s Rikers Island correctional facility for three years awaiting a trial that would never come. Accused of stealing a backpack containing money and entertainment devices, he pleaded not guilty and repeatedly maintained his innocence. In 2013, after spending significant time in solitary confinement, he finally saw his case thrown out for lack of evidence. But two years later, in an act that many attribute to the traumas he experienced while jailed, Browder killed himself.Browder s death was widely lamented in progressive media, yet his experience while alive was representative of what tens of thousands of Americans without Kavanaugh s advantages go through every day. There has been a great deal of study supporting the notion that people of color don t benefit from this presumption of innocence. And anecdotally, it is hard to imagine a black person awash in the sympathy has Kavanaugh received. Unlike black and brown people accused of a crime, Kavanaugh has a cadre of powerful people affording him tenderness and the presumption of innocence. At one point during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, Kavanaugh bemoaned how the assault allegation would affect his role as a youth basketball coach. At another, he boasted of his acceptance into Yale, as if academic achievement precluded him from misbehaving in the ways alleged by witnesses. And in one exchange during Thursday s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) likened Kavanaugh s experience answering questions to hell: Graham: Do you consider what you ve been through a job interview?Kavanaugh: I ve been through a process of advice and consent under the Constitution, which  Graham: Would you say you ve been through hell?Kavanaugh: I   I ve been through hell and then some.Graham: This is not a job interview.Kavanaugh: Yes.Graham: This is hell.Before a scheduled procedural vote on Kavanaugh s nomination the next day, Graham blasted his Democratic colleagues for wanting to silence single white men.  I know I m a single white male from South Carolina, and I m told I should shut up, but I will not shut up,  Graham said. In channeling the trope of the forgotten white man, he projected his angst onto Kavanaugh. It was a travesty, according to Graham, that a Supreme Court nominee would have to answer a customary inquiry   not even a criminal one   into his past, even if that past might have included a sexual assault. For privileged white men, inconveniences can seem like oppression.There was no conservative movement protesting on Browder s behalf   no throngs of Republican policymakers and pundits speaking of the injustice that spelled his death. Nor was there any such movement for Tamir Rice or Rekia Boyd, who were fatally shot by police officers, or for Dajerria Becton, who suffered under literally the full weight of the law. The message in this selective outrage is clear: If you are not a white male, you will forever be tasked   at your own peril   with policing your body and defending others from the threats it s thought to pose. But if you are white and male, childhood and the presumption of innocence is your right for eternity. You, not your victims, will be believed. You will be permitted to harm, holler, cry, berate and offend with impunity because adulthood and its responsibilities are not your burden. "

It s past time for a 1980s reckoning,  wrote Powers, whose columns appear regularly in the newspaper.She said she was compelled to write about her assault after Christine Blasey Ford s testimony last week against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Blasey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that a drunken Kavanaugh groped her, tried to take off her clothes and put his hand over her mouth when they were high school students. Many people have focused on the fact that she didn t mention the event to anyone until 2012,  Powers wrote.  As a former teenage girl in the early 1980s, this does not seem remarkable to me. In fact, the first time I spoke of the incident chronicled here was last week. And yet I have zero doubt of what happened and who did it to me. A post shared by Kirsten Powers (@kirstenpowers) on Oct 2, 2018 at 7:26am PDTPowers wrote that she  passed out at a party after being fed all sorts of alcoholic concoctions by older boys  and woke up with her shirt off and a  popular senior basketball player  on top of her. Dizzy and confused, I could barely remember anything about the night before. I asked what had happened and the boy told me we had just snuggled, but he couldn t explain why my shirt was off,  she wrote. A few days later, a male classmate I was close to exited the boys locker room visibly shaken. He told me this boy had bragged in the locker room that he had molested me when I was passed out. ( Molested  is my word. For his part, this boy chose to gleefully describe in salacious detail what he did to me while I was unconscious.) Powers wrote that  people can make terrible mistakes in life and learn from them and go on to make significant and important contributions to the world.  But she also said we can t  send teenage boys the message that they can sexually assault someone and, as long as they eventually become good citizens, we will elevate them to one of the most important positions in our society.  Powers added that the message to teenage girls cannot be  that attacks on their bodies don t matter because the perpetrator is young like them  or that  their response to being attacked, or lack thereof, is what will be put on trial. Powers has advocated an investigation into the sexual misconduct claims against Kavanaugh. She s also supported women coming forward, and has recognized the difficulty of doing so.  The way anxiety works is that when something anxious happens and triggers you   for example, testifying in front of the entire country   you become incapacitated,  she said last week on CNN during a break in a Kavanaugh hearing.Blasey s Judiciary Committee testimony resurfaced painful memories for many women. At least three C-SPAN callers shared stories of being sexually assaulted. And, on social media, the actresses Sarah Hyland and Busy Philipps revealed that they had been attacked."

Mazie Hirono rejected the idea that women are coming forward with allegations of sexual assault only in an effort to target men, calling recent comments made to this effect by Donald Trump Jr. fearful and an example of  mistrust of women.  It falls from a belief that, unfortunately, too many people have, especially men, that women just sit around making these stories up. It s not true,  Hirono (D-Hawaii) said on CNN s  New Day  on Tuesday morning.Host John Berman asked the senator about a recent Washington Post article discussing male fury and the alleged fear rising in the GOP in defense of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.Berman wanted Hirono s take on the notion that men feel they re being unfairly targeted by allegations of sexual assault and proceeded to show her a clip of the president s eldest son echoing these sentiments, telling DailyMailTV that he s scared for his sons. I ve got boys, and I ve got girls. When I see what s going on right now, it s scary,  Trump Jr. said in an interview published Monday. When the other sides weaponizes it against men, and says,  Forty years later we can bring it up, and you did something in high school that no one remembers but it should disqualify you from ever doing anything ever again,  it diminishes the real claims,  he continued.Hirono responded by saying that the men in this country  should make sure their sons particularly are raised in such a way that they respect women, don t assault them, don t harass them   all of that.  This kind of attitude that is exemplified by the piece I just listened to, it falls from a fear and mistrust of women,  she said.Hirono also made the point that such comments illustrate why  sexual assault is one of the most underreported crimes.  Because when women come forward   and by the way, thousands of people are coming forward to share their traumatic stories that they never reported. These are the kinds of attitudes that make it really tough for them to come forward,  she said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) vowed on Monday that if President Donald Trump s expanded FBI investigation of sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh isn t adequate, the House Judiciary Committee, on which he sits, would launch a probe if Democrats take the House in this fall s elections. If we flip the House, we gain subpoena power. We would certainly interview all of Judge Kavanaugh s accusers,  Lieu said in an interview aired on SiriusXM Progress.  It depends on what the FBI investigation does. Lieu, a former Air Force prosecutor, said statements by Kavanaugh s classmates who ve come forward in the media claiming he misled the Senate Judiciary Committee about his heavy drinking in college   even Trump acknowledged on Monday that Kavanaugh had a  difficulty  with drinking as a teenager   are crucial to the FBI investigation.  I believe the FBI would have to interview witnesses who contradict Kavanaugh on drinking,  Lieu said.  Senator Jeff Flake said that if he lied under oath he should not be confirmed. The FBI should interview those people to see if he perjured himself.  He [Brett #Kavanaugh] was lying about a central fact that would corroborate parts of the allegations of all three woman  @RepTedLieu / @tedlieu on The @MSignorile Show pic.twitter.com/8l90OCU41UBut Lieu also believes investigating Kavanaugh s drinking is critical to helping corroborate the sexual misconduct allegations raised by three women: Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick.After reports surfaced in the media over the weekend that the FBI investigation was being limited by the White House, and after pressure from several moderate GOP senators, including Flake (R-Ariz.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), the White House announced on Monday it would allow the FBI to expand the probe, though reiterated that it must be completed by Friday. It s not clear, however, whether that will include speaking with classmates about Kavanaugh s drinking.Former Yale classmate Liz Swisher, a Seattle medical doctor, told CNN she drank with Kavanaugh often and that he  drank heavily  and was a  sloppy drunk.  Yale classmate Chad Luddington issued a statement to the media in which he said he was  deeply troubled by what has been a blatant mischaracterization by Brett himself  about drinking, which Luddington called  frequent  and  heavy.  He said that Kavanaugh, after drinking, was  often belligerent and aggressive,  would  slur  his words and would be seen  staggering.  All the allegations against Kavanaugh have one fact that s the same, which is that he was inebriated and it was related to his drinking,  Lieu said in the interview, noting that Kavanaugh in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee repeatedly denied drinking heavily or to the point of blacking out. Kavanaugh wasn t just lying about some random thing, the score of a baseball game or something like that,  Lieu said.  He was lying about a central fact that would corroborate parts of the allegations of all three woman. It is central to those allegations.  I believe that after that hearing Judge #Kavanaugh showed he was no longer qualified to be on the #SupremeCourt  @RepTedLieu / @tedlieu on The @MSignorile Show pic.twitter.com/lnnxcSOniHLieu also said that last week s hearing, at which Kavanaugh angrily denounced Democrats for the inquiry   which he said was in part  revenge  for  the Clintons    showed that he s not qualified to be on the Supreme Court. There are many other judges the president could nominate that would have better temperament, that did not lie under oath and that are not so fully partisan as Judge Kavanaugh,  Lieu said.The mention of the Clintons, among other  conspiracy theories,  Lieu said, was  really quite bizarre.    A Supreme Court justice,  Lieu added,  is not supposed to be the mouthpiece for Donald Trump. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

He said Democrats  aren t looking for justice,  but instead are fomenting a new era of racism.On  Tucker Carlson Tonight  the commentator claimed that only Senate Republicans believe Kavanaugh s Senate confirmation proceedings  have anything to do with sexual abuse,  and that Democrats have a different agenda. It s not about Brett Kavanaugh at this point,  Carlson said.  It s about punishing everybody who looks like Brett Kavanaugh. The New York Times reported on Monday that Democrats were concerned that White House-imposed limitations on the FBI probe could turn it into a  farce.  The White House requested interviews with just four witnesses   two high school friends of Kavanaugh; a friend of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford; and another of the judge s accusers, Deborah Ramirez, according to the paper.This came about after Republicans reluctantly agreed to a weeklong FBI investigation following tense testimony from Kavanaugh and Blasey at a hearing last week. Following the outcry from Democrats, and some moderate Republicans, President Donald Trump on Monday reversed the restrictions on the probe and said he wanted a  very comprehensive  investigation. Democrats aren t looking for justice here,  Carlson said.  They want a revolution. For 60 years they ve been telling us that it is immoral to judge people by their skin color and they were right about that. Absolutely right. They put up a monument to Martin Luther King on the National Mall just in case we forgot. And yet, suddenly, without notifying the rest of us, they have changed the rules. Anyone who doesn t judge others on the basis of skin color, is, wait for it now, a bigot. Refuse to commit racism? You re a racist.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) declared on Friday, the day after the hearing over Christine Blasey Ford s allegation of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Kavanaugh may have forgotten that. Throughout his stormy testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee   a job interview of sorts for the open seat on the high court   Kavanaugh wasn t just interested in trying to clear his name. He wanted the world to know that he is mad because he is not getting what he believes should be his.But what he, and many other powerful men, might be finding out is that they are not owed money and fame. No one is due a prestigious job. And most especially not if they stand accused of mistreating people.During his petulant performance on Thursday, Kavanaugh enumerated his  lifetime of high-profile public service.  He reminded the committee that over his 26-year career, he has  served in many high-profile and sensitive government positions.  Kavanaugh s pedigree starts with a family who could send him to Georgetown Preparatory School and extends to Yale   where he said he gained admission by  busting my tail  but where he was also a legacy admission. He clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, worked in the George W. Bush White House, and took his current place on the D.C. Circuit   which he made sure the committee knew  is often referred to as the second-most-important court in the country  and where he said he  handled some of the most significant and sensitive cases. These are the trappings of his privilege, and also what he sees as his ticket to the next level of prestige. Kavanaugh claimed that Democrats surfaced Blasey and other women s allegations because they  couldn t take me out on the merits.  On the merits, he is sure, he is owed this honor.What Kavanaugh has at stake is a very rare and illustrious promotion to a lifetime appointment on the highest court in the country. If his nomination fails, he goes back to being a judge on the country s second-most powerful court. Yet this, he wants us to believe, is the same as annihilation. He argued that the delay in his confirmation is meant to  blow me up and take me down.  If the mere allegation, the mere assertion of an allegation   is enough to destroy a person s life and career,  Kavanaugh told the committee,  we will have abandoned the basic principles of fairness and due process that define our legal system and our country. This is at the heart of Kavanaugh s raw fury. Defenses of due process aside   this is not a trial but, again, a job interview   he also feels he is entitled to this seat. Such power, such prestige, is his birthright as a white man. Not getting what he wants is the same as losing his very life. It doesn t matter that three women have publicly accused him of sexual assault and misconduct. When has that ever gotten in a man s way?He s far from alone.In a self-indulgent essay in Harper s Magazine, John Hockenberry, the former public radio host whom multiple women accused of sexual harassment, recently wrote he had been given  a life sentence of unemployment without possibility of furlough  after he was let go.  Is my life a reasonable price exacted in the pursuit of justice?  he queried.Former New York Review of Books editor Ian Buruma published a similar essay by former Canadian radio host Jian Ghomeshi, whom multiple women have accused of physically and sexually abusing them. Buruma then defended the essay by arguing Ghomeshi had suffered  finding your life ruined. Actor Norm Macdonald recently lamented that Louis C.K., who has been accused of exposing himself to women without their consent, and Roseanne Barr, who tweeted racist things about former White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, had seen  all their work in their entire life being wiped out in a single day.  (Never mind that Louis C.K. has already staged a comeback.)As Trump put it in a February tweet,  There is no recovery for someone falsely accused ñ life and career are gone.  By claiming that being outed by Me Too and losing their careers is tantamount to being locked in jail or losing their actual lives, these men are also saying that the accusations have unfairly robbed them of what they have a right to: fame, power, influence and loads of money. Hockenberry and Ghomeshi still found homes for their writing in two of the country s most prestigious magazines. Louis C.K. earned $52 million last year and is reportedly worth tens of millions of dollars, even as his latest movie was canceled. And yet, finding that they may no longer be welcome in the halls of power, no longer lifted higher and higher among those ranks, is comparable to incarceration or death.Despite what white men may have been led to think for centuries, they don t have a birthright to positions of power. Alleged abusers like Kavanaugh may finally be facing a reality that has been far too slow to come: their privilege  their gender, race, class and pristine credentials   never should have, and perhaps someday won t, entitle them to power they haven t earned. It s not just that these men don t deserve to be handed even more control, even more influence, even more plaudits   especially when there is no sign they have done anything to reform themselves or make amends with the people they hurt. It s also that there are scores, hundreds, heaps of people who are talented and qualified and, importantly, haven t abused anyone, who could occupy these positions instead. There is absolutely no way the Brett Kavanaughs of the world are the only available people who could adequately fill these roles. We do not suffer from a dearth of talent. We suffer from overlooking talent in favor of privileged men, some of whom have done things that disqualify them.White men have rocketed to the top of the workplace and the world stage for virtually all of history, some of them deserving, some leapfrogging over others who may have been more deserving. But there is no reason the men being called out as abusive harassers who treat women like objects and playthings should keep plowing forward. It s only right that their comeuppance includes stepping aside to let the qualified, nonabusive people through.Especially when we know this abusive behavior is partly what keeps talented people hidden in the shadows. While Blasey is a well-respected, well-paid psychology professor, she has also detailed the toll Kavanaugh s alleged assault took on her life, and we don t know what professional ramifications she may have suffered. Experiencing sexual harassment of the kind Hockenberry, Gomeshi, Louis C.K., and dozens and dozens of others are accused of inflicting on people makes many victims tune out and even drop out of certain careers.There are qualified people who don t abuse others who can step into the void created when exposed harassers and assaulters are no longer promoted or allowed to remain in their roles. That s how a functioning job market should work: Decent and talented people should rise, and people who damaged others along their career path should fade away. It s not exactly the world we ve lived in up until now. But it s one that we are, perhaps, slowly entering.So far, President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans don t seem deterred from putting Kavanaugh on the court. But that doesn t mean Kavanaugh has proven himself worthy of what he may very well get. Bryce Covert is an independent journalist writing about the economy.

In a searing CNN op-ed published Monday, Milano denounced Kavanaugh s bid for a seat on the country s highest court. We cannot confirm Brett Kavanaugh,  she wrote.  We cannot allow another generation of women and children to grow up knowing their government and those acting in its name see us as less than human. The editorial was published just days after the actress attended Kavanaugh s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Milano, who says she was sexually assaulted as a teenager, was pictured sitting behind Kavanaugh carrying a placard with the words  I believe survivors. She later told CNN that she attended the hearing to  stand in solidarity with [Christine Blasey Ford], and all women and men who have been victims of crazy abuses of power.  Ford testified before the judiciary committee on Thursday about her alleged sexual assault by Kavanaugh when they were teenagers. There was a sense of hope in that room, as she spoke, for so many of us that have gone through that,  Milano said of Ford s testimony.END THE CRUELTY. My new op ed below. It ties in the sexual abuse of immigrant minors in detention centers to the misogyny of Trump and Kavanaugh.  Please give it a read. https://t.co/jqp9ePXjYgMilano, who played a central role last year in the ignition of the #MeToo movement, wrote in her op-ed that sexual misconduct and other types of abuse pervade all echelons of the U.S. government. Both Kavanaugh and Trump have denied allegations against them. I wish so deeply that the alleged sexual violence   and overall cruelty toward those who are vulnerable   committed by those who wear the mantle of our nation s government began and ended with these two men. It does not,  Milano said.  It exists at every level of our national institutions, and even at agencies working on behalf of our government who are tasked with the sacred duty of caring for children. The actress focused specifically on the plight of migrant children, a record number of whom are currently in U.S. custody.She described how migrant kids were recently moved en masse in the middle of the night, without forewarning, to a desert tent city in Texas.She wrote about the alleged sexual violence, abuse and neglect that some migrant kids in federal custody have endured, including the multiple children who were sexually abused by a youth care worker at an Arizona shelter.She called out Kavanaugh for his dissent of a 2017 appeals court ruling that allowed an undocumented teen to obtain an abortion. If confirmed to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh  would be making decisions about the bodily rights and autonomy of all Americans,  Milano told her readers.  Milano suggested the judge s appointment could  further  institutionalize the already prevalent sexual violence in government. Can we doubt that, if we confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, this further institutionalization of sexual violence will not rear its ugly head in myriad unseen ways throughout our nation?   In my name? In your name?   We cannot let Kavanaugh and Trump be the lasting face of who we are as a nation,  she concluded."

The conservative lawmaker is a staunch defender of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee who has been accused of sexual assault. On Monday, Graham slammed Democrats for calling for an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations, and claimed that they were playing politics by trying to keep the seat open until after the midterm election: All they want is a political outcome.

The group unwittingly played an unusual supporting role in the incident.  Chad Ludington, a professor at North Carolina State University and one of Kavanaugh s Yale classmates, said in a statement cited by The New York Times that 38 years ago, he and Kavanaugh were drinking beer with friends at a New Haven bar following a UB40 concert. They spotted someone who they believed resembled Ali Campbell, then the band s lead singer. When the man told the group to leave him alone, Kavanaugh allegedly cursed and  threw his beer at the guy,  which led to a fight. During that altercation, another member of Kavanaugh s group allegedly  took his beer and smashed it into the head of the guy.  Ludington told The Times:  I don t know what Brett was doing in the melee, but there was blood, there was glass, there was beer and there was some shouting, and the police showed up. Kavanaugh was among five people questioned by the New Haven Police Department about the assault, The Times reported. Although he was not arrested, a 21-year-old man accused Kavanaugh of throwing ice at him. At the time, UB40 was riding high on the success of its 1983 hit, a cover of Neil Diamond s  Red Red Wine.  The Times report caused both  Red Red Wine  and the band s name to trend on social media, which led to more than a few cracks, given Kavanaugh s repeated references to liking beer rather than wine, red or otherwise:I will pay one million dollars for any footage of Kavanaugh singing and/or karaoke-ing  Red Red Wine Red Red Whine pic.twitter.com/Gi0duoOwEaEveryone who had UB40 in the Kavanaugh shitshow pool step forward to claim your winnings.Having  red red wine  doesn t count, that s a separate entry.

Speaking to NBC News  Kate Snow, Swetnick, 55, who has accused Kavanaugh of being present during a  gang rape  in the early 1980s, elaborated on her account of the judge, whom she described as a  mean drunk  who  groped  girls at parties. Swetnick had earlier laid out her accusations against Kavanaugh in a sworn declaration.The interview raised fresh questions, however, about Swetnick s past with Kavanaugh, as some of her remarks appeared to deviate from her written statements. NBC News, for the record, has not been able to independently verify her claims. There are things she told us on camera that differ from her written statements last week,  Snow noted prior to the interview s airing. The host later stressed that the network was  not discounting what [Swetnick] said in any way,  adding that  a lot of people  were working on corroborating her account.  In the interview, Swetnick described Kavanaugh, who she said attended some of the same house parties as she did when they were teenagers, as being a  very aggressive  and  very sloppy drunk.    I saw him   go up to girls and paw on them, try to, you know, get a little too handsy, touching them in private parts. I saw him try to shift clothing,  she told Snow.  He would pretend to stumble and stumble into them and knock them into a wall. He d push his body against theirs. He would grope them,  she later added.Watch the full NBC interview here (story continues below):In her sworn declaration dated Sept. 25, Swetnick said Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge had been present when she was gang-raped at a house party in Washington, D.C., in about 1982.She said Kavanaugh and Judge had been part of a group of boys who d  spike  the drinks at house parties with the intention of causing  girls to lose their inhibitions and their ability to say no. When asked by Snow to elaborate on this, Swetnick said she saw Kavanaugh  giving red Solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame,  and she  saw him around the punch.  I would not take one of those glasses from   Brett Kavanaugh,  Swetnick said, adding:  I don t know what he did. But I saw him by [the punch bowls], yes.  In her declaration, Swetnick also said she  witnessed efforts by [Judge, Kavanaugh] and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be  gang-raped  in a side room or bedroom by a  train  of numerous boys. She added that she had a  firm recollection  of seeing boys   including Kavanaugh and Judge    lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their  turn  with a girl inside the room. When asked about this, Swetnick told Snow that the boys were not in a line,  but definitely huddled by doors. She added that she believed, in hindsight, that Kavanaugh had been  involved in this behavior.   I would say yes. It s just too coincidental,  she told Snow.Excerpts of my interview with Kavanaugh accuser Julie Swetnick will air first @MSNBC at 6pm with @AriMelber @NBCNews pic.twitter.com/bCY37cAeJ7Swetnick also spoke about her own assault during the interview.  What happened to me is probably the most horrendous, awful thing that could happen to a human being,  she said.  My body was violated; my soul was broken. Questioned about whether she thought Kavanaugh was one of the people who assaulted her, Swetnick, who said she filed a report with Montgomery County police after the alleged assault, told Snow she could not  specifically say that he was one  of them. But before this happened to me, at that party, I saw Brett Kavanaugh there,  Swetnick said.Kavanaugh has vehemently denied Swetnick s accusation, which he described as  ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone.  I don t know who this is, and this never happened,  he said in a statement.Below is my correspondence to Mr. Davis of moments ago, together with a sworn declaration from my client. We demand an immediate FBI investigation into the allegations. Under no circumstances should Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed absent a full and complete investigation. pic.twitter.com/QHbHBbbfbEIn an earlier interview with Showtime s  The Circus  that aired Sunday, Swetnick said all sexual misconduct accusations against Kavanaugh should be thoroughly investigated. Brett Kavanaugh is going for a seat, where he is going to have that seat on the Supreme Court for the rest of his life. And if he is going to have that seat legitimately, all of these things should be investigated,  Swetnick said, adding that she did not believe the federal appellate judge was an appropriate candidate for the country s highest court. From what I experienced firsthand, I don t think he belongs on the Supreme Court,  Swetnick said.  I just want the facts to come out, and I want it to be just, and I want the American people to have those facts and judge for themselves. Swetnick is one of at least three women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week about her alleged assault by Kavanaugh when they were teenagers. Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh s, claims the judge exposed himself to her at a college party and thrust his penis in her face without her consent.Following a surprise call on Friday by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) to delay Kavanaugh s final confirmation vote, President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to launch an investigation   one limited in time and scope   into some of the allegations against Kavanaugh. According to The New York Times, the bureau will be questioning four people: Ramirez; Mark Judge; Leland Keyser, a high school friend of Ford s; and Patrick  P.J.  Smyth, who Ford says was at the house where she was allegedly assaulted.Swetnick s attorney, Michael Avenatti, said Monday that his client had not been approached by the FBI as part of its investigation. He said Swetnick is willing to  take a polygraph test, meet with the FBI and be cross-examined by Kavanaugh s lawyers.  My client Julie Swetnick has offered to take a polygraph test, meet with the FBI and be cross examined by Kavanaugh s lawyers. He has refused to do the same. All of these women cannot be lying. And women who are lying do not push to meet with the FBI. Why the coverup by Trump?According to The Associated Press, Swetnick has an  extensive history of involvement in legal disputes.  In 2000, she was involved in a lawsuit in which an ex-employer, Oregon-based software company Webtrends, accused her of providing false information on her job application. The company claimed Swetnick, a software engineer, had also engaged in  unwelcome sexual innuendo and inappropriate conduct  toward two male co-workers.Swetnick claimed Webtrends had subjected her to  physically and emotionally threatening and hostile conditions,  according to the suit. She said she was sexually harassed by four co-workers   claims her colleagues denied. Avenatti told the AP that Swetnick s legal history had  no bearing on the credibility of her claims about Kavanaugh.  The Webtrends suit, which he described as  completely bogus,  had been dismissed a month after it was filed, he noted. Avenatti has slammed the FBI s Kavanaugh investigation as a  scam  and a  sham.  How do you conduct a legitimate, fair & thorough investigation into allegations unless you interview the person actually making the allegations about her experiences, what she witnessed, and what facts and other witnesses she is aware of? Answer   YOU CAN T. And that s by design,  he said in a Sunday tweet.

I worry that the FBI report will come back without a definitive conclusion, and that may give cover to some people who want to vote yes,  Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told HuffPost on Monday. He said senators should also examine if Kavanaugh misled the Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing last week, as well as whether he has the temperament to serve on the Supreme Court.Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) similarly acknowledged Monday that an inconclusive FBI investigation into the allegations could help alleviate pressure on a handful of uncommitted senators, who will  be able to say that they ve done the extra due diligence that some people wanted them to do. The White House on Monday authorized the FBI to interview any witnesses it deems necessary in its probe of the allegations, reversing course after previously placing restrictions that barred certain witnesses from being interviewed. The move seemed to be the result of pressure from several moderate Republicans, including Jeff Flake of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine, who initially pushed for a delay to the Kavanaugh confirmation process on Friday after listening to the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford. The Northern California research psychologist claimed Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers. The judge has denied the allegation. It does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover, for example. We actually need to find out what we can find out,  Flake said at an event in Boston on Monday, adding that the probe the FBI conducts ought to be  fulsome. The FBI moved quickly to question a number of people, including several of Kavanaugh s friends from high school, on Monday. It s unclear, however, how extensive of an investigation it can accomplish in a week s time. A number of the witnesses Blasey named in her account of the alleged assault said they have no memory of the events she described taking place. Most Republicans, including Flake, have said that they will support Kavanaugh s nomination short of corroborating evidence.  We have to be serene with the idea that if there s a thorough but expeditious investigation, that that in itself is a good thing,  Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) cautioned Monday, noting he had spoken to his colleagues about the possibility of the FBI returning an inconclusive report on the nominee.  We can t be cheering for a particular outcome. Part of what we re trying to do is make sure that, win or lose, this process has some semblance of fairness. Democrats on Monday expressed concern over Kavanaugh s statements about his activities and his alcohol consumption in school. During his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kavanaugh gave a series of dubious explanations about certain terms in his high school yearbook and denied accusations that he drank excessively. Some progressive groups have urged Democrats to seek a formal perjury investigation of him based on his testimony. Some of his statements about his yearbook are so deeply questionable I have trouble understanding how he could have made them under oath,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who sits on the committee, told reporters on Monday.Kavanaugh s temperament to serve on the court has also come under question. Last week, he angrily accused Democrats during the hearing of engaging in a  calculated and orchestrated political hit  by bringing up allegations that he said were motivated by animus toward President Donald Trump   some of the most partisan language a Supreme Court nominee has used in the modern era.But even Flake, who joined with Democrats in calling for the FBI investigation, said he could understand Kavanaugh s outburst given the seriousness of the accusations. Boy, I had to put myself in that spot. You know, I think you give a little leeway there,  Flake said Sunday in an interview on CBS   60 Minutes. Senate GOP leaders, meanwhile, accused Democrats of prematurely conceding the fight over the allegations against Kavanaugh by bringing up other matters, like the veracity of his statements before the committee. If you listen carefully... you can practically hear the sounds of the Democrats moving the goal posts,  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the Senate floor on Monday, predicting that Democrats won t be satisfied by the FBI investigation if it turns up nothing new.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Also,  first and most obviously,  a judge cannot be a  political partisan,  he told members of the Columbus Law School at Catholic University three years ago in a speech titled  The Judge as Umpire  (see the video above).His description of the necessary judicial temperament was a dramatic contrast to his own combative, belligerent behavior at a hearing last week as he defended himself against an accusation of sexual assault from Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford. As for political partisanship, Kavanaugh characterized the allegation and hearing as a  calculated  and conspiratorial  political hit  job by Senate Democrats out to get  revenge on behalf of the Clintons,  whom he had investigated in the 1990s as part of independent counsel Ken Starr s staff. He railed against unnamed  outside left-wing opposition groups. He also loudly and angrily talked over questions from Democratic senators on the judiciary committee who were considering his nomination. At one point, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) asked him if he had ever drunk so much alcohol that he d forgotten what happened.  No, I remember what happened,  Kavanaugh shot back.  And I think you ve probably had beer, senator. He presented a very different view of the proper temperament for a judge in the speech at Catholic University, which was analyzed by Mother Jones:To be a good judge and a good umpire, it s important to have the proper demeanor. Really important, I think. To walk in the others  shoes, whether it be the other litigants, the litigants in the case, the other judges. To understand them. To keep our emotions in check. To be calm amidst the storm. On the bench, to put it in the vernacular, don t be a jerk. I think that s important. To be a good umpire and a good judge, don t be a jerk.Kavanaugh also said judges should  demonstrate civility  in their opinions   and guard against creeping arrogance:There s a danger of arrogance, as for umpires, for referees, but also for judges. And I would say that danger grows the more time you re on the bench. As one of my colleagues puts it, you become more like yourself  and that can be a problem.The speech also included the infamous line:  Whatever happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep,  the private boys  high school he attended at the time of the alleged assault in 1982.The FBI is now investigating accusations of sexual misconduct, including Blasey s, against Kavanaugh. Some senators also want the bureau to determine if Kavanaugh lied under oath during his hearing. But his behavior last week has also raised questions about if his temperament is appropriate for the highest judicial post in the nation.Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.)   who joined with Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) to press for the FBI investigation before a confirmation vote is held on the floor of the Senate   expressed concerns about Kavanaugh s behavior.  He said in a CBS News interview Sunday that he thought Kavanaugh  went over a line  in certain confrontations with senators at the hearing.  He was clearly belligerent   aggressive, angry,  in a way that made Coons wonder about his suitability for the Supreme Court.Watch Kavanaugh s entire 2015 Columbus Law School speech in the video above. He discusses the attributes of good judges beginning at 12:55.Mother Jones has trimmed it to some of the most pertinent sections here:Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The messages, summarized in a memo obtained by NBC, suggest that Kavanaugh s relationship to Ramirez was closer than he let on and that she was uncomfortable around him when they were both at a wedding 10 years after they graduated.Ramirez was the second woman to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, saying he exposed himself at a gathering when they were both in college and thrust his penis in her face. She said she was inebriated but confident enough in her recollection to go public and ask the FBI to investigate the claims.Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the allegation and told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that he first heard about Ramirez s claim in the New Yorker article. The text messages, however, indicate that his team had been working to refute Ramirez s accusation long beforehand.A New York Times report on Monday also seemed to further the narrative that Kavanaugh was known during his Yale days as a heavy drinker.The Times, citing a police report from 1985, reported that officers questioned Kavanaugh after a bar fight while he was a junior at Yale. Kavanaugh was accused of throwing ice at a patron at the bar, and one of his friends, Chris Dudley, was accused of hitting the man with a glass on the side of the head.Kavanaugh was not arrested, but another Yale classmate who said he was at the bar that night issued a statement providing other details of the encounter.  On one of the last occasions I purposely socialized with Brett, I witnessed him respond to a semi-hostile remark, not by defusing the situation, but by throwing his beer in the man s face,  the classmate, Chad Ludington, said in the statement on Sunday, noting he had been in contact with the FBI.Ludington expanded on his statement during an interview with CNN s Chris Cuomo later on Monday, telling the host he believed Kavanaugh lied to Congress about his past behavior with alcohol. I believe that he lied, distorted and dissembled to the Senate Judiciary Committee,  Ludington said of the judge.  He never acknowledged that he got to the point that he might not actually remember something. And I find that very hard to believe, actually. I find that impossible to believe, actually. While Ludington said he doesn t think there s anything inappropriate about drinking in college, he noted that he thought it was  fundamentally wrong  to lie to lawmakers.  Brett took umbrage and threw his [drink] at the guy. Chad Ludington, a former Yale classmate of Brett Kavanaugh, recounts a story in which he says Kavanaugh threw a drink at person in a bar, adding he believes he  lied... distorted... dissembled  in his Senate testimony. pic.twitter.com/7MlxPYXa8DSeveral of Kavanaugh s other acquaintances have been in touch with or working to contact the Justice Department in recent days after the White House gave the FBI authority to investigate claims by Ramirez and Christine Blasey Ford, who said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was 15.A Yale classmate of Kavanaugh s, Kerry Berchem, told NBC that she had emailed an FBI agent about the text messages and sent a follow-up note, but had not heard back.Berchem said in a statement to the outlet that she had  no direct or indirect knowledge about any of the allegations  against Kavanaugh. However, I am in receipt of text messages from a mutual friend of both Debbie and mine that raise questions related to the allegations,  Berchem said.  I have not drawn any conclusions as to what the texts may mean or may not mean but I do believe they merit investigation by the FBI and the Senate. CNN also reported that Ramirez had supplied the FBI with an  extensive  list of names to investigate in relation to her allegations.CNN: Debbie Ramirez supplied an  extensive  list of witnesses to the FBI, containing more than 12 names.  The list included people Ramirez says were in the room that night, people with whom Ramirez discussed the incident contemporaneously, as well as people who had heard about.Carla Baranauckas contributed to this report.This story has been updated with additional comment from Chad Ludington.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

An 88 percent majority of Hillary Clinton voters approve of the decision, as do half of non-voters in the 2016 presidential election and a third of Donald Trump voters.There s less support for either party s behavior in the Senate. Americans say, 46 to 30 percent, that they believe Democrats are playing politics rather than making a good-faith attempt to get to the truth. By a smaller margin, 42 percent to 33 percent, they say the same of Republicans.Views are again divided along political lines. Sixty-five of Clinton voters but just 5 percent of Trump voters say that Democrats are acting in good faith; two-thirds of Trump voters but just 7 percent of Clinton voters believe that Republicans are doing so.Overall, 35 percent of Americans say the Senate today is doing a worse job of handling the accusations against Kavanaugh than it did of handling Anita Hill s accusations against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991. Just 13 percent believe the Senate is doing a better job now, with the rest unsure or saying that not much has changed.Polling released since Thursday s hearings has varied on the exact effect the testimony had on the public s opinion of Kavanaugh. Initial YouGov polling found that last week s testimony had, overall, little effect on support for his confirmation, while the firm s latest survey for CBS finds a  net shift in sentiment... toward opposition.  Quinnipiac University, which last looked at views of Kavanaugh s nomination in early September, reported Monday that he had lost ground among Democrats and independents, without corresponding gains among Republicans. Ipsos/Reuters polling also released Monday found about a 5-point uptick in opposition to Kavanaugh s confirmation between Sept. 18 and 24 and Sept. 26 and 30.Kavanaugh s relative unpopularity for a Supreme Court nominee, however, is consistent. Across all those surveys, however, opposition to Kavanaugh s confirmation at least modestly outweighed support.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 28 and 29 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov s nationally representative opinion polling.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said Sunday that if Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath, his nomination is over. Oh, yes,  Flake told CBS News  Scott Pelley.Well, Senator? Do we have some news for you! Kavanaugh lied throughout his confirmation hearing. He told big lies and easily disprovable small lies. This may not even be the first time he has lied under oath: former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) said Kavanaugh lied to him in his 2006 confirmation hearing for his current seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.So, Sen. Flake, we now present to you all the lies Kavanaugh told in last week s hearing   at least all the ones we can prove.(A Flake spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.)A key point made by Kavanaugh throughout his defense was that Christine Blasey Ford s allegations were  refuted  by three contemporaries alleged to have been at the party where she said he sexually assaulted her. Those alleged attendees said, under penalty of perjury, that the event did not take place, Kavanaugh argued. Dr. Ford s allegation is not merely uncorroborated, it is refuted by the very people she says were there, including by a longtime friend of hers,  Kavanaugh said. The evidence is not corroborated at the time,  he said at another time.  The witnesses who were there say that it didn t happen. But none of the alleged party attendees   Mark Judge, Leland Keyser and P.J. Smyth   ever refuted anything Blasey claimed. They simply said they could not recall attending such a get-together. I have no memory of this alleged incident,  Judge said. I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct,  Smyth said.Keyser said that she has  no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where [Kavanaugh] was present, with, or without Dr. Ford.  She added that while she can t remember the event from 36 years ago, she believes Blasey s allegations. She reiterated this after Kavanaugh s misleading testimony.Blasey explained that there was no reason for them to remember the party.  It was not one of their more notorious parties because nothing remarkable happened to them that evening,  she said. I never attended a gathering like the one Dr. Ford describes in her allegation,  Kavanaugh said.But according to Kavanaugh s calendars from the summer of 1982, which he submitted as evidence in his defense, he did.As he said himself,  The calendars show a few weekday gatherings at friends  houses after a workout or just to meet up and have some beers.  He says that he never attended a gathering like this, but that s obviously false because the type of gathering he said he did attend is exactly the kind she described. None of those gatherings included the group of people that Dr. Ford has identified,  he also said.On July 1, Kavanaugh wrote that he planned to go  to Timmy s for skis w/Judge, Tom, PJ, Bernie, Squi.   Skis  are  brewskis,  a popular slang term for canned or bottled beer in the early 1980s.So he gathered for brewskis with two of the three people Blasey said she remembers being there. Small gathering? Beer? Judge, Brett and P.J.? Check, check and check. She attended an independent private school named Holton-Arms, and she was a year behind me,  Kavanaugh said.  She and I did not travel in the same social circles. In that July 1 calendar entry about drinking  skis  with friends, he lists  Squi,  the nickname for his high school classmate Chris Garrett. Blasey testified that she briefly  went out with  Garrett in the summer of 1982.Kavanaugh also admitted in a separate Sept. 17 committee interview that he was friends with Holton-Arms girls.  I would imagine that there were Holton-Arms girls [at parties] on occasion, and I was friends with a couple,  he said. I drank beer with my friends,  Kavanaugh yelled in his opening statement.  Almost everyone did. Sometimes I had too many beers. Sometimes others did. I liked beer. I still like beer. But I did not drink beer to the point of blacking out, and I never sexually assaulted anyone. It shouldn t matter if someone who likes to drink beer or used to binge-drink to the point of blacking out goes on to have a successful career. What is at issue is that Blasey alleged that Kavanaugh was  visibly drunk  when the alleged assault took place. It s possible Kavanaugh had drunk too much to remember the event.Kavanaugh repeatedly stated that he has never blacked out in his life. Numerous people who knew him in college and high school said this was likely impossible, based on the number of times they saw him staggering drunk. Brett was a sloppy drunk, and I know because I drank with him,  said Dr. Liz Swisher, a college friend of Kavanaugh s.  I watched him drink more than a lot of people. He d end up slurring his words, stumbling.  He was a notably heavy drinker, even by the standards of the time, and that he became aggressive and belligerent when he was very drunk,  said James Roche, a freshman-year college roommate of Kavanaugh s.  I did not observe the specific incident in question, but I do remember Brett frequently drinking excessively and becoming incoherently drunk.  There is no doubt in my mind that while at Yale, he was a big partier, often drank to excess, and there had to be a number of nights where he does not remember,  said Lynn Brookes, a college classmate.Kavanaugh and his friends were  loud, obnoxious frat boy-like drunks,  who were the  hardest drinkers on campus,  according to Kit Winter, Kavanaugh s other freshman-year college roommate. I definitely saw him on multiple occasions stumbling drunk where he could not have rational control over his actions or clear recollection of them,  said Daniel Livan, who lived in Kavanaugh s dorm.  His depiction of himself is inaccurate.  The fact is, at Yale, and I can speak to no other times, Brett was a frequent drinker, and a heavy drinker,  said Chad Ludington, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh s.  I know because, especially in our first two years of college, I often drank with him. On many occasions I heard Brett slur his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption, not all of which was beer. Ludington added,  I can unequivocally say that in denying the possibility that he ever blacked out from drinking, and in downplaying the degree and frequency of his drinking, Brett has not told the truth. Kavanaugh s assertion that he has never blacked out from drinking is further challenged by his own stories and emails.In a 2014 speech at Yale, Kavanaugh recounted his fun partying days with a story about  falling out of the bus onto the front steps of Yale Law School at about 4:45 a.m.  after attending a Red Sox game at Fenway Park. He then admitted that he and a friend had to put together their memory of the drunken night the next day. Indeed, as a classmate of mine and I were reminiscing and piecing things together the other day, we think we had more than a few beers before the banquet,  Kavanaugh said.Kavanaugh, in an email to friends after a fun weekend vacation, apologized for getting belligerent after losing games of dice and said he didn t remember it happening. Excellent time,  reads Kavanaugh s email dated Sept. 10, 2001.  Apologies to all for missing Friday (good excuse), arriving late Saturday (weak excuse), and growing aggressive after blowing still another game of dice (don t recall). Reminders to everyone to be very, very vigilant w/r/t confidentiality on all issues and all fronts, including with spouses.  (Emphasis added.) My friends and I sometimes got together and had parties on weekends,  Kavanaugh testified.  The drinking age was 18 in Maryland for most of my time in high school, and was 18 in D.C. for all of my time in high school. The legal drinking age was raised to 21 in Maryland when Kavanaugh was 17 years old in 1982, which is when Blasey s alleged assault took place.Not only is Kavanaugh wrong about the drinking age when he was in high school; he wasn t even 18 years old (the incorrect drinking age he claims) when he recorded his own beer drinking on his calendar at the time.Who cares about a little underage drinking? It wouldn t matter if this weren t about two bigger issues: the event in question and whether Kavanaugh is credible. His dishonesty here shows he gets even the little things wrong.  Judge, have you boofed yet?  The question appears on Kavanaugh s 1983 senior yearbook page. It corresponds with Judge s page, which says,  Bart, have you boofed yet?  Kavanaugh s entry includes other terms that refer to heavy drinking ( 100 kegs or bust  and  Beach Week Ralph Club ) and a curious phrase,  Devil s Triangle. What does  boof  mean? And  Devil s Triangle ? The first term  refers to flatulence,  Kavanaugh said in response to Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and the second is a  drinking game  akin to quarters.But many people, including Kavanaugh s classmates at Georgetown Prep, said that s not what those terms mean and that s not what Kavanaugh was referring to at all.  Boof  has a history of being a slang term for anal sex, and  Devil s Triangle  refers to sex between two men and one woman. Based on extensive interviews by me and @katekelly with Kavanaugh s former Georgetown Prep classmates, what he just said about the meanings of  boofed  and  Devil s Triangle  is not true,  tweeted David Enrich, who broke the story about Kavanaugh s yearbook writings.In his high school yearbook, Kavanaugh listed himself as a  Renate Alumnius.  (The misspelling of  alumnus  is in the original text.) This was a reference to Renate Dolphin, a female contemporary who attended a Maryland Catholic girls  school. That yearbook reference was clumsily intended to show affection and that she was one of us,  Kavanaugh testified.  But in this circus, the media s interpreted the term is related to sex. It was not related to sex. But two other Georgetown Prep classmates of Kavanaugh s told The New York Times that it was related to sex. The prep school boys who wrote  Renate Alumnius  in their yearbooks intended it as a claim of conquest   that they had some kind of physical relations with her. They were very disrespectful, at least verbally, with Renate,  Sean Hagan, one of Kavanaugh s high school classmates, told The New York Times.Another Georgetown Prep classmate wrote a ditty about Dolphin clearly documenting that their reference was not about friendship:  You need a date / and it s getting late / so don t hesitate / to call Renate.  They were saying she was easy.Dolphin had signed a letter to the committee with 64 other women in support of Kavanaugh after Blasey s allegations emerged. When the Times contacted her about the  Renate Alumnius  yearbook reference, she said she had not known about it and that it greatly hurt her to learn of it. I don t know what  Renate Alumnus  actually means,  she told the Times.  I can t begin to comprehend what goes through the minds of 17-year-old boys who write such things, but the insinuation is horrible, hurtful and simply untrue. I pray their daughters are never treated this way. I will have no further comment. A statement from Kavanaugh s lawyer Alexandra Walsh to the Times said that her client and Dolphin attended a high school event once and  shared a brief kiss good night following that event.  I think Brett must have me confused with someone else, because I never kissed him,  Dolphin said through a lawyer in response.And yet Kavanaugh said the reference was  not related to sex  after claiming a kiss that the woman in question denies.Kavanaugh listed himself as the biggest contributor to the  Beach Week Ralph Club.  Beach Week is a party week in the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area where high school students go to nearby beaches to drink heavily.  Ralph  is slang for  vomit.  When Whitehouse asked Kavanaugh about this reference, he said it was about spicy food. I m known to have a weak stomach, and I always have,  Kavanaugh testified.  In fact, the last time I was here, you asked me about having ketchup on spaghetti. I always have had a weak stomach.  So the vomiting that you reference in the Ralph Club reference, related to the consumption of alcohol?  Whitehouse followed up.To which Kavanaugh sputtered a non sequitur reply about how he went to Yale:  Senator, I was at the top of my class academically, busted my butt in school. Captain of the varsity basketball team. Got in Yale College. When I got into Yale College, got into Yale Law School. Worked my tail off.  Did it relate to alcohol? You haven t answered that,  Whitehouse pressed. I like beer. I like beer. I don t know if you do,  Kavanaugh sneered. OK,  Whitehouse said, as Kavanaugh weirdly pressed the senator on whether he liked beer and what he preferred to drink.It is simply laughable to consider that  Beach Week Ralph Club, Biggest Contributor  is in reference to anything other than drinking so much alcohol that one vomits. I have no connections there,  Kavanaugh insisted regarding his ties to Yale University, where he went as an undergraduate and for law school.  I got there by busting my tail. But his grandfather, Everett Edward Kavanaugh, went to Yale for undergrad. The Intercept dug up a copy of his grandfather s yearbook, showing him as a student.Yale has said that 20 to 25 percent of its students are classified as legacy students. Throughout my 53 years and seven months on this Earth, until last week, no one ever accused me of any kind of sexual misconduct,  Kavanaugh declared in his Sept. 27 hearing.But Blasey alerted Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the committee, of her allegations in July. Blasey publicly revealed herself in a Sept. 16 article in The Washington Post. Kavanaugh s friend Judge wrote a book titled  Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk,  in which a character named Bart O Kavanaugh (sound familiar?) vomits on someone s car during Beach Week and passes out.Kavanaugh denied that he was the inspiration for O Kavanaugh.  He wrote a book that is a fictionalized book,  he said in his hearing.But a note at the beginning of Judge s book states,  This book is based on actual experiences. Kavanaugh repeatedly denied knowing that Judge Alex Kozinski, a mentor for whom Kavanaugh clerked from 1991 to 1992, was a sex predator who harassed women in his office and maintained a private server in his offices for porn. Kozinski is the most important judicial figure, aside from now-retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, in Kavanaugh s life. Kozinski introduced Kavanaugh when the latter was nominated to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.It s impossible to know if Kavanaugh provided misleading testimony when he said the revelations about Kozinski were a total surprise and  a gut punch.  But it seems very unlikely.Kozinski was first accused of  sadistic  and  abusive  behavior in 1985. When the allegations emerged, the Senate Judiciary Committee reopened hearings into his nomination after it already voted to send his nomination to the full Senate. He was still confirmed to the 9th Circuit.Reports about his harassment of female clerks and his maintenance of a website hosting porn came out in 2008. Kozinski was also known to send to a listserv wildly inappropriate content that demeaned women. He was admonished in 2009 and stepped down as chief judge of the 9th Circuit in 2014. Yet Kavanaugh appeared with Kozinski at a Federalist Society event in 2015.Kozinski s behavior was not unknown. Legal reporters Dahlia Lithwick and Ian Millhiser have written that they knew about Kozinski. Yale Law School students told HuffPost that professors Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld, who are married to each other, intimated that they avoided clerking with Kozinski because he was known to sexually harass women. Chua is friends with Kavanaugh, has directed multiple students to clerk with him and endorsed his nomination.Heidi Bond, one of the women who came forward in 2017 to tell their stories of harassment at Kozinski s hands, wrote in Slate,  Kozinski s sexual comments   to both men and women   were legendary.  Having clerked in his chambers, I do not know how it would be possible to forget something as pervasive as Kozinski s famously sexual sense of humor or his gag list, as Kavanaugh has professed to in his hearings,  Bond wrote.Kavanaugh said in his hearing that he could not remember receiving emails from Kozinski s email list, known as the  Easy Rider Gag List. It s hard to confirm what Kavanaugh knew about Kozinski. It would be possible to find out if he ever received some of those creepy emails Kozinski sent to his listserv, but Kavanaugh did not offer to search his emails to find out.William Pryor was nominated by President George W. Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in 2003. Pryor, a protege of nowñAttorney General Jeff Sessions, was controversial for his views on abortion. Kavanaugh, who handled judicial nominations for the White House at that time, denied that he personally handled Pryor s nomination when he was questioned during his appeals court confirmation hearings. I was not involved in handling his nomination,  Kavanaugh said.  I am familiar generally with Mr. Pryor, but that was not one that I worked on personally. But emails showed that Kavanaugh was consulted on Pryor s nomination. How did the Pryor interview go?  Kyle Sampson, a Bush-era Justice Department staffer, emailed Kavanaugh in 2002.  Call me. This email did not refute Kavanaugh s careful testimony, as he said he was  not involved in handling this nomination.  But Democratic senators felt that he misled with his testimony. When he was asked whether he lied or misled about this during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, he responded,  As I recall at least, I was not the primary person on that. During Kavanaugh s 2006 confirmation hearing for his seat on the D.C. Circuit, he was asked about his role in the Bush White House during the 2001 nomination of Charles Pickering Sr. to a seat on the 5th Circuit. Pickering had solicited letters of support for his nomination from lawyers who had business before his court in Mississippi. Kavanaugh was asked whether he knew about those letters of support. My first question is this,  then-Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) asked Kavanaugh.  Did you know that Judge Pickering planned to solicit letters of support in this manner before he did so? And if not, when did you become aware that Judge Pickering had solicited these letters of support?  The answer to the first question, Senator, is no,  Kavanaugh replied.  This was not one of the judicial nominees that I was primarily handling. But recently disclosed emails show that Kavanaugh played a significant role in Pickering s nomination process, which dragged on into 2004 because of a Democratic Party filibuster. Kavanaugh was often the only person included on emails about Pickering s nomination and helped place op-eds and news stories to help the nominee.This doesn t directly refute Kavanaugh s statement that he wasn t  primarily handling  the Pickering nomination. Feingold, however, believes he was misled at the time by Kavanaugh. Taking all his testimony together, we see a clear pattern emerge: Brett Kavanaugh has never appeared under oath before the U.S. Senate without lying,  Feingold wrote in a HuffPost opinion piece.When Kavanaugh was nominated to serve on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006, he was asked whether he knew anything about the Bush administration s warrantless wiretapping policy.Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) pressed Kavanaugh on whether he had ever seen  documents relating to the president s [National Security Agency] warrantless wiretapping program.  I learned of that program when there was a New York Times story   reports of that program when there was a New York Times story that came over the wire, I think on a Thursday night in mid-December of [2005],  Kavanaugh said at the time.Emails that came out during Kavanaugh s Supreme Court confirmation hearing, however, tell a different story on both accounts.In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Kavanaugh asked John Yoo, an Office of Legal Counsel lawyer who helped justify warrantless surveillance and torture programs,  Any results yet on the [Fourth Amendment] implications of random/constant surveillance of phone and e-mail conversations of non-citizens who are in the United States when the purpose of the surveillance is to prevent terrorist/criminal violence? While Bush did not authorize the NSA surveillance program until 2002, Kavanaugh s email indicates he was aware of discussions about the program before he said he learned about it from news reports.Yoo defended Kavanaugh, stating that he was not involved in the development of the NSA program known as Stellarwind.In 2003, Kavanaugh received information based on documents that were stolen from Senate Democrats by a Republican staffer. This included one fully copied stolen document. The documents provided inside information about Democrats  strategy to oppose Bush s judicial picks.Leahy, whose documents were stolen, asked Kavanaugh about this in 2006. He denied knowing the source of the information he received.Leahy returned to this question during Kavanaugh s hearing last week   this time with access to Kavanaugh s emails from the time. One of those emails included the first draft of a memo composed by Leahy s staff, although it was not labeled as such. Another came with a subject line of  Spying,  although this one simply suggested the author had a  mole  among Democrats providing intelligence on their strategy.Leahy pressed Kavanaugh on the draft memo, which he said was  obviously taken from my internal emails.  He asked,  Did any of this raise a red flag in your mind?  It did not, Senator, because it all seemed consistent with the usual kind of discussions that happen,  Kavanaugh responded.As to the question of the  mole  email labeled  Spying,  Kavanaugh chalked it up to bipartisanship, saying,  There was a lot of bipartisanship among the staffs. There were a lot of friendships and relationships where people would talk to    Oh, I ve got a friend on Sen. Ted Kennedy s staff  or  I have a friend on Sen. Hatch s staff or Sen. Specter s staff.  That kind of information sharing did not raise red flags. Kavanaugh never apologized to Leahy about receiving or using the stolen documents. Leahy concluded,  It s fair to say that he was not forthright with me, and I m bothered by it. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) asked Kavanaugh on Sept. 27 when he first learned that Deborah Ramirez, a classmate from Yale, had alleged Kavanaugh once shoved his penis into her face as part of a joke. In the last   in the period since then, The New Yorker story,  Kavanaugh replied, referencing the Sept. 23 story about Ramirez s allegations written by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer.NBC News reported on Oct. 1 that Kavanaugh s team had reached out to former classmates via text message to get them to rebut Ramirez s allegations prior to the publication of The New Yorker article.Two former classmates of Kavanaugh and Ramirez   Kerry Berchem and Karen Yarasavage   discussed efforts by Kavanaugh and his lawyers to get Yale classmates to tell the press that the allegations were false. In one message, Yarasavage said Kavanaugh asked her to go on the record in his defense,  NBC reported.  Two other messages show communication between Kavanaugh s team and former classmates in advance of the story. Oddly, in a private interview with committee members held on Sept. 25, Kavanaugh indicated that he did know about the allegations before The New Yorker article was publishedIn the printed transcript of this interview that occurred two days before his public testimony, Kavanaugh complained that Ramirez was calling former classmates to see if they remembered the alleged incident.  And I, at least   and I, myself, heard about that, that she was doing that,  he said, admitting that he knew about it ahead of time.It s not clear why Kavanaugh provided a different response in his public testimony on Sept. 27. No president has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination,  Kavanaugh said moments after President Donald Trump announced his nomination.Not only is this an impossible claim to prove   one would have to review the details of every past president s vetting process for every Supreme Court nominee   but it certainly appears that Trump did next to no consulting on his court pick. He was given a list of possible nominees by the Federalist Society, a conservative group that has tremendous sway over Trump s judicial nominees, and told to pick one.It took Trump two weeks to pick Kavanaugh from the list. For some contrast, President Barack Obama spent about a month reviewing his options before nominating Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan to the court.CORRECTION: An earlier version incorrectly noted the location where Trump announced Kavanaugh s nomination.This article has been updated to include Kavanaugh response to Ramirez s allegations.

Kaitlin Curtice is a Potawatomi author, speaker, and Christian mystic from Atlanta, Georgia. Like many others across the U.S., she tuned in last Thursday to listen to professor Christine Blasey Ford s powerful testimony accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they both were teenagers (a charge he vehemently denies).The hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee compelled thousands of women to share their own experiences concerning sexual assault and living with the threat of it.For Curtice, Blasey s testimony rekindled memories of the many times in her life she has felt unsafe while doing ordinary tasks. She thought about how, while walking to her car in a dark parking lot, she puts her keys between her fingers and keeps her phone out   just in case she encounters an attacker.Curtice wondered if she was being overly  paranoid  by taking such steps. So she posted on Twitter on Thursday, searching for women who have felt the same fear while walking alone, and have responded by taking precautions. Women:RT if you ve ever walked through a parking lot with your keys between your fingers or pretended to talk on the phone because you felt unsafe.Curtice told HuffPost she thought she d get about 20 to 30 retweets. Instead, dozens of women chimed in, sharing their own stories about the care they take or the plans they make in advance just to feel safer while walking alone. Curtice s tweet quickly went viral, earning over 68,000 retweets in four days. I realized that I m not paranoid,  Curtice told HuffPost.  I m just a woman in America. This is our everyday reality, and many, many women made that clear. Welcome to being female. https://t.co/LQUk7DKadWRelatively few instances of sexual violence are committed by someone who is a complete stranger to the victim, according to RAINN, a national anti-sexual violence organization. Most sexual assault perpetrators know their victims in some way.Still, the outpouring of responses to the tweet showed Curtice that something needs to change.<U+2033>If this many of us are signaling that we feel this unsafe every single day, we have a problem with the way America has institutionally signaled to women that we do not matter as much as men matter, and that men hold the power,  she said.The responses on Twitter made it clear that the fear of sexual assault is an omnipresent reality that complicates even the most mundane, everyday situations. It is a given. Every time. I also look to make sure there is no one following me and even take out my ponytail because ponytails (supposedly) makes it easier for a guy to grab it and use it to pull you his direction. All this, just for trying to get from a building to my car.Or ever gotten off a subway car, or an elevator, or took a different route home, or went into a store you didn t need to go to because someone was following you. https://t.co/fwpxkoXzebRecently, I had issues with my key fob not working properly. My first thought, upon realizing, was not the inconvenience of not being able to unlock my car remotely, but that if someone attacked me from behind, I wouldn t be able to get inside my car fast enough. https://t.co/FDwX5E5RqBEven though the onus shouldn t be on women to prevent being sexually assaulted, some reacted to Curtice s tweet by sharing what they do when the possibility of it makes them feel unsafe.Some said that they don t just pretend to be on their phones while walking alone  they actually call friends or family and keep them on the line until they feel safe again. Others talked about checking the back seat of their cars before getting in and locking the doors immediately. Women spoke up about paying extremely close attention to their surroundings and using whatever they had on hand to potentially scare off would-be attackers   purses, water bottles, keys. Others planned disguises in advance. Once, when walking alone in an unfamiliar place, I unclipped my purse strap so the heavy metal clip could be easily swung as some kind of weapon. https://t.co/5CtmjqF8LrMy reusable water bottle is stainless steel. Whenever I m walking home from my car in my neighborhood, you better believe I swing that damn thing like Harley Quinn swings a baseball bat to make sure everyone knows I have it.I used to pack a hoodie and baggy jeans in my backpack to walk home from my late class in college. I tried to walk like a guy would walk hoping to avoid being followed or cat called. From experience if I looked traditionally feminine I would often be harassed.Always had to do this when riding my bike home at night. Hair tucked in, make my shoulders look as big as possibleWhen I m walking alone at night I move fast and try my best to look like I will tear someone apart if they even think about messin with me, and run through my self-defense moves in my head real quick https://t.co/iDJioVrUJgIn college they had women take Rape Prevention workshops & taught us things like this. Unfortunately, they did not offer Do Not Rape workshops for men. https://t.co/n2TNmF3cBPSome women spoke about how these safety tactics are passed on from generation to generation, from mother to daughter. My mom taught me to hold keys in my fingers and to always keep my head on a swivel as a little girl bc there are bad men out there. https://t.co/lKL7Ft3usTMy daughter is starting to drive. The first thing I told her was to always have her key in her hand when waling thru a parking lot.My daughter and I just talked about this last night. I tried to explain the caution/fear to my husband recently, but he just cannot comprehend. https://t.co/GmPJs66gPmSome shared stories of meeting women who tried to lend a hand to assuage fears, even though they were strangers.In fact one lady bus driver did a slight detour to get me closer to home after I had told her about a guy who was insisting I went home after him whilst I waited for the bus. She got me to sit behind her. He wasn t on the bus but she wanted me to feel safe.I had a woman Uber driver once who was concerned about where she was dropping me off. She said  You have my number, call if there is a problem and I will turn around immediately . I was fine, but I will always remember her concern and kindness.Some men responded to Curtice s tweet by pledging to support and believe women who come forward with stories of sexual assault. Others pushed back   arguing that men also feel wary while walking alone at night.While Curtice acknowledged that there are definitely some spaces where men may feel unsafe, she said her tweet was directed at elevating women s voices. She also said she hopes the tweet encourages men to listen to women s experiences.  I hope it encourages men to examine the ways in which they make women feel unsafe, or the ways in which they shame women, often without realizing it, for taking these kinds of precautions to simply stay safe in America,  she said.Need help?

His confirmation would do serious damage to the credibility and integrity of the Supreme Court as a critically important institution in our constitutional system.I say this not because Kavanaugh is not intellectually qualified to serve on the court. To the contrary, viewed solely from that perspective, he is as well qualified as most of the other justices who have been confirmed in recent decades   including Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, John Roberts, Sonia Sotomayor, David Souter, Lewis Powell, Warren Burger and Harry Blackmun, to name just a few. From this standpoint, I agree with the American Bar Association s original evaluation that Kavanaugh is intellectually and professionally well qualified to serve on the court. For a number of reasons, though, other considerations enter the picture. First, there is the unconscionable conduct of Senate Republicans in refusing to confirm President Barack Obama s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland in 2016. By any measure, Garland was as qualified as   indeed, more qualified than   Kavanaugh. But the Senate Republicans, in order to manipulate the confirmation process in a determined effort to control the future direction of the court, violated every well-established norm in a profoundly dishonest effort to get our nation to this point   a point at which, if Kavanaugh is confirmed, there will be five Justices on the Supreme Court who are more aggressively conservative than any other justice, except Antonin Scalia, who has served on the court in living memory.Senate Republicans have used every available device and distortion to create a rock-solid right-wing five-member majority that will vote the straight-up Republican Party line on such fundamental issues as gun control, campaign finance reform, labor unions, abortion, gay rights, affirmative action, gerrymandering, corporate and commercial speech and minority voting rights, without regard to any serious, consistent or principled theory of constitutional interpretation. The confirmation of Kavanaugh would represent the triumphant completion of this strategy and the culmination of the Senate Republicans  reprehensible treatment of Garland. This should not be permitted to happen. If it does, it will destroy the integrity and credibility of the Supreme Court for decades to come. To someone like myself, who has devoted his entire adult life to teaching, writing and speaking about the Constitution of the United States, this is truly devastating. What we need now   what our nation deserves now   is the appointment of a relatively moderate justice, like Garland or Souter, whose presence on the court will enable it to retain its identity as a court rather than as a partisan political actor.Beyond that, there is the issue of personal integrity. With the highly credible testimony of professor Christine Blasey Ford, serious questions have been raised about Kavanaugh s integrity, honesty and temperament. Having watched Ford s and Kavanaugh s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am inclined to accept her version of events. But even if she is in error, I have no doubt that Kavanaugh could have calmly and sympathetically testified that her memory of the incident was flawed and that it was some other person who inflicted this horror upon her. He did not do so.Instead of expressing respect and sympathy for Ford and calmly suggesting that she was mistaken in thinking that he sexually assaulted her, he ranted and shrieked and tossed off accusations and lies that demonstrated, to my surprise, that he clearly does not belong on the Supreme Court of the United States. Even if he did not do what he is accused of, the way he presented himself was truly shocking, immature, irrational and uncontrolled. No person with that degree of emotional instability belongs on the highest court in our land. Kavanaugh revealed himself to be untrustworthy in precisely the way justices of the Supreme Court must be trustworthy. They must be calm, thoughtful, open-minded, respectful and mature; Kavanaugh has made strikingly clear that he is none of these things. That, in itself, is a compelling reason not to confirm his nomination to serve on the Supreme Court.Over the past half-century, I have had the privilege of getting to know, to varying degrees, most of the individuals who have served on the Supreme Court since 1968. None of them   none of them   would have behaved in the truly immature and reprehensible way Kavanaugh did before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is simply not fit to serve as a justice of the Supreme Court. If President Donald Trump, Senate Republicans and the Federalist Society care at all about the integrity of the Supreme Court as an institution, it is time for them to go back to the drawing board. They can do better, and they should.Geoffrey R. Stone is the Edward H. Levi distinguished service professor of law at the University of Chicago."

There were reportedly restrictions placed on the number of witnesses federal investigators could interview, as well as on certain topics like Kavanaugh s drinking history.However, the Trump administration reversed course on Monday after nearly unanimous criticism from Democrats and a few wavering Republicans. It does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover, for example. We actually need to find out what we can find out,  Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said at an event in Boston on Monday. Flake said he planned to speak with the White House counsel s office to ensure the probe is  fulsome. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who has not yet said whether she will support Kavanaugh s nomination, also told NBC News on Monday that she was consulted about the White House authorizing the expanded FBI approach to the investigation. I am confident that the FBI will follow up on any leads that result from the interviews,  Collins said in a statement Monday.Flake, Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) initially pushed for a delay to the Kavanaugh confirmation process on Friday after listening to the testimony of Blasey, who says Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both teens. The appellate court judge has denied the allegations.GOP leaders reluctantly agreed to a limited investigation lasting no longer than one week because of their razor-thin majority in the Senate. It s unclear how senators like Flake and Collins will vote if the FBI turns up nothing new, but without them on board, Kavanaugh s nomination is likely to be blocked by a majority of the Democratic caucus.Addressing swirling questions about the scope of the investigation during a press conference at the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump said he d like to see a  very comprehensive  probe of the allegations, telling reporters that the FBI  should do what they have to do to get the answer. Unable to attack Blasey head-on   a politically sensitive move on the eve of the midterm elections   Republicans have instead focused on complaining about the process that led the psychology professor to speak out last month, and on attempting to discredit the story of a different woman who has accused Kavanaugh of being at a high school party where she was gang-raped. That woman did not identify Kavanaugh as an assailant. If you listen carefully... you can practically hear the sounds of the Democrats moving the goal posts,  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the Senate floor on Monday, predicting that Democrats won t be satisfied by the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations if it turns up no new evidence.McConnell, who vowed to confirm Kavanaugh even before Blasey told her story before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, added that the Senate will begin its final votes on Kavanaugh s nomination  this week.

For some in the former camp, her testimony brought up painful memories of long-ago sexual assaults that they had kept quiet or of the disbelief they faced if they came forward. In the other group, some recalled their behavior in past years or expressed the fear of being accused of things they hadn t done.Those who felt an affinity with the Supreme Court nominee or his accuser often expressed their sense of solidarity in terms of gender    I m a woman,  one Blasey backer wrote simply, while a man who backed Kavanaugh began by explaining,  Because I m a white male ....  Although gender clearly played a role, the sharpest divides were along political lines.On opposite ends of the spectrum, male Donald Trump voters and female Hillary Clinton voters stood out as unusually connected to the story: 56 percent of female Clinton voters said they felt a kinship with Blasey, while 59 percent of male Trump voters said they saw something of themselves in Kavanaugh. By contrast, most female Trump voters and male Clinton voters didn t report feeling similar ties.Comments from those who said they were personally affected speak clearly to the heightened emotions surrounding the hearings. Below, a sampling of responses to the survey   some lightly edited for clarity. Because I too was a victim, as a child and as an adult. I m 58. I have never told anybody. I have never reported it.    female Clinton voter I had a very similar experience when I was 15. I m now 69 and only told someone about this last week. I told my sister. I have never spoken of it in all these years, but I can never forget it. I was also sexually attacked by two boys whom I knew.    female Clinton voter I too am a victim of sexual assault.    male Clinton voter I am also a woman, and I was sexually abused as a child. I know what it s like to be afraid to share something and to only share it because you feel you have to, in the face of outside disbelief and internal pain.    female nonvoter I was assaulted when I was young and have only chosen to tell a select few because of potential professional and personal repercussions.    male Clinton voter Because, like nearly all women, I too have been a victim of sexual assault and harassment. I have never told anyone nor reported any of the incidents. However, if one of the men who assaulted me were to attempt to run for an office or appointment at such a high level, I would certainly come forward in an effort to stop such a man from gaining such an influential position.    female Clinton voter  Female, been assaulted too. No one believed me.    female Clinton voter I ve watched this exact kind of thing happen a few times both in high school and college. I don t think there is a female out there who hasn t had to deal with guys who are drinking, drunk, rude or just pushy at the very least. Sometimes it turns into assault or rape.    female Trump voter Because she is a person who is simply trying to do her duty as a citizen and she has been attacked, ridiculed, threatened and vilified. I identify with her because her experience is an amplified version of what every woman experiences throughout their entire lives.    female Clinton voter I ve been sexually assaulted, and no one took me seriously.    female nonvoter Because so many women in this world don t come forward, and it takes a lot of guts to go forward. I didn t have the guts. I did confront one of my accusers, and I have to see him all the time in the small town where I lived. ... I have yet to confront [the other one], but one day I will.    female Clinton voter I have been sexually assaulted and know how hard it is to come forward about such allegations when it is a person people look up to.    female Trump voter I know many women that have been sexually assaulted.    male Clinton voter I am a woman who attended parties in the  80s where I experienced many of the attitudes she described. I also am a victim of sexual assault.    female Clinton voter I too was molested when I was a young woman, and I ve never told anyone about it out of shame and embarrassment.    female Clinton voter I understand the feeling of wanting to do something and being stonewalled by those in power with an agenda.    male Clinton voter I was young once too but never would force myself on a girl.    male Clinton voter I ve been there.    female Clinton voter I ve been through what she went through.    female Clinton voter I m a woman.    female Clinton voter Because I m a white male and so deemed to be guilty of racism, sexism, assault, destroying the planet and every other social ill. If you disqualified every man who embarrassed himself in high school, no man would be left to serve.     male Trump voter I know how women will lie. I ve had it happen to me.    male Trump voter I ve worked hard my entire life. I believe he has as well. I have made more mistakes than Brett has and have paid for them. These allegations on sexual misconduct are older than me. I ve been given a second chance, if you will, and he has proved to be a good man   might I say even the best among us.    male Trump voter  I am a white male with some power who has done some boorish things in the past.    male third-party voter He is a Christian man and a conservative. I am a Christian and conservative too. I believe he will hear issues at the Supreme Court on the basis of the Constitution and not try and make new laws. I do not fear he will end abortion or same-sex marriage. I am against both, but I still don t think he will make new laws banning them.    female Trump voter  He did nothing wrong. You can t defend yourself about something that never happened. Been in that position, and it s lonely and impossible.    female Trump voter I ve had someone put an order on me to keep me away from her and my daughter. Everything in the order was lies. They don t realize that when they don t tell the truth, it really messes someone up.    male Trump voter I have seen too many men accused unfairly.    female Trump voter Because I have witnessed someone falsely accusing someone of attempted rape. I know how malicious it can be.    male Trump voter I don t think that he is guilty, and if he is, he was a minor, a child.    male Trump voter  Christian, family man, married, coaches his kids  sports, lawyer, all-around good guy   like me.    male Trump voterNeed help?

The problem is, Kavanaugh has strenuously denied that he abused alcohol as a teenager. Trump is undercutting his own Supreme Court nominee s defense against sexual assault allegations leveled against him by Christine Blasey Ford. Trump said he tuned in to last week s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and said he saw  a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man with drink.  I graduated from high school, and while I did not drink, I saw a lot of people drinking,  Trump said at a Monday press conference.  They drink beer and they would go crazy, they were in high school, they were 16, 17 years old. And I saw a lot of it. Does that mean that they can t do something that they want to do with their life?  I really believe that he was very strong on the fact that he drank a lot and so I don t know where there would be a big discrepancy,  Trump added. Blasey has said that when they were teenagers, Kavanaugh locked her in a room and sexually assaulted her. She said that he and his friend, Mark Judge, who was present for the assault, were  drunkenly laughing during the attack  and  seemed to be having a good time. Deborah Ramirez has also alleged that while she and Kavanaugh were students at Yale, he drunkenly exposed himself to her. Another classmate of Kavanaugh s at Yale, Charles Ludington, said he remembers Kavanaugh would become  belligerent and angry  when drunk.But Kavanaugh has strongly denied having a problem with alcohol, saying he just drank beer occasionally, like everyone else. My friends and I sometimes got together and had parties on weekends. The drinking age was 18 in Maryland for most of my time in high school, and was 18 in D.C. for all of my time in high school. I drank beer with my friends. Almost everyone did. Sometimes I had too many beers. Sometimes others did. I liked beer. I still like beer.But I did not drink beer to the point of blacking out, and I never sexually assaulted anyone. There is a bright line between drinking beer, which I gladly do, and which I fully embrace, and sexually assaulting someone, which is a violent crime. If every American who drinks beer or every American who drank beer in high school is suddenly presumed guilty of sexual assault, will be an ugly, new place in this country. I never committed sexual assault.There are also other hints that Kavanaugh may have been a heavier drinker than he has let on.Apparently, Kavanaugh s protests that he was a moderate drinker who never once passed out from a hard night partying didn t even convince the president.

Thank you, Mr. President.  But Trump continued to taunt her. That s OK. I know you re not thinking. You never do,  the president muttered.Jeez. @CeciliaVega tells Trump she isn t shocked he called on her.  Trump says  I know you weren t thinking, you never do.  pic.twitter.com/PX6ReNYZ0YVega, visibly taken aback, seemed to ask Trump to repeat what he d said. But Trump brushed off her request, telling her to just  go ahead  with her question.Vega then attempted to ask Trump about the FBI investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. But Trump said he wouldn t discuss the probe until more questions were asked about the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement   a revised trade deal among those three countries, and the subject of the news conference.Trump eventually came back to Vega s question on Kavanaugh, though not before belittling another female reporter, CNN s Kaitlan Collins, who also attempted to ask about the Kavanaugh investigation. Don t do that,  Trump interrupted Collins.  That s not nice... Do you have a question on trade? After pointing out that her colleagues had already asked several trade-related questions, Collins continued with her question about Kavanaugh.

They re loco,  he said of the media.  I use that word because of that fact that we made a trade deal with Mexico.  Trump has long fostered a fraught relationship with the U.S. s southern neighbor. When he announced his presidential bid in 2015, he said of Mexico,  They are not our friend, believe me. He claimed the country was sending undocumented immigrants into the United States:  They re sending people that have lots of problems, and they re bringing those problems with us. They re bringing drugs. They re bringing crime. They re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.Trump made a massive and costly border wall a central part of his presidential campaign and insisted that  Mexico will pay for it.  Mexican leaders have repeatedly said their country will not pay for such a wall. His administration has enforced numerous policies that hurt people from Mexico and South and Central American countries, including ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and routinely separating migrant families at the border.Trump frequently makes off-the-cuff comments, like his  loco  remark, that come across as tone deaf at best and blatantly racist at worst.In January he reportedly described Haiti and African nations as  shithole  countries and slammed the idea of renewing protections for immigrants from those regions.Trump also has a tendency of referring to racial groups as monoliths. I ll take jobs back from China. I ll take jobs back from Japan,  he said during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in 2015.  The Hispanics are going to get those jobs, and they re going to love Trump.  I love the Muslims. I think they re great people,  he said during his campaign regarding whether he would be willing to name a Muslim person to his Cabinet.

The proposal would not completely eliminate MATS, which sets limits on power plant emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants. But it is  designed to put in place the legal justification for the Trump administration to weaken it and several other pollution rules,  and could open the door to a possible full repeal of the regulation, according to The New York Times.Considered by the World Health Organization to be one of the Top 10 chemicals of major public health concern, mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can cause brain damage in young children, among a slew of other negative health effects. High levels of mercury also adversely affect wildlife. Coal-fired power plants are the single largest source of mercury contamination in the United States. If MATS is weakened, it would represent a major win for the coal industry, which has for years pushed for the rule s rollback.As the Post reported, Robert Murray, chief executive of the Murray Energy Corporation, one of the country s largest coal companies, personally requested the repeal of MATS in a letter to Energy Secretary Rick Perry last year. Andrew Wheeler, who was retained for years as a lobbyist for Murray Energy, is the current acting administrator of the EPA. He directed the agency in August to  reconsider  the mercury rule. The Trump administration is making a major move to eliminate regulation of a highly toxic chemical emitted from coal-burning plants   one known to be hazardous to children and fetuses. https://t.co/hfXAL2Vp0YThe new proposal would reportedly reverse a 2011 Obama administration finding that the EPA must take indirect health benefits   known as  co-benefits    into account when evaluating the costs and benefits of toxic pollution regulations.In the case of MATS, for example, the Obama administration estimated that the rule would cost industry $9.6 billion a year   making it one of the most expensive regulations that the EPA had ever issued. The administration argued, however, that the costs were far outweighed by the rule s enormous health benefits.  It found that reducing mercury brings up to $6 million annually in health benefits   a high number, but not as high as the cost to industry,  the Times explained.  However, it further justified the regulation by citing an additional $80 billion in health benefits   in other words,  co-benefits    from the reduction in hazardous soot and nitrogen oxide that occurred as a side effect of limiting mercury emissions. Under the new proposal, the EPA would no longer need to consider such  co-benefits  when determining the net cost of a regulation, the Times reported. If the proposal is approved, therefore, the health benefits of MATS   at least on paper   would no longer outweigh its economic cost, leaving it vulnerable to weakening or even repeal. (Both the Post and the Times noted that Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump s embattled Supreme Court nominee, would likely vote to toss out the rule. Kavanaugh expressed skepticism in an earlier opinion about the benefits of MATS.) Environmental groups and activists have reacted with horror at the news of the proposed rule. Are pro-life evangelicals fine with the Trump administration attacking safeguards against mercury & lead pollution that damages the developing brains & nervous systems of fetuses & children?  John Walke, clean air director of environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, wrote in a Monday Twitter post.  This rollback jeopardizes safeguards, compliance & cost recovery for pollution controls,  he added.9-20-18:  I m an environmentalist.  --@realDonaldTrump One week later: Trump WH receives EPA proposal launching sabotage of Mercury & Air Toxics Standards that avoid 100,000s of asthma attacks in kids, 1,000s of deaths & heart attacks every year. https://t.co/zBVsM9jZXoAre pro-life evangelicals fine with the Trump administration attacking safeguards against mercury & lead pollution that damages the developing brains & nervous systems of fetuses & children? https://t.co/Ndll3HS3mTTrump s @EPA may soon make its next move in rolling back the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards: https://t.co/0wmsWS9qJW.#MATS #StopEPARollbacks pic.twitter.com/1FyqXir9w3Another example of the toxic agenda of @EPA s industry insiders: weakening safety standards that protect us from poisonous #mercury to boost coal company profits. https://t.co/V6DPJIWHvjDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Later that night, President Donald Trump tweeted that the NBC report was incorrect and he had not placed any limits on the investigation. As of this writing Monday morning, NBC was standing by its original story, reporting that the limits placed on the investigation by the White House and Senate Republicans had not changed.So now we ve gone from a sham hearing to a sham investigation where the White House is dictating to the FBI whom they can interview and whom they can t. Is this really what Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) had in mind when he made the deal to support moving Judge Kavanaugh s nomination out of the Judiciary Committee in exchange for reopening the FBI background check? Do Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) really feel comfortable trading their votes for a so-called investigation that ignores one of the accusers and precludes them from asking for records that would verify Christine Blasey Ford s testimony? Shouldn t the FBI, not the White House, be determining the scope of the investigation?Would congressional Republicans accept this kind of watered-down investigation if allegations like these had surfaced about one of President Barack Obama s nominees? Of course not.It wasn t that long ago when Republicans were chomping at the bit to investigate anything and everything. From 2009 to 2013, I was the spokesman or senior adviser for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and any time the duration of an investigation was called into question, we would always say that the political calendar should not dictate the pace of oversight. Looking back at some of the higher-profile investigations we conducted, the last thing anyone could say about our investigations was that they were done in haste.In the spring of 2011, Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in tandem with then-Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), began an investigation into  Operation Fast and Furious.  On June 7, 2017, more than six years later, the committee released its final report on the investigation.In the fall of 2012, Republicans began an investigation into the attack on the U.S. diplomat facility in Benghazi, Libya. The investigation lasted for more than four years, concluding in December of 2016.In 2013, congressional Republicans launched an investigation into the IRS s alleged targeting of conservative groups. The  scandal  would be an ongoing line of attack for Republicans until November of 2017 when the Trump administration declared that prosecuting the matter  would not be appropriate based on the available evidence. Flash-forward to Thursday and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. Yes, the same Chuck Grassley who partnered with us on the oversight committee, was making the case that the reason allegations of sexual assault made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh cannot be thoroughly investigated is because someone else knew about them two months ago.When someone wants to rush an investigation or avoid it altogether, it demands the question, what are they afraid is going to be found?In the few short weeks that have elapsed since Blasey s allegations against Kavanaugh became public, multiple women have come forward with accusations of their own. If Senate Republicans had their way, these women would never have been heard in the first place. Now, they have begrudgingly agreed to a one-week delay to allow the FBI to reopen their background investigation into Kavanaugh, but have expressly limited that investigation to a specific witness list that does not include one of the new accusers, Julie Swetnick, or former classmates who have said Kavanaugh lied during his testimony about his drinking habits.Simply put, it is highly unlikely that such a limited inquiry that is being controlled by the White House is going to produce anything new that sheds light on Kavanaugh s guilt or innocence. Imagine if your child went to the authorities with an accusation of sexual assault and they told you they would conduct a one-week investigation, only talk to people cleared by the accuser s boss and then close the investigation. That s what s happening right now.During the eight years that Barack Obama was president of the United States, Republicans would not shut up about their vigorous pursuits of truth, transparency and accountability. Now, they are bending over backward to rush through the confirmation of a man who is the subject of multiple allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct. Clearly, when it comes to investigative vigilance, Republicans have no intention of holding themselves to the standards they set for the Obama administration. It turns out Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) was right when he said, if  you re looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time  If this were a fair process, concerned about getting at the truth, Trump and his Republican accomplices would waive the arbitrary and entirely political one-week deadline. But they won t. And that tells you everything you need to know about how serious of an investigation this really is.The only question now is whether  swing votes  like Flake, Collins and Murkowski will look the other way as this sham investigation proceeds.Kurt Bardella is the former spokesman and senior adviser for the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee and U.S. Sen.

I ve got boys, and I ve got girls. When I see what s going on right now, it s scary,  President Donald Trump s eldest son said in an interview published Monday.  People who are real victims of these things,  he added, are diminished  when it is so obviously political in cases like this. Trump Jr., who has five children, talked to the outlet alongside girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle during a campaign swing to support Montana Republican U.S. Senate candidate Matt Rosendale.Guilfoyle, a former Fox News co-host and ex-prosecutor, said she supports investigating allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted women when he was in high school and college.  I think it s important, in terms of doing an investigation, to get the facts out there and find out,  said Guilfoyle. It s very tough 35 years later, but it doesn t mean it should be ignored,  she added.  But, people need to be careful to understand the politics involved as well and what motivations people may have. Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, telling how Kavanaugh forced himself on her when they were high school students. She recalled the laughter from Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge that she ll never forget. Two other women   Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick   also have come forward with allegations against Kavanaugh.Trump Jr. attacked Blasey last week in a tweet that questioned her statement that she had anxiety over air travel. Others on Twitter immediately condemned his insensitivity.Republicans have ridiculed the assault claims as part of a Democratic smear campaign, with many senators saying they believe Blasey was assaulted, but not by Kavanaugh.The Judiciary Committee voted on Friday to forward Kavanaugh s nomination to the full Senate, which agreed to give the FBI a week to investigate the allegations before a confirmation vote.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The organization also reported a sharp increase in calls throughout Thursday, the day of Blasey and Kavanaugh s closely watched testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.From Thursday through Sunday, the hotline saw a 338 percent increase in calls. Over the entire month of September, it experienced a 157 percent increase compared to September of last year, receiving 28,509 calls, or an average of about 950 each day.Blasey is one of the three women who has accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexual misconduct. Her emotional testimony compelled many people to speak out about their own sexual assault experiences.During breaks between Thursday s rounds of questioning, C-SPAN received several powerful calls from viewers recounting past incidents of sexual abuse, some of whom said that they had rarely spoken about it before. History shows us that when high-profile allegations such as these are in the news it often causes others to reach out too. This story has clearly resonated with survivors, and has led thousands to reach out for help for the first time,  RAINN President Scott Berkowitz said in a statement.

Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee of Utah, and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina Thursday as each senator questioned Kavanaugh. The Supreme Court nominee was defending himself against a sexual assault accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford, who had testified earlier in the day.The doxxing was immediately picked up by congress-edits, the social media bot that monitors Wiki edits from IP addresses assigned to the Capitol. The information was added  anonymously from the U.S. House of Representatives,  congress-edits said in a tweet that went out to more than 65,000 followers.The right-wing Gateway Pundit posted tweets and other social media messages claiming the IP address responsible for the doxxing was linked to someone in Waters  office.Waters, a notably harsh critic of President Donald Trump, said Capitol Police and her own tech specialist determined that the  IP address in question does not belong to my office or anyone on my staff. Capitol Police did not immediately respond to HuffPost s request to comment on Waters  statement.Waters said false online accusations fingering a member of her staff  compromised  that individual s privacy, identity and safety.

The main topic was the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Judge Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court nomination and the sexual assault allegations against him. But what really stunned Oliver was the fact that so many on the right were willing to support Kavanaugh even if he was guilty because they believed he will help overturn Roe vs Wade and restrict abortion rights.  Oliver summed it up:  It s fine to appoint someone who has committed sexual assault to the Supreme Court as long as they will curtail abortion rights. It s a stance that prioritizes human lives, as long as you think life starts at conception, stops right before a sexual assault and then starts right back up again right after that assault is over.  Oliver played a clip of Kavanaugh getting teary-eyed while testifying about exercising with his high school friends. Yeah. He s crying at the memory of lifting weights at his friend Tobin s house,  Oliver pointed out.  I hate to say it, but I m starting to think that men might be too emotional for the Supreme Court. Oliver also described Kavanaugh as  Trumpian  for citing conspiracy theories that blamed  left-wing opposition groups  and  the Clintons  for the accusations against him.  That is absolutely horrifying,  Oliver said, adding:   It is worth taking a moment now to note the norm that has just been shattered, because I know that we re all basically callous to people talking that way now, but we are supposed to have at least nine people left in America who do not talk that way, and yet Kavanaugh just all but came out and said that he s going to approach his entire tenure as one giant case of  me vs. the fucking libtard cucks.

Lindsey Graham in a biting new portrait in which the actor says the South Carolina Republican s attitude explains why women are afraid to report sexual assault. Last week, Graham aggressively defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from just such allegations, and accused Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee of trying to  destroy this guy s life.  He also declared that anyone who voted against Kavanaugh was  legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics. Carrey s response came in the form of a very unflattering image: Ever wonder why women don t report sexual abuse? Look no further than the hideous and hateful face of Lindsey Graham who offered nothing but anger and absolute disdain to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford following her courageous, and very credible, testimony. Talk about  a disgrace.  pic.twitter.com/PSCNZv2cnpCarrey has been using his artwork to attack President Donald Trump and members of his administration and other politicians, including Graham. Earlier this summer, he blasted the South Carolina senator for  shifting with the political wind when your country desperately needs you  and warned that  in the end it will be as if you never really existed. Earlier this year, Carrey said that his artwork was a way of dealing with current events.

Her hourslong testimony, in which she answered queries from Democratic senators and from Mitchell on behalf of Republicans, was considered widely credible. Democrats have argued that the hearing isn t a criminal trial and that the question isn t whether Kavanaugh can be legally charged, but whether the judge is being honest about his past behavior while under oath. We are here for one reason, to determine whether Judge Kavanaugh should be elevated to one of the most powerful positions in our country,  Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Judiciary Committee s ranking Democrat, said last week.  This is not a trial of Dr. Ford. It s a job interview for Judge Kavanaugh. Is Brett Kavanaugh who we want on the most prestigious court in our country? Is he the best we can do? Mitchell wrote in her memo that her assessment of the hearing focuses strictly on law and  legal context.  She acknowledged that  there is no clear standard of proof for allegations made during the Senate s confirmation process. But the world in which I work is the legal world, not the political world. Thus, I can only provide my assessment of Dr. Ford s allegations in that legal context. In a recent YouGov survey, Americans said, 41 percent to 30 percent, that they believed Blasey was telling the truth; they were split, 35 percent to 38 percent on whether Kavanaugh was similarly honest.Still, Mitchell, an Arizona prosecutor specializing in sex crimes, outlines in her memo what she believes are inconsistencies in Blasey s testimony, according to multiple outlets which obtained the memo.  A  he said, she said  case is incredibly difficult to prove. But this case is even weaker than that,  Mitchell writes in the memo, which the Washington Post and CNN obtained.  Dr. Ford identified other witnesses to the event, and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them. For the reasons discussed below, I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the Committee. Nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. Mitchell argues that Blasey has  not offered a consistent account of when the alleged assault happened ; has  struggled to identify Judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name ; and  has no memory of key details of the night in question. She also wrote that she believes  the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr. Ford s attorneys likely affected Dr. Ford s account. Mitchell s memo   which is addressed to all Republican senators    doesn t analyze Kavanaugh s testimony, during which he denied the allegations against him, attacked the partisans who raised them, and portrayed himself as an aggrieved victim.The memo, news of which first surfaced Sunday night, also comes after the White House formally asked the FBI to reopen its background investigation into Kavanaugh on Friday. Committee Republicans had shocked observers by agreeing in a last-minute move prompted by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) to request a formal investigation into the claims of misconduct.NEW--> in memo to all Senate Rs obtained by WaPo, Rachel Mitchell argues re Ford case:  A  he said, she said  case is incredibly difficult to prove.

During testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, Kavanaugh raised his voice and appeared to tear up as he attempted to fend off allegations of sexual assault and heavy drinking.  I just want to remind everybody that all this yelling and crying happened at this dude s job interview,  Che said during the  Weekend Update  segment.  Typically, when you re asked about a sexual assault and your drinking problem at a job interview, you don t get the damn job. He added:  I don t know if Mr. Kavanaugh actually has a history of assault or if he actually has a drinking problem, but I do know that he might. And you shouldn t be on the Supreme Court if you might. You shouldn t be on the  People s Court  if you might. Later in the segment, Che wondered aloud why the GOP was so insistent on pushing Kavanaugh through.  Why does it have to be him?  Che asked.

Ludington told the New York Times in a statement Sunday that Kavanaugh played down  the degree and frequency  of his drinking to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. He said he often saw Kavanaugh  staggering from alcohol consumption. Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three different women, denied in his testimony that there was any possibility he ever drank so much alcohol that he may have lapses in his memory.Ludington called Kavanaugh s answers about drinking a  blatant mischaracterization  based on his experiences around the judge when they attended Yale University together. Ludington claimed he often saw Kavanaugh  belligerent and aggressive  while drunk.  It is truth that is at stake, and I believe that the ability to speak the truth, even when it does not reflect well upon oneself, is a paramount quality we seek in our nation s most powerful judges,  Ludington said in a statement to the Times. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-10 on Friday to recommend Kavanaugh s Supreme Court nomination advance to a full Senate hearing. Shortly after, the White House agreed to request the FBI to dig into the accusations against Kavanaugh. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) asked that the FBI investigate Kavanaugh s old drinking habits, as well as several other statements by the judge that the senator believes may have been lies. Lying to Congress under oath is a federal crime. On Monday, NBC News reported that the FBI planned to talk with Ludington this week. The FBI declined to comment when asked HuffPost for confirmation.New this morning: @NBCNews has learned that the FBI will be talking to Kavanaugh s former Yale classmate. pic.twitter.com/VU1ThLWHSoLudington s not the only one countering parts of Kavanaugh s testimony. Former Yale classmates Liz Swisher, James Roche and Lynne Brookes have also made public statements about Kavanaugh s excessive drinking during their youth. Swisher told CNN s Chris Cuomo on Friday that though she never saw Kavanaugh be sexually aggressive, the judge was a  sloppy drunk.  There s no problem in drinking beer in college, the problem is lying about it,  Swisher told CNN.  He drank heavily, he was a partier, he liked to do beer bongs, he played drinking games, he was sloppy drunk.  Former Yale classmate of Brett Kavanaugh, Liz Swisher, describes him as  one of the beer drinking boys,  saying she never saw him behave sexually aggressive, but that he was  definitely a sloppy drunk.  https://t.co/9mtEmCp5uJ pic.twitter.com/8ATyawZp7yDr. Christine Blasey Ford, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, claims Kavanaugh forced himself on her at a high school party more than 35 years ago. Blasey testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday that she was certain Kavanaugh was the one to pin her down, force himself on her, attempt to take off her clothes and then hold a hand over her mouth when she tried to scream when they were teenagers. Deborah Ramirez alleges Kavanaugh took off his pants and thrust his penis at her face at Yale party during their freshman year. Julie Swetnick wrote in a sworn declaration that Kavanaugh was present at high school parties where boys engaged in raping girls. Swetnick claims she saw Kavanaugh drink excessively at these parties,  press girls against him without their consent  and attempt to remove or shift their clothing. Kavanaugh has vehemently denied all allegations against him.Roche, a roommate of Kavanaugh s during freshman year, told the New Yorker he found Ramirez s claims to be credible. Roche added that he saw Kavanaugh  frequently, incoherently drunk.  Another unnamed classmate told the New Yorker Kavanaugh could be  aggressive and even belligerent  when he drank. Brookes, who also attended Yale, told CNN Thursday that Kavanaugh was  lying  to the Senate Judiciary Committee about his drinking.  There is no doubt in my mind that while at Yale, he was a big partier, often drank to excess and there had to be a number of nights where he does not remember,  Brookes told CNN. Lynne Brookes, a former classmate of Kavanaugh, alleges he was misleading about the extent of his drinking at Yale.

Given all the special privileges that corporations have enjoyed for so long, it s high time corporate boards include the people who constitute more than half the  persons  in America,  Gov. Jerry Brown wrote in a message when signing the bill into law.The bill, titled SB-826, was introduced by state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara).It requires any corporation based in California to have a minimum of one woman on its board of directors by the end of 2019. By the end of 2021, the bill mandates that number increase to at least two women directors if the corporation has five directors, or to a minimum of three women if the corporation has six or more directors.Jackson thanked Brown in a tweet Sunday, writing  yet another glass ceiling is shattered, and women will finally have a seat at the table in corporate board rooms. Thank you  @JerryBrownGov for signing  #sb826 ! Yet another glass ceiling is shattered, and women will finally have a seat at the table in corporate board rooms. Corporations will be more profitable. This is a giant step forward for women, our businesses and our economy @NAWBOCACalifornia state Sen. Toni Atkins (D-San Diego), who co-authored the bill, echoed Jackson s tweet. The two  authored this bill because it s indeed  high time  corporate boards include women,  Atkins tweeted.THANK YOU @jerrybrowngov for signing #SB826! @SenHannahbeth and I authored this bill because it s indeed  high time  corporate boards include women. https://t.co/sBamdwqNh0.Not everyone was a fan of the measure. The California Chamber of Commerce, and a coalition of about 30 businesses and groups in California, have argued the bill is unconstitutional.  Gender is an important aspect of diversity, as are the other protected classifications recognized under our laws,  the coalition wrote in a letter to the California state Senate in May.  We are concerned that the mandate under SB 826 that focuses only on gender potentially elevates it as a priority over other aspects of diversity. In his signing statement, Brown acknowledged the bill s opponents but explained why he is signing it anyway. There have been numerous objections to this bill and serious legal concerns have been raised,  Brown wrote.  I don t minimize the potential flaws that indeed may prove fatal to its ultimate implementation. Nevertheless, recent events in Washington, D.C.   and beyond   make it crystal clear that many are not getting the message. At the end of the statement, Brown cc d the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, which has been in the spotlight following Thursday s highly charged testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford.Ford has accused the federal appeals court judge of sexually assaulting her when they both high school students. Two other women have come forward with accusations of misconduct against Kavanaugh, all of which he has denied. The committee on Friday voted to advance the nomination of Kavanaugh.A final vote had been expected next week, but Senate GOP leaders agreed to a supplemental FBI investigation into the allegations, lasting up to one week, following a dramatic series of events leading up to the committee vote Friday.Full list of women/family themed bills Brown just signed.

F.B.I. agents are experts at interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow with additional interviews,  wrote Comey, who was fired by President Donald Trump last year.  Unless limited in some way by the Trump administration, they can speak to scores of people in a few days, if necessary. Comey added that FBI agents are far better equipped to handle any investigation than politicians are, as the bureau s agents  have much better nonsense detectors than partisans, because they aren t starting with a conclusion. As for  nonsense,  Comey seemed to be referring to Kavanaugh s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, specifically the nominee s defensive responses to questions about his high school yearbook. Though the book appears to back up claims he was a heavy partier in his youth who would allegedly get blackout drunk , Kavanaugh testified to  enjoying beer but denied ever drinking to the point where he had memory loss. Yes, the alleged incident occurred 36 years ago. But F.B.I. agents know time has very little to do with memory,  Comey wrote.  They know every married person remembers the weather on their wedding day, no matter how long ago. Significance drives memory. They also know that little lies point to bigger lies. They know that obvious lies by the nominee about the meaning of words in a yearbook are a flashing signal to dig deeper. Comey s words follow reports that the White House is limiting the FBI s background investigation of Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, including Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez. The Senate Judiciary Committee had initially declined to ask the White House for an FBI investigation, but Republican leadership relented after several moderate senators demanded one on Friday.Although Comey did not address specific restrictions the White House has reportedly imposed   including limiting which people can be interviewed   he did criticize the seven-day time limit. If truth were the only goal, there would be no clock, and the investigation wouldn t have been sought after the Senate Judiciary Committee already endorsed the nominee,  he said.Read Comey s full op-ed here.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) had high praise for her  Saturday Night Live  doppelganger on Sunday.  SNL  featured a short, but apparently very accurate, impersonation of the Minnesota senator during its Season 44 premiere on Saturday night. The comedy series opened with a re-enactment of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s Thursday testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.Comedian Rachel Dratch replayed Klobuchar s questioning of Kavanaugh, played by Matt Damon, on his drinking habits from high school and whether he ever got  blackout  drunk. Dratch was so spot-on that she earned a shoutout from Klobuchar that night.   You played a good me,  Klobuchar tweeted at Dratch early Sunday.

He has denied the allegations against him, as well as two other sexual misconduct accusations by other women.Klobuchar s line of questioning went viral Thursday after the judge obstinately tried to turn her questions back onto her.

It will never be enough  for them, the president tweeted.Wow! Just starting to hear the Democrats, who are only thinking Obstruct and Delay, are starting to put out the word that the  time  and  scope  of FBI looking into Judge Kavanaugh and witnesses is not enough. Hello! For them, it will never be enough - stay tuned and watch!In appearances on the Sunday talk shows, Democrats maintained the White House cannot limit the scope of the FBI investigation it ordered. GOP leaders reluctantly agreed to request an investigation Friday after a handful of moderates including Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said they wouldn t support Kavanaugh without one.The dramatic move came a day after the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor who alleged the high court nominee assaulted her when they were both teens in high school.Several outlets, including CNN, NBC News and The New York Times, have reported that the probe is being tightly controlled by the White House counsel s office in coordination with Senate Republicans, contrary to Trump s claims on Twitter on Saturday.In other words, despite the president s tweet, nothing has changed. The White House-imposed limits remain. https://t.co/ZQN3Pxr2wtThere are reportedly restrictions on the number of total witnesses federal investigators can interview, as well as on their ability to question Kavanaugh s Yale classmates about his drinking habits. Alcohol plays a role in Blasey s claims about the nominee, as well as the claims of two other women who came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct. They [the White House] cannot say,  Oh, hey, only interview the people in their neighborhood on one side of the street.  Or,  Only interview people from a certain period of their life,   Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said on CBS   Face the Nation.   You let the men and women of the FBI, the professionals, do their jobs. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a centrist Democrat who was instrumental in helping convince Flake to urge for a delay in the confirmation process, argued that severely limiting the list of witnesses whom the FBI is allowed to interview does not represent a serious investigation. If it s a list of 75 witnesses, I d say,  OK, in a week that is a lot.  But if it s list of three, that is an attempt to shut it down and not make this a legitimate background check,  Coons said Saturday at the Global Citizen Festival.After a day of testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Flake, a member of the panel, voted Friday to send Kavanaugh s nomination to the Senate floor. But he bucked his party and called for a probe not lasting longer than a week that will be  short and limited in scope to the current allegations that have been made. The Republican, who plans to support Kavanaugh s nomination if the investigation does not turn up any additional facts, did not explain exactly how limited of an investigation he wanted to see occur. He told reporters it is up to the FBI to determine whether to probe the allegations leveled against Kavanaugh by two other women, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, in addition to Blasey s.The FBI is planning on questioning several key witnesses, including Kavanaugh s high school friend Mark Judge, but not Swetnick herself, according to The New York Times. Swetnick said in a signed declaration released by her attorney Michael Avenatti that Kavanaugh was present at a 1982 party where she was gang raped, but didn t identify Kavanaugh as an assailant. The office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has been heavily involved in the process behind the scenes, suggested in an email to reporters on Sunday it did not view Swetnick s story as credible. Meanwhile, in a separate interview with CNN on Sunday, top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway said that she didn t  think  White House counsel Don McGahn would place limits on the FBI s investigation.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

She expressed concern about the nation s general state of affairs and in particular decried Republicans  handling of sexual assault accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. I watched 11 men who were too chicken to ask a woman a single question,  she said of the GOP members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who relied on outside attorney to question Kavanaugh s alleged victim, Christine Blasey Ford, at a hearing on Thursday.  I watched powerful men helping a powerful man make it to an even more powerful position. Of the president, Warren said,  Let s face it, Donald Trump is taking this country in the wrong direction ... I am worried, down to my bones, about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy. Speculation over a presidential bid by Warren has swirled for some time. Her Saturday remarks were her clearest and most direct on her intentions.Warren, an Oklahoma native, won her Senate seat in 2012 after careers as a law professor and consumer advocate.

And they ultimately got, at least officially, the FBI investigation they were pushing for. They should feel good about these successes.But they also had a big failure: They didn t understand how Republican grandstanding would play on live television.There is only one accurate way to portray what happened in Thursday s hearings. Blasey s testimony was so powerful and believable, and her behavior so respectful, that even President Donald Trump could see it from his alternative mental universe. Even Chris Wallace at Fox News was calling it a  disaster for Republicans. So in desperation, the GOP decided to blow up the entire proceeding. The strategy was to take all focus away from what the nation had just heard. Instead, turn the hearing into a partisan attack on Democrats, throwing anything and everything possible at them in the hopes that something, somehow, sticks.That s why the Republicans suddenly dropped their guest prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell, early on in the questioning of Kavanaugh. And that s why, instead of asking any substantive questions themselves, they turned the hearing into a political circus   led by Lindsey Graham in an unhinged tirade (which many observers saw as his audition to become Trump s next attorney general).Everything about it was nakedly hypocritical and ridiculous, particularly from the party that had blocked Merrick Garland for an entire year. To the Democrats on the committee, who could see the faces of Ford supporters in the room, the GOP s desperation probably seemed so obvious that they assumed Americans would see through it. But when something like this happens on live TV, you have to state the obvious by calling it out.The Democrats didn t. Instead, they continued their attempts to ask questions of Kavanaugh   even though he made clear that he wouldn t answer them, and would just repeat talking points.As actress Alyssa Milano (who was visible in the shot behind Kavanaugh) later told The Hollywood Reporter,  I felt like the Democrats didn t really know how to respond to that rage in a way that was effective and impactful. Exactly. The Democrats let the GOP s performance have its intended effect. Trumpists   who, sadly, comprise the majority of today s historically unrecognizable Republican Party   prize shows of strength above all else, including truth. Graham s grandstanding came straight out of the Trump playbook: Who cares if something is accurate, legitimate or sensible, as long as people who want to believe it are watching?It became one of the most talked-about moments of the day. Suddenly, people who wanted Kavanaugh s nomination to sail through were  energized.  Trump and his team were happy. The lies and hypocrisy worked. Some conservatives declared Graham  won  the hearing. A CNN analysis said it may have even  single-handedly saved  Kavanaugh s nomination.This is the lesson: When a side that is morally and factually in the wrong tries to claim the high ground on live TV, you have to knock them back down right then and there and reclaim it.Democrats should have screamed back, pointing out Graham s insane level of hypocrisy. They should have stated what was happening: They were searching for answers, while Republicans were fighting to prevent that from happening. They should have pointed out the pathetic weakness and misogyny of Republicans hiding behind Mitchell during Blasey s testimony, only to speak up once she left the room. They should have noted that Blasey was surely watching the hearing, and challenged Lindsey Graham to tell Blasey that the entire hearing was really, as he called it,  crap. If, after this, other members of the GOP still continued their charade, the Democrats should have kept fighting back. When Sen. John Cornyn had the audacity to compare the event to the McCarthy hearings, Democrats should have asked the Republicans on the panel whether any of them   with the possible exception of Sen. Jeff Flake   had any decency.Yes, there were procedures in place for who speaks when, and there were supposed to be time limits. But Graham and his compadres threw propriety to the wind. If you have to get reprimanded for interruptions, get reprimanded. Just show the country, and the world, that you are right   and won t take the pummeling.Democrats: Next time a Trumpist lobs a verbal grenade in hopes of blowing up memories of something that just happened, jump right on it. Or, better yet, pick it up and throw it back.Josh Levs is an entrepreneur, former CNN and NPR journalist, and the author of All In: How Our Work-First Culture Fails Dads, Families, and Businesses   And How We Can Fix It Together."

Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) last week.Grassley s letter to the law enforcement officials says that a man, whose name was redacted, contacted Whitehouse on Monday with a claim that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted a female acquaintance of his on a boat in Newport Harbor, Rhode Island, in 1985.The Judiciary Committee later questioned Kavanaugh about the allegations, which he vehemently denied. I was not in Newport, haven t been on a boat in Newport,  Kavanaugh said.  This is just completely made up, or at least not me. I don t know what they re referring to. The man who made the accusation later  recanted his story,  saying he d  made a mistake,  the Providence Journal reported.Grassley said in his letter that the man s actions may have amounted to a crime.  The Committee is grateful to citizens who come forward with relevant information in good faith, even if they are not one hundred percent sure about what they know,  Grassley wrote.  But when individuals provide fabricated allegations to the Committee, diverting Committee resources during time-sensitive investigations, it materially impedes our work. Such acts are not only unfair; they are potentially illegal.  It is illegal to make materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements to Congressional investigators. It is illegal to obstruct Committee investigations,  he continued.Grassley concluded by urging Sessions and Wray to  give this referral the utmost consideration.  President Donald Trump ordered the FBI on Friday to launch an investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, which the judge has denied. Several women   including Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor, and Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh s   have accused the judge of misconduct.Trump s order came on the heels of a surprise call by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) to delay Kavanaugh s final confirmation vote until an FBI probe   one limited in time and scope   is complete.Clarification: A previous headline was unclear about which allegations Grassley was referring to.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) on live television last week, has opened up about her assault   and explained why she chose to share her story with the world.In a poignant Op-Ed published Saturday in USA Today, Archila, who detailed the story of her assault in front of Flake s office on Monday and then directly challenged the senator on Friday in the halls of Congress in a moment captured live on CNN, said her dealings with the lawmaker represented the first times she d ever spoken publicly about the attack on her. I never thought that I would share my story,  wrote Archila, the executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy.  It happened when I was five years old, before I had the consciousness to know exactly what was taking place. Even still, I knew that it was wrong.  I told two adults at the time and they didn t believe me,  Archila, 39, continued.  So I kept this as a secret, too afraid and ashamed to tell my parents. It has been a burden that has weighed on me greatly ever since. Archila said the courage of Christine Blasey Ford, the California professor who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers, had inspired her to tell her own story. Ford told her story to protect our country and, in solidarity with her and as a way to thank her, I decided to tell mine too,  Archila wrote.  I, like thousands of women who have chosen to do the same, are doing this in the hopes that when the senators hear our stories, they will not only believe us, but most importantly, they will use their power to help heal our country, and not further reinforce the culture that condones sexual violence by ignoring survivors. On Friday, Archila and 23-year-old Maria Gallagher, also a survivor of sexual assault, challenged an ashen-faced Flake as he entered an elevator.  What you are doing is allowing someone who actually violated a woman to sit on the Supreme Court,  Archila lambasted the senator.  This is not tolerable. You have children in your family. Think about them.  Look at me when I m talking to you. You re telling me that my assault doesn t matter! : Protesters confront Sen. Jeff Flake moments after he announces he will vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh. https://t.co/Cc5y9kura1 pic.twitter.com/qqvz3jx8JFFlake had earlier announced his intention as a Senate Judiciary Committee member to vote to confirm Kavanaugh, despite the allegations against him. Flake followed through with that vote, but he also made a surprise call   approved by the White House   for a one-week delay on the Senate floor vote to confirm the judge so an FBI investigation into the accusations could first take place.In her opinion piece, Archila suggested her story, as well as that of other survivors of sexual violence, may have played a role in shifting Flake s perspective.  His reaction shows the power that we have, together, when we chose to tell our stories and stand up for our vision of an inclusive society,  she wrote.  When we take action, we breathe new life and possibility into our democracy. So much love to all the 1000s of people who are changing the course of history with their protests, stories, & courage.

I don t know if there was any one thing, but I was just unsettled,  he told the outlet.  You know, when I got back to the committee, I saw the food fight again between the parties   the Democrats saying they re going to walk out, the Republicans blaming everything on the Democrats.  We can t just have the committee acting like this,  he continued.  The majority and minority parties and their staffs just don t work well together. There s no trust ... It s just falling apart. Quizzed specifically about his encounter with Archila and Gallagher, Flake said the two women may have been motivated by a political agenda when they approached him   an  agenda ... different than mine.  I think some of their concern was how Kavanaugh would rule on the court. They may have been there prior to the allegations against him because of his position on some issues,  he said.Flake added, however, that it had still been a  poignant  moment for him.  It certainly struck a chord,  he said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) says he s going to call for an investigation to determine whether anyone on the staff of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) was involved in outing Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. That s illegal, inappropriate,  Graham, one of Kavanaugh s biggest allies in the Senate, said Sunday on ABC s  This Week.   The FBI will do a supplemental background investigation [of the Kavanaugh allegations] then I m going to call for an investigation of what happened in this committee   who betrayed Dr. Ford s trust. Blasey had requested confidentiality when she contacted Feinstein s office in July to tell the senator her allegation that Kavanaugh assaulted Blasey when they were in high school   which Kavanaugh has denied. However, she ultimately came forward this month in an article published by The Washington Post and testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday in an extraordinary hearing.Feinstein, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, denied during the hearing that she had leaked Blasey s story to the press earlier this month, explaining that she had honored the psychology professor s request for confidentiality.Graham, however, said without citing evidence that he believed  somebody in her office  was the culprit. Blasey has said she decided to go public after reporters began contacting her and her associates, but it is not currently clear where they got her name. All I can tell you is it came from somebody with a political motive.   No friend would do this to Dr. Ford,  Graham said, lamenting the  despicable  confirmation process for Kavanaugh. Sen. Lindsey Graham tells @GStephanopoulos he s going to call for an investigation into  a despicable process,  including  who in Feinstein s office  referred Christine Blasey Ford to her attorney Debra Katz and  who betrayed Dr. Ford s trust  https://t.co/plKvncoC3D #ThisWeek pic.twitter.com/cR1ZLelPQFThe Judiciary Committee on Friday voted to advance Kavanaugh s nomination to the floor after Senate GOP leaders reluctantly agreed to requests from several moderate senators   including Jeff Flake of Arizona   to open a limited supplemental FBI investigation into the allegations, lasting up to one week.A report published by NBC News, however, caused a stir on Saturday when it noted the FBI will specifically not be able to question Kavanaugh s Yale classmates about his drinking habits, even though alcohol plays a role in Blasey s claims about the nominee, as well as the claims of two other women who came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct.President Donald Trump on Saturday pushed back on reports that the White House had ordered the FBI to limit the scope of the investigation, including the number of alleged witnesses, writing in a tweet that  I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion. In his interview on ABC, meanwhile, Graham suggested that he saw no need for the FBI to interview Kavanaugh s classmates about his alleged drinking habits. He s had six FBI background checks. ...

I feel very empathetic, frankly, for victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment and rape,  Conway said on CNN s  State Of The Union.  Becoming visibly emotional, she told host Jake Tapper:  I m a victim of sexual assault. She offered no details on the assault, but said,  I don t expect Judge Kavanuagh or Jake Tapper or [Arizona GOP Sen.] Jeff Flake or anybody to be held responsible for that. You have to be responsible for your own conduct. .@KellyannePolls to @jaketapper:  I m a victim of sexual assault.  #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/ZQcmnFIicQTapper said,  This is the first time I ve ever heard you talk about something personal like that, and I m really sorry.  Well, I ve just had it,  Conway replied.Her disclosure follows Thursday s highly charged testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused the federal appeals court judge of sexually assaulting her when they both high school students.Blasey alleges Kavanaugh pinned her down, groped her and attempted to remove her clothes during a small gathering in suburban Maryland in the early 1980s. In his defiant   and, at times, weepy   testimony, Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations.Last week, two additional women   Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick   also accused him of sexual misconduct in the early 1980s. Ramirez alleges Kavanaugh thrust his penis into her face at a dormitory party when they were both freshmen at Yale University. Swetnick alleges she witnessed Kavanaugh and one of his friends at several high school parties getting  drunk  and  being overly aggressive with girls. Kavanaugh has denied ever sexually assaulting anyone.Conway during her CNN appearance downplayed the allegations, saying they didn t compare to the sexual misconduct allegations faced by comedian Bill Cosby, who earlier this year was convicted of aggravated indecent assault, or former President Bill Clinton. Let s just be honest what this is about,  Conway said of the Kavanaugh controversy.  It s raw partisan politics. .@KellyannePolls:  Let s not always bring Trump in everything that happens in this universe.  #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/UzSs2dwpnCTapper, acknowledging Conway s emotional revelation, questioned her about the more than 20 accusations of sexual misconduct against President Donald Trump. You work for a president who says all the women who accuse him are lying,  Tapper said.  As a survivor of this   and again I m deeply, personally very sorry about whatever pain you ve gone through   but does that not make you think when you hear somebody like [Ford] or other people make allegations, does that not make you think, these women need to be heard and even if there are not corroborating witnesses ... absence of evidence is not evidence of absence? Conway pushed back on Tapper s mention of the president, saying  don t conflate  the accusations against him  with what happened to me  and  let s not always bring Trump into everything. She also claimed sexual assault allegations have been viewed differently by the public based on the victims  or perpetrators  political leanings. Jake, they should all be heard, and they should be heard in courts of law,  Conway said.  They should be heard in depositions. They should be heard in proceedings. Those who can prosecute, those who have civil and/or criminal causes of action, should pursue that.  But we do treat people differently who are either the victims or the perpetrators of this based on their politics now and based on their gender,  she added.  That is a huge mistake.

I m a conservative. He s a conservative. I plan to support him unless they turn up something   and they might,  said Flake. He added that he was particularly interested in hearing more from a high school friend of Kavanaugh s who has agreed to cooperate with the FBI probe.That friend, Mark Judge,  sticks out because he was mentioned so much by Dr. Ford, and he might be able to shed some light on her recollection of time and events,  Flake said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford, the California professor who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about her alleged assault by Kavanaugh when they were teenagers.

When asked by The Atlantic about his decision to call for the delay, Flake, one of a handful of swing votes on Kavanaugh s nomination, said that he d been feeling  unsettled  about how the judge s confirmation process had been playing out, especially the partisanship that appeared to be wrenching the Senate  apart at the seams.

There are now multiple people who knew him well who say he was a much more reckless drinker than he claimed.There is one date on his calendar, July 1, that increasingly looks as if it could be the date of the infamous party that Christine Blasey Ford described. The FBI will explore all of this, and more.As McConnell and the Republicans get a clearer sense of just whom the FBI will be talking to and what will come out, the following is their nightmare scenario:More and more credible sources will make a liar out of Kavanaugh. When the FBI reports back in a week, there will be allegations that the Senate Judiciary Committee will have to pursue, burning more time.Kavanaugh will have to be called back to testify, both about the new allegations and his previous evasions. For the committee to do less would be to risk losing the votes of Republican Sens. Jeff Flake, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. But the FBI findings, once reported, could also cost Kavanaugh their votes on the merits   and his confirmation.At that point, another two weeks will have gone by, Kavanaugh could be utterly humiliated and possibly vulnerable to a charge of perjury. It will be that much harder to get another nominee vetted and confirmed two weeks closer to the election. So Trump and McConnell could lose not only Kavanaugh personally, but the court seat.Trump and McConnell are nothing if not opportunists. They have no personal loyalty to Kavanaugh. Trump is famous for firing people when they outlive their usefulness. McConnell takes situational ethics to a new low.So Trump and McConnell will surely consider the risks and benefits of standing by Kavanaugh, and the odds of his prevailing. Those odds are worsening.There is a fair chance that early this week, Kavanaugh will be asked to fall on his sword. You know the routine.  I have decided to spare my family and our country further ordeal and embarrassment, and blah, blah, blah. That way the FBI investigation is short-circuited and the subject is changed. The spectacle of Republican men defending a likely sexual assaulter against a highly credible woman goes away. Trump and McConnell get to fast-track another nomination, preferably female, such as the ultraconservative Amy Coney Barrett, who was appointed last year to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The court seat is saved, the optics on women shift, while the ferocious white male base is furious at Kavanaugh s treatment and turns out to vote in November.As McConnell and Trump take a close look at the risks and alternatives, dumping Kavanaugh has to be very tempting. As for Kavanaugh himself, even withdrawing may not spare him further trouble in the investigation of what actually occurred at that fateful party. He could be the subject of further inquiry by the House or Senate, or by Maryland prosecutors.One more item. At Thursday afternoon s hearing, Kavanaugh s ferocity caught the committee Democrats off guard. In playing the outraged, innocent alpha male, he intimidated the decorous Democrats in fine Trumpian fashion. But if the Democrats get another shot at him, they will be better armed and better prepared. Expect an opening statement something like this:Judge Kavanaugh, last week you told us that these hearings were a partisan ambush, a deliberate withholding of material until the eleventh hour. You knew that was a lie. You knew that Dr. Blasey Ford agonized for several weeks over whether to come forward, and your bullying performance was evidence of why she was right to be wary. You also dissembled, to put it charitably, about several aspects of your prior life and behavior. We now have several credible sources, who told the FBI under oath of your dishonesty.Several of your answers were carefully crafted to avoid admitting you were ever drunk enough at social events in high school to black out, which would in turn admit that if something like what Dr. Blasey Ford described occurred, you just might be the one with the faulty memory. This dissembling was calculated to allow you to deny that the assault happened, while barely skirting the risk of perjury.One of you lied to this committee and to America. To put it bluntly, the accumulating evidence suggests that the liar is you. All the bullying in the world will not convince us otherwise. And the more you try to bully, the more you display the character and temperament consistent with the attack that Dr. Blasey Ford described   and inconsistent with a Supreme Court justice.Judge Kavanaugh, you feign outrage that your confirmation was delayed a couple weeks so that we could find out the truth. You sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit with Judge Merrick Garland. When he was nominated to the Supreme Court, Judge Garland had no charges of misconduct against him. He was not only delayed eight months, he was not granted a hearing at all. So kindly spare us the self-righteous indignation.I yield back the balance of my time.There is no honor among thieves. Contemplating the potential damage of letting this show continue, Trump and McConnell have to be weighing whether to throw Kavanaugh overboard.Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and a professor at Brandeis University s Heller School.

Let me tell you this: I m gonna start at an 11,  Damon shouts.  I m gonna take it up to about a 15 REAL QUICK! He said he practiced his comments to the committee by  screaming into an empty bag of Doritos.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT.) has called on Judiciary Committee head Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to direct the FBI to determine if Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was truthful under oath in his testimony before the panel. Lying to Congress is a federal crime,  Sanders noted in a tweet that included a copy of a letter he sent to Grassley on Friday.  Kavanaugh s truthfulness with the Senate goes to the very heart of whether he should be confirmed to the court. A determination of perjury in any statement in Kavanaugh s testimony would threaten his confirmation.The FBI was given a week to investigate allegations against Kavanaugh as part of a deal forged Friday by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and committee Republicans. In order for the FBI investigation regarding Judge Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to be complete, it is imperative the bureau must not only look into the accusations made by Dr. [Christine Blasey] Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, it should also examine the veracity of his testimony before the Judiciary Committee,  Sanders wrote.Lying to Congress is a federal crime.The FBI must examine the veracity of Kavanaugh s statements under oath in addition to the sexual assault allegations against him. Kavanaugh s truthfulness with the Senate goes to the very heart of whether he should be confirmed to the court. pic.twitter.com/TsNOTm4fxKSeveral statements that Kavanaugh made Thursday were challenged after he defended himself under oath against Blasey s accusation that he sexually assaulted her. She testified that he pinned her to a bed, tried to remove her clothing and placed his hand over her mouth when she tried to yell at a house party when they were both in high school.Kavanaugh testified three times Thursday that Blasey s friend Leland Keyser  refuted  Blasey s claim  under penalty of felony.  While Keyser doesn t recall the party where the attack allegedly occurred, she did  not refute Dr. Ford s account, and ... she believes Dr. Ford s account,  her attorney wrote in a letter sent Friday to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Kavanaugh s Yale classmates have contradicted his characterization of his drinking in high school and college as moderate and that he never blacked out. Classmates said he was a heavy drinker and sometimes a belligerent, drunk. Blasey said that both Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, who she said was in the room when the alleged assault against her occurred, were  stumbling drunk. Judge has written in his memoir, Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk, that he and his friends were determined to drink 100 kegs of beer their senior year at Georgetown prep. Kavanaugh s bio in the senior yearbook notes that he was a member of the  Keg City Club (treasurer)   100 Kegs or Bust. Kavanaugh also testified that it was legal to drink as a senior when he attended Georgetown Prep, which is located in suburban Maryland. It wasn t. The drinking age in Maryland was raised from 18 to 21 in 1982 when Kavanaugh was 17.Kavanaugh repeatedly told the committee he never drank to the point where he didn t remember something. He also denied ever becoming aggressive when he drinks. There have been many reports from Kavanaugh s high school, college and law school classmates that contradict this. (7/x)Kavanaugh also denied being in the same  social circles  as Blasey, indicating it was unlikely they d be at the same party. Yet his calendar marks several get-togethers with a friend nicknamed  Squi    whom Kavanaugh identified as Chris Garett   who was going out with Ford at the time, she testified.Kavanaugh also testified he  never attended a gathering like the one  described by Blasey, but his own calendar and Judge appear to contradict that.Kavanaugh claimed that he and Dr. Ford  did not travel in the same social circles.  Dr. Ford said she dated Chris Garrett, referenced as a friend in his yearbook. In fact she testified Garrett introduced her to Kavanaugh. (9/x)Kavanaugh claimed he didn t drink on weeknights but an entry on his calendar for Thursday July 1 states,  Go to Timmy s for Skis w/ Judge, Tom, Pj, Bernie, Squi.  Kavanaugh clarified to Sen. Booker that  Skis  referred to beer. Was Kavanaugh s original statement truthful? (10/10) pic.twitter.com/vu8YWoxHycKavanaugh s insistence that words he used in his bio in his senior yearbook    boofing,   Devil s Triangle,  and  Renate Alumnius  were relatively innocent have been widely contradicted. While he said Devil s Triangle was a drinking game, for example, it s also used as a term for a sexual threesome....Is it perjury if you lie about the meanings of #Boof and #DevilsTriangle under oath? Asking for a Supreme Court nominee. #KavanaughFordSanders also lists several questionable statements under oath by Kavanaugh during his initial confirmation hearings earlier this month.It s unclear how much freedom the FBI will have in its investigation to determine Kavanaugh s veracity under oath.NBC reported Saturday that the bureau has been given a specific list of witnesses that can be questioned, and that contradictory information about his drinking at Yale will not be probed, according to sources. Agents will also not be allowed to investigate claims by Julie Swetnick, who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct at parties during high school, NBC reported.But President Donald Trump insisted Saturday that the FBI has  free rein  to follow any leads.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The agency, however, will reportedly leave Kavanaugh s third accuser alone upon request from the White House.According to reports from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal also out Saturday, White House has put tight limits on the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh s alleged misconduct. The constraints mean that authorities may not be able to interview all available leads, the outlets reported. According to NBC, the FBI will specifically not be able to question Kavanaugh s Yale classmates about his drinking habits, even though alcohol plays a role in all three accusers  claims about the nominee, who denies ever drinking to the point of not remembering certain events. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) lashed out at the possibility that constraints had been placed on the investigation, saying that the FBI s hands  must not be tied ... we need the facts. The FBI s hands must not be tied in this investigation. We need the facts. https://t.co/GR7TFhDG9kTrump tweeted late Saturday night that he was not limiting the FBI in its investigation and that NBC News had got the story wrong.NBC News incorrectly reported (as usual) that I was limiting the FBI investigation of Judge Kavanaugh, and witnesses, only to certain people. Actually, I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion. Please correct your reporting!The FBI wasted little time reaching out to Deborah Ramirez, who surfaced as the second women accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. She says Kavanaugh thrust his exposed penis in her face at a Yale University party in the 1980s. Her lawyer confirmed the agency already contacted Ramirez for an interview and that she intends to cooperate, but offered no further comment.Ramirez came forward after Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused the nominee of sexually assaulting her at a high school party in 1982.The third accuser, Julie Swetnick, says she saw Kavanaugh and friend Mark Judge at high school parties where girls were raped by multiple teenage boys, but stopped short of explicitly accusing Kavanaugh of doing so himself. Judge also appeared in Blasey s story as the sole witness to her assault. Blasey says she managed to escape the alleged attack by Kavanaugh after Judge jumped on top of the two of them.A lawyer for Judge indicated his client also plans to cooperate with the FBI.Trump told reporters on Saturday that the agency has  free rein  to do  whatever they have to do, whatever it is they do.  They ll be doing things that we have never even thought of,  Trump said.  And hopefully at the conclusion everything will be fine. The White House formally asked the FBI to reopen its background investigation into Kavanaugh on Friday, one day after Blasey detailed her claims before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Earlier Friday, committee Republicans had shocked observers by agreeing in a last-minute move prompted by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) to request a formal investigation into the claims of misconduct.This article has been updated with tweets from Sen.

Speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Saturday, Pelosi said Kavanaugh is unfit to be on the Supreme Court. I couldn t help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say  hysterical,   Pelosi said about Thursday s emotional testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.During the hearing, Blasey recounted the night she says Kavanaugh pinned her on a bed, covered her mouth with his hand, and attempted to forcibly remove her clothing at a gathering in high school. In his own testimony, Kavanaugh forcefully declared his innocence, at times yelling, crying and interrupting senators.The judge called the allegations a  gross character assassination  conceived by Democratic lawmakers and fueled by  revenge on behalf of  Bill and Hillary Clinton. I think that he disqualifies himself with those statements and the manner in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats,  Pelosi told interviewer Alex Wagner. She added that  if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he s not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he s on right now.  An FBI investigation into the allegations was opened Friday. Kavanaugh has also been credibly accused of sexual misconduct by two other women.

We found a country deeply divided in their reactions to the hearings.  YouGov s Douglas Rivers and Joe Williams wrote Saturday.  The largest group believed Ford was telling the truth and Kavanaugh was not. A smaller, but still substantial group, believed the opposite. Hardly anyone believed both were telling the truth. Where you came out depended mostly on where you came in. Americans said, 41 to 30 percent, that they believed Ford was telling the truth; they were split, 35 percent to 38 percent on whether Kavanaugh was similarly honest. (Those who reported having personally watched at least some of the hearings   a majority of the country   said, 52 to 36, that they believed Blasey. They were split 44 to 46 on whether they believed Kavanaugh.) Results were deeply divided along partisan lines: Seventy-three percent of Democrats, and just 14 percent of Republicans, believed Blasey was telling the truth; 74 percent of Republicans, and just 11 percent of Democrats, believed Kavanaugh. Even controlling for partisanship, there were some modest differences between men and women s reactions   69 percent of Republican men said they felt Blasey was not telling the truth, compared to 59 percent of Republican women who said the same.Because YouGov s surveys are conducted using an online panel, the pollsters were able to compare respondents  latest opinions against what they d actually said prior to the hearings. More than 1,000 of those surveyed in the most recent poll were also interviewed for an earlier Economist poll taken after the allegations broke. Of those, 80 percent hadn t changed their minds on whether or not Kavanaugh should be confirmed. The rest hadn t shifted one particular way, either   15 percent of those who d supported him said they were now opposed or undecided, but 16 percent of those who d opposed him said they were now unsure or supportive. The formerly undecided who came off the fence also split about evenly, according to YouGov, leading to  almost no net movement in one direction or the other. The survey s results offer an initial sense of public reaction in the immediate aftermath of the hearings. Sentiments could easily change in the week to come, as the FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh unfolds, and news coverage of the story continues. It also remains to be seen what other surveys will show. Prior to the hearings, for instance, initial HuffPost/YouGov polling showed Kavanaugh s ratings to be relatively stable in comparison to the drop measured by several other polls. And although polling by several outlets last week consistently found opposition to Kavanaugh s nomination outstripping support, the exact size of that gap varied.But the results suggest that so far, Kavanaugh s opponents may be especially mobilized by the issue. Sixty-five percent of voters who don t want him confirmed, the survey finds, say the Supreme Court will be very important to deciding their vote in this year s midterms, compared to 50 percent of those who support his confirmation   a gap that s especially notable because, in the past, Republicans have often been substantially likelier than Democrats to prioritize Supreme Court appointments.The YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 27-28 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.

This is despite public opinion polls prior to the hearing showing a plurality of Americans disapproved of Kavanaugh s confirmation. If Republicans confirm him regardless, the question now turns to how they may be punished for it in the midterms. Whether or not they are depends partly on whether support for Kavanaugh is motivated by partisanship or whether other factors are involved that may cause voters to abandon the GOP.Analysis from my think tank, Data for Progress, suggests they should be worried. In a poll last week (conducted entirely after Christine Blasey Ford s allegations had been made public but prior to Friday s hearings), we found support for Kavanaugh was heavily concentrated among people, regardless of party preference, who deny the reality of sexism and oppose policies to reduce sexism.In that poll, we asked whether respondents supported confirming Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In addition, we included a series of questions that measure sexist attitudes and support for policies to reduce sexual assault. This included a specific battery of questions designed to identify views that are referred to as  hostile sexism  in the literature. Academics distinguish hostile sexism, which involves the objectification of women and expressions of inferiority, in contrast to benevolent sexism, which suggests in a paternalistic way that women are better at things (such as being more empathetic). Respondents were asked if they agreed with the following statements:Many women are actually seeking special favors, such as hiring policies that favor them over men, under the guise of asking for equality. Most women interpret innocent remarks or acts as being sexist. Feminists are not seeking for women to have more power than men.Feminists are making entirely reasonable demands of men.We then used those answers to generate a sexism score for each respondent. In addition, we asked respondents several questions about their support for certain specific policies designed to reduce sexual harassment and assault:Currently, when companies fire executives who engage in sexual harassment in the workplace, those executives receive large severance packages. Should Congress pass a law that would allow men (or women) who are found guilty of sexual harassment in the workplace to be fired without severance?Would you support or oppose government requiring sex and consent education in high schools to prevent sexual assault and harassment?Would you support or oppose empowering the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to levy fines against companies with high levels of sexual harassment?Working with Data for Progress co-founder Jon Green and Data for Progress Senior Adviser Meredith Conroy, I found that   controlling for education, age, race, party preference and income   a respondent s sexism score strongly predicted whether or not they supported Kavanaugh s confirmation. The chart below shows that regardless of a respondent s party preference on the Generic Congressional Ballot (GCB), support for Kavanaugh was strongly associated with sexism.This second chart below shows that, similarly, support for Kavanaugh correlates across party preference with those who oppose policies to curb sexual assault.Surveys prior to Friday s hearing consistently showed that support for Kavanaugh was much lower among women than among men, and support for him has polarized across gender. It s also not just public opinion: Data provided to Data for Progress from Be A Hero s Crowdpac campaign suggests women make up a disproportionate share of the donors to fund Sen. Susan Collins  opponent should Collins vote for Kavanaugh.  We re calling on Collins to do one simple thing: believe survivors. If she refuses, we ll make sure there s a candidate who does in 2020 and will fund them to the tune of $2,000,000,  said Marie Follayttar, executive director of Mainers for Accountable Leadership, which partnered with Maine People s Alliance to build the strategy.On the other hand, support for Kavanaugh has mostly come from people who have vehemently dismissed the realities of sexism. At National Review, which has turned itself into a veritable war room dedicated to smearing Kavanaugh s accusers, Dennis Prager wrote that the accusations against Kavanaugh should be ignored, regardless of their truth. Prager had previously written a defense of spousal rape, called  When a Woman Isn t In the Mood: Part 1,  which includes the following:  It is an axiom of contemporary marital life that if a wife is not in the mood, she need not have sex with her husband. Here are some arguments why a woman who loves her husband might want to rethink this axiom.  In Part 2, he presented  eight reasons for a woman not to allow not being in the mood for sex to determine whether she denies her husband sex.  Needless to say, I suspect that Prager (who supports Kavanaugh s nomination) would also score quite high on our hostile sexism battery.Analyzing the Voter Study Group, most Americans reject the ideas that make up the hostile sexism battery. For instance, only 1 in 3 respondents believe that  women who complain about harassment often cause more problems than they solve  and only 1 in 5 believe that  women should return to their traditional roles.  Additionally, according to recent polling, strong majorities of Americans believe that discrimination often costs women jobs and fewer than 1 in 5 believe that workplace harassment  is no longer a problem. For years, progressives have wondered how Republicans have managed to float above public opinion, supporting unpopular laws and now the most unpopular nominee in Supreme Court history. That may now change. The 2016 presidential election saw the largest gender gap in modern American history. With the gender gap in the 2018 midterms already poised to be even greater, the Republican Party s commitment to attacking Blasey and Kavanaugh s other accusers is only likely to further drive a wedge between the parties on gender.In confirming Kavanaugh, Republicans would be making a large bet that further polarization won t hurt their electoral fortunes. I bet they re wrong.Sean McElwee is a writer and researcher based in New York City and a co-founder of Data for Progress. He tweets at @SeanMcElwee."

The standard for such an appointment should be high, and the burden is on the nominee,  the board s resolution stated.  That burden is not met as long as there are unresolved questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assault.  ACLU President Susan Herman clarified that the organization is nonpartisan and does not oppose Kavanaugh based on how he might vote on the Supreme Court. We oppose him in light of the credible allegations of sexual assault against him,  Herman reiterated.Blasey testified Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh locked her in a room and sexually assaulted her in 1982. The judge responded to the accusation directly afterward with an angry, emotionally charged statement that said Senate Democrats  destroyed  his reputation and his family.Blasey s testimony, Kavanaugh s response, subsequent allegations by other women and the  inadequate  investigation into the nominee s past behavior all led the board of directors to doubt Kavanaugh s fitness to serve on the nation s highest court, the board said.While the ACLU frequently comments on politics, it said Saturday s announcement marks only the fourth time in its 98-year history that its board has voted to oppose a Supreme Court nominee. It did not endorse or oppose then-nominee Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Upon Kavanaugh s nomination in July, the ACLU released a statement warning that the judge could help President Donald Trump  undermine civil liberties and civil rights.  It s incumbent on Congress to determine whether Kavanaugh s legal views are compatible with the powerful role he will play for generations,  Legal Director David Cole said at the time.America Magazine, a Jesuit publication, rescinded its endorsement of Kavanaugh after Blasey s testimony. (Kavanaugh s high school, Georgetown Prep, is a Jesuit establishment.)Senate Republicans made the startling decision Friday to agree to a one-week delay on Kavanaugh s confirmation vote pending further FBI investigation of his past. The American Bar Association and Yale Law School, which Kavanaugh attended, had joined Democrats  calls for the FBI investigation earlier in the week."

Justice Kavanaugh, your life and family are not ruined,  Fred Guttenberg tweeted on Thursday following testimony from Kavanaugh, who has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct.  Try having a child murdered by a weapon that you refer to as  common use.  You will get through this and hug both of your children tonight. He added in a follow-up tweet that Kavanaugh has made himself out to be a victim, but is ultimately just a  bad person.  Judge Kavanaugh, I listened to you talk of your life being ruined.  It is not. I listened to you turn yourself into a victim. You are not. What today showed is that you clearly are a partisan and do not have the temperament for the court.  Even worse, you are just a bad person.Guttenberg is a gun control activist whose daughter, 14-year-old Jaime, was killed in the February school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.On Thursday, following emotional testimony from Christine Blasey Ford where she detailed her sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, the judge gave his own testimony in which he yelled, cried and interrupted senators attempting to ask him questions about the alleged misconduct. My family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed by vicious and false additional accusations,  Kavanaugh said in his opening statement, adding that he believes Blasey s claim has been used as a  calculated and orchestrated political hit  designed to keep him off the Supreme Court.Blasey has accused Kavanaugh of pinning her to a bed, covering her mouth with his hand and attempting to forcibly remove her clothing while they were at a gathering in high school. The FBI is now looking into the claim.Guttenberg attended Kavanaugh s confirmation hearing earlier this month, which became highly publicized after the father attempted to shake the judge s hand and speak to him about gun violence only to be flatly ignored. I m the father of Jaime Guttenberg, who was murdered in Parkland,  Guttenberg told Kavanaugh.Kavanaugh turned his back on Guttenberg and walked away. When he started walking away, it was after my introduction. I was saying to him,  I just want to talk to you about what happened to my daughter in Parkland,   Guttenberg told HuffPost at the time.  I think I said it twice, but he moved past. He got to a certain point, I put up my hand and waved and said,  Have a good day.  Guttenberg was later detained and questioned by Capitol police. He insisted to HuffPost that immediately prior to his detainment, Kavanaugh turned to him and winked.  I don t hold grudges   that s not who I am,  Guttenberg said of the incident.  My goal is to find common ground. I absolutely would meet with him, I would be happy to. No grudges. If there s a chance for us to talk, father to father, it would be my honor to do it. Kavanaugh is also accused of exposing himself to Deborah Ramirez while the two were in college and thrusting his penis in her face. And Julie Swetnick said she was the  victim of one of these  gang  or  train  rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present  at a party in approximately 1982.

Ms. Keyser does not refute Dr. Ford s account, and she has already told the press that she believes Dr. Ford s account,  the attorney, Howard Walsh, wrote in the letter sent late Friday. Kavanaugh and Republicans have repeatedly attempted to use a prior statement from Keyser in their defense against Blasey s allegation. Blasey, now a psychology professor, told the Senate committee this week she is  100 percent  certain it was Kavanaugh who pinned her to a bed at a high school party in what she believed was an attempt to rape her. Although Keyser believes her friend, Walsh said  the simple and unchangeable truth  is that his client is  unable to corroborate  Blasey s account because she does not remember it. The letter clarifies an initial statement from Keyser that did not comment on the veracity of Blasey s story.  Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford,  her attorney initially said.Keyser also told The Washington Post separately that she believed her friend. But that didn t stop her original comment from being distorted by Republican senators and their Supreme Court nominee. Kavanaugh said three times in an angry opening statement that Keyser had  refuted  Blasey s claim.  Ms. Keyser said under penalty of felony she does not know me, does not recall ever being at a party with me ever, and my two male friends who were allegedly there, who knew me well, have told this committee under penalty of felony that they do not recall any such party and that I never did or would do anything like this,  he said. Later, Kavanaugh urged the committee to  listen to Ms. Keyser. New: Here s the letter from Leland Keyser s lawyer to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Keyser says she will cooperate with the FBI, but has no recollection of the incident in question and thus can t corroborate Ford s acct, though she says she believes Ford. pic.twitter.com/oApw9YKcdJSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also used Keyser s statement to support Kavanaugh. Blasey acknowledged her friend s statement during her Thursday testimony before the committee, saying she did not expect Keyser or anyone else allegedly present to recall the event.  Nothing remarkable happened to them. They were downstairs,  Blasey said, adding that she did not tell Keyser about the assault at the time. Keyser wishes  to cooperate fully  with the supplemental FBI investigation into Kavanaugh the committee agreed upon at the eleventh hour, and which President Donald Trump formally requested on Friday.Mark Judge, the only other witness to the alleged assault, according to Blasey, has also signaled a willingness to cooperate.

She had what her husband felt was an odd request: She very much wanted a second front door. They discussed it in couples counseling and it was then that she first described in detail what had happened to her in the early 1980s.On Thursday, during Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Blasey recounted the same story for the entire world, detailing the trauma that s haunted her for three decades and had her advocating for more escape routes in her own house.You ve heard the story by now. Brett Kavanaugh   who is one final Senate floor vote from being Justice Brett Kavanaugh of the United States Supreme Court   pinned her down, Blasey says, groped her, tried to remove her clothes and covered her mouth when she tried to scream. It was hard for me to breathe,  she said in her opening statement,  and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me. Both Brett and Mark [Judge, Kavanaugh s high school friend] were drunkenly laughing during the attack. They both seemed to be having a good time. Blasey went into that hearing knowing GOP senators probably wouldn t care what she said, that they d hired a woman to interview her instead of speaking to her themselves, and that she would face a prosecutor while under oath. But she did it anyway. I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified,  she said.  I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school. Blasey s testimony might not stop Kavanaugh from being confirmed to the Supreme Court. But as Mariame Kaba, an organizer and educator and one of the smartest people I know, put it on Twitter, arguing that Blasey s actions won t matter is  insulting,  because she  rightfully knows that she s not in control of what these GOP ghouls do in the end. She s putting her experience in the mix. That s courage. And Blasey s courage will have long-lasting effects. We know this because we ve seen it before when courageous women faced overwhelming criticism and doubt. Like Dr. Anita Hill, who in 1991 also went before the Senate Judiciary Committee and told the world, in detail, that Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her. The following year, women, angry after Hill s testimony didn t derail Thomas  nomination, had an unprecedented run at office. It was dubbed  the Year of the Woman. The public and the press didn t look upon Hill at the time as being a hero. She was called a nuisance. She was called a political ploy (as Blasey has been). But now we remember her as the woman in the vanguard who made way for Blasey. And before Hill, there were many women who stood up to power and Blasey now joins their ranks as well.  These include women like Ida B. Wells and Fannie Lou Hamer, who used their voices to stand up to racial injustice; Ann Richards and Shirley Chisholm, who never backed down from politics despite the odds or the criticism; Carmita Wood, who helped found Working Women United after resigning from Cornell in 1975 after facing sexual harassment; or Maya Angelou, who wrote about being sexual assaulted in her 1969 autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.All of these women faced public ridicule, violence from men and incredible odds stacked against their success. But history remembers them as heroes, women in the vanguard in the fight for freedom who have and will continue to inspire future generations of women and girls.It may take years for us to understand the ultimate impact of Blasey s testimony. But we have already started seeing its effects just days out.Callers into C-SPAN shared their own sexual assault stories. One woman, Brenda, called in during a break in the hearing. I could hear her from the kitchen, her voice pulled me into the living room and had me standing in front of my TV, hand over my mouth, tears streaming down my face.Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who had indicated he would vote yes on Kavanaugh, got into an elevator Friday in the Hart Senate Office building, Ana Maria Archila blocked the closing door and addressed Flake directly.  On Monday, I stood in front of your office,  she said.  I told the story of my sexual assault. Flake kept trying to leave, the elevator buzzing because the door had been open too long. Still, Archila continued talking.  What you are doing is allowing someone who actually violated a woman to sit on the Supreme Court. This is not tolerable. Maria Gallagher then jumped in. When Flake wouldn t meet her eyes, she said,  Don t look away from me. Look at me and tell me that it doesn t matter what happened to me, that you will let people like that go into the highest court of the land and tell everyone what they can do to their bodies. Archila told The New York Times she was inspired by Blasey.  When the Me Too movement broke out, I thought about saying it   but I wrote things and deleted it and eventually decided I can t say,  Me too.  But when Dr. [Blasey] Ford did it, I forced myself to think about it again. Flake announced, just prior to the committee vote (during which he voted for Kavanaugh), that he would be asking for a delay in a final floor vote so the FBI can investigate the multiple sexual assault claims against Kavanaugh. President Donald Trump later announced the investigation would happen.Flake credits  a lot of people on the phone, in email and text, and walking around the capitol  for his small change of heart.  It s been remarkable the number of people who saw Dr. [Blasey] Ford and were emboldened to come out and say what happened to them, including close friends.  Who knows what s next. Gallagher and Archila and their courage, inspired by Blasey s and in the footsteps of Hill s, will energize others.In the end, like Hill, like the brave women before her, Blasey s legacy and the ramifications of her testifying will outlive this particular confirmation hearing and, ultimately, the Supreme Court justice she testified against. Of the two people who testified that day, only one is a hero and she will be remembered as such.Jessica Luther is a freelance journalist, an author and a co-host of the feminist sports podcast  Burn It All Down.

During its coverage of the Brett Kavanaugh hearing, the normally stolid channel turned into something else: an impromptu national town hall on sexual assault. As Christine Blasey Ford told the country that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in 1982, woman after woman started to call in to C-SPAN to tell senior executive producer and host Steve Scully about the men who had sexually abused them.  Well over a dozen,  he estimated.  It was such an organic moment. It just happened. We didn t plan it. Brenda from Missouri calls C-SPAN I m a 76-year-old woman who was sexually molested in 2nd grade. This brings back so much pain. Thought I was over it but it s not. You will never forget it. You get confused & you don t understand it but you never forget what happened to you.  pic.twitter.com/uCgroeQ4B5Some of the callers were Democrats. Some were Republicans. Some were young, but many of them, like Ford, were years removed from the incident. Scully hadn t expected to be flooded with calls. But he also wasn t entirely surprised. After almost three decades with C-SPAN, he has come to expect people to call in during moments of national crisis. He compared Thursday to covering Anita Hill s testimony and the Sept. 11 attacks.  These just became moments where everyone was watching, everyone had an opinion, and the raw emotion bubbled up,  he said. Whether or not anyone notices. C-SPAN fields calls from regular Americans every day, so much so that John Oliver and Co. once dubbed Scully  The Most Patient Man In America.  Jokes or not, Scully said listening helps him truly feel the pulse of the nation in a way others might not be able to. HuffPost spoke with Scully about what it was like inside C-SPAN on Thursday. This conversation has been slightly edited and condensed. I wanted to ask you about the calls you got on Thursday   a number of them were from sexual assault survivors. Just the sheer number of stories was pretty remarkable. Was that something that you were expecting?No, it wasn t something that we expected, but it also did not surprise us. We open our phone lines every day, every morning for our programming. During the course of the day, I think what we saw, though, was just the sheer, raw emotion from the testimony of Dr. Ford, and I kind of compare it to two things. We did the same thing after Anita Hill, but more recently, after 9/11. These just became moments where everyone was watching, everyone had an opinion, and the raw emotion bubbled up. Once we got one call, it seemed like every other caller was another victim of sexual abuse, and that s what was really so incredible. It just seemed to be a watershed moment. How do you find that this moment compared to the Anita Hill moment that you covered all those years ago?Obviously, there are similarities in terms of the hearing and the drama. The comparison is that you have these  I was there  moments. I mean, people remember 9/11. People who watched Anita Hill remember what was happening. One of the things that we do best as a network is   you know, we don t have pundits. We don t have talking heads. We just hear from the American people. And that was 27 years ago, but I do remember when we took calls then, and when we took calls after 9/11, the emotion just came pouring out. You had so many people   they just had to speak. People wanted to be heard. And we re the one network that allows people to have a voice and share it with people around the country. You re always going to get the emotion. But this one was a little bit different just because of the intensity of the calls that we were receiving. What did you find yourself thinking about as these calls started to come through and pile up?I listened. I just listened. And I think the American people, those who watch C-SPAN, just wanted to listen. I mean, they had just heard from Christine Blasey Ford. We did calls in the breaks and then during the lunch break and the transition between Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. And, you know, my job is not to become part of the story. My job is to be a facilitator, and whether I m doing an interview or moderating the [morning C-SPAN show]  Washington Journal,  or taking calls, we just want to listen, and I think that s something we need to do more of, maybe, in this country. And hopefully, C-SPAN can be part of that. Did any of the comments from the women stick with you? Brenda, who was the first one   76 years old. There were a number of other callers. What struck me is that most of the callers were in their 50s, 60s or 70s. And most of them were recounting what happened when they were young teenagers. There was one [woman who] was 23, and she had been abused when she was 17 and 18, so that was relatively fresh in her mind. But the general theme of those who did call that were older is that they remember what happened and they explained exactly what happened. That s what I took away from it. Look. I m married, I ve got three daughters, I have five sisters. Sexual abuse is an issue in our country, and it has to be addressed, whether you agree or disagree with everything that happened yesterday. Chris Wallace was talking on Fox News about conversations he had had with his daughters, it s been interesting to see  I think we all have. I ve had those conversations. I have a younger daughter who s only 9, but I have two older daughters, and I ve had that conversation because it is an issue out there. Men need to treat women with respect, and sadly, that doesn t always happen. I wanted to ask: You talked about hearing from a broad swath of the American people. I couldn t help but notice there were also some callers calling in and saying Ford seemed like she was lying. What do you see as the news value of taking those sort of calls as well?First of all, we don t know what people are going to say. Our job is to put it out there, and as long as they re not using corrosive language or as long as they re not going in the gutter   our calls reflect America. What people are saying is a reflection of what Americans are saying. I come from a big family, so I have liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans [in my family], and they have their own point of view. When people call in to the program, they re expressing their point of view. So as long as they keep it civil   even if they show emotion, even if they say so-and-so is lying or so-and-so is incompetent, whatever the issue happens to be   as long as they keep it aboveboard, we want to hear from everyone. I don t know what the person is going to say. None of us who hosts these programs knows what the people are going to say once you get on the air.What was it like inside C-SPAN? Was this something that people were talking about among themselves? It took a while, but then people said  Wow, have you tuned in? There s something going on over there. I was on the set. Some people were saying,  Hey, this is really beginning to resonate.  We didn t really change our approach. We had always planned on taking calls. Certainly, the social media lit up. I mean, look, I knew right away when we were getting these calls that we d tapped into something. I m out there. I m taking the calls. We were the pool cameras for the hearing itself, so not only did we have the responsibility of producing our own coverage, but everything that you saw on all the networks came from the C-SPAN cameras. Really, our primary focus is to make sure that we have everything in place so that the cameras were working and the coverage was first-rate, because ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, CNN   everyone was counting on C-SPAN to make sure we do a first-rate job. So that was our primary focus. But yes, once we started to get the calls   I don t know what the final number was, but well over a dozen women called in expressing their own shame or anger at being a victim of sexual abuse. And they were all very   they showed emotion, but they were all very thoughtful and very clear and in many ways mirrored what we heard from Dr. Ford. Because she also said,  I don t remember all the details but I remember what happened.  Another viewer called and said,  I remember I was abused at a beach. I can t tell you exactly where it was, but I can tell you exactly what happened.  That was interesting that we had those parallels. Conversely, we had a lot of people who said the Democrats are wrong to do this and they were critical of Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats and [said] Judge Kavanaugh is being smeared, so we heard that as well. You also heard these women say, like Ford, that they hadn t told many people   that it wasn t something they had talked about very much with a lot of people, and I couldn t help but notice that parallel with Ford as well.Yeah, and I asked them that because I wanted to find out   you know, I m speaking as a white male, so I m speaking to a victim of abuse and I was curious, does her story resonate? What happened in your situation? Is there a familiar or similar pattern? So that s why I had asked those questions. After you wrapped up, what did you find yourself thinking about? Did you have any conversations about it? I was exhausted. It was a full day. I was exhausted from the day because there was so much emotion and so much coverage. Just hearing Judge Kavanaugh and hearing from Dr. Ford and then taking our calls, and I think   we just kept going on into the evening. I wrapped up around 8 o clock. And then we carried into the evening with another host. But I think we were happy with the way that the coverage worked out because so many were counting on us, but I think we also felt emotionally drained. How could you not? You have two very powerful witnesses giving some very powerful testimony on some issues that really are resonating with our country   and C-SPAN, I think, played a small part.We like to say that we are America s town hall because we want people to take it all in, and I ve gotta tell you too, even the calls that were critical of the Democrats, it was fascinating to hear both sides. And yes, they had emotion. And yes, they showed anger. But they also showed civility. I hope that makes sense. They expressed their views, and like I said, we are a reflection of where the country is. One of the things I remember in the 2016 election is all the pro-Trump callers, the passion that they had in their voice. I remember saying to people, you know this could prove that Donald Trump could win the presidency, and sure enough, he won it. So what you re getting from the C-SPAN callers is really where the country is on so many different levels. Need help?

For weeks, I heard Republican senators and pundits assail her character and memory, as well as object to the process by which her story came to light. I felt that it was important to go down to the Senate to bear witness, to the best of my ability, to this momentous day. I was, and am, in awe of Dr. Ford s bravery.Standing in the basement of a Senate office building on my lunch break, I hoped to be able to speak with a senator or two about whether they believed the research psychologist s story and whether, even if they did, it would affect their vote. As I was about to leave to get back to my office for a meeting, Sen. Lindsey Graham entered the hallway and stopped to speak with the press.I heard every disgusting word that Sen. Graham said then   that Dr. Ford wasn t credible because she had waited so long to come forward. That he wouldn t consider the merits of the claim because he disagreed with the process by which her story had not been shared earlier with the committee. But what hit me hardest was his assertion that we shouldn t believe Dr. Ford because she couldn t recall the exact date or location of the assault.I couldn t keep quiet on that. When Sen. Graham broke free from the press gaggle, I told him that I had been raped 13 years ago and that I didn t know the exact date. Would he believe me despite that?Graham s callous response was to say that he was sorry but that I needed to go to the police. Here s video of my exchange with Senator Graham, courtesy of @CNN and @SuzanneMalveaux. If @LindseyGrahamSC wants to talk further, I d love to chat about why  go to the cops  is a horrifically insensitive and dismissive thing to say to a rape survivor.https://t.co/ifDLOGDDzYI don t believe his apology was sincere, but, more important, this exchange, along with his treatment of Dr. Ford and countless other women in his tenure in elected office, demonstrated his lack of concern for sexual assault survivors and his complete lack of understanding of the dynamics that keep us from reporting to the police.Our stories are real. What happens to us is real. And that is true even if we do not ever disclose it to our families or friends, or report it to law enforcement. The response we ve seen to Dr. Ford telling her story, and to the other women who have come forward about Brett Kavanaugh, is as clear an illustration as any about why people don t report being assaulted.Further, senators like Lindsey Graham and Jeff Flake, who was confronted in an elevator Friday morning by Ana Maria Archila and Maria Gallagher, are telling the millions of women with stories just like mine that they do not consider possibly having sexually assaulted someone(s) to be disqualifying. It is a clear message that they do not believe that we matter. Graham told me I should have gone to the police. When I was raped, as a sophomore in college, I did consider it. I ve also considered it in the years since, though the statute of limitations has since expired. But Sen. Graham knew none of that. He only knew that, to his mind, the only way you could possibly be telling the truth was if you reported it to the police.Survivors of sexual violence don t report to the police for all kinds of reasons, not the least of which are that we see every day how police and our nation s courts   including the one on which Kavanaugh currently sits and the one to which he will likely soon be confirmed   fail to achieve justice for us. We don t report because overwhelmingly the people assaulting us are our boyfriend, or friend, or family member, or coach, or clergy   people we ve loved and have trusted.We don t report because people of color and LGBTQ people are at risk of surviving violence only to face further victimization through state violence.We don t report because studies show that police officers commit sexual assault and domestic abuse themselves at disproportionately high rates. We don t report because, as a tweet from @emrazz notes, Brock Turners turn into Brett Kavanaughs who protect Brock Turners. Brock Turners grow up to be Brett Kavanaughs who make the rules for Brock Turners.The police can t do anything about my rape now, but Graham and his colleagues can choose to believe Dr. Ford and to give the FBI sufficient time to fully investigate her story, and Deborah Ramirez s story, and Julie Swetnik s story. They can choose not to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court to rule over our lives and bodies for decades to come.The justice we can achieve now could look like withdrawing Brett Kavanaugh s nomination or declining to confirm him, and finding a new nominee who doesn t have a mounting tally of credible sexual misconduct accusations to their name. Justice could look like nominating a new associate justice of the Supreme Court who understands that just because a survivor doesn t remember every single detail does not mean she s lying or is a pawn of his political opposition. But I m not counting on Lindsey Graham to support any of that. After all, he s already shown us that he s willing to cavalierly dismiss the anguished pleas of any sexual assault survivor who didn t pursue his very narrow perception of justice. And besides, if Dr. Ford or I had recalled the dates we were assaulted, he would surely find any other reason to ignore our voices.Do you have a personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

Jeff Flake s surprise call Friday for a delay in the final vote on Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation was affected by encounters with women  emboldened  to share their experiences and his desire to demonstrate that the  process is fair,  he told reporters Friday.He said it was  remarkable  how many people who  saw Dr. [Christine Blasey] Ford [testify] were emboldened to come out and say what had happened to them,  Flake told reporters.  I heard from friends, close friends. I had no idea.  Flake referred to his  interactions with a lot of people   on the phone, email, text, walking around the Capitol, you name it. Earlier in the day, Flake had issued a statement saying that he wasn t convinced Blasey s testimony accusing Kavanaugh of sexual assault was enough to deny the Supreme Court nominee a vote.A short time later, Flake was confronted as he entered an elevator by two survivors of sexual assault who challenged him on Kavanaugh in an encounter captured on video that went viral.  What you are doing is allowing someone who actually violated a woman to sit on the Supreme Court. This is not tolerable,  one of the women shouted. Flake, who left the elevator ashen-faced and clearly rattled, did not reveal to reporters if that encounter affected his ultimate decision to call for a one-week delay in a final vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation to allow time for an FBI probe. But he had already been talking the night before with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia about how to deal with the Kavanaugh accusations without rejecting his confirmation outright, sources told Politico. Together they would hold the power to block Kavanaugh s final confirmation on the Senate floor. Flake told reporters that his morning statement was a bid to keep Republicans calm about where he stood and not worry that he was going to bolt from their ranks.  I hoped that would help provide leverage,  Flake said.But he was also determined to demonstrate  that the process is fair, even if Democrats are  not going to vote for  Kavanaugh, Politico reported.Flake reached out Friday to Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who s a fellow member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and discussions began. After joining  Republicans on a party-line vote to advance Kavanaugh s nomination out of the committee, Flake then called for an FBI investigation into the accusations against Kavanaugh before a final Senate vote. He made clear that he wanted a probe of  not more  than a week.  This country is being ripped apart here, and we ve got to make sure we do due diligence,  he told the committee. I wanted to support  Kavanaugh, Flake told reporters later.  I m a conservative, he s a conservative judge. But I want a process we can be proud of, and I think the county needs to be behind it. I feel relieved that @JeffFlake seems to have heard my and @AnaMariaArchil2 s voices in the Senate elevator today. We absolutely need an FBI investigation and for him and all Senators to vote NO. #StopKavanaugh pic.twitter.com/VnsfTIRGXJDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) pulled off such a dramatic mood swing Friday after his furious rant at Brett Kavanaugh s Senate hearing the previous day that CNN hosts Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon were positively giddy with surprise.An incandescently angry Graham had accused Democrats of being out to  destroy  Kavanaugh s life so they could get their own Supreme Court nominee if they win back the White House in 2020.  This is the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics,  he yelled at Thursday s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Boy, y all want power. God, I hope you never get it. But on Friday   after Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) persuaded senators to hold off on the nomination until the FBI investigates sexual misconduct accusations against Kavanaugh   a jocular Graham told reporters:  It makes sense to me.   Makes sense to him?  an astounded Cuomo asked Friday.  Never, if you ever, if I m ever the chairman ... ,  he added, mocking Graham s earlier rant.  Now it s not such a bad idea?  First he s got the vapors,  Lemon, who s from Louisiana, joked, drawing out the archaic term with a Southern accent.  Oh! I ve got the vapors!  Then suddenly he s  Mr. Pragmatic.  Lemon called it a  screen test  for attorney general for President Donald Trump.  He would love a job in this administration,  Lemon said.It s not only Graham s temperament that s shifting, it s also his politics, Lemon added. Graham was  one of the biggest critics of this administration ... now he s defending everything, even when it s indefensible.

In the summer of 1982, seven months before he turned 18, the state raised the legal drinking age for beer and wine from 18 to 21. (It was already 21 for hard liquor.) Those who were 18 or older at the time were  grandfathered  in, so they could continue to drink legally. That, however, did not apply to Kavanaugh: He didn t turn 18 until the following February.  Yes, we drank beer, my friends and I, boys and girls,  Kavanaugh told the committee.  I liked beer. I still like beer. The drinking age, as I noted, was 18, so the seniors were legal. Senior year in high school, people were legal to drink ... Sometimes probably had too many beers. He also told Fox News in his interview Monday:  Yes, there were parties, and yes, the drinking age was 18. And yes, the seniors were legal and had beer there. In his introductory remarks before the committee, Kavanaugh said that everything he said on the network could be entered as testimony.Legal drinking age in Maryland changed to 21 when Brett Kavanaugh was 17 years old: pic.twitter.com/0MDUGrZ9CXThe legal drinking age was 18 in Washington, D.C., throughout the years Kavanaugh attended Georgetown Prep. He could have legally purchased and consumed alcohol in the capital   but only in the last four months of his senior year, after he turned 18.Most students attending Georgetown Prep lived in Maryland, however. Christine Blasey Ford has accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault at a house party in suburban Maryland, where she said both Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were  stumbling drunk.  She also testified that she had a beer. (Kavanaugh was 17 at that time; Blasey was 15.)The White House argued Friday that Kavanaugh s testimony about drinking was not intended to be misleading, but provided  context  about how Maryland high schoolers obtained beer. Kavanaugh  never suggested that all of his high school drinking was of legal age,  White House spokesman Raj Shah said in a statement reported by The Associated Press. Shah insisted that Kavanaugh had said the legal drinking age was 18 because it  allowed friends to legally purchase beer, and for him to drink at high school parties,  the AP reported.Under Maryland law, a person under the age of 21 cannot consume or possess alcohol except in certain circumstances, including in a private home with the consent and under the supervision of an adult over the age of 21.In his memoir, Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk, Judge recounts years of local high school parties and beach getaways involving alcohol. He wrote that he and his friends aimed to consume 100 kegs of beer their senior year. Kavanaugh s bio in the senior yearbook notes that he was a member of the  Keg City Club (treasurer)   100 Kegs or Bust. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

I believe you, and people will believe you,  Rev. Karoline Lewis of Luther Seminary, said in a powerful Facebook video addressed directly to survivors.  You re not crazy. What happened to you was real,   Rev. Kyndall Rae Rothaus, of Texas  Lake Shore Baptist Church, said in the video.  And if the people in your life don t believe you, keep working until you find people who do. Sojourners, a progressive Christian activist organization, published the video Thursday evening   hours after the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman accusing him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. Kavanaugh s nomination moved forward Friday, after Senate Republicans agreed to a one-week FBI investigation into Blasey s allegation. The Senate proceedings this week have prompted an outpouring from sexual assault survivors across the country. Several women called into C-SPAN during the Senate hearing to share their personal stories about sexual abuse. The National Sexual Assault Hotline experienced a dramatic surge in calls.At the end of a tough week for survivors, Jenna Barnett, women and girls campaign coordinator for Sojourners, told HuffPost she felt it was important for pastors to acknowledge the harmful messages churches have sent to victims in the past. From telling women to stay in abusive marriages at all costs to shaming women for violence someone else inflicted, Barnett said churches have much to lament. With the new video, Barnett said, she wanted to remind people that even when it seems as if churches aren t safe spaces to speak about abuse, there are pastors out there who will believe and grieve with survivors.  We wanted to show visually what if feels like to have a pastor prioritize survivors and speak to their healing,  she said.The video was filmed at Neveretheless, She Preached, a conference that took place earlier this week in Waco, Texas, that centers on the voices of female church leaders. The 10 women who shared their thoughts in the video were from a mix of Protestant backgrounds. While many secular activists have already spoken out in defense of women this week, Barnett said that it s crucial for people of faith to chime in. Especially if the person who has experienced violence is religious themselves, there can be a spiritual trauma in that,  Barnett said.  That s why I think faith leaders need to speak to that trauma and try to provide a balm. It s part of a broader effort by Sojourners to call on faith leaders to speak out against sexual violence from the pulpit. On Friday, Sojourners launched a website featuring 100 real sermons about domestic and sexual abuse, preached by clergy from a wide spectrum of denominations. The project seeks to provide guidance to pastors who are unsure of how to address the topic   and ultimately, help make churches safer places for survivors. By preaching about domestic and sexual violence from the pulpit, pastors signal to survivors that they will believe victims and make healing a priority, Barnett said.  There are pastors and faith leaders who, when [survivors] come forward, will believe them and walk alongside them in their suffering and are ready to direct them to services in the community when it goes beyond what a pastor is able to offer,  Barnett said.

J Accuse,  the first film Polanski is starting work on since the Me Too movement launched a mass reckoning against predatory men in Hollywood and across the media landscape, is being financed by French production company Legende Films, the studio told The Hollywood Reporter on Friday.Polanski even managed to nab Oscar winner Jean Dujardin to star opposite Louis Garrel as Capt. Alfred Dreyfus, the real-life French-Jewish soldier wrongly accused of spying for the Germans in the 1890s.The French-Polish director s decision to create a film about a man who was falsely accused, imprisoned for five years and then exonerated is sure to raise some eyebrows.In 1977, Polanski pleaded guilty to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl and served 42 days in prison as part of a plea deal. When he received word that a judge was planning to revoke his plea deal, he fled to Paris and has remained a fugitive there ever since. While the U.S. has made multiple attempts to extradite him, Polanski hasn t been immune to recent repercussions of the Me Too movement, which in May he called a  mass hysteria that occurs in society from time to time.  That same month, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expelled him    though he s still holding on to the Oscar the academy awarded him in 2003 for  The Pianist.  News of Polanski s film comes the same day the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to send Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court nomination to the Senate floor despite multiple women coming forward with allegations of sexual misconduct.

I don t know if this is going to continue onward or are we going to get a vote,  Trump said in a photo opportunity at the White House.Trump said he had only just learned about an agreement Senate Republican leaders reached with Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) to put off a confirmation vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh until the FBI can look into  credible  sexual misconduct allegations against him.He said he would not try to pressure other Republican senators, including Alaska s Lisa Murkowski and Maine s Susan Collins, into voting for Kavanaugh.  They have to do what they think is right. They have to be comfortable with themselves,  Trump said.Hours later, the White House released a statement from Trump honoring the Senate s request:  I ve ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh s file. As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week. Kavanaugh said in a statement released through the White House that he would cooperate:  Throughout this process, I ve been interviewed by the FBI, I ve done a number of  background  calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the senators and their counsel asked me. I ve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate. The words and tone were a dramatic turn from Trump s stance at a Wednesday news conference during his visit to the United Nations General Assembly. There, he discounted the accusation as politically motivated.  Con job. It is. It s a con job. You know, confidence. It s a confidence job. But they   it s a con job by the Democrats. They know it,  he said.And Thursday, following Kavanaugh s angry performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, when he also claimed the accusations were part of a left-wing conspiracy to keep him off the high court, Trump tweeted his praise. Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him. His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting. Democrats  search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist. The Senate must vote!  Trump wrote.On Friday, after Flake s announcement that he would not feel comfortable with a floor vote until an FBI investigation had been conducted, Trump claimed that he, too, found the testimony of Kavanaugh s accuser, professor Christine Blasey Ford, moving. I thought her testimony was very compelling, and she looks like a very fine woman to me. A very fine woman,  Trump said.  Certainly she was a very credible witness. She was very good in many respects. Blasey, now a research psychologist in California, testified that Kavanaugh and a friend of his had trapped her in a bedroom at a small gathering 36 years ago. She said Kavanaugh held her down, covered her mouth with his hand and tried to remove her clothes as he and his friend laughed. Kavanaugh has denied even being at the house with her and said he has never sexually assaulted anyone. Since she came forward, two other women have leveled accusations against him.Many Republicans, including senators on the Judiciary Committee, have said they believe Blasey was attacked but that she must have been mistaken about the identity. Clearly she s been through something awful,  Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said Friday. I feel sorry for her, and I do believe something happened to her,  said South Carolina s Lindsey Graham.  But I don t believe it was Brett Kavanaugh. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The meme, posted to King s Facebook page on Wednesday, features a photo of Blasey wearing sunglasses. An edited version of the image next to it depicts Blasey with the sunglasses removed, revealing her to actually be Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate. I KNEW IT!  reads the accompanying text.  ah-HA!!! ,  King s campaign wrote as the caption.  The meme appears to baselessly imply that Blasey s very serious allegation of sexual assault   which she addressed in heartbreaking testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday   is part of some elaborate left-wing conspiracy. Blasey made a credible accusation that when she was 15, a 17-year-old Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and attempted to take off her clothes. She says when she tried to scream, Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth. She told senators that Kavanuagh and his friend Mark Judge laughed during the attack before she managed to get away   a laughter that she says has haunted her all her life. In her testimony Thursday, which was watched by millions across America, she said the incident left her traumatized. Kavanaugh denies it occurred. King is an eight-term congressman from Iowa best known for being a bigot and a white supremacist. His congressional office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it was irresponsible for a congressman to be sharing memes demeaning a survivor of sexual assault.The person or persons behind his campaign s official Facebook page, however, responded quickly, and flippantly, to HuffPost questions. You can read the whole exchange below: HuffPost: Do you think this is an appropriate meme for a congressional campaign to be sharing? Considering it s about an allegation of sexual assault?Steve King s campaign: The humor of that meme is pointed at the absurdity of the Left, nothing more. Our page content is definitely not for people who struggle to have a sense of humor or irony. That being said, we re definitely not going to litigate every meme with you. HuffPost: OK, thank you. How is it pointing out the absurdity of the left? (Not going to litigate every meme. Only interested in this one right now!)Steve King s campaign: Lol c mon man...it s obviously alluding to the Left manipulating the opposition against Kavanaugh s nomination. HuffPost:  Hhmm, ok. I see it as implying that the left completely cooked up Dr. Ford s accusation? I know you like dank memes and all, but seems kinda shitty to post about someone alleging she was sexually assaulted, yea?Steve King s campaign: Just a suggestion: you might be taking things a bit too literal... Just sayin. And we already explained the meaning of the meme, which you can either choose to believe or not HuffPost: hhmm ok, wasn t taking it too literally. Was just saying it s kinda shitty/insensitive to post about a sexual assault victim. Especially from the verified FB page of a candidate for Congress? But it s just lulz I guess, right?Steve King s campaign: Again, the meme was pointed at the absurdity of the Left. If you choose to not believe us or just misunderstand memes completely, that s your prerogative. The fact that the Left doesn t understand memes is in itself a meme, ironically. Steve King s campaign proceeds to share a couple of  The Left Can t Meme  memes. HuffPost: Yea I m familiar with the left can t meme thing! Very clever good for you. King s campaign has also shared other crass memes on Facebook belittling the sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh. Two out of three sexual assaults in America go unreported to police. It s common for sexual assault survivors to not speak out about their assaults until years or even decades later. King has won his last few elections by over 20 percentage points. A recent poll shows him only 6 points ahead of his Democratic opponent, J.D. Scholten, ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm election. Need help?

Instead, they ve subtly adopted another theory: that someone assaulted Blasey, but it wasn t Brett Kavanaugh. I do believe something happened to her, I don t know when and where, but I don t believe it was Brett Kavanaugh,  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Friday.  I do believe that something very, very, very bad happened to Dr. Ford, and I am very sorry,  Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Friday.  But I do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh was involved.  Blasey went before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday and said she was certain that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers. She said Kavanaugh, now a federal judge and nominee for the Supreme Court, had pinned her on a bed and covered her mouth, trying to remove her clothes, but that she got away when his friend, Mark Judge, jumped on them. Blasey s hourslong testimony, in which she answered queries from Democratic senators and a woman prosecutor hired by Republicans to do their questioning, was widely considered credible. Dismissing her entirely would require saying a psychologist who spoke with emotion about sexual assault was a fraud. But Kavanaugh allies had already begun laying the groundwork for an alternative   that she was simply mistaken about who assaulted her. And even when she said she was sure that was not the case, Republicans stuck with it. The idea of a Kavanaugh doppelg‰nger was floated in a Washington Post column and a Wall Street Journal editorial board column earlier this month. But it was taken to an extreme when Ed Whelan, a conservative lawyer and friend of Kavanaugh, posted a series of tweets detailing his theory that someone else assaulted Blasey, complete with identifying details about the man in question. Whelan later deleted his tweets and apologized. Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee made an explosive charge ahead of Thursday s hearing: that two men came forward to claim may have been the subjects of Blasey s story. In a timeline of events distributed to reporters, they wrote that committee staff on Monday interviewed  a man who believes he, not Judge Kavanaugh, had the encounter with Dr. Ford in 1982 that is the basis of his complaint.  They received an in-depth statement from him on Wednesday. The same day, staff  spoke via phone with another man who believes he, not Judge Kavanuagh, had the encounter with Dr. Ford in 1982 that is the basis of her allegation. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Blasey about the two men who claimed they may have sexually assaulted her.  With what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?  he asked her. 100 percent,  she replied. But other than that timeline and brief mention, the fact that two men came to the Senate Judiciary Committee to present themselves as potential predators got little attention. Two men came forward and said they may have had an encounter with Dr. Ford,  said Taylor Foy, spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), when asked whether the committee reported the men to law enforcement.  No one said they committed assault or admitted any wrongdoing. Even in the case of wrongdoing, it s unlikely they would face criminal charges. At the time of the alleged assault, it likely would have been classified as a misdemeanor with a statute of limitations of a year, and Blasey has not filed a complaint.  Still, it calls into question how credible investigators believed the men really were. Democrats were not notified about the two anonymous men in advance. A spokeswoman for Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the committee, said they  learned about the two anonymous men from the press when they forwarded the release.  Ultimately, even without much reference to the two anonymous individuals, Republicans said they believed Blasey while dismissing her. Kavanaugh said he didn t do it; they said they believed him more.  There s no doubt in my mind that she truthfully testified that she had had a sexual assault, that she had been assaulted sexually in her past,  Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) said Friday.  I don t feel that the evidence shows that Judge Kavanaugh was there that night. Grassley said he found her testimony before the judiciary committee to be  credible  and believed her to be  sincere in her version of the facts.  But I also found Judge Kavanaugh s testimony credible and sincere,  Grassley said Friday.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The magazine says that Blasey s detailed testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about her alleged sexual assault in 1982 at the hands of now Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh inspired the piece. She speaks for the women who have no voice,  Juan said of Blasey.Blasey said in her testimony that Kavanaugh groped her and held her down in a bedroom during a party, with Kavanaugh s friend Mark Judge present. In response to a question from Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), she said her most vivid memory of the alleged assault was the laughter. Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense,  said Blasey.  I was underneath one of them while the two laughed. Two friends having a really good time with one another. The day after testimony from Blasey and Kavanaugh about her allegation, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance his nomination. A final vote had been slated for next week, but Senate GOP leaders agreed to a supplemental FBI investigation into her allegation to last up to one week. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Donald Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate.Statement from President @realDonaldTrump: I ve ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh s file.

Christine Blasey Ford  vividly described Kavanaugh attempting to rape her when they were both teenagers, saying he pinned her to a bed and used his hand to stifle her screams.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and other Republicans have said Blasey must be mistaken about what happened. But on Thursday, in a fiery speech from the dais during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing   which had been precipitated entirely by Blasey s testimony   Graham ranted about a claim from another woman, who came forward this week.Julie Swetnick said in a sworn declaration that in the early 1980s, she saw Kavanaugh at parties where groups of boys would rape girls. Her attorney is Michael Avenatti, who also represents a woman who received money to stay quiet about an alleged past affair with President Donald Trump.Democrats did not ask Kavanaugh about the gang rape accusation, but Graham did during an angry few minutes of questioning from the dais. Were you a gang rapist?  Graham asked.Kavanaugh said no. You re supposed to be Bill Cosby when you re a junior and senior in high school,  Graham said.  And all of a sudden, you got over it. It s been my understanding that if you drug women and rape them for two years in high school, you probably don t stop. The serial rape accusation is ridiculous on its face, in Graham s view, because Kavanaugh has not been accused of any similar behavior over the course of his career.Graham went on to say that voting against Kavanaugh s nomination would be  legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics. He didn t ask Kavanaugh anything about Blasey s story. Later, during a closed-door Republican meeting, Graham s colleagues applauded him, as did conservative commentator Sean Hannity, who interviewed Graham on Thursday evening, when the senator railed against Senate Democrats some more.  Do you really believe that Brett Kavanaugh is a serial rapist? Do you believe any of this garbage?  Graham asked on Hannity s program.  I m sorry Dr. Ford went through this. She shouldn t have had to go through. But I am convinced beyond any shadow of a doubt that Brett Kavanaugh is not the man they re trying to make him. Blasey, the sole accuser who testified before the committee, did not say Kavanaugh drugged her or that he was a serial rapist. Not even Avenatti s client said she d witnessed Kavanaugh raping people   she said she d seen him at parties where rape did occur and she thought he might have participated.HuffPost asked Graham on Friday if it s fair to say Democrats are claiming Kavanaugh was allegedly a serial rapist like Cosby, who has been accused of assault by dozens of women.  No, I m not saying that,  Graham said.  I m saying it s fair to say that that s the accusation that came from Mr. Avenatti.  Graham suggested that his Cosby comments perhaps shouldn t be taken literally.  The process that we are engaging in has led to this accusation and nobody wants to talk about it because it is so over the top,  he said. Nobody except Graham, that is.  I want to prove to people what this process is all about,  he said.  It s about buying time, throwing anything and hoping it will stick. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

She said Judge was in the room and engaged in  uproarious laughter  with Kavanaugh.Kavanaugh forcefully declared his innocence during his own testimony, at times yelling, crying and interrupting senators. If the FBI or any law enforcement agency requests Mr. Judge s cooperation, he will answer any and all questions posed to him,  Judge s lawyer, Barbara Van Gelder, told CNBC in an email.Judge previously declined to speak to the Senate Judiciary Committee and is currently holed up at a friend s house in Bethany Beach, Delaware,  recovering from alcoholism,  according to his lawyer. As HuffPost reporter Laura Bassett points out, Republicans could have subpoenaed him for questioning but decided to instead take his word for it that he recalls nothing of the alleged incident.A Senate vote to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court could occur as early as Saturday. But on Friday, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) asked that the vote be delayed so the FBI could look into the claims against Kavanaugh. Fellow Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she supports Flake s proposal.Kavanaugh has been credibly accused of sexual misconduct by two other women. Deborah Ramirez said that at a college party, Kavanaugh exposed his penis and thrust it in her face. And Julie Swetnick said she was the  victim of one of these  gang  or  train  rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present  at a party in approximately 1982.

Like many Americans, I feel sick, with a knot in my stomach, after witnessing Thursday s meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee.The fact that there may now be a delay on a final Senate vote to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court changes nothing. Even if he goes down, the GOP has made its bed. And the revulsion at seeing Kavanaugh more than likely reach the Supreme Court   after incident after incident after incident seemed to be the turning point on his nomination s demise   mirrors the way many of us felt about Donald Trump s election almost two years ago. That in both cases brave women came forward   subjecting themselves to public humiliation, harassment and threatened physical harm   only to have angry white men push their allegations aside isn t lost on any of us.The difference, now, is that we re ready.We went through terrible shock and grief after the 2016 election and pulled ourselves together. We gathered forces. We marched. Then, we organized and struck back with ferocity at the ballot box. We ve launched those first salvos, in special election after special election, and more often than not, we have won against all odds.Now comes the big one in November   and we ve been preparing, working hard and waiting with anticipation.Data has shown that progressives are turning out in big numbers, thus transforming the Democratic Party. That same data suggests we have the ability to transform Congress, governorships and state legislatures. The GOP s likely, reckless action in putting Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court will only become rocket fuel for nationwide mass mobilization at the polls. You don t need data, however, to see how raw pain and anger has the power to galvanize those who watched the GOP smear the women who came forward to give credible accounts of sexual assault by Kavanaugh.What happened this week is unprecedented. Nothing truly compares. The Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings in 1991, during which Anita Hill came forward with sexual harassment allegations against the nominee, led to  The Year of the Woman,  which doubled the number of women elected to the House and the Senate. But this is a much more monumental moment, coming at a time when a record number of women are already running for local and federal office. And whereas Hill charged Thomas with sexual harassment in the workplace, a serious accusation, what we re seeing here are credible allegations of attempted rape and sexual assault.Unlike Hill, who maintained her composure as she described intimidating and ugly incidents at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (where she and Thomas worked), Christine Blasey Ford was intensely emotional as she told senators how the alleged sexual assault when she was a teenager   just 15 years old   altered her life forever. We saw her continued pain. It was impossible to not connect with her.And unlike Thomas, Kavanaugh is neither black nor making any kind of history on the court (nor is he even remotely popular with the public, having the lowest support in polls of any Supreme Court nominee of the last 30 years). Kavanaugh is a privileged white man who attended prep school and ran with the kind of crowd many of us knew in high school and college: teens and young adults who believed they could do whatever they wanted, treating women, people of color and LGBTQ people with disregard.As Blasey spoke, I recalled a high school incident that s come back to me in recent days (and that I tweeted about) in which I was bullied at a party for being gay (and like most people, I couldn t tell you much if anything about 99 percent of the parties I attended in those years). I was betrayed by my best friend, who joined up with the  in  crowd that night, some of whom then drove me to a beach and left me there. I can t tell you what date it was or at which house it happened. But I can tell you every single person who was there.The image of Kavanaugh in sheer rage, yelling during his opening statement (a complete meltdown, whether it was also partially or totally a performance) and interrupting senators, several of them women and people of color, is   to use a word from Blasey s testimony   indelible.Equally so are the unhinged performances of each and every one of the white male GOP senators on the Judiciary Committee, including the maniacal rantings of Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. All of it was grotesque theater playing to one man: the authoritarian president, who himself is playing to his racist, extremist base. None of us who ve been paying attention, who ve reported on events and organized for the last two years, is going to forget it.But more than that, millions of Americans watched Blasey s testimony   glued to TV screens in their homes, in their offices, in shops, in airports and in restaurants around the country   and believed her, even if they might have  previously been doubters or on the fence. They also watched the GOP s brazen, ugly display. This has surely jarred Americans and activated them, even if they might have been somewhat apathetic or previously uninformed. There is no question our lives will be altered in ways that right now are immeasurable if Kavanaugh sits on the Supreme Court. All of the gains we ve made (and that we ve already seen eroding) for civil rights for women, people of color and LGBTQ people will be rolled back by this extremist-dominated court. There is no question about that. The power of money in politics will be further unleashed. Unions will become even more vulnerable after already suffering crippling blows from this court. The environment will be degraded as regulations are stripped away. Big business, and its greed, will be rewarded. The authoritarian president s power will be protected.We ve known all of this was at stake since the day Donald Trump was elected   just as we knew it the day he nominated Brett Kavanaugh. We know the enormous task that lies before us. We re shellshocked, yes, but we re prepared.This brutal, horrendous action only gives us more drive and passion. And it will help us make the case to millions of other Americans that we must take our country back in the midterm elections. Michelangelo Signorile is an editor-at-large for HuffPost.

His lawyer, Barbara Van Gelder, also issued a statement Friday afternoon saying he was willing to cooperate with any law enforcement investigation, so long as it took place  confidentially.  The Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday afternoon voted along party lines to send Kavanaugh s nomination to the full Senate, but Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) strongly implied that he would not support Kavanaugh unless the FBI first conducts an investigation in the next week. On Friday afternoon, the committee said it would ask the White House to request a supplemental background check into Kavanaugh. Blasey has alleged that Kavanaugh and Judge locked her in a room when they were all in high school. She said Kavanaugh pinned her to the bed and sexually assaulted her while Judge was present. Democrats wanted Judge to testify before the committee, but Republicans refused to call him to do so. He has been hiding out in Bethany Beach, Delaware, away from the media scrutiny. Judge has denied Blasey s allegations. He has written extensively about his drunken high school escapades at Georgetown Preparatory School, where he was good friends with Kavanaugh.

She says she was assaulted by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has denied the allegation.I believe Blasey, because why would anyone put herself and her family through this kind of scrutiny and loss of privacy? Why would anyone make herself the target of hatred, including death threats?She says she s been forced out of her home and is now protected by bodyguards.*  *  *My daughter spent three summers at a sleep-away camp. It was her favorite place in the world. She planned to continue going until she aged out, then become a counselor in training, and then a counselor. She planned to run the camp someday.But the summer before last, when she was 13, a boy her age told his cabinmates he wanted to rape her. His cabinmates told her cabinmates, who told her and her counselor, who told the  head of the hill,  who told the camp director. Everyone was notified, including the boy s mom. Everyone except me.I didn t hear about the incident until months later. One night in October, I learned what had happened when my daughter sat on my bed and told me about another boy, a fellow eighth grader who d sent her a picture of his penis. She cried because the boy used to be her friend. He asked her to kiss him and she said no. Then he pressured her harder by sending a picture of his penis. She called it a  dick pic,  using that now all-too-common lingo, as if a picture of a dick showing up on a 13-year-old s phone is normal. Apparently, it is.My daughter has been sent 30 dick pics between sixth grade and the middle of eighth grade.All of her friends have gotten dick pics, she told me. So many boys send them.When I asked if the penises in the photos were hard, she said,  What s that mean? I explained with my pointer finger that a penis could either flop down or point straight out. She replied,  Hard. *  *  *This is what Christine Blasey Ford says: When she was 15, she went to a friend s house to hang out with a few kids. Some of the kids had been drinking a lot. She had to pee and went upstairs to the bathroom. Two boys followed her up the stairs. One of them shoved her into a room. One of them locked the door behind them. The boys laughed, like two friends having a great time, while one of them got on top of her, groped her and tried to get her clothes off. She feared she d be raped, and when he put his hand over her mouth to muffle her screams, she thought he might accidentally kill her. She tried to fight him off, but couldn t until his friend jumped on the bed and knocked them over.*  *  *It s difficult for a girl to know what to do when she receives a photo of a penis. Boys send the pictures through Snapchat. If she takes a screen shot, then legally, she s distributing child pornography. Worse, the boy will get a notification that someone took a screen shot of his picture. Chances are, then, he ll retaliate. He ll spread rumors. He ll post a picture of some other girl s breasts and say it s her.When I asked my daughter if she ever sent pictures of her body parts, she said no, but she knows girls who have.I don t know if a dick pic feels like an assault. But I imagine it does, because my daughter told me all this and then, in that same conversation, told me what had happened at camp.I called the camp director the next day. He said they did an investigation. He said the boy s cabinmates were questioned. They couldn t prove the boy said the word  rape.  No one was sure. He told me there was another incident where the boy lay on top of a girl in the infirmary, but then a few days later, the boy and the girl became a couple. How is that relevant?  I asked.He said the boy may have been  misunderstood. I said,  You are a camp director and you seem to know nothing about a girl s psychology. The director told me they watched the boy all summer. They did everything they could to protect her.I said,  You did everything you could to protect him. *  *  *Christine Blasey Ford says she didn t tell her parents because she was 15, and she thought she d get in trouble for drinking beers with boys.           *  *  *I don t wonder why my daughter didn t immediately tell me what happened at camp. For one thing, I don t speak to her while she s at camp. Campers aren t allowed to have phones, or any contact with the outside world other than letters. In her letters that summer, she said she wasn t having fun and that she didn t like camp anymore.Why didn t she tell me a boy threatened to rape her? Why didn t she tell me that every time she left her cabin, her cabinmates acted like bodyguards?  Because she was 13.Because she was scared.Because she was embarrassed.Because she wasn t sure she wanted to leave.Because she thought the camp director didn t believe her.Because she was afraid I d fly out there and throw a massive fit.It wasn t her job to tell me. The camp director knew, and he didn t protect her.*  *  *Maybe deep in every girl s psyche is a fear that no matter what happens, she ll be the one suspected of doing something wrong. That was true for Christine Blasey Ford in 1982. It still feels true today.But what did the 15-year-old Blasey do wrong? In her testimony this week, she said she showed up at a gathering of kids that evening in 1982. She said a boy threw her down on a bed. She thought she would be raped or accidentally killed. Then, she said, years later, when that boy became a Supreme Court nominee, she brought it up. She brought it up when it mattered.As I watch her testimony on Facebook Live, I see comments scrolling by. So many people are calling her a liar. So many people are accusing her of being a pawn of the Democrats. So many people are accusing her of wrongdoing.That s what I m afraid of now: that if I say boys sent my daughter pictures of their dicks and another boy threatened to rape her, people will think she did something to provoke them.This is our world. This is the world a girl has to learn to navigate   a world where she has to get her cabinmates to protect her because no one else will.Andrea Askowitz is the author of the memoir My Miserable, Lonely, Lesbian Pregnancy.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) seems inordinately concerned about the judge s future as a Harvard professor and girls basketball coach.Cruz lamented to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday that even if Kavanaugh is confirmed as a justice, he and his family will still have to deal with the social consequences of him being accused of sexually assaulting and harassing women when he was in high school and college   allegations Cruz dismissed as  sensational  and  ludicrous.  Judge Kavanaugh has two young daughters, a 10-year-old and a 13-year-old,  Cruz said.  For the rest of their lives, their daughters will go to school, will interact with people, many of whom are convinced their father is a rapist. Kavanaugh may never again be able to teach at Harvard Law School, Cruz also pointed out, calling the judge s description of his Harvard teaching career   some of the most poignant testimony yesterday.  (Christine Blasey Ford, whose testimony preceded Kavanaugh s, described, in detail, being sexually assaulted at age 15 while the two boys in the room laughed at her, and how it affected the rest of her life.) It is entirely possible those on the left would say we don t want someone we believe to be a rapist ever teaching again,  Cruz said. [Judge Kavanaugh] also talked about how much he has loved coaching girls basketball, coaching his daughters in basketball. And he mentioned he may never coach again. Cruz added:  It might well be in this tribalized, partisan-divided world that the parents of the other girls say,  No, we don t want him as a coach anymore.  Our words and actions have consequences.  He also talked about how much he s loved coaching girls  basketball, coaching his daughters in basketball. And he mentioned he may never coach again,  Sen. Ted Cruz highlights the collateral damage of the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh. https://t.co/NmIZm7XrXq pic.twitter.com/elSGlVV6eUOne consequence of Cruz s speech is that many Twitter users brought out really tiny violins.Cry me a river. He and his nasty friends used their senior yearbook to claim they d all had sex with a specific girl, making her look bad. He s been caught lying on multiple occasions and I couldn t really care less what he thinks about anything.Coaching org s have a higher bar to entry than the US Supreme Court. Or the presidency.Confirming him without fully investigating is going to cause collateral damage all over the country but sure let s be concerned about if a possible sexual predator might not ever coach girls basketball again. #MAGAGuess what, Ted @SenTedCruz -- basketball coaches, churchgoers, and judges can all be abusers. Kavanaugh does not have the temperament, integrity, or honesty to be a Supreme Court Judge. #NoKavanaugh #BetoForTexasTed Cruz says the accusations are a dark cloud over Kavanaugh that will haunt his family forever, but says the committee shouldn t do anything more to find the facts that he s confident would save his reputation. What?Is Ted Cruz really comparing what Dr. Ford has lived through to Kavanaugh possibly not being able to coach basketball anymore? #DelayTheVoteDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) sought a one-week delay in the full Senate s vote so that the FBI could investigate Blasey s allegations. His request came after speaking to Democrats in a room adjacent to the committee hearing room, which created much confusion and speculation ahead of the committee s scheduled 1:30 p.m. vote.In the end, Flake voted with other Republicans in the 11-10 party-line vote to advance Kavanaugh s nomination without any assurances that the FBI investigation would happen. Later Friday, senators passed a motion to proceed with Kavanaugh s nomination and set a schedule to continue debate beginning at 3 p.m. EDT Monday.Flake explained his decision to reporters following the vote. Let me emphasize again: I m a conservative, I would love to see Judge Kavanaugh confirmed and I hope to be able to do that,  he said.

There s a difference of opinion as to what it means,  he said.The Judiciary Committee vote to advance the nomination to the full Senate seemed like a foregone conclusion, with Thursday s testimony from Kavanaugh and Blasey appearing to have made little difference in the minds of senators. Judiciary Committee Republicans eagerly defended Kavanaugh during his defiant testimony, and accused Democrats of politicizing his nomination. Republicans came away from Blasey s testimony saying that she was credible, yet continued to claim her memory may have been faulty.Friday s vote followed a contentious morning, with several Democratic members of the committee walking out in protest of the GOP push to advance Kavanaugh s confirmation.Harris and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) also refused to vote on a motion setting the vote time for Friday afternoon, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) explaining that  they are not answering because this is so unfair. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) called it  a railroad job. Kavanaugh s victory in the committee was assured on Friday morning, when Flake   who had previously said  obviously, if you believe the charges are true, then you vote no    announced that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh s confirmation.Shortly after that, a sexual assault survivor confronted Flake in a Capitol Hill elevator. Look at me and tell me that it doesn t matter what happened to me, that you will let people like that go into the highest court of the land,  the woman said tearfully, while Flake looked down at the floor.Blasey calmly testified before the committee on Thursday, questioned by sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, who was selected by GOP leaders because of the poor optics of showing the all-male Republican committee membership. Later in the day, the American Bar Association, whose  well-qualified  rating of Kavanaugh was frequently touted by his supporters, called on Senate leaders to delay the vote and open an FBI investigation into sexual misconduct allegations raised by Blasey and two other women, which the Republicans and the Justice Department have refused to do.Kavanaugh also lost the support of America Magazine, a national Jesuit publication. Kavanaugh graduated from the elite Georgetown Prep, a Jesuit school, in suburban Washington. White House officials on Friday morning blamed Democrats for the spectacle. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders accused Democrats of  exploiting  Blasey  for their own political purposes,  and said they owe her an apology.Arthur Delaney contributed reporting.

The problem with Kavanaugh s insistence that this letter is exculpatory is that it is not true.Leyland Keyser sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 22 stating that she did not remember any gathering that matched the one Blasey described as the place where Kavanaugh and Mark Judge allegedly shoved her into a room and sexually assaulted her.  Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford,  the letter from Keyser s lawyer to the committee reads.But Keyser also personally told the Washington Post that, while she cannot remember the gathering taking place or having met Kavanaugh, she believes Blasey s testimony. This did not stop Kavanaugh and Republicans from twisting Keyser s statements that she can t remember into an exonerating statement that implies the events never happened at all.  Ms. Keyser said under penalty of felony she does not know me, does not recall ever being at a party with me ever and my two male friends who were allegedly there, who knew me well, have told this committee under penalty of felony that they do not recall any such party and that I never did or would do anything like this,  Kavanaugh said in his angry opening statement.  Dr. Ford s allegation is not merely uncorroborated, it is refuted by the very people she says were there, including by a longtime friend of hers. Refuted. He stated two other times in his opening statement that Keyser s statement to the committee  refuted  Blasey s allegations. Listen to Ms. Keyser,  Kavanaugh said.  She does not know me. I was not at the party described by Dr. Ford. In at least three other instances, Kavanaugh asserted that all witnesses alleged to have been at the gathering where the assault reportedly took place,  said it didn t happen. Republican senators, in defense of Kavanaugh and his honor, rallied around this line. Keyser s statement  explicitly dispute[d]  the allegations of sexual assault brought by Blasey, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said on Friday ahead of the committee s vote on Kavanaugh nomination. All three of the individuals whom Dr. Ford has named as supposed eyewitnesses have made statements to the Senate under penalty of felony,  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in his statement explaining his vote for Kavanaugh.  None of them corroborate her account. To the contrary, they refute it. Democrats rebutted this argument. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) pointed out that Keyser did not refute Blasey s testimony, but she merely said that she did not recall the events as having taken place and that she believed her friend. Not recalling is not the same as refuting,  Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said on Friday.Blasey herself said she did not fault Keyser for not remembering the gathering or the alleged assault that Blasey did not tell anyone about until 2012 because who would remember hanging out with some friends 36 years ago when you were not assaulted. Leland would not remember this unremarkable party,  Blasey said.  It was not one of their more notorious parties because nothing remarkable happened to them that evening.

Once we take that presumption [of innocence] away from the accused and give it to the accuser, we re going to have nothing but chaos,  Jeffress said during an interview on Fox Business on Thursday night.Ralph Reed, founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, called Kavanaugh s testimony  forceful, eloquent, substantive, and compelling.  Judge Brett Kavanaugh s testimony was forceful, eloquent, substantive, and compelling. I thank President Trump for selecting such an outstanding nominee. I am proud to support Kavanaugh s confirmation and pray he will soon be on the Supreme Court.Jack Graham, pastor of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas, also found the judge s testimony  compelling. Judge Kavanaugh s testimony was compelling, convincing and credible. He should be confirmed and will make an outstanding Supreme Court Justice.Franklin Graham, son of the famed evangelist Billy Graham (and unrelated to Jack), called the hearing an embarrassment.Yesterday s hearing was an embarrassment. Let s pray that our country will do better than this. Judge Brett Kavanaugh said this has ruined his reputation and devastated his family. Unfortunately, I m afraid that is exactly what the minority leadership wanted to do.The leaders, many of whom are part of Trump s informal evangelical advisory board, have often chimed in on social media to support the president s policies and decisions. Overall, white evangelical Protestants have long been one of Trump s most reliable groups of supporters. Kavanaugh s nomination brought many evangelicals closer to a vision they held as they voted for Trump in 2016   a Supreme Court packed with conservative justices who could together restrict abortion access and promote other conservative Christian issues.A new Marist poll demonstrates just how far some evangelicals are willing to go to fulfill that vision. One question posed to the nearly 1,000 people surveyed between Sept. 22 and Sept. 24 asked whether Kavanaugh should be confirmed to the Supreme Court if Blasey s allegations against the judge are true. Of the 19 percent identified as white evangelical Christians, 48 percent said he should, while 36 percent said he shouldn t and 16 percent were unsure.Some evangelicals fear that their fellow believers  reactions to Blasey s allegations set a dangerous precedent for sexual abuse survivors. Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to speak out against former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar, has said part of the reason she waited for years to report her abuse was that she had watched fellow evangelicals  eviscerate  victims who spoke out against much-loved political candidates, pastors, teams or ministries.In a tweet thread last week, she said that her community s reactions showed her what they really thought about abuse and about victims. I knew it meant if faced with a choice between a survivor and their favorite  whatever,  they d attack the survivor,  she wrote.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Proceeding with the confirmation process without further investigation is not in the best interest of the Court or our profession,  said Dean Heather Gerken in a statement posted on Twitter.Dean Gerken Joins the ABA in Calling for Further Investigation. pic.twitter.com/SYAsVHwsi7Gerken echoed the ABA, which on Thursday urged the committee to delay a confirmation vote on Kavanaugh. We make this request because of the ABA s respect for the rule of law and due process under law,  it said in a letter to the committee.  The basic principles that underscore the Senate s constitutional duty of advice and consent on federal judicial nominees require nothing less than a careful examination of the accusations and facts by the FBI. Calls to delay the committee vote, which is taking place Friday, followed a grueling day of testimony Thursday from Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused the judge of sexually assaulting her when they were both in high school.Democrats on the committee have repeatedly urged the FBI to reopen its background investigation into Kavanaugh in the wake of allegations against him. Blasey had also called for an investigation before she would testify but ultimately agreed to move forward with Thursday s hearing.Kavanaugh is an alumnus of Yale Law School, where a growing number of students and alumni have denounced administrators for their rote support of the judge.The school was also thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks when HuffPost and subsequently The Guardian reported that two well-known law professors had told students seeking clerkships with Kavanaugh that he liked female clerks with a  certain look. Three of Kavanaugh s former classmates at the law school who previously endorsed the judge s nomination have since rescinded their support and said the allegations warrant a  fair and credible investigation.

David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Val Demings (D-Fla.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) told HuffPost they are now joining the colleagues in pushing for a probe. Of course we need an investigation,  Demings said.  This was never about politics, it is about finding the truth, despite all of the GOP s efforts to cover it up. ... Unless we have a credible, independent investigation, these allegations will be a dark cloud over Judge Kavanaugh, The Supreme Court, and the United States for decades to come.  Someone committed perjury under oath in the Senate Judiciary Committee and I think it was Judge Kavanaugh and therefore he should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and should not serve as a judge on any court,  said GutiÈrrez in a comment to HuffPost Friday. GutiÈrrez is retiring at the end of his term so will not be present for the next Congress.They join Reps. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) and Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is the ranking member of the committee. Any credible investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh must include testimony from Mark Judge. If  @senjudiciary<U+2069> refuses to do so, the House Judiciary Committe certainly should.  https://t.co/rrPpqafOKiDemocrats have a strong chance of retaking the House majority in the November elections, meaning they would have the power to push forward on an investigation   which could even lead to impeachment. Even if Kavanaugh doesn t get confirmed to the Supreme Court, he still has a lifetime appointment to the D.C. Circuit, which is widely considered to be the second-most powerful court in the nation.  If you stand with survivors, the path forward is clear: Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached   not promoted,  said Heidi Hess, co-director of the progressive group Credo Action.Johnson s support is key, because if Democrats regain control of the majority, he would become chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet. That subcommittee has the authority to subpoena witnesses and documents related to Kavanaugh. This whole process has stunk to high heaven,  Johnson told The Intercept.The other members of the Judiciary Committee did not return a request for comment, except Rep. Zoe Lofgren s (D-Calif.) office, which said it had no comment. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), refused to subpoena Mark Judge, whom Christine Blasey Ford has identified as a witness to the sexual assault she said was carried out against her by Kavanaugh.Ford and Kavanaugh testified before the committee on Thursday, and the senators will be moving forward to vote on the Supreme Court nominee Friday afternoon.

Archila is an executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, a progressive nonprofit group. She said in a statement after the confrontation that Flake  claims to support civility  but has proven  he would rather ignore women s stories and support a disrespectful sexual abuser than stick to his values. The Senate Judiciary Committee convened Friday morning for a vote on Kavanaugh. Flake entered the hearing room frowning. The senator was previously one of a few whose voting plans were unclear following Thursday s testimonies from Kavanaugh and Blasey. He stood up for Blasey on the Senate floor and criticized a comment from President Donald Trump that cast doubt on her claim because the alleged incident occurred more than three decades ago. I do not believe the claim of sexual assault is invalid because a 15-year-old girl didn t report the assault to authorities, as the president of the United States said just two days ago,  Flake said Thursday.  How uninformed and uncaring do we have to be to say things like that, much less believe them? Yet the senator said Friday in a statement that he ultimately decided to vote to confirm Kavanaugh because he had left the hearing the day before  with as much doubt as certainty.

The accusers and other witnesses should be questioned by the FBI and then be summoned to testify before the Judiciary Committee,  Dershowitz wrote in an op-ed for Fox News.  All sides have an interest in a full and thorough examination of these serious charges. Maybe we can get closer to the truth, although that is not certain,  he continued.  But right now there are too many unanswered questions to bring the confirmation of Kavanaugh   currently a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia   to a vote of the Judiciary Committee as scheduled on Friday, much less to a vote of the full Senate. Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton, contributes frequently to Fox News. He has repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of special counsel Robert Mueller s probe into the Trump campaign s ties to Russia. But on Thursday, he was firmly on the side of Democratic lawmakers who want the FBI to probe the allegations against Kavanaugh. Republican senators have refused to call for an investigation.To reinforce his point after both Blasey and Kavanaugh said with 100-percent certainty they were telling the truth, Dershowitz told a story about a rabbi: Acting as a marriage counselor, the rabbi hears the complaints of the wife and tells her she s right. He then affirms that the gripes of the husband are also justified. Finally, the rabbi s assistant turns to his mentor and says:  But rabbi, I don t understand. They can t possibly both be right! To which the rabbi answers:  My student, you re right too.  Is it possible that both Ford and Kavanaugh are truthfully stating what they honestly believe, but that one of them is honestly mistaken?  Dershowitz wrote. It is also possible that one of them is deliberately lying,  he noted.  Right now, there is no way of knowing for certain, which is why the FBI needs to talk to the judge s accusers and others. Dershowitz emphasized that the  burden of proof  was on the accusers, not the accused.Visit Fox News for the entire essay.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network estimated calls to its National Sexual Assault Hotline were 147 percent higher than usual, the organization tweeted Thursday. Wait times for callers were unprecedented, RAINN added. Upticks in calls to crisis hotlines are common when sexual assault is in the news, RAINN told Time, but Thursday s surge was huge. Calls to the hotline following the release of the  Access Hollywood  tape in which then-GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump bragged about grabbing women  by the pussy,  for example, jumped 33 percent.RAINN said the hotline s calls have increased 46 percent since Blasey s allegations were made public earlier this month, and 57 percent since a second woman, Deborah Ramirez, came forward in a New Yorker article published Sunday describing how Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in college.Blasey s gut-wrenching account of being attacked when she and Kavanaugh were high school students compelled many people to share their own assault experiences in ways both public and private. A 76-year-old woman   identified as Brenda from Valley Park, Missouri   phoned into C-SPAN during a 15-minute hearing recess, saying she was sexually molested in the second grade. This brings back so much pain,  she said.  I thought I was over it. But it s not. You will never forget it. You get confused and you don t understand it   but you never forget what happened to you. Blasey said she was 100-percent sure Kavanaugh was the one who assaulted her. He vehemently denied the accusations.The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on the Supreme Court nomination on Friday, despite repeated calls for an FBI investigation into Blasey s claims.Need help?

But she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday that she happened to see Judge working at a local Safeway just weeks later and that he appeared uncomfortable when she spoke to him.Blasey testified that Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, tried to remove her clothing and placed a hand over her mouth to stop her from yelling at a small gathering at a house. Judge was in the room when the alleged attack occurred, she said. Judge was not called to testify.Blasey recalled spotting Judge working at the Potomac Village Safeway store about  six to eight weeks  after the alleged attack  arranging the shopping carts.  She said he was  nervous  and  uncomfortable saying hello back  to her, and  looked ill,  she told the Senate Judiciary Committee.Judge s own words appear to back that up. He wrote in his 1997 memoir, Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk, that he worked for a few weeks as a bag boy at a  local supermarket  the  summer before his senior year  to  raise money for a football camp.  Both he and Kavanaugh were members of the football team of the all-male Georgetown Prep in Bethesda.Judge recalled in the memoir frequently being blind drunk at high school parties.  By now, even though I wasn t drinking every day, I was completely hooked. Going a week without getting drunk was unthinkable. I was spending between four and seven nights with the gang,  he noted. As for working, Judge wrote:  It was a nightmare. Invariably I would be hungover   or still drunk   when I got to work at seven in the morning, and I spent most of the first hour just trying to hold myself together. Judge graduated in 1983; the summer before would have been 1982. In addition, Kavanaugh marked off 10 days of football camp on his calendar beginning Aug. 22 in 1982. In an attempt to be more specific about the date of her alleged assault, Blasey suggested:  If we could find out when he [Judge] worked there [at Safeway], then I could provide a more detailed timeline about when the attack occurred. A customer service representative at the Potomac Safeway had no comment when asked about Judge by HuffPost. But Judge s job would have ended in time for football camp that summer. Six weeks before would have been in early July. On July 1, Kavanaugh s calendar notes   Go to Timmy s for Skis    possibly  brewskis     w/[Mark] Judge, Tom, PJ, Bernie, Squi.<U+2033>Judge has said he has no memory of the incident described by Blasey. Kavanaugh also wrote  beach week  on his 1982 calendar, beginning June 6.Judge devoted a section of his memoir to  beach week,  when Catholic high school students traditionally headed to the shore after school was out. During beach week, Judge wrote,  I had an opportunity to make some headway [with girls]. Most of the time everyone, including the girls, was drunk. If you could breathe and walk at the same time, you could hook up. Judge mentions the name  Kavanaugh  in his elementary school in his memoir. In another passage, he refers to a  Bart O Kavanaugh  in high school, who drank so much that he  passed out. In his yearbook his senior year, Judge wrote:  Bart, have you boofed yet?  Kavanaugh wrote the same year in his yearbook:  Mark have you boofed yet?  The Supreme Court nominee testified Thursday that  boofing  referred to  flatulence. Kavanaugh called Judge s memoir  fictionalized  in his testimony. It s touted on Amazon as a  coming-of-age memoir  in which the  author recounts his own struggles against alcoholism.

Emotionally, it was taxing,  Noah said of the hearing.  It was like a sad Super Bowl. Noah had kind words for Christine Blasey Ford, the California research psychologist who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they both were in high school. Even as Dr. Ford sat through hours of grueling questioning, being asked to remember the tiniest details of something that happened over three decades ago, she still managed to remain surprisingly gracious and agreeable,  Noah said.He also noted that Kavanaugh appeared to be extremely angry.

If Dr. Blasey s allegation is true, the assault and Judge Kavanaugh s denial of it mean that he should not be seated on the U.S. Supreme Court,  the magazine s editors wrote on Thursday. But even if the credibility of the allegation has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt and even if further investigation is warranted to determine its validity or clear Judge Kavanaugh s name, we recognize that this nomination is no longer in the best interests of the country,  they added.Blasey is the first of three women to accuse the Supreme Court nominee of sexual misconduct.America Magazine is a weekly magazine published by Jesuits, a Catholic religious order for men also known as the Society of Jesus. While we previously endorsed the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh on the basis of his legal credentials and his reputation as a committed textualist, it is now clear that the nomination should be withdrawn.https://t.co/CXqVGkaTdYAt the time of its endorsement, America Magazine s editors hailed Kavanaugh as the champion who could be the Supreme Court s fifth vote to overturn the ruling of Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in all 50 states.They described him as a constitutional  textualist who is suspicious of the kind of judicial innovation  that led to the ruling. The editors mused that his nomination would allow Catholics to transform the public s views on abortion, making it  an even less appealing choice.  Kavanaugh, a Catholic, was attending a Jesuit-run private school at the time of the alleged assault.But Blasey s testimony on Thursday apparently outweighed the magazine s fight against abortion.Blasey s testimony  clearly demonstrated both the seriousness of her allegation of assault by Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and the stakes of this question for the whole country,  the editors wrote.The magazine said that Kavanaugh s hearing was now more than a battle of policy issues:  The hearings and the committee s deliberations are now also a bellwether of the way the country treats women when their reports of harassment, assault and abuse threaten to derail the careers of powerful men. The magazine also warned Republicans on the committee against voting for Kavanaugh without investigating all of the women s claims. If Senate Republicans proceed with his nomination, they will be prioritizing policy aims over a woman s report of an assault,  they wrote.   Even if one thinks that Dr. Blasey s allegations are not credible, demonstrating them not to be would require further investigations and testimony,  the editors added. This would including calling additional witnesses and assessing further allegations against Judge Kavanaugh from other women, to which Republicans on the committee have been unwilling to commit and which would be divisive in any case.

And he really got into the role   in the hearing room he was that arrogant white prep school boy, grounded before Beach Week and fuming. It wasn t hard to imagine a younger Brett, all prickly entitlement, barking to his parents about the injustice of being told he can t go boofing on the shore with Squi.During his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the allegations of sexual assault made against him by Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh harangued the committee in a plaintive squawk. He seemed perpetually on the verge of tears   especially, for some inscrutable reason, when he lovingly recalled how well-organized his father s daily calendar was   yet also incandescent with partisan fury and petulance about the injustice being done to him.  And Republican men, from pundits to the president, apparently reveled in it. Those in the room, such as Sens. Lindsey Graham, Orrin Hatch and Ben Sasse, used their questioning time to apologize fulsomely to the judge and to shout imprecations against government overreach, Democratic perfidy and the great cruelty being done to Kavanaugh by investigating credible assault allegations against him prior to confirming him to a lifetime seat on the highest court in the nation. Kavanaugh s testimony stemmed from accusations of a male bonding session gone too far. On Thursday, the nation saw another one, of another kind, in progress.The torrent of allegations and recollections about Kavanaugh s high school and college days has been a grim reminder of how cruelly girls and women suffer at the hands of boys and men who bond by laughing at their expense. During Kavanaugh s testimony, we saw an equally ugly mirror image: men bonding through performative anger and hostility   again, at the expense of women.Where Blasey, soft-spoken and gracious, assiduously courted the goodwill of both Republican and Democratic senators   laughing at their jokes, patiently allowing them to complete questions and graciously asking for clarification when she didn t understand them, apologizing to them for any inconveniences or misunderstandings   Kavanaugh burst into his testimony with a pout screwed to his flushed face, the look of a man who has just discovered his S-Class has been keyed. He was ready to brawl   elementary-schoolyard style, with gratuitous sniffling and eye-rolling. He accused Democrats in his opening statement of executing  a calculated and orchestrated political hit,  perhaps as  revenge on behalf of the Clintons.  When Democratic senators   four of them women   questioned Kavanaugh, his physical reactions were bizarrely juvenile; he squirmed and grimaced and made wounded eyes much like an aggrieved 8-year-old denied a long-awaited trip to Dairy Queen because he shoved his sister. He interrupted their questions to complain, in tones rising nearly to a shout, that these allegations were  sprung  on him at the last minute, or to ask them forlornly if they also liked beer.In one particularly insolent exchange, he responded to Sen. Amy Klobuchar s question as to whether he d ever drunk so much that he couldn t remember the next day what had happened by turning the question back on her   twice. Needless to say, whether the Minnesota Democrat has ever been blackout drunk bears no relevance to Kavanaugh s Supreme Court appointment, nor was it Kavanaugh s place to ask her questions during the hearing. (After a brief break, having perhaps been informed that the optics on this were spectacularly poor, he reopened the hearing by apologizing to her.)But Kavanaugh, like Blasey, was courting the goodwill of his audience   at least of the audience that mattered to him. Where her anger would have irritated and alienated them, his braced them. Robin Lakoff, professor emerita of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, characterized his behavior as  hostile, angry, bullying, uncooperative,  and noted in an email to HuffPost that  when a man, especially a powerful and entitled one, acts that way, it strengthens him in the eyes of many: he s manly, strong, and credible.  President Donald Trump, a summa cum laude graduate of this particular school of masculinity, reportedly disliked Kavanaugh s restrained, anodyne interview Monday on Fox News. The judge s little-boy-in-a-big-suit tantrum was transparently pitched toward the president, and reports indicate that it worked.Meanwhile, from the hearing room, the men were whipped into a himpathetic fury.  What you want to do is destroy this guy s life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020,  Graham hissed at his Democratic colleagues, his lip curling in a sneer.  This is the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics. And if you really wanted to know the truth, you sure as hell wouldn t have done what you ve done to this guy.  This is worse than Clarence Thomas. I didn t think it could get any worse than that,  Hatch said to Kavanaugh.  This is a national disgrace, the way you re being treated. It seemed that witnessing visible anger on his behalf from Republican senators was the only thing that could bring Kavanaugh any measure of equanimity. Afterward, he was able to briefly smile or even joke during questioning. Their anger validated his own quivering rage; it clarified his apparent conviction that he is a victim.  You re right to be angry,  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told Kavanaugh repeatedly during his questioning.The hearing was a celebration of male anger   the power of anger to bring men together, to reinforce their certainty about what is owed to them as men and, of course, to sweep women s anger and pain to the side. Kavanaugh and the Republican senators rarely addressed Blasey or her credibility directly; rather confusingly, the party line was that she, too, was a victim, and that they bore no ill will toward her. During Blasey s own testimony, she described in agonizing detail how she recalled Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge laughing as the future judge lay on top of her, covering her mouth with his hand and attempting to wrench off her clothes.  You ve never forgotten them laughing at you,  Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said as he questioned her.  They were laughing with each other,  she replied, making a precise distinction.  I was underneath one of them while the two laughed. Two friends having a really good time with one another. The assault and their laughter were indeed at her expense, but for those two boys, it wasn t about her. On Thursday, Kavanaugh and the Senate Republicans tried to get righteously angry without attacking a very sympathetic and credible accuser. Instead, they revealed that their anger, like that laughter 36 years ago, isn t even about her. Like everything else, it s all about them."

We make this request because of the ABA s respect for the rule of law and due process under law,  reads the letter, a copy of which was obtained by HuffPost.  The basic principles that underscore the Senate s constitutional duty of advice and consent on federal judicial nominees require nothing less than a careful examination of the accusations and facts by the FBI. The move is extraordinary in that the ABA gave Kavanaugh a unanimous  well-qualified  rating for the Supreme Court nomination, and the federal judge has boasted that he was  thoroughly vetted  by the lawyers  group.The letter, signed by ABA President Robert Carlson, came just hours after Kavanaugh testified before the judiciary panel in light of recent allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford at a gathering when they were both teenagers in the 1980s. Blasey, who also spoke on Thursday, claimed that a young Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, attempted to take off her clothes and put his hand over her mouth to the point that she thought he was  accidentally going to kill  her.Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the allegation, telling lawmakers on Thursday that the claim, alongside those of two other women, were  a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election. Republican members of the judiciary commitee said they still planned to move forward with a vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation Friday morning. After the tally, the nomination will move to a procedural vote in the full Senate on Saturday, although it s unclear if the judge has the 50 votes needed to open debate on his confirmation on the chamber floor.The ABA signaled in its letter that the nomination process was being rushed through without an appropriate investigation, effectively siding with Democrats who have called for the Justice Department to look into Blasey s claims.  Each appointment to our nation s Highest Court (as with all others) is simply too important to rush to a vote,  the letter, shown above, says.  Deciding to proceed without conducting additional investigation would not only have a lasting impact on the Senate s reputation, but it will also negatively affect the great trust necessary for the American people to have in the Supreme Court. It concludes:  It must remain an institution that will reliably follow the law and not politics. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The Republicans  constant sniping and their obvious attempts to obstruct the process and brush Ford aside did not deter her in any way,  Meyers said.  Her testimony today was a towering act of courage given the trauma she s survived. Her grace and composure under unimaginable pressure, which she owed no one, was stunning. At one point, Dr. Ford, a research psychologist, literally explained to the panel how memory works. Meyers was also impressed with Blasey s intellect. She s in the middle of testifying in the intense glare of the national spotlight about an alleged sexual assault by a Supreme Court nominee and she just taught everyone how the brain works,  Meyers said of her answer to a question about how she could be sure that Kavanaugh had been her attacker.  She gave a detailed anatomy of the hippocampus and the memory centers of the brain to a group of guys who look like they eat brains.

One was one of his  closest friends to this day  who confided in him that she was a sexual abuse survivor, another his mother. He mentioned his wife, talked about his daughters. At one point, he literally listed women he s known:  Amy or Julie or Kristen or Karen or Suzanne or Moira or Megan or Nikki. Using women as shields is a well-known tactic to refute reports of gendered harassment or violence. It s a perverse idea, if you really consider it: If a man doesn t harm all the women around him, how could he have ever harmed one (or three)? It s cousin to the  I m the son of a mother  defense and akin to  I can t be racist, my best friend is black! Kavanaugh is good at using this device. He s been doing it for a while. I keep thinking about the high school girls basketball team that Kavanaugh coaches. He mentioned them in his opening statement during the original round of hearings into his nomination for Supreme Court justice:  For the past seven years, I have coached my daughters  basketball teams. I love coaching. All the girls I have coached are awesome. Two days later, on the third day of the hearings, current and former players of the girls high school basketball team that he coaches sat behind him. The New York Times described them as being  in blue sweaters, ponytails and plaid skirts.  According to the Times,  Kavanaugh introduced each of them, rattling off their names and, in a remarkable display of memory not devoted to legal precedent, their grades.  Then the room burst into applause.There was something troubling about the parading of these girls at the time. Kavanaugh was under intense scrutiny, in part, because of the concern that, if put onto the highest bench in the land, he will rule against reproductive rights. That very day at the hearing, abortion and whether Roe v. Wade was settled law were center stage. He wanted us to believe that because he coaches these girls and is kind to them and thinks they are awesome that we shouldn t worry that he would rule against their rights. But his judicial record and his emails suggest otherwise.But now, a few weeks later, multiple people have come forward and told stories about how disrespectful Kavanaugh was to girls in high school and college (his high school yearbook alone is disgusting, no matter how much he tried to argue otherwise at the hearing). There have been reports about how he likes his law clerks   which he told us Thursday were a lot of women   to look a certain way.I can t help but think that, based on statistics, some of those girls in Kavanaugh s life are already sexual assault survivors; some of them will be in their lifetime (usually by someone who knows them well). They have now participated, whether they understood it that way, in trying to clean up the past (and assure the future) of this man whom one woman says assaulted her in high school, another he made fun of in his yearbook, both to impress high school boys. They have had to listen to so many people say over the last week or so that boys assaulting girls is normal, something all boys do, and what does it really matter anyway.And all this is because they wanted to play basketball and their coach ended up being brought under scrutiny.But Thursday, when Kavanaugh brought them up (which, of course, he did), it wasn t to lament about their futures or to worry over their health or safety, or refute the  boys will be boys  narrative that has been flung around without care and will likely haunt them in their school years and beyond. It was to complain that because of professor Blasey s testimony and the reporting that has happened since her story became public, he  may never be able to coach again.  Apparently, the inconvenience to his life is worth more than the trauma women will face throughout their own lives.Stop telling us about the women you know, the ones you have been nice to, the ones you haven t harmed, how great a guy you are because you, unlike the rest of the world, didn t treat some women like shit. We are not your armor. We are not your excuse. We are not your female assistants who will step in to do your dirty work when you don t have the guts to question a sexual assault survivor yourself or when you fail to put any women from your party on the judiciary committee, ever (shame on Phoenix prosecutor Rachel Mitchell for participating Thursday).Right at the end of the hearing, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) asked Kavanaugh,  Do you agree that it is possible for men to both be friends with some women and treat other women badly?  Kavanaugh responded that it is and then, again, reiterated that he s been friends with women since he was 14. He knows the deal, he just finds the invisible armor much too comfy and much too useful to let it go.

She received skeptical media attention at that time, and several polls found that the American public didn t believe her. Now, with the Me Too movement bringing greater scrutiny to bad men in politics, media and business    and even ending their careers   journalists have revisited Broaddrick s story and found it more credible. Even Democratic voters now say they believe the sexual assault or harassment allegations against Clinton. For that, Broaddrick is glad.  It s so much better now,  she told HuffPost, saying she particularly liked a 2017 New York Times op-ed by Michelle Goldberg.  I have so many that are in the middle and on the left that understand I am telling the truth.  But Broaddrick was in Washington on Thursday not just to tell her own story   she d also come to cast doubt on another woman s sexual assault claim, giving interviews to reporters at a Concerned Women for America rally in support of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Inside the nearby Dirksen Senate Office Building, Christine Blasey Ford was preparing to testify that Kavanaugh had pinned her on a bed and groped her when they were both high school students in the early 1980s.  I believed he was going to rape me,  Blasey told the Senate Judiciary Committee.  I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most and has had the most lasting impact on my life. Broaddrick said Democrats were hypocrites for choosing to elevate Blasey s claims Thursday after disregarding Broaddrick s two decades ago.  If you can listen to accusations like this, how can you not have listened to me back then?  she said. Specifically, Broaddrick said Senate Democrats refused to read a deposition she d given investigators into Clinton s misconduct. Broaddrick s allegation had been omitted from the articles of impeachment that passed the House in 1998, however, which focused on his committing perjury while president, and only surfaced after the Senate acquitted Clinton the following year.Broaddrick has become increasingly outspoken as a conservative. She told BuzzFeed she voted for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 but in 2016 she was one of Republican nominee Donald Trump s guests at a debate with Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton. There are some similarities between Broaddrick s and Blasey s stories. Both women waited decades to come forward about the alleged abuse. Both said they felt forced to reveal their identities because of pressure from investigative reporters. But Broaddrick said her own story, that Clinton raped her in an Arkansas motel room in 1978, is more credible, largely because several other people confirmed she told them about the incident shortly after it allegedly happened. Blasey waited more than 30 years before telling anyone. She first disclosed the assault in a 2012 therapy session with her husband. The fact that nobody said they heard about Blasey s assault around the time it occurred, Broaddrick said, is why she finds it unbelievable.  You compare that with mine   data, dates, people I told, injuries,  she said, referring to her claim that Clinton bit her lip. I think she s casting a very dark shadow on real victims,  Broaddrick said. Republicans have said the lack of contemporaneous corroborating evidence is Blasey s biggest problem. Her lawyers provided sworn affidavits from her husband and three friends who said they d heard her mention she d been assaulted by Kavanaugh before he was nominated to the Supreme Court, but all the testimonials are from 2012 or later. Those are not people who witnessed the alleged event,  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told HuffPost.  All the people she identified as witnessing the alleged event said they can t confirm it.  The only person other person Blasey said was in the room was Mark Judge, a classmate of Kavanaugh s who has said he never saw the judge behave in the way Blasey described. But Republicans have shown little interest in getting further testimony from Judge, a conservative writer. Broaddrick said she hadn t heard about the people who ve said Blasey told them about her allegation before Kavanaugh became Trump s nominee.  I ll have to read up on that,  she said.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) claimed that his unprecedented decision to  hire  Mitchell was  to de-politicize the process and get to the truth, instead of grandstanding and giving senators an opportunity to launch their presidential campaigns. I spent years helping choreograph congressional oversight committee hearings, and not once would we have entertained the tactic of bringing in a hired gun to question our witnesses in place of our own members. The reason why is because it would not have been an effective way to get to the truth of anything.If Thursday s hearing was really about truth, Grassley would not have already scheduled a vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation for Friday morning. If Thursday s hearing was really about the truth, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick would have been allowed to tell their stories as well. If Thursday s hearing was really about the truth, key witnesses like Mark Judge would have been called to testify.Republicans  calculation in using Mitchell had nothing to do with the truth, as they falsely professed. It was that a woman questioning a woman would serve them better politically than a panel of Republican men cross-examining a sexual assault victim on national television.Traditionally, the rules and structure of congressional hearings benefit the members. As we saw during Kavanaugh s own session before the Senate Judiciary Committee, members tend to use their time to filibuster and give political speeches. It s a tactic that allows them to establish context and reinforce certain themes and narratives throughout the hearing. But because Senate Republicans changed the way they would question Blasey, they ended up illustrating just how much of a charade this whole hearing was.As Blasey s remarkable and compelling appearance unfolded, it became evident that the deliberate absence of other witnesses and accusers was just as much a burden for Mitchell as it was for Blasey. To Mitchell s credit   and much to the Republicans  chagrin   she approached her questioning the way any prosecutor would, by pointedly asking questions with minimal editorializing. Yet given the format of the hearing, she had little to work with. She spent much of her time questioning the authenticity of Blasey s fear of flying or who paid for the administration of a polygraph exam, but in no way did her contributions to the proceeding bring the committee closer to the truth.As Kavanaugh s turn to testify arrived and it became clear that Mitchell wasn t the ringer they had hoped for, Republicans benched her. Senators like Ted Cruz (R-Texas), John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who had been sitting silently during Blasey s testimony, suddenly found their voices and offered lengthy soliloquies defending Kavanaugh. So much for Grassley s line about  getting to the truth  to prevent  grandstanding for political purposes. Other Senate Republicans like Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who excoriated his Democratic colleagues as  despicable,  had already said Blasey s testimony wouldn t change his vote. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared on Tuesday that  we re going to be moving forward. I m confident we re going to win, confident that he ll be confirmed in the very near future. And that s the thing ñ Republicans saw this hearing all through the lens of winning and losing. To them, allegations of sexual misconduct and gang rape are obstacles they must overcome to win their game. It doesn t matter if the allegations are true or not, as long as they win.Senate Republicans unilaterally made the decision to limit the hearing to just Blasey and Kavanaugh. Republicans brought in Mitchell for the optics, set up a sham hearing that excluded essential witnesses she could have questioned, and the minute they felt they were on the losing end of things, had her stand aside.The bottom line is Senate Judiciary Republicans couldn t find the courage to ask Blasey any questions   but had no problem finding their voices to run interference and defend Kavanaugh. That inequity should tell you all you need to know about what unfolded on Thursday.Kurt Bardella is the former spokesperson and senior adviser for the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee and U.S. Sen.

I wish that I could be more helpful,  she said.Blasey, a remarkably brave woman who agreed to be grilled in front of the entire nation about her greatest trauma   an attempted rape she says was perpetrated by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when they were both in high school   wished that she could be more helpful.Throughout her four-hour testimony, Blasey s sincere desire to accommodate those around her was made clear in the words she used. She apologized for misspeaking, even about small details like visiting her family in Delaware, not D.C. She reiterated to the committee that her motivation in coming forward was  to be helpful,  that she was used to being  collegial. The research psychologist repeatedly thanked Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) for allowing her to be there and double checked that her allotted break times worked for him. At one point, she told him that she would have been  happy to host  him in her home state of California.For countless women watching Blasey, these gestures struck a chord. Every knee-jerk  thank you  and  I m sorry  felt like words so many had uttered before, part of a familiar display of courtesy we d all performed at some point   out of sheer necessity. Out of a desire to make other people, not ourselves, feel comfortable at all costs.Over the course of those four hours, Blasey didn t yell. She didn t betray an ounce of rage, even though she had every right to be very, very, very angry. She told the Senate Judiciary Committee that her decision to come forward publicly meant that her  greatest fears have been realized. And yet she did not interrupt anyone during the hearing. She laughed at Grassley s bad jokes about coffee. She was kind and respectful to the senators who questioned her.That s because Blasey, a longtime academic and human woman on Earth, knows what it costs women to deviate from being pleasant and cooperative. If you are a woman who hopes to be taken seriously in a world where women are still fighting to be taken seriously, to be considered reliable narrators of their own traumas, you have to modulate your behavior to accommodate those in power   in this case, and in most cases, white men in power. So many women are conditioned to present in public the way that Blasey did: courteous, calm and vulnerable. It s  routinized,  as Deborah Tannen, professor of linguistics at Georgetown University and author of You re the Only One I Can Tell, put it. It s all part of the self-presentation of being self-effacing and considerate and helpful,  she explained.  Those are characteristics that are expected of women. And women who don t show those characteristics will be judged negatively. Unhappiness and suffering and pain are emotions that are acceptable in women. Anger is an emotion that s not.  The thing that guts me about Dr. Blasey s  niceness  is that she has no choice. If she, for one second, betrays that she dislikes the men who tried to rape her or the men trying to defend them, SHE will be cast as the abusive, violent party in the exchange.From an early age, girls learn that authority figures will reward them for being amenable and punish them for being  too  assertive. Studies have shown that girls and women apologize far more than boys and men do, that girls are more likely than boys to be praised for  being good.  They learn, as Soraya Chemaly wrote in her new book exploring female anger, Rage Becomes Her, to smile as a way to  sooth the people around [them], a facial adaptation to the expectation that we put others first, preserve social connections, and hide our disappointment, frustration, anger, or fear. This sentiment was echoed by Tannen.  Girls learn very early on that they get bad responses if they are not self-effacing, apologetic,  oh, little old me,   she said.Not only are girls rewarded for their accommodating tone and behavior, but they are also taught that this kind of comportment might literally stave off violence. They learn to be constantly vigilant about their environments and potential threats in those environments, and to adjust their behavior accordingly. For many grown women, they learn to prioritize the comfort of men as a result, especially powerful men. We are so busy teaching girls to be likable,  wrote Chemaly,  that we often forget to teach them, as we do boys, that they should be respected. Unlike women, men can yell their way to respect. Their anger is viewed as powerful, no matter how misdirected or unhinged it is. In stark contrast to Blasey s steady testimony, Kavanaugh came out with metaphorical guns blazing. He yelled. He interrupted. He talked back to Democratic senators, even asking Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) whether she drank to the point of memory loss.If Blasey s comportment had mirrored Kavanaugh s,  she would have been excoriated,  said Tannen.  She would have been seen as a Valkyrie. She had to be composed. Everything about her was pulling in on herself. Everything about him was expansive and explosive. For too many of the thousands of American women watching today s hearing, this contrast felt uncomfortably familiar. To see this dynamic   her contained politeness, his blazing rage   play out on the national stage, when the stakes are so high, was nothing short of excruciatingly painful. Women have spent millennia being polite, even in the face of overwhelming pain and trauma. So many women have spent their lives trying to figure out the right way to behave in order to be taken seriously. The right way to be forceful without being disliked. The right way to protect themselves in a world that often shows how little they are valued.Politeness, on its face, can be a good thing. Expecting at least the performance of kindness between fellow citizens seems like a no-brainer. But when only one gender is expected to act accordingly, when men are bound by no such conventions and face no consequences for violating norms, women s politeness is essentially weaponized against them.

The committee heard from accuser Christine Blasey Ford for more than four hours Thursday morning, during which she recounted an allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school in the 1980s. Kavanaugh, in his own testimony, vehemently denied the claim, saying in his opening remarks that there had been  a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything to block my confirmation. After Friday s vote, the nomination will move to a procedural vote before the full Senate on Saturday morning. It s unclear if Kavanaugh has the 50 votes needed to open debate on the Senate floor on his confirmation.Judiciary Committee holding vote on Kavanaugh nomination tomorrow, with a motion to proceed on Senate floor on Saturday, Cassidy saysSenate Republicans came to the judge s defense throughout his remarks, apologizing on his behalf and lambasting their Democratic colleagues. What you want to do is destroy this guy s life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020,  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in response to a line of questioning from Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).  This is the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics. And if you really wanted to know the truth, you sure as hell wouldn t have done what you ve done to this guy. President Donald Trump also weighed in within minutes of the hearing s end, tweeting out his support for Kavanaugh and saying the judge s remarks  showed America exactly why I nominated him.  His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting,  the president wrote.  Democrats  search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist. The Senate must vote! Democrats used their 5-minute rounds of inquiry Thursday to ask about reports of Kavanaugh s behavior with alcohol in school and his relationship with his friend Mark Judge, whom Blasey said witnessed the alleged assault. He also was repeatedly questioned about whether he d be willing to request an FBI investigation into Blasey s allegation. Kavanaugh sidestepped those efforts and remained defensive, at times growing outraged in his remarks. This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record,  he said in his opening statement.  Revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups. This is a circus. Blasey s own remarks and her account of the alleged sexual assault were emotional, but she remained unequivocal in her characterization of the night. Asked how firmly she believed Kavanaugh was the one who attacked her that night, she replied:  One hundred percent.  Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense,  Blasey said of Kavanaugh and Judge when responding to a question about her most vivid memory of the encounter.  I was underneath one of them while the two laughed. Two friends having a really good time with one another. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The results, released publicly on Wednesday, showed her answers were  not indicative of deception.  Polygraphs are extremely unreliable indicators of truthfulness   but they also happen to be a tool that Kavanaugh vouched for in one of his opinions on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a case involving a Ph.D. student who had filed several Freedom of Information Act requests for her dissertation on polygraph bias. The court case centered on whether the student qualified for reduced FOIA fees   the panel decided that she did   but the panel also weighed in on the Defense Department s decision to withhold certain reports about polygraph exams. In his opinion, Kavanaugh concluded that polygraphs are a valuable tool for the government to determine credibility and decide who should be allowed to handle classified information. As the Government notes, law enforcement agencies use polygraphs to test the credibility of witnesses and criminal defendants. Those agencies also use polygraphs to  screen applicants for security clearances so that they may be deemed suitable for work in critical law enforcement, defense, and intelligence collection roles.  The Government has satisfactorily explained how polygraph examinations serve law enforcement purposes.The government was right to block public disclosure of details about the effectiveness of polygraphs, Kavanaugh wrote at the time: Second, the reports contain information about techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations. As the Government points out, the reports detail whether a particular agency s polygraph procedures and techniques are effective. The reports identify strengths and weaknesses of particular polygraph programs. In describing the effectiveness of polygraph techniques and procedures, the reports necessarily would disclose information about the underlying techniques and procedures themselves, including when the agencies are likely to employ them.Polygraphs, often erroneously called lie detector tests, measure changes in the subject s physiology, including pulse, blood pressure, breathing rate and perspiration. Nervous test takers can produce a polygraph that suggests they are lying when they are telling the truth, and confident test takers can find ways to beat a polygraph and lie without detection. Because of this, polygraphs are not allowed to be used as evidence in court in many jurisdictions. But law enforcement and government agencies continue to use the controversial tests, and the government closely guards internal reporting about polygraphs  reliability. Blasey s polygraph results do not prove that she is telling the truth about Kavanaugh. But her decision to subject herself to the invasive, anxiety-inducing procedure does show her effort to exhaust all available means of proving that she s telling the truth. Asked by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) on Thursday if he had taken a polygraph test, Kavanaugh said he had not. No, I ll do whatever the committee wants. Of course, those are not admissible in federal court,  he said, knowing that the Republican-controlled committee was unlikely to instruct him to take a polygraph.  They re not admissible in federal court because they are not reliable, as you know.   H/t to Joe Patrice, who first flagged Kavanaugh s 2016 opinion and his views on polygraphs.

A good judge must be an umpire   a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy   I don t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences,  Kavanaugh said at the hearing, echoing memorable lines that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts delivered during his confirmation hearing in 2005. When asked several times to comment on particular issues of the day, Kavanaugh declined, telling senators he would not  get within three zip codes  of a political controversy, and that judges ought to be  above politics; we stay out of it. The version of Kavanaugh that appeared at Thursday s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he denied allegations of sexual assault leveled against him by three women in recent weeks, however, was starkly different from his description of the role of a neutral third party. Using some of the most partisan language a Supreme Court nominee has used in the modern era, Kavanaugh angrily accused Democrats of engaging in a  calculated and orchestrated political hit  that was animated by  anger at [President Donald] Trump  over the 2016 presidential election, as well as  revenge on behalf of  Bill and Hillary Clinton.Democrats said the extraordinary claims from Kavanaugh, whom President George W. Bush appointed to the D.C. Circuit Court in 2006, made him appear more like a partisan warrior rather than a fair-minded judge who will be required to hear from litigants before the court objectively and with an open mind. It is hard to imagine this person being objective and fair on the Supreme Court,  Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) tweeted on Thursday amid Kavanaugh s opening statement. Ron Brownstein, an editor for The Atlantic, echoed the sentiment. It s reasonable to ask how does #Kavanaugh continue serving as a federal judge, much less on #SCOTUS after delivering such an openly partisan attack and identifying so unequivocally as an opponent of the Dem Party? He has validated those who see him as a GOP operative in a robeDespite Kavanaugh s attempts to portray himself otherwise, he has been involved in partisan Republican politics for decades. He spent more than three years working on Ken Starr s investigations into President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, urging prosecutors to question the then president in graphic detail about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, including things like oral sex, masturbation and phone sex. He pushed for expanding the Whitewater investigation during Clinton s presidency to include looking at the death of White House staffer Vince Foster, which remains a subject of conservative conspiracy theories. Kavanaugh was also involved with George W. Bush s legal team in the 2000 recount.His appearances in some of the biggest political flashpoints in modern American history prompted one Democratic senator in 2004 to describe him as the  Forrest Gump of Republican politics. Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee pressed Kavanaugh during Thursday s hearing to explain whether he believed Christine Blasey Ford   who testified earlier in the day that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school while they were both teens   was also a part of an orchestrated left-wing conspiracy, which he claimed in his opening statement had sought to derail his nomination.  I don t know her, but I ve also said that we bear no ill will towards her,  Kavanaugh told Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), referring to Blasey.Asked again by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kavanaugh faulted the Judiciary Committee, who he said  destroyed  her confidentiality.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The senator explained how Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault in high school, has four degrees   including a doctorate from the University of Southern California   and has published more than 65 peer-reviewed articles. Feinstein concluded by saying Blasey is also a wife and a mother of two sons. The subtext of the senator s flattering remarks was clear: Blasey s degrees and, by extension, her socioeconomic background, should make her a credible accuser. But in reality, many sexual assault survivors are nothing like Blasey. And because many of them are minorities from low-income backgrounds, their accusations are not taken seriously.Regardless of her privileged background, there s no doubt that Blasey has gone through one of the hardest days of her life. She was interrogated on national television about her most painful memories, without being given the due process of a full investigation. But the fact that she appeared at a hearing in the first place, that her allegations were taken seriously enough to potentially derail Kavanaugh s nomination, has a lot to do with her being the  right  kind of accuser.Blasey is an upper-middle class woman with a prestigious job and a sparkling education. She is an extremely articulate psychologist who, throughout the hearing, proved she understands the science of trauma better than most people in the room.She also looks and acts the part of someone whom Republican members of the committee   11 male senators   would deem  credible.  She has been married to her husband for 16 years and grew up in an affluent Washington, D.C., suburb. She is a white, blonde woman dressed in a blue blazer. In her testimony, she was apologetic, deferential and polite, even telling the committee she is  used to being collegial. But many sexual assault survivors are not from a privileged sphere. Though experts note that sexual violence data is incomplete because so many victims don t report, a recent study found that 44 percent of sexual assault reports are made by people with incomes of less than $25,000 a year   even though this demographic makes up only 22 percent of all households.Offenders are known to prey on marginalized victims because they have fewer resources and are more likely to be dismissed by lawyers and police. One-third of Native American women have been sexually assaulted, compared to the national statistic of 1 in 6 women, and a recent poll by National Public Radio found that Native American victims are afraid to report the incidents because they fear discrimination. Sex workers experience one of the highest levels of sexual assault   between 45 to 75 percent are victims of physical or sexual violence, according to one study   but the crimes are often dismissed by authorities as a job hazard. The rate is even higher for transgender sex workers.The most vulnerable victims, those who are most in need of protection, are the least likely to be believed. Lisalyn Jacobs, a steering committee member for the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, says low-income victims might not report their assaults because they don t trust the legal system to take them seriously.  [They think],  I present as this poor person. Who is going to find me credible and worthwhile?   Jacobs says.  I think that is definitely a reality that low-income women struggle with.  Linda Williams, co-director of the Justice and Gender Based Violence Research Initiative at the Wellesley Centers for Women, says that lawyers can be more hesitant to take on the cases of marginalized victims. She says prosecutors might think,  I can only take cases forward that I think are going to be winnable. And the jury is going to be less likely to believe a woman who is poor and homeless and not well-spoken, or who maybe won t show up for the trial. While powerful accusers such as Ashley Judd and Gretchen Carlson have helped take down their high-profile abusers, the multiple black women and girls who have accused R. Kelly of statutory rape and abuse over the past few decades have not managed to derail his career to the same extent. Critics of Me Too have pointed out how the movement has amplified the experiences of rich white women, while forgetting about the domestic workers, restaurant workers and farmworkers who are often low-income people of color. And Anita Hill, the black woman who accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, was vilified and isolated to a greater degree than Blasey was because of her race.  Anita Hill was deemed less credible as a woman of color,  says Jacobs.  She was a lawyer and is now an academic.  There is no doubt that today is historic. It s momentous and heartbreaking to watch any woman talk about her trauma in front of a national audience. But it s worth remembering that Blasey is not the average sexual assault accuser   and that if it weren t for her privileged background, she might not have been given a seat in today s hearing.  If someone came forward who was a housekeeper in a hotel where an individual had stayed and they were a person of color or an immigrant, would it have even gotten this far?  said Williams.  I think likely not. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting. Democrats  search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist. The Senate must vote!The president was noticeably silent on Twitter throughout the daylong hearing, during which both Blasey and Kavanaugh offered tearful testimony. Immediately after the hearing ended, Trump called Kavanaugh s testimony  powerful, honest and riveting,  while calling Blasey s accusations part of a political tactic by Democrats. He echoed Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who during the hearing went on a tangent about Blasey s allegations being a  sham  leveled by Democrats on the committee. I would never do to them what you ve done to this guy,  Graham yelled.  This is the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics. And if you really wanted to know the truth, you sure as hell wouldn t have done what you ve done to this guy. Thursday s hearing was a critical moment for the Me Too movement, hinging on whether U.S. politicians believe women like Blasey and Kavanaugh s other alleged victims, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick; whether allegations of sexual assault can or should affect a Supreme Court confirmation; whether speaking out against powerful men is worth the inevitable backlash.It was no surprise that Trump chimed in about the hearing. He s publicly defended Kavanaugh and lashed out at Blasey since she went public with her allegation that Kavanaugh forced himself on her at a party in high school. In a Twitter tirade last week, Trump wondered why Blasey never called the cops (victims of rape and sexual assault rarely do) and why nobody reached out to the FBI (you re not supposed to). He accused Democrats of playing a  con game  and making  false accusations.  He said Kavanaugh was  an absolute gem  who had been  treated very unfairly. The president also argued that Ramirez  has nothing  against Kavanaugh because  She was totally messed up. She admits she was drunk.  Ramirez accused the nominee of thrusting his penis in her face when they were freshmen at Yale in the  80s. Trump has said little about Swetnick, who stated in a sworn declaration prior to Thursday s hearing that Kavanaugh and others in his circle would spike beverages at parties and  target  particular women in attendance. Swetnick said she was raped at a party where Kavanaugh was present.Trump s swipes at Kavanaugh s accusers demonstrate why many victims don t share their stories of assault or seek help. Blasey s closest friends have said she was hesitant to come forward with her story because she feared these very attacks.Despite being forced to spar with the president online and endure threats and harassment, Blasey announced on Sunday that she would indeed testify about her accusations against Kavanaugh. We committed to moving forward with an open hearing,  wrote Blasey s lawyers in a statement.  Despite actual threats to her safety and her life, Dr. Ford believes it is important for Senators to hear directly from her about the sexual assault committed against her. This is a developing story.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), minutes after she mentioned that her father had experienced alcohol addiction.The Minnesota Democrat asked Kavanaugh whether he had ever drunk so much that he  couldn t remember what happened or part of what happened the night before.  No, I remember what happened,  Kavanaugh responded.  And I think you ve probably had beers, senator. Klobuchar pressed him further.  So you re saying there s never been a case where you drank so much that you didn t remember what happened the night before or part of what happened?  You re talking about blackout. I don t know. Have you?  he shot back.The issue of Kavanaugh s drinking has arisen in the wake of allegations from several women that he sexually assaulted them decades ago. In at least two of the alleged incidents, the women said they remembered Kavanaugh being severely drunk.On Thursday, the Judiciary Committee heard testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor who has alleged Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school. Blasey said in her testimony she recalled Kavanaugh being  very inebriated  at the time of the alleged assault.Kavanaugh has since admitted that he may have  had too many  drinks on occasion but denied he ever drank to the point of blacking out   a claim several former classmates have disputed. Drinking is one thing, but the concern is about truthfulness,  Klobuchar said.The senator continued to try to get a direct answer from Kavanaugh regarding whether he had ever blacked out from drinking. The judge once again turned the question around on Klobuchar, prompting her to reply:  I have no drinking problem. Sen. Amy Klobuchar asks Brett Kavanaugh if he has ever blacked out from drinking, and he turns the question back on her.Kavanaugh:  You are asking about a blackout. I don t know. Have you? Klobuchar:  Could you answer the question, judge? https://t.co/9FalHY71EC pic.twitter.com/ptnGHHYussKlobuchar began her questioning of Kavanaugh by saying that her father has experienced alcoholism in his life and is a member of Alcoholics Anonymous to this day.After a short recess following the interaction with Klobuchar, Kavanaugh apologized to the senator. I m sorry I did that,  he said.  This is a tough process. Klobuchar responded:  When you have a parent who s an alcoholic, you re pretty careful about drinking.

The Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy,  he said angrily in his opening remarks.  Since my nomination in July, there has been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything to block my confirmation. The dirty politics Kavanaugh is alleging should be no surprise to him, since he spent part of his career in that world. Kavanaugh cut his teeth in Washington working for what Democrats consider to be the most brazen and partisan crusade in modern politics: Ken Starr s investigations into President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. He spent more than three years working for the independent counsel, who was looking into various scandals surrounding Clinton and his wife, Hillary.Kavanaugh personally urged Starr to expand the Whitewater investigation to include looking at the death of White House staffer Vince Foster, a controversy that was a partisan attempt to use a man s death to go after the Clintons. Foster died by suicide in 1993, a conclusion reached by U.S. Park Police (his body was found in a park) and the FBI. In fact, multiple investigations concurred that it was a suicide. Yet in March 1995, after those reviews, Kavanaugh called for a  full-fledged investigation  into Foster s death. That inquiry helped validate right-wing conspiracy theorists who believed that the Clintons killed Foster, and the matter outraged Foster s family. During the Monica Lewinsky inquiry, Kavanaugh pressed Starr to ask Clinton sexually graphic questions about his relationship with the White House intern. Some examples: Yet on Thursday, Kavanaugh said he was shocked that he had to talk about his sex life. As to sex, this is not a topic I ever imagined would come up at a judicial confirmation hearing,  he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.Christine Blasey Ford, who testified before Kavanaugh on Thursday, has accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexually assaulting her while they were teenagers. Kavanaugh portrayed himself as a victim of a vast left-wing conspiracy, consisting of people who are working on behalf of the Clintons.  This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record,  he claimed.  Revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups. This is a circus. He added that he believed the  grotesque and coordinated character assassination will dissuade confident and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country, and, as we all know in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around comes around. Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the prestigious U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which is widely considered the second-most powerful court in the country. Whether he stays there or goes onto the Supreme Court, he will have to rule on cases that involve Democrats and liberal groups   the same ones he believes have ruined his life.

It would make sense, then, that he would be a good witness for Kavanaugh.Judge, however, wasn t at the hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday   he s  recovering from alcoholism  at a beach house in Delaware, according to his lawyer.Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy (Vt.) wanted to know if Kavanaugh would want Judge there as a witness. Kavanaugh never answered the question, but rather skirmished with the senator:Leahy: If [Blasey] is saying Mark Judge was in the room, then he should be here today. Would you want him called as a witness?Kavanaugh: Senator, this allegation came into the committee  Leahy: No no, I m just asking the question, would you want him to be here as a witness?Kavanaugh: He s already provided sworn testimony to the committee. This allegation has been hidden by the committee.Kavanaugh would go on to shout down Leahy for interrupting:Sen. Leahy (D-VT):  Would you want [Mark Judge] to be here as a witness? Brett Kavanaugh:  He already has provided sworn testimony to the committee. This allegation has been hidden by the committee --   https://t.co/Dzu2JyOIWV pic.twitter.com/OJaPOG4LI2In another striking exchange, Leahy referenced Judge s 1997 memoir, Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk, while questioning Kavanaugh about his drinking habits back in high school.Kavanaugh didn t answer that, either, but instead called Judge s book a work of fiction.Leahy: The author of the book   references a Bart O Kavanaugh vomiting in someone s car during beach week and then passing out. Is that you that he s talking about?Kavanaugh: Sir, uh, Mark Judge  Leahy: To your knowledge is that you that he s talking about?Kavanaugh: Sir, I ll explain if you let me.Leahy: Proceed, please.Kavanaugh: Mark Judge was a friend of ours in high school who developed a very serious drinking problem, an addiction problem, that lasted decades ... He wrote a book, that is a fictionalized book and an account. I think he picked out names of friends of ours to throw them in for characters in the book. We can sit here and make fun of some guy who has an addiction  Leahy: I m not making fun of anybody, I m trying to get a straight answer from you under oath.Earlier on Thursday Blasey said Judge s testimony would have been helpful to corroborate anecdotes like the time she ran into him at the Potomac Village Safeway, where he worked, a few weeks after the alleged attack. I certainly feel like I could be more helpful to everyone if I knew the date he worked at the Safeway,  she told senators.This is what we have from the other man alleged to have been in the room during the assault.

Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) pressing Kavanaugh about why he hasn t welcomed an FBI investigation into the three sexual misconduct allegations against the judge.Graham then addressed Kavanaugh directly, telling the judge,  You ve got nothing to apologize for.  Kavanaugh is testifying in one last Senate hearing before a confirmation vote set for Friday. Earlier this month, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982 when the two were at a high school party. Graham did not hold back when chastising the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, accusing the group of creating a political ploy to deny Kavanaugh, a conservative judge, a seat on the Supreme Court.  I would never do to them what you ve done to this guy,  Graham yelled, pointing at Durbin.  This is the most unethical, sham since I ve been in politics. And if you really wanted to know the truth, you sure as hell wouldn t have done what you ve done to this guy. Graham erupts at Democrats:  This is the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics.  Follow along live: https://t.co/W9gxruNFvs pic.twitter.com/w0jPNDvw8rGraham continued his condemnation of the Democrats, telling Kavanaugh that he could  not imagine  what he and his family have been through since Blasey came forward with her accusation.  Boy, y all want power. God, I hope you never get it. I hope the American people can see through this sham,  Graham said to the Democrats on the committee. God, I hate to say it because these have been my friends, but let me tell you when it comes to this,  he continued,  You re looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time my friend. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders showed support for Graham s comments on Twitter, writing:  Lindsey Graham has more decency and courage than every Democrat member of the committee combined. God bless him. Graham s passionate defense of Kavanaugh came after Durbin repeatedly asked Kavanaugh why he refused to call for an FBI investigation.   Turn to [White House counsel] Don McGahn and to this committee and say for the sake of my reputation, my family name and to get to the bottom of the truth of this, I am not going to be an obstacle to an FBI investigation,  Durbin urged.  I would hope that all the members of the committee would join me in saying that we re going to abide by your wishes, and we re going to have that investigation. A combative moment as Sen.

I welcome whatever the committee wants to do because I m telling the truth,  Kavanaugh said.  I want to know what you want to do,  Durbin responded. I m innocent,  Kavanaugh said, raising his voice.  I m innocent of this charge.  Then you re prepared for an FBI investigation?  Durbin reiterated.  They don t reach conclusions, you reach the conclusion senator,  Kavanaugh said, to which Durbin responded:  No, but they do investigate questions.  If there is no truth to her charges, the FBI investigation will show that. Are you afraid that they might not?  Durbin later asked.  After the exchange, Durbin once again asked if Kavanaugh would comply with an FBI investigation to clear his name. In response, the judge simply sat there silent seemingly unable to find an answer. In addition to Blasey s allegations, two other women have publicly accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

At first yelling, then breaking down in tears, the embattled Supreme Court nominee denied the allegations against him, attacked the partisans who raised them, and portrayed himself as an aggrieved victim.Kavanaugh stands accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers. Two other women have also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Blasey spent the morning telling the committee her story, smiling congenially at the senators on the panel and at times herself choking up.There were no smiles from Kavanaugh. This has destroyed my family and my good name, a good name built up through decades of very hard work and public service at the highest levels of public government,  he told the Judiciary Committee.  It s an outrage,  he told Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in response to her questions as to why he didn t demand an FBI investigation.  A joke. A farce,  Kavanaugh said, talking about the accusations of Julie Swetnick, who claims the judge was present at a party where she was raped.Kavanaugh s apparent strategy is called DARVO, short for  Deny. Attack. Reverse victim and offender.  The term was coined by Jennifer Freyd, a psychologist at the University of Oregon.She first started thinking about the formulation watching Anita Hill testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee decades ago   a moment that clearly echoed on Thursday.Freyd said that in her view, Kavanaugh was definitely using DARVO on Thursday.  All the parts are there,  she told HuffPost.An innocent man, unjustly accused, but facing the job interview of his life didn t have to react the way Kavanaugh did on Thursday afternoon   visibly angry and emotional, clearly feeling victimized. He does not need to be the victim here but rather a dignified person who cares about the issue of sexual assault in our country,  Freyd said Thursday, as Kavanaugh was speaking.  He could say that this a great teachable moment for our country   to really deal with sexual assault. Of course, there is another option too. If he wanted to stop denying he could do a profoundly healing thing for this country: acknowledge and apologize for what he did do. The DARVO strategy has been on display over the past few weeks as Republicans rally around Kavanaugh. Donald Trump is perhaps a master practitioner, portraying himself as the victim of smear campaigns and women being paid to accuse him of sexual misconduct. As you have seen, I am a victim of one of the great political smear campaigns in the history of our country,  he said during the presidential campaign, as allegations mounted against him.Trump played the victim again on Wednesday in a rambling press conference where he defended Kavanaugh.  I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me,  he said, telling reporters he identified strongly with the embattled judge.And before Trump, there was Bill Clinton, who famously told the country he did not have sexual relations with  that woman.  That turned out to be untrue.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Mitchell honed in on whether political partisans had coached Blasey in her testimony or polygraph or had helped her pick her lawyers. She asked Blasey how she had paid for her polygraph.These questions assumed that Blasey was part of the Democratic Party apparatus, a tool to derail the nomination of a conservative to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh himself claimed that Blasey s allegations were a Democratic Party smear brought by someone as  revenge on behalf of the Clintons. Immediately after Blasey was excused from the hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) angrily told reporters that she was a tool of the Democrats, who want to win the Senate and then refuse to hold hearings for any future Supreme Court nominee of President Donald Trump. She is just as much a victim of this as Brett Kavanaugh is, and someone betrayed her trust!  Graham yelled. I don t know who paid for her polygraph, but somebody did,  he added. Republicans accused Hill of the same thing in 1991 when she testified that Thomas had sexually harassed her over many years. She was colluding with  slick lawyers   the worst kind  from liberal groups, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) argued in 1991. (Hatch is one of three octogenarian senators to have questioned Hill in 1991 and Blasey on Thursday.) I believe that someone, some group, I don t care who it was, in combination, came up with this story and used this process to destroy me,  Thomas said in his 1991 testimony about Hill s allegations.These arguments cropped up because Hill did not present herself as a liar. Supporters of Thomas had to devise a reason for her to come forward with her allegations that did not directly impugn her credibility. The Republicans said she was put up to it,  said David Brock, the former conservative reporter who smeared Hill in his infamous book The Real Anita Hill before becoming a liberal Democrat.  She was led in to testify by liberal advocacy groups. They could never say that she had a political motive herself. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Ramirez alleged that Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face during a party when they were freshmen at Yale University. Swetnick alleged she witnessed Kavanaugh and one of his friends at several high school parties getting  drunk  and  being overly aggressive with girls. Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge, has vehemently denied the allegations. His weepy, defiant testimony Thursday offered a stark contrast to Blasey s composed statements before the committee hours earlier.Here are some of the wildest moments from Kavanaugh s testimony on Thursday: I ve submitted to this committee detailed calendars recording my activities in the summer of 1982,  Kavanaugh said.  Why did I keep calendars? My dad started keeping detailed calendars of his life in 1978. After becoming visibly emotional, the judge continued,  He did so as both a calendar and a diary. He s a very organized guy, to put it mildly.  Kavanaugh gets emotional and takes time to collect himself while saying he was inspired by his father s habit of keeping thorough calendars https://t.co/9FalHY71EC pic.twitter.com/STqaX4Rzgq One feature of my life that has remained true to the present day is that I ve always had a lot of close female friends,  Kavanaugh told the committee.  I m not talking about girlfriends. I m talking about friends who are women.  Maybe it was because I was an only child and had no sisters,  he added.  But anyway, we had no social media or text or email, and we talked on the phone. I remember talking almost every night, it seems, to my friends   Amy or Julie or Kristen or Karen or Suzanne or Mora or Megan or Nicky. The list goes on. Kavanaugh channeled the man who nominated him to the highest court in the land, President Donald Trump, by claiming that the sexual misconduct allegations against him were part of a  political hit.  This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit,  Kavanaugh said,  fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups. Brett Kavanaugh just blamed the Clintons for the sexual assault allegations against him https://t.co/yp7M0e5G2Q pic.twitter.com/WPmLlbzPuzSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) suggested that Kavanaugh request an FBI investigation into the allegations if he truly cared about saving his reputation, but Kavanaugh danced around the request. I welcome whatever the committee wants to do,  cause I am telling the truth,  Kavanaugh said.But Durbin pressed him, saying,  I want to know what you want to do.  I m telling the truth,  Kavanaugh said before Durbin asked him again what he wanted to do. I m innocent,  Kavanaugh said.  I m innocent of this charge. They don t reach conclusions. You reach the conclusions.  You can t have it both ways, Judge,  Durbin said.  You can t say here at the beginning,  I welcome any kind of investigation.  Asked numerous times by Sen. Durbin if he will commit to having the FBI investigate, Judge Kavanaugh repeats that he would do whatever the committee would like to do and declines to explicitly support an FBI review. pic.twitter.com/eZzsIiDvqeSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) also questioned Kavanaugh about whether he would be willing to request an FBI investigation into the allegations, but Kavanaugh continued to demur. I m here to answer questions about my yearbook or about any of my sports,  Kavanaugh said.Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), too, attempted to obtain a simple  yes or  no  from Kavanaugh on whether he would be willing to ask the White House to conduct such an investigation. But Kavanaugh again refused to directly answer the question.Klobuchar follows up on Durbin s line of questioning and urges Kavanaugh to ask Trump to open an FBI investigation into the allegations so the air can be cleared. Kavanaugh again dodges. pic.twitter.com/UdZO38F9rWWhen asked by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) if the phrase  Ralph Club  in his high school yearbook referred to throwing up from drinking too much alcohol, Kavanaugh became defensive. I like beer,  he responded.  I like beer. I don t know if you   do you like beer, Senator? What do you like to drink? He employed the same strategy later when Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) asked if he has ever drunk so much that he didn t remember certain parts of the night before. You re asking about blackout,  Kavanaugh replied.  I don t know. Have you?  After a short recess, Kavanaugh offered an apology to Klobuchar, which she said she accepted. I m sorry I did that,  he told her.  This is a tough process. Sen. Amy Klobuchar asks Brett Kavanaugh if he has ever blacked out from drinking, and he turns the question back on her.Kavanaugh:  You are asking about a blackout. I don t know. Have you? Klobuchar:  Could you answer the question, judge? https://t.co/9FalHY71EC pic.twitter.com/ptnGHHYussKavanaugh was asked to explain several phrases found in his high school yearbook and his responses were, at times, cringeworthy. That refers to flatulence. We were 16,  Kavanaugh said, explaining the word  boofed  to the senator.  If we want to talk about flatulence at age 16 on a yearbook page, I m game,  he added.CORRECTION: This article previously stated that a reference to  Ralph Club  appeared in Brett Kavanaugh s calendar. It appeared in his high school yearbook. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

In follow-up questions, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) asked Blasey how she could be so sure that it was Kavanaugh who did it.Blasey, who is a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, offered a lesson in neuroscience in reply.  The same way that I m sure that I m talking to you right now, just basic memory functions,  Blasey told Feinstein in response.  And also just the level of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the brain that sort of, as you know, encodes   that neurotransmitter encodes memories into the hippocampus, and so the trauma-related experience then is kind of locked there whereas other details kind of drift. Norepinephrine and epinephrine are two hormones released when the body experiences stress. When a person is experiencing a threat like a sexual assault, these stress neurotransmitters flood the brain and help encode details like the environment and the people who you re with on the hippocampus, which is a part of the brain that s responsible for creating and retrieving memories.Later on in the hearing, she again referred to the hippocampus when responding to Sen. Patrick Leahy s (D-Vt.) question about her most vivid memory of the alleged assault, which Blasey said took place in the early 1980s. Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two,  she said, referring to Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, the other person Blasey alleges was in the room when the assault took place.  And their having fun at my expense. In pairing the retelling of her traumatic experience with explanations of the way assault affects the brain, Blasey is educating the public about how survivors process and store violent memories and can recall them years later. Sabrina Segal, a psychology professor at Cal State University, Channel Islands, says that Blasey was making a distinction between everyday memories that the brain records during calm, relaxed moments and traumatic memories that the brain encodes during periods of high stress and fear for one s life.  The hippocampus is a structure in the brain that we know basically converts short-term memory traces into long-term memory traces,  Segal said, a term that psychologists use to describe the physical change that takes place in the brain when it stores a memory.  We know this because of studies where this part of the brain was removed, and it altered a person s ability to do that.  This bit of biology explains why Blasey would be certain of some details like Kavanaugh s face, or the environment of the room and less so of other details that occurred before the alleged assault, such as the owner of the home where the incident took place. In moments where she feared for her life and was in  fight or flight  mode, she would have details  seared  into her memory, Segal said. The full mechanics of this response also involve the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure in the brain which perceives and responds to danger. What a lot of people don t know is that your body releases adrenaline, which is a stress hormone, and almost simultaneously your brain will release [norepinephrine] in the amygdala,  Segal said.  It s a potency maker in terms of being able to strengthen the memory. Research shows that it is common for survivors of sexual trauma to strongly remember the details of the event itself but not have many memories of other details around the event. When something is incredibly traumatic and emotional, that [norepinephrine] is going to make specific details etched in, and you will never forget them,  Segal said.  The fact that she s had these memories for 20 years is not shocking to me in any way. Negar Fani, an assistant professor at Emory University who specializes in the neurobiology of post-traumatic stress disorder, says that this traumatic memory-storing process has a strong evolutionary purpose.  It s so that you can avoid things that could potentially harm you in the future,  Fani said.  When you encounter and encode these contextual aspects of the memory, you ll avoid things that even remotely relate to that trauma memory. Fani said this could explain why Blasey requested that Kavanaugh not be present in the room during her testimony.  This person who assaulted her produces that same fight or flight reaction,  Fani said.  Because he s a critical part of the threat context, it s going to arouse her fight or flight system, and its hard to think clearly when that fight or flight system is engaged. "

In a since-deleted tweet, Rachel Butera posted a video of herself mimicking Blasey s voice. I sound like I m back at that high school party; I can t help it,  Butera said as she referred to the 1982 gathering where Blasey said she was assaulted. I just have this kind of a voice, like a baby, even though I m a doctor and I m on this media circus, political stage, and I have kids myself, that I don t know why I speak with vocal fry,  Butera continued.  But you can listen to my testimony and hear that a grown woman sounds this way.  Blasey testified about her alleged assault before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. She said that at a high school party both she and Kavanaugh attended as teens, he forcibly held her down, covered her mouth and attempted to remove her clothes.Butera now concedes that her impression of Blasey  was a mistake  and said that she  didn t think this would offend anyone  in a followup tweet.I was by no means mocking a rape victim I am 100% on Christine Blasy Ford s side!

While young women are standing up and saying  No more,  our institutions have not progressed in how they treat women who come forward,  said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Too often, women s memories and credibility come under assault. In essence, they are put on trial and forced to defend themselves, and often revictimized in the process. When Hill testified about the sexual harassment she allegedly faced from Clarence Thomas, she went up against a Senate Judiciary Committee composed entirely of white men, who seemed unable or uninterested to comprehend what she was talking about. And then the Senate confirmed Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court anyway. The committee is more diverse in 2018   but only on the Democratic side, which now has both women and people of color. The Republican side is still composed entirely of white men. Recognizing the optics and the high likelihood that one of their members would come out looking bad, Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) hired Rachel Mitchell, a female sex crimes prosecutor, to question both Blasey and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for them. The photos are just as damning though.Hiring a prosecutor backfired. Mitchell tried, and failed, to find holes in Blasey s story. Her questioning seemed disjointed and ineffective. And it made it seem like Blasey was the one who had something to answer for.  You are not on trial,  Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) reminded Blasey.  This is a disaster for the Republicans,  concluded Fox News host Chris Wallace. As was the case with Hill, Blasey s testimony was riveting. In 1991, Hill spoke about sexual harassment, which was pervasive but little-discussed in public. Her testimony broke the floodgates and made it a national issue. On Thursday, Blasey spoke about what teenage girls face at the hands of boys, who use them for power plays and bonding with their male friends.  I was underneath one of them while the two laughed. Two friends having a really good time with one another,  Blasey said of her most indelible memory of the alleged attack.Blasey s prepared opening remarks were available the day before Thursday s hearing. In them, she described her allegations of being sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh when they were teenagers: I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on top of me. He began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me. I yelled, hoping someone downstairs might hear me, and tried to get away from him, but his weight was heavy. Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because he was so drunk, and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes. I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me.But it was hearing Blasey read that statement, near tears, that so moved people. You read the opening statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, and it is one thing. But then you hear it, and in the way that she expresses it ... it is a totally different thing,  said Fox News host Brett Baier. Blasey, like Hill, is up against a White House and Senate Republicans who want to push their Supreme Court nominee through as quickly as possible, upset that the allegations came out so close to a vote. Neither woman wanted to be in the public spotlight, but both were pushed there when the media broke the stories of their allegations. The only reason Hill was allowed to testify was because female Democratic lawmakers, primarily in the House, pressured their male colleagues to let her speak. (Barbara Mikulski was the only Democratic woman in the Senate at the time.)Although Democrats controlled the majority at the time, they did little to come to Hill s aid as Republicans tore into her credibility, portraying her as a jilted lover, a fabulist and an opportunist. Twenty-seven years later, Blasey testified only after Democrats pressed their Republican colleagues, who were eager to confirm Kavanaugh as quickly as possible. Even once they agreed to a hearing for her, they quickly scheduled a vote on Kavanaugh for the following day.Senate Republicans also refused to call Mark Judge, whom Blasey has identified as being present for her assault. And they still have not agreed to hear from two other women who have publicly come forward with other allegations. Likewise, in 1991, Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Joe Biden (D-Del.) never scheduled testimony from women who could have strengthened Hill s account. The FBI conducted an investigation into Hill s allegations in 1991. Republicans and the White House refused to allow one to go forward this time, despite Blasey s request. Chairman, you and I were both here 27 years ago,  Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.), said to Grassley on Thursday.  At that time, the Senate failed Anita Hill. I said I believed her. But I m concerned that we re doing a lot less for these three women today. After Blasey s hearing, Republican senators said they weren t really moved by her testimony and still didn t think there was enough evidence to necessarily believe her over Kavanaugh.  I don t even think it s going to take 27 years  for people to realize the hearing was poorly run, said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women s Law Center.  A younger generation of people are going to look at it right now and say,  How is this OK?  It makes the Senate look very disconnected.  Indeed, a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted Sept. 17-18 found that only 10 percent of voters thought the Senate was doing a better job of handling Blasey s allegations than it did with Hill s claims. Twenty-four percent said it was doing worse, and 34 percent said it was about the same. And as of now, a Friday morning vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation stands, despite the other allegations still out there. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

His name came up over and over again during her testimony: She said it was Judge who turned up the music to drown out her protests. She said she made eye contact with Judge during the attack, expecting him to help her, and he did nothing. She said the two drunk teens laughed uproariously at her struggles before Judge jumped on the bed and knocked her and Kavanaugh over, inadvertently helping her to escape.Six to eight weeks later, she recalled, she ran into Judge at the Potomac Village Safeway, where he worked as a bag boy. She testified that she greeted him, and though he d been  friendly  to her for the two years before the attack, she said that  his face was white and [he was] very uncomfortable saying hello back.  She said that  he looked a little bit ill. Since Blasey came forward with these allegations, Republicans have zeroed in on some holes in her memory, such as the fact that she can t remember the specific date or location of the alleged incident. Mark Judge s testimony could help her do that, she said.  I certainly feel like I could be more helpful to everyone if I knew the date he worked at the Safeway,  she told senators. As it happens, Judge s 1997 memoir, Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk, backs up Blasey s timeline. In it, he recalls having worked as a bag boy  at the local supermarket  in the summer of 1982.   But Judge is currently hiding out at a beach house in Bethany Beach, Delaware,  recovering from alcoholism,  according to his lawyer. Republicans could have subpoenaed him   after all, he is the only eyewitness to the alleged attack   but instead they re taking his word for it that he remembers nothing of the incident and are declining to ask him further questions. (By contrast, when Anita Hill testified about Clarence Thomas before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991, more than 20 witnesses spoke at the hearing.)  Judge and Kavanaugh were close friends in high school. If he had anything helpful to say that could back up Kavanaugh s own account of being a sober, hard-studying, churchgoing good boy in high school, Republicans would almost certainly have trotted him out as a character witness. But Judge most likely wouldn t be helpful to the GOP cause. In Wasted, Judge described a puking, passed-out  Bart O Kavanaugh.  And Judge s former college girlfriend Elizabeth Rasor has publicly challenged his claim that  no horseplay  took place at Georgetown Prep. In a New Yorker interview, Rasor said that Judge once described for her a high school incident in which he and other boys took turns having sex with a drunk woman.Rasor s story backs up the explosive claims of Julie Swetnick, who in a sworn declaration spoke of  efforts by Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be  gang raped  in a side room or bedroom by a  train  of numerous boys.  Swetnick alleged that she was the victim of a gang rape at one of these parties where Kavanaugh was present, though she did not implicate him in the attack on her.Judge s name has come up so often in the various allegations against Kavanaugh and in Thursday s hearing that it beggars belief he still hasn t been called to testify. Multiple Democratic senators demanded his presence. Mark Judge should be subpoenaed from his Bethany Beach hideaway and required to testify under oath, but he has not,  Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) admonished at the hearing. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said the GOP senators  failure to question Judge and the president s failure to call for an FBI investigation is  tantamount to a cover-up.  Republicans have been insisting on the importance of  due process  and  innocent until proven guilty,  and Kavanaugh said 17 times during his Fox News interview this week that he wants a  fair process.  But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) rejected Democrats  calls for a more thorough fact-finding inquiry, including a firsthand witness and a federal criminal investigation. He chose instead to pit Blasey s testimony against Kavanaugh s. A former prosecutor of sex crimes told HuffPost that she  would have given anything for a witness in the room to an intimate violence offense.  You bet I would have subpoenaed him,  said Linda A. Seabrook, general counsel at Futures Without Violence, a nonprofit working to end violence against women.  It s irresponsible not to.

During Blasey s testimony for the Senate Judiciary Committee, Rachel Mitchell, the prosecutor representing the all-male GOP membership of the committee, asked Ford about her fear of flying and its severity.The questions noted Ford s initial refusal to be interviewed by the Judiciary Committee, which she and her lawyers attributed to her anxiety about getting on a plane to travel to Washington, D.C.Mitchell then pointed out that Blasey had traveled on airplanes to visit family, go on vacation and appear at the committee hearing. Many viewed the questioning as designed to cast doubt on Ford s claim that her alleged sexual assault at the hands of Kavanaugh has  drastically altered  her life.Trump Jr. used the exchange as an opportunity to post a tweet pushing that narrative. (The better to score those cheap political points, right?)I m no psychology professor but it does seem weird to me that someone could have a selective fear of flying. Can t do it to testify but for vacation, well it s not a problem at all.Twitter users immediately pounced.I m no expert on conspiracy but it does seem weird to me that someone would  lie about meeting with Putin s  representative to discuss how to obtain damaging information on Mrs. Clinton as part of a Russian government effort to support his father.I m no psychology professor but it does seem weird to me that someone could have a selective fear of germs. Can t shake hands with people but unprotected sex with a porn star while your wife is pregnant, well it s not a problem at all.I m no psychology professor but it does seem weird to me that someone could not recall meeting Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Can t recall it in a Senate Committee testimony, but in emails, well it s not a problem at all.I m no expert, but there is an easy solution- demand an FBI investigation and demand that the actual witness to the event testify. Absent that, one does not need to be a rocket scientist to see right through your lack of expertiseI m no psychology professor but it does seem weird to me that a grown man can only get his rocks off by paying someone a large amount of money to lead him to a defenseless animal so he can kill it. #trump #trumpjr #murderer #ed #sexualpredatorI m no psychology professor, but it does seem weird to me that someone with a pathologically lying dad who cheated on his stepmom while his step brother was less than 6 months old & who, himself, cheated on his own wife thinks it ok s to question anyone else about anything EVER.Luckily, at least one psychology professor chimed in and offered relevant info to the president s son that he will likely ignore.I am a psychologist and many research studies prove that motivation does have an effect on anxiety.

The actress posted the tweet during Christine Blasey Ford s nationally televised testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were high school students. The actress Busy Philipps, in a post on Instagram during Blasey s testimony, revealed that she was raped at 14.Hyland tweeted out her statement using the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport, which sexual assault survivors began circulating last week to share their stories after President Donald Trump attacked Blasey and questioned why she didn t come forward with her story earlier.  Hyland also added the hashtags #BelieveWomen, #MeToo and #IBelieveHer.The actress has spoken about being in an abusive relationship before. In a follow-up tweet, Hyland made clear that she supports the women who have come forward against Kavanaugh. In addition to Blasey, two other women   Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick   have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct when he was in high school or college.  I believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. I believe Deborah Ramirez. I believe Julie Swetnick. There is no path forward for Judge Brett Kavanaugh,  Hyland wrote. I believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. I believe Deborah Ramirez.

This is me at 14. The age I was raped. It s taken me 25 years to say those words,  Philipps wrote Instagram.  I wrote about it in my book. I finally told my parents and sister about it 4 months ago.

She tweeted an explanation why most people don t report being sexually assaulted.  To people saying  Why didn t he/she report it?  When something so evil happens to you it takes a long time to process it,  she wrote.  In our victim-blaming culture it takes incredible courage to come forward. The victim is treated like the perpetrator.  "

But I want you to know I didn t forget to do it, because I would do that just as she was about to speak,  he said. Feinstein responded with a cool and unbothered  Thank you.  That was just the first of several interruptions by Grassley throughout the four-hour Senate hearing on Thursday.

Lindsey Graham told a woman who called out to him to say she d been raped that she  should have told the cops. The South Carolina senator had just been speaking to reporters in the Capitol basement and criticized Blasey for being unable to remember the exact date she was allegedly assaulted by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. That was when a nearby activist, Robyn Swirling, told Graham she didn t know the date she was raped 13 years ago.Graham responded,  I m sorry. ... You should have told the cops,  according to reporter Emma Dumain, who witnessed the exchange.Swirling, the founder of anti-sexual harassment organization  Works in Progress, wrote in her own tweet that Graham s wording was slightly different:  I m sorry, but then you should go to the cops. That was me! @LindseyGrahamSC said he did not believe Dr. Ford because she couldn t recall the exact date of the assault. I told him I was raped 13yrs ago but don t know the date. So would he believe me?He said  I m sorry, but then you should go to the cops. #BelieveSurvivors https://t.co/UERpDmvBU9Graham has had a lot to say before and during Kavanaugh s confirmation hearings, telling reporters during the break that Blasey s testimony was not convincing to him and that her  hiring a lawyer and taking a polygraph makes me more suspicious.    What happened to her, I don t know. Why don t you believe [Kavanaugh]? What is it about him you don t want to believe?  Graham said.  They ve tried to destroy this guy s life with one accusation after another. The senator also appeared to threaten the Democrats  future Supreme Court nominees by saying,  If this is the new norm, you better watch out for your nominees. Later, after Blasey s testimony ended, Graham went on another tear with reporters, saying:  I don t know who paid for her polygraph, but somebody did. ... I feel ambushed. Sen. Graham warns Democrats:  If this is the new norm, you better watch out for your nominees  pic.twitter.com/p9NIryUl7YSwirling told HuffPost that from her vantage point, she thinks Graham s comment  was a cruel, dismissive, and insensitive thing to say to a rape survivor who is asking you to respect and acknowledge and believe her experience.  Most people would be able to limit their comments to saying  I m sorry,   she said via email.In another tweet, she added that if Graham  had paused to talk with me, instead of rushing into the elevator  she d have  told him the cops can t do anything about it now, but that doesn t make it any less true and doesn t make me any less credible. Additionally, Swirling recently penned a raw personal essay for HuffPost about being labeled the  class slut  in high school, in which she talks about sexual abuse and the emotional trauma it causes. In Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s high school yearbook, he identified himself as a  Renate Alumnius,   Swirling wrote.  It was an allusion, repeated on other boys  pages, to the supposed sexual conquest of a girl named Renate Schroeder.  This kind of macho bragging, whether based on real events or not, can give a young woman what s politely referred to as  a reputation.  What teenagers like Kavanaugh probably didn t bother to consider is how giving a girl that kind of reputation can open her up to bullying, abuse and a lifetime of emotional trauma. Arthur Delaney contributed reporting.This story has been updated with comment from Swirling."

And as if describing her trauma in front of the entire world wasn t enough, she also had to endure people questioning her experience with anxiety.During the hearing, Rachel Mitchell, the Republican special counsel for the Judiciary Committee, probed into Ford s fear of flying. The questions were regarding Ford s initial refusal to be interviewed by the Judiciary Committee, which Ford and her lawyers attributed to her anxiety around getting on a plane to travel to Washington, D.C.Ford said she was hoping that someone would come interview her so she could avoid getting on an airplane. But when she realized that wasn t going to happen, she got on the plane to fly to the hearing instead.Conservatives were quick to jump on this exchange during the hearing, seemingly using it as a way to diminish Ford s overall credibility:Dr. Ford s testimony was delayed because of her fear of flying.Rachel Mitchell: How did you get to Washington?Dr. Ford: AirplaneM: When were here in August, how did you get here?F: AirplaneM: You ve been to Hawaii & Tahiti?F: YesM: How d you get there?Ford: Airplane pic.twitter.com/AtkuQ9arL2I have difficulty buying that a person afraid of flying willingly gets on a plane to fly all over the globe for pleasure.I m no psychology professor but it does seem weird to me that someone could have a selective fear of flying. Can t do it to testify but for vacation, well it s not a problem at all.Make no mistake: The implication that Ford is a liar because she was able to get on a plane when she claims she has anxiety over flying is a blinding example of how many people don t comprehend mental health and trauma. Just because someone experiences anxiety or a phobia doesn t mean that person will always avoid what causes it. In fact, in a lot of cases, they shouldn t. Exposure to certain anxiety triggers is vital to treating the condition, said Victor Schwartz, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine and chief medical officer at the mental health organization The Jed Foundation. The way we typically try to treat phobias or anxiety-based fears is teaching relaxation techniques and then graded exposure, where you slowly expose yourself to small doses of what scares you,  Schwartz told HuffPost.  It s a way of inoculating yourself so you can then tolerate bigger doses of the thing that you re afraid of. There s also no particular rule or pathology for when people can or cannot avoid their anxiety triggers, Schwartz said. These are not black and white things ... people do things they re afraid of. A person who has anxiety or a phobia has a real hard time doing it, but that doesn t mean that under the proper circumstances they re completely incapable of doing it,  he said.  Just like someone who might have some cardiac problems or an injury. If someone is chasing them, they re probably going to be able to run, though it might be extremely uncomfortable or painful for them. Many on Twitter were quick to make this point.I m very afraid of flying and do it all the time, like most people who are afraid of flying. I can t imagine how much worse the anxiety would be for someone flying to testify about sexual assault on national television.I have a fear of flying. I am also on track for delta diamond medallion benefits. Thank you rachel mitchell, useless prosecutor from maricopa countryWhen I was in my 20s I suffered from an anxiety disorder and was terrified of flying but I still got on planes for family vacations (heavily medicated) and for work trips that took me all over the world. But if I could avoid it, I would. Which is basically what she said. https://t.co/V0UNVycgUTAn estimated 40 million American adults live with an anxiety issue. The disorder is expansive. It can include excessive worry and rumination. It can prompt panic attacks. It can bring about physical symptoms like headaches and a racing heartbeat. It also can stem from specific, intense fears (in some cases, that fear is getting on an airplane). But mental health professionals stress that it s possible to live with these symptoms and still carry on with your daily routine.Using Ford s anxiety over flying as a possible attempt to undermine her credibility or experience is gross, wrong and completely misunderstands how anxiety works and how it needs to be medically treated. If we want more acceptance around mental health in this country, we have to stop questioning people s personal experiences with it. We have to recognize that it affects everyone differently. And we also have to believe that a person s mental health condition is just one part of their life; it doesn t define it.Sometimes, that means getting on a damn plane   on your own terms   despite the anxiety. Doing that makes you strong, not a liar.Senior Wellness Editor, HuffPost"

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), said he thought it was suspicious that Kavanaugh s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, had hired a lawyer and taken a lie detector test before she went public with her story two weeks ago. And he didn t like that Blasey couldn t remember how she got to the party that night in 1982, where she alleges a teenage Kavanaugh pinned her down and covered her mouth so no one could hear her scream, where she heard the  uproarious laughter  that she said she ll never forget.   She can t say how she got there and how she left,  Graham told HuffPost during a brief pause in the hearing. Kavanaugh has steadfastly denied Blasey s claims, as well as subsequent sexual misconduct allegations from two other women. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a committee member, said Blasey s testimony hasn t shaken his support for Kavanaugh at all. He predicted the committee would proceed with voting Kavanaugh out of committee on Friday as planned.Asked if he thinks Blasey s testimony is credible, Hatch said:  It s too early. The Utah Republican initially responded to Ford s testimony by telling reporters that Ford was an  attractive witness  and that  she s pleasing.  HuffPost asked Hatch why he said that about Blasey as the senator headed onto the Senate floor, but he kept walking.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the committee, appeared stunned when she learned what Hatch said. Seconds ticked by before she responded,  That s   interesting. Many Republicans, including chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), ignored reporters  questions or said they wouldn t comment until they heard from Kavanaugh, who is a currently a federal judge for the D.C. Circuit. This ought to come down to evidence. It ought to come down to facts. And I don t know if there s anything in terms of facts or evidence that have changed,  Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said.Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said he thought Blasey looked  credible  and  calm.  But the Alabama Republican, who as a then-Democrat voted to confirm Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991, said he wanted to hear from Kavanaugh before making a final decision. You re kind of sitting like the jury. You want to hear the whole story,  Shelby said.One of a handful of Democrats who hasn t announced a position on Kavanaugh, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), also said he needed to hear from the nominee. But when a reporter asked if Blasey sounded credible, Tester said yes.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) said he remained undecided.  I haven t drawn any conclusion on anything yet because the bits and pieces I m seeing, I m not seeing in full.  Meanwhile, Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), another vulnerable Democrat up for re-election this year, said he had found Blasey  very credible, very compelling, and very courageous.

It s not a big deal,  said a Trump supporter in Bozeman, Montana, interviewed by MSNBC on Wednesday. Groping a woman? At 18? I mean, how many guys do you know who think that s no big deal?  the unidentified woman said, turning to her daughters, who nodded.Many of Trump and Kavanaugh s supporters have repeated this defense: Kavanaugh s alleged sexual assault was just routine, boys-will-be-boys behavior.Much of defensive reaction I m seeing around Kavanaugh (& not just from the right) suggests that lots of people think a regular part of male development is the stage where boys drunkenly pin down young women & try to assault them. This is not a surprise, but it s so depressing.On the president s favorite show  Fox & Friends,  co-host Brian Kilmeade lamented Wednesday that he  didn t know your ninth- and 10th-grade actions could really reflect on what happens in the Supreme Court. Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, the leading conservative group championing Kavanaugh s nomination, dismissed Christine Blasey Ford s description of events as  boorishness to rough horseplay,  though she did acknowledge that attempted rape is  a very serious allegation.  It s all eerily similar to almost exactly two years ago, in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign, when The Washington Post published the infamous 2005  Access Hollywood  recording of Trump, then host of NBC s  The Apprentice,  bragging about sexual assault.Then, as now, Trump s backers seemed to have few qualms about it, downplaying and attempting to explain away the tape, which underscored his long history of sexism and misogyny. Even as at least 20 women came forward with allegations against Trump of various forms of sexual misconduct, voters elected him anyway.Many of Trump s supporters bought his explanation that his boasts of grabbing women  by the pussy  were simply a form of  locker room talk. His campaign officials, surrogates and family members flooded the airwaves with the  boys will be boys  defense. The fact is men talk like that,  then-Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani said on CNN. We all know guys that have had conversations with other guys that go in that direction,  Trump s eldest son, Donald Jr., said while defending his dad in the days after the tape was released.  That s a fact of life. While acknowledging that  it wasn t right,  Trump s son Eric said the tape was just  two alpha guys in a room talking. Trump s wife, Melania, dismissed the boasts as  boy talk  and joked that she had  two boys at home,  referring to her husband and their then 11-year-old son Barron.Then, as now, Trump s supporters went into attack mode, defending Trump by going after the credibility of the source of the claims.After the  Access Hollywood  tape leaked to The Washington Post, Trump falsely claimed that releasing the tape was  illegal  and threatened to sue NBC.The New York Times reported last year that Trump has since questioned the authenticity of the tape itself, privately claiming without evidence that the voice on the audio isn t his. Trump had previously acknowledged it was him making the comments heard on the tape.When multiple women came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct, Trump said they were lying and denigrated their appearance and character.Now, Trump and his defenders have similarly gone after Kavanaugh s accusers, part of the president s usual playbook of siding with accused men and attempting to cast doubt on their accusers. At a U.S. Capitol rally of Kavanaugh supporters on Wednesday organized by the conservative group FreedomWorks, attendee Linda Harper of Goldsboro, North Carolina, told HuffPost that she thinks all three of Kavanaugh s accusers are lying. She suggested the women  are paid to do this,  citing the familiar conservative conspiracy theory that Democratic billionaire George Soros  is at the top. Harper s friend, Carl Mischka of North Carolina, said he thinks the women s allegations against Kavanaugh are  a bunch of crap,  and that they shouldn t be a factor in his confirmation. It has to do with the qualifications of a human being, but not to be a Supreme Court justice,  he said.Harper said she did not believe the women accusing Trump of sexual assault, but it did bother her when Trump talked about being able to grab women  by the pussy.  But she said his accomplishments as president have overshadowed his crass remarks.  We hired him to be the president and he has made the tax cuts, improved our economy, decreased unemployment for African-Americans,  she said, though her last claim isn t accurate.  We have better relations with countries in the world,  she said.  Now he s making relations with North Korea. You could just list on and on. I m a huge fan.

This is me at 14. The age I was raped. It s taken me 25 years to say those words,  Philipps wrote on Instagram.  I wrote about it in my book. I finally told my parents and sister about it 4 months ago. Today is the day we are silent no more.  Philipps posted her story on Instagram at the same time Christine Blasey Ford was telling members of the Senate Judiciary Committee of being sexually assaulted by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when they were high school students.Philipps said she had stayed silent about being raped for 25 years. The actress wrote that she couldn t imagine what Blasey was feeling during her public testimony.A post shared by Busy Philipps (@busyphilipps) on Sep 27, 2018 at 8:52am PDTPhilipps did not go into detail about her assault, but said that she wrote about it in her upcoming book, This Will Only Hurt A Little, slated to be published in October. Philipps is one of many women who have offered support to Blasey as she faces questioning by senators and a Republican-hired sex crimes prosecutor on national television Thursday. Blasey accused Kavanaugh of pining her down, groping her, and trying to remove her clothing more than 35 years ago. Blasey has been criticized for not reporting the alleged attack at the time.Many women have spoken about their own reluctance to report sexual assaults, including  Top Chef  host Padma Lakshmi. Lakshmi revealed in a New York Times essay published Tuesday that she was raped as a teenager and didn t report it. "

Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said President Donald Trump s unwillingness to involve the FBI is  tantamount to a cover-up. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford spoke to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about an incident in which Kavanaugh allegedly held her down, covered her mouth and attempted to forcibly remove her clothing when they were both teenagers. The president and Republican lawmakers are hoping to confirm Kavanaugh for a spot on the high court within days.When it was his turn to speak, Blumenthal commended Blasey s bravery, said this was a  teaching moment  for America, and blasted the president for his continued defense of Kavanaugh and his unwillingness to call for an FBI investigation.Blumenthal said it was Trump s responsibility, not Blasey s, to call for an FBI investigation into the alleged assault. It s not up to you; it s up to the president,  the senator said.  His failure to ask for an FBI investigation, in my view, is tantamount to a cover-up. Kavanaugh has now been publicly accused of sexual misconduct by three women. But the president has stuck by his Supreme Court nominee, calling the judge  one of the finest people I ve ever known  and trying to discredit one of the accusers. Deborah Ramirez said Kavanaugh exposed himself and thrust his penis in her face at a party in college. Trump said she  has nothing  because she  admits she was drunk.

Three women have now come forward to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual abuse and misconduct while he was in high school and college. The first of those women   Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor who says Kavanaugh assaulted her when they were both high school students in suburban Maryland   is testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. A fourth anonymous accusation was sent to Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner. The Senate Judiciary Committee has tentatively scheduled a vote on Friday, meaning the full Senate could confirm Kavanugh early next week. Three GOP governors   John Kasich of Ohio, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Phil Scott of Vermont   said that vote should be delayed until all of the victims  claims can be throughly investigated.Baker and Kasich both weighed in on Twitter. Baker described the allegations as  sickening  and said there should be no Senate vote until an independent investigation is complete.The accusations brought against Judge Kavanaugh are sickening and deserve an independent investigation. There should be no vote in the Senate.Kasich, who is in his final year as governor and is widely seen as a potential long-shot primary challenger to President Donald Trump in 2020, went further in his own statement, saying he would not support Kavanaugh s confirmation  in the absence of a complete and thorough investigation. My statement on Judge #Kavanaugh s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court: pic.twitter.com/zw53NY9yeLScott made similar remarks to the Burlington Free Press. This is a lifetime appointment,  he said.  And I m not taking a position on Judge Kavanaugh himself, but we owe it to Americans to make sure that they get it right. Because this doesn t happen every day. And it s their obligation to do so. So take your time. Investigate. Another GOP governor called for the Republicans to slow down the nomination process to allow for more investigations without explicitly calling for a delay. Maryland s Larry Hogan told The Baltimore Sun on Tuesday the accusations were  disturbing  and gave him  great pause.   There are credible charges and big concerns. They need to be heard,  he said after an event in Montgomery County.  They ought to take whatever time it takes to make sure these accusers are heard and he has a chance to respond to them. Hogan, Scott and Baker, who all represent blue states and are up for re-election in 2018, are among the nation s most popular governors, with approval ratings regularly topping 60 percent. Baker is considered a near-lock for re-election   a poll released this week showed him with a 40 percentage point lead over his Democratic opponent   and Hogan and Scott are considered heavy favorites over their Democratic opponents, Ben Jealous in Maryland and Christine Hallquist in Vermont.In a statement, Maryland Democratic Party Chair Kathleen Matthews said Hogan should join his fellow GOP governors in calling for Senate Republicans to delay the vote. Dr. Blasey Ford s accusations against Brett Kavanaugh are credible and extremely disturbing, and Governor Hogan should display the courage of fellow Republicans like John Kasich and Charlie Baker, who are calling on Senate Republicans to delay a vote on his nomination,  she said.

Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) had some powerful words for Christine Blasey Ford during Thursday s Senate confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.  I have found your testimony powerful and credible, and I believe you,  Blumenthal told the Palo Alto University professor.Blasey, who accused Kavanaugh earlier this month of sexually assaulting her in 1982, was testifying to the Senate Judiciary Committee. During Blumenthal s line of questioning, Blasey broke down in tears in response to his poignant statement.  I want to quote one of my colleagues, Sen. Lindsey Graham, in a book that he wrote in 2015 when he was describing his own service   and very distinguished naval service   as a trial lawyer,  Blumenthal said to Blasey.  He said, quote, of his prosecution of rape cases,  I learned how much unexpected courage from a deep and hidden place it takes for a rape victim or sexually abused child to testify against their assailant.  As Blumenthal reiterated the quote, Blasey bowed her head and began crying.  If we agree on nothing else today, I hope on a bipartisan basis we can agree on how much courage it has taken for you to come forward, and I think you have earned America s gratitude,  Blumenthal added. Visibly moved, Blasey mouthed the words  thank you  in response to Blumenthal. Republicans, except for Grassley, are remaining mute throughout Ford s testimony.So Senator Blumenthal quotes from Lindsey Graham s own book, to devastating effect. pic.twitter.com/qfC0Oz9N2fEarlier in his statement, Blumenthal thanked Blasey for coming forward despite the criticism she knew she would have to endure.  You have inspired and you have enlightened America,  he said. You have inspired and given courage to women to come forward, as they have done to every one of our offices, and many other public places,  Blumenthal continued.  You have inspired and you have enlightened men in America to listen respectfully to women survivors and men who have survived sexual attacks. And that is a profound public service, regardless of what happens with this nomination.  Blasey is the first of three women to publicly accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. The judge is set to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee after Blasey on Thursday. A committee vote on Kavanaugh s nomination is set for Friday.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

I m a 76-year-old woman who was sexually molested in the second grade,  said Brenda, before becoming audibly emotional.  This brings back so much pain. I thought I was over it. But it s not. You will never forget it. You get confused and you don t understand it   but you never forget what happened to you.  Without my family, I would never have been able to go through this,  she added.  And now I m 76 years old, and I thought I was over it until I heard it happened to somebody else, and it is such a shame. C-SPAN host Steve Scully then asked Brenda how old she was when she was sexually assaulted, prompting her to respond:I was in the second grade, and it was a seventh grader at my school, and you know on rainy days they have you march around the school back then because they couldn t let you out. And I would see him, and I would get so upset.I ve had a weight problem my whole life because I was so afraid that someone was going to hurt me. And I m married, I have a wonderful family; I have a wonderful husband, and a child and great-grandchildren and grandchildren, and I thought I was over this. I have not brought this up for years until I heard this testimony, and it s just breaking my heart.Listen to Brenda s story around the 59:30 mark below:Thursday s hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee allowed Blasey and Kavanaugh to testify about her accusations. She alleges the judge pinned her down, groped her and tried to remove her clothes during a small gathering at a house in suburban Maryland while they were both in high school in the early 1980s.Two other women have come forward this week and accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Deborah Ramirez alleges Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face at a dormitory party when they were both freshmen at Yale University. Julie Swetnick alleges she witnessed Kavanaugh and one of his friends at several high school parties getting  drunk  and  being overly aggressive with girls. Kavanaugh, now a federal appeals court judge, has vehemently denied the allegations.Prior to airing Brenda s powerful story on Thursday, C-SPAN took calls from two men   both of whom accused Blasey of lying during her testimony. She is lying like a dog,  said a caller identified as James from Princeton, Indiana.  Listen, she said so much inconsistent in her statements that you could drive a Mack truck through it. When asked for specific examples of inconsistencies, James stumbled but said the prosecutor should take Blasey  to the woodshed.  She can t remember this. She can t remember that,  James said.  I wish that dang prosecutor would say,  Listen, I need more than five minutes, and I could take her to the woodshed.  The next caller, identified as Tracy from Riverton, Wyoming, echoed James  aggressive rhetoric toward Blasey. I just feel that she is very scripted,  said Tracy, who also failed to cite any specific examples like his fellow male caller.  She s really putting on an act. All her inconsistencies and what not. You can just tell she s lying. Later Thursday, during a longer recess from the hearing, several more women called into C-SPAN to discuss Blasey s testimony and their personal experiences with sexual abuse. (Those women s calls start around 1:27 in the C-SPAN video above.)A called identified as Jessica from Chicago said she found Blasey was credible because of  how familiar her experience is.  I was sexually assaulted when I was 19 in college,  said Jessica, now 26, before being overcome with emotion.  I d prefer not to go into too much more detail than that   I m sorry.  It s very important to victims of sexual assault that we take these accusations seriously,  she added.  And I m disappointed that there hasn t been an FBI investigation because it s 2018, the Me Too movement has happened, and I think that we need to come from a perspective of believing women when they come forward with these stories because it s not an easy thing to do and I don t think it s something that anyone would undertake lightly. Scully then took a call from Michelle, a 53-year-old mother from Fort Pierce, Florida. She said both she and her daughter had been victims of sexual assault. I am a survivor myself,  Michelle said.  When I was 12 ... sleeping over at [my best friend s] house, around 4 in the morning, in the dim light of the night light, her 17-year-old brother was hovered over her and on to me on the other side of the full-size bed with his hands in my underwear and fondling me.  I remember being so frightened and not wanting anyone to be upset with me because I loved this family a lot,  she continued.  I shook to pretend I was waking up and he d back off. He came back about two more times until my girlfriend started to stir a little bit and then he left and that was the end. The only person I ever told that to was my husband when I first married him a few years later and a girlfriend since then. That being said, I m still friends with that person and I would never ever want to cause her harm. Michelle said she felt Blasey  came across as a credible person herself that has been through the trauma,  but said she also felt Kavanaugh s public denials have been  just as compelling. President Donald Trump and several Republican senators have publicly questioned Blasey s accusations and attacked the credibility of Ramirez and Swetnick. Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a fine man, with an impeccable reputation, who is under assault by radical left-wing politicians who don t want to know the answers; they just want to destroy and delay,  Trump tweeted earlier this month. I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents,  the president added.Trump s tweets highlighted a common   and misguided   belief that all survivors of sexual assault report the incidents to law enforcement officials. Nearly two-thirds of people who are raped or sexually assaulted don t go to police at all, according to Justice Department estimates.This article has been updated with information from callers during the second recess.

Others indicated that they found Blasey s testimony powerful   so much so that it changed their opinion on Kavanaugh.I m hearing from conservative men in my DM s that Ford s testimony is changing their mind.

She said she said hello, noting that the two had been previously friendly for some time.Judge  looked a little ill  and his face went pale, Blasey said.Earlier, she had said Judge was present in the room when Kavanaugh jumped on top of her, ran his hands over her body and placed a hand on her mouth to drown out her yells. She made eye contact with him twice, she told the Senate, and his laughter along with Kavanaugh was the strongest part of her recollection.The revelation matters because it would help pin Blasey s claims to a specific point in time. She repeatedly referenced it in further responses during her testimony.When pressed by a prosecutor representing the all-male GOP membership of the committee about the specific date of the alleged assault, Blasey responded by saying,  If I knew when Mark Judge worked at the Potomac Safeway, I could be more helpful in that way. GOP leadership in the Senate resisted calls to ask Judge to testify at the Thursday hearing along with Blasey and Kavanaugh.Blasey s comment underscored why such a testimony might be key   and Judge s own personal statements hint at it as well. He wrote about working at a local supermarket in his book about his youthful drinking, New Yorker journalist Jane Mayer noted on Twitter. (Mayer is a co-author of a piece detailing the second set of allegations against Kavanaugh by Deborah Ramirez, one of three women who have accused him of sexual misconduct).Judge left the D.C. area last week after he came under public scrutiny. On Monday, the Washington Post found him staying at a beach house in Delaware.

When Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) asked the Palo Alto University professor what her most vivid memory of the alleged assault is, Blasey s response was powerful and poignant. Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense,  Blasey said, her voice cracking with emotion.  I was underneath one of them while the two laughed. Two friends having a really good time with one another.  The uproarious laughter between the two [friends] having fun at my expense.  Dr. Christine Blasey Ford on her strongest memory of the assault. #KavanaughHearings pic.twitter.com/tJtWS157CGThe exchange, and Blasey s haunting answer, struck a chord with many viewers.She remembers their laughter the most, two friends having a good time at her expense.  Heartbreaking.  Remember this moment when Kavanaugh issues his categorical denial.  Watch how the sheer authority of male power overtakes the trauma we just saw. #KavanaughHearingsBloody hell... this laughter line is brutal. Raw. Appalling on so many levels.Watching Dr. Ford relive her trauma was devastating. Watching her recall the laughter of Judge/Kavanaugh that still haunts her was devastating. Watching her be made to feel like she has to say sorry while answering these pointed, stupid questions is devastating.Earlier in the hearing, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) asked Blasey how she was so sure that the person who attacked her was Kavanaugh. The question was in response to a Republican lawmaker who claimed Ford may have mistaken Kavanaugh for a different classmate. Again, Blasey s response was unwavering. The same way that I m sure that I m talking to you right now, just basic memory functions,  Blasey told Feinstein.  Also just the level of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the brain that sort of, as you know, encodes that neurotransmitter and encodes memories into the hippocampus. So the trauma-related experience is kind of locked there, whereas other details kind of drift. Feinstein reiterated her question, asking,  So what you are telling us is this could not be a case of mistaken identity.   Absolutely not,  Blasey responded.During a separate exchange, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), asked Blasey,  Dr. Ford, with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?  100 percent,  she responded.Earlier this month, Blasey accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her during a high school party in 1982. Blasey says that Kavanaugh and a friend, Mark Judge, cornered her in a room and Kavanaugh jumped on top of her, groped her and attempted to take her clothes off. When Blasey tried to scream for help, she says the then-17-year-old Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth to silence her. Blasey was 15 at the time.Two other women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. On Sunday, Deborah Ramirez claimed that the judge exposed himself to her and thrust his penis in her face during a party when they were students at Yale University during the 1983-84 school year. On Wednesday, Julie Swetnick alleged that Kavanaugh was  present  at a party where she was gang raped.Kavanaugh is set to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee after Blasey on Thursday.

But the attorneys for Ramirez, who made letters to the FBI and Senate public, said they had made numerous attempts to speak to committee members, only to be largely ignored.Grassley on new allegations regarding Kavanaugh:  At this time, we have not had cooperation from attorneys representing other clients.  pic.twitter.com/EyvNY8kBuf I understand that there are two other public allegations,  Grassley said.

Ramirez said that at a college party, Kavanaugh exposed his penis and thrust it in her face.And Swetnick said she was the  victim of one of these  gang  or  train  rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present  at a party in approximately 1982. Thursday s testimony will influence whether Kavanaugh is elevated to the highest court in the nation.In the same breath that Grassley claimed to have not had cooperation from attorneys for the other alleged victims, he said he had been in close contact with Blasey s attorneys.

That very same week, Hill had rocked the nation with sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.  I believe her,  Kline said.And so Kline got invited to the very first meeting of  I Believe Anita Hill. Part protest, party, support group and remembrance,  I Believe Anita Hill  has become an annual tradition for hundreds of professional women and students in Columbia, South Carolina. What started as a gathering of just a few dozen women, each of them horrified at how the Senate handled Hill s testimony and searching for like-minded company, has ballooned into a yearly tradition to celebrate Hill and evangelize for equal treatment in the workplace.Sometimes, they re graced by Hill herself. Now a Brandeis University professor, Hill makes sparing public appearances linked to her 1991 testimony but has been the guest of honor at  I Believe Anita Hill  twice. These were occasions, attendees said, to get to know and understand Hill beyond her televised statements. It wasn t difficult to gather women together that first year. Kline, her professor and the handful of other women in their huddle were among the countless women who found that in certain circles their belief in Hill put them in the minority. My circle of family and friends didn t all feel the way I did by a long shot,  said Kline, now a Columbia-area attorney.  This gave me a comfortable camaraderie. I think we each in our own way have all had similar experiences.  All of the members today are inexorably focused on the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, of attempted rape when the two were in high school. Her testimony will unfold, like Hill s, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which appears hesitant, like last time, to allow her story to stand in his way.For a group of women who have never stopped thinking about Hill, the parallels are overwhelming. I don t see a whole lot of change from 1991, in terms of how very slow to act, painfully slow,  the committee has been, Kline said.Given that several of the same senators during Hill s testimony still serve on the committee,  I m wondering, how much have we really learned? How much have they really learned?  said Barbara Rackes, a businesswoman in Columbia and an early member of  I Believe.   Maybe they re going to be a little less pointed    in lieu of asking questions, Republicans on the committee have hired a prosecutor, she added.  But the notion that we re hearing from many of the same people, I carry some anxiety. Among the  I Believe Anita Hill  members who will be watching the hearing are many young members, who weren t born yet or were children at the time of Hill s testimony. Lydia Royals, a recent college graduate, doesn t think she would have known about Hill or understood the extent of her impact without the annual event. Not having lived through Hill s testimony, Royals finds Thursday s hearing more difficult.  I don t want to say,  oh yeah, of course, we re here again,   she said,  because I want to stay surprised. It was in its second year when  I Believe Anita Hill  marked the first anniversary of her testimony. The organizers had to confront what the event would stand for in the long run. By then, Justice Clarence Thomas was serving on the Supreme Court; the Senate Judiciary Committee s mistreatment of Hill was more of a scar than an open wound. The  I Believe  originals decided that the best way to honor Hill was to keep talking frankly about sexism in the workplace and swapping solutions. The annual event became a place for women to name and recognize the sexual harassment they faced in their own workplaces and to keep memories of Hill s bravery, as many of them described it, alive.As the events of 1991 receded into the past, the organizers also made it a mission to keep the memory of Hill s testimony fresh.  Bring someone along    meaning, a young woman   became the group s informal motto. You can t let your guard down,  Rackes said. [Hill] gave us language and descriptions to behaviors that we knew were happening but had nothing to name and label them with,  said Marjorie Hammock, an early  I Believe  attendee and a leader in the SC Progressive Network.  It gave us the ability to examine and explore what it was in our lives that was so oppressive. Her courage and her presence did that. That was back then. Today, as Blasey testifies, Hammock considers Hill s example to be a different kind of gift. She helped prepare us for what was to come,  Hammock said.  She helped prepare us for the fact that it was going to happen again. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Grassley took aim at Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Senate Democrats, and offered that the FBI already investigated Kavanaugh and found nothing. Nowhere in any of these six FBI reports   was there a whiff of any issue, any issue at all related to inappropriate sexual behavior,  Grassley said. Feinstein had forwarded a letter detailing allegations against Kavanaugh on Sept. 13   at the time, its contents weren t public. At the time, Feinstein was lambasted for withholding the document from other committee members. She says she did so at Blasey s request. When I received Dr. Ford s letter on Sept. 13, my staff and I recognized the seriousness of those allegations and immediately began our committee s investigation,  Grassley said.  Every step of the way, the Democratic side refused to participate in what should ve been a bipartisan investigation.  He said he wished the committee had more time to investigate the allegations, and that it s the Democrats  fault that they don t. Only at an 11th hour, on the eve of Judge Kavanaugh s confirmation vote, did the ranking member refer the allegations to the FBI. And then the allegations were leaked to the press. That s where Dr. [Blasey] Ford was mistreated. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley apologizes to Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford for threats they ve received in the lead up to today s hearing and said they were  a poor reflection on the state of civility in our democracy.  https://t.co/y50162fExy pic.twitter.com/O25gtez8VdFeinstein took the mic next, firing at Grassley for not introducing Blasey properly and noting that Blasey hadn t wanted to make these allegations public. She reiterated that she wanted this confidential,  Feinstein said.  How women are treated in the United States with this kind of concern is really wanting a lot of reform. In the meantime, good morning, Dr. Ford, thank you for coming forward and being willing to share your story with us. .@SenFeinstein introduces Dr Ford, noting that Grassley failed to do so. pic.twitter.com/dWPUpp0r3TShe also noted allegations that were made by two of Kavanaugh s alleged victims who weren t testifying today: Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick.  I m sorry you brought up about the unsubstantiated allegations of other people,  Grassley said.His frustration seems to fly in the face of his own words during a hearing in 1991, when Anita Hill famously came forward with allegations of sexual harassment in front of an all-white panel of male senators. Back then, he said the  11th hour allegations  should be investigated and heard properly.At about four hours and seven minutes in, you can see Grassley himself, during Hill hearings, talking about how in future every member of the committee should get FBI reports on cases like this: https://t.co/65SMU7mQbs People are asking how we could have let your statements slip past us? Those are valid questions. I m going to work toward ensuring this never happens again,  Grassley said back then.  I want to establish a new ground rule. Whenever the FBI is dispatched every committee member should be notified of the allegation. And when the FBI has finished its work, every committee member should be notified and have access to that report. A rule like this should ensure once and for all that even an 11th-hour charge like yours should be fully considered. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Over the course of this week, like I think a lot of American families, my family   a lot of it on email   has been discussing this and disagreeing and arguing about it,  Wallace said.  And two of my daughters have told me stories that I had never heard before about things that happened to them in high school. He continued:  [They] hadn t told their parents   I don t know if they told their friends   certainly they never reported to police. They weren t as serious as the allegations against Kavanaugh, but the point is that there are teenage girls who don t tell stories to a lot of people, and then it comes up, and I don t think we can disregard that. I don t think that we can disregard Christine Blasey Ford and the seriousness of this. I think that would be a big mistake.

Ramirez alleges Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face during a drinking party when they were both freshmen at Yale University in the early 1980s. And Swetnick alleges she witnessed Kavanaugh and one of his friends at several high school parties getting  drunk  and  being overly aggressive with girls. Kavanaugh, now a federal appeals court judge, has vehemently denied the allegations.Need help?

Many looked like college kids. Lots of  Make America Great Again  hats, at least one Liberty University sweatshirt.The students were encouraged on Wednesday by Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. to show their support after the university found out Yale University students were planning to protest Kavanaugh s appointment.  I think the Republicans are going above and beyond giving the accuser the right to be heard, maybe more than they should, but I think they should be commended for hearing her out, for taking her seriously and delaying the process so she can be heard,  said Falwell to students.The student effort Thursday was facilitated by the Christian nonprofit women s group Concerned Women for America, who sponsored bus trips for 150 students from the Liberty campus in Lynchburg, Virginia, to Washington, D.C. Liberty University matched so a total of 300 students could go, though it s unclear if that amount showed up. Liberty University declined a request for comment about its role in facilitating the trip.Penny Nance, CEO and President of Concerned Women for America, said in a statement that  enough is enough  in efforts to delay Kavanaugh s confirmation. Senate Democrats continue to use dirty tricks, threats and lies to smear a decent man and delay the process of confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,  said Nance.  His character continues to be praised by people of all walks of life who have known Judge Kavanaugh at various stages of his life. Let s not let a smear campaign by the left ruin a good man s character and hard work. Nance also said that not confirming Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court  would be failing the American people who elected President Trump for this very purpose and were fully aware of his potential nominees to our nation s highest court.

Early on, female students were housed on the top floors of the dorms, which led men to joke years later:  Yale, with the tradition of women on top.  During the summer after Luckow s freshman year, she recalled, an elderly male alumnus declared during the question-and-answer part of a reunion event that the decision to admit female students had marked the downfall of the institution. When I was a grad student at Yale in the  80s, there were still big marble urinals in the women s bathrooms in the main library and the gym that they didn t bother to take out, sending a subtle message, we joked, that we were perhaps temporary,  said Dana Frank, who is now a history professor at U.C. Santa Cruz.Over three decades later, the culture at Yale has come under public scrutiny after multiple women have accused Kavanaugh, now a Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault. One alleged victim, Deborah Ramirez, told lawmakers that Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face, forcing her to touch it, during his freshman year at the prestigious university. Kavanaugh s mostly Republican backers have tried to cast doubt on Ramirez s allegations, arguing that if such an incident really did occur, she would have reported it at the time. But former students who overlapped with Kavanaugh at Yale describe the university in the 1980s as a place where being a female student still felt like a privilege, not a right; where heavy drinking was commonplace; where women felt they were expected to put up with bad behavior from men; and where certain privileged groups of men seemed able to get away with anything.  It felt like  we were only here by the graces of men,  said Luckow, who now teaches film at the university.  There was this sense that we were responsible for what men did to us. Faced with allegations of drunken sexual assault, Kavanaugh has depicted himself as a studious, celibate kid who shied away from partying.  I went to an all-boys Catholic high school, where I was focused on academics and athletics, going to church every Sunday and friendship with my fellow classmates and friendship with girls from the local all-girls Catholic schools,  Kavanaugh said in an interview with Fox News this week.  I did not have sexual intercourse, or anything close to sexual intercourse, in high school or for many years thereafter.  But several of Kavanaugh s former classmates at Yale describe him and his fraternity brothers as heavy drinkers who were aggressive toward women when drunk. In his second year at Yale, Kavanaugh joined Delta Kappa Epsilon, a fraternity known on campus for mistreating women. Greek life was only beginning to make a comeback at the university at that time, and joining a fraternity was an unusual move. Pledging DKE was  a step out of the mainstream,  said one woman who graduated in 1985 and requested anonymity to speak frankly about her experiences at Yale.  The guys from DKE were pigs. Horrible men. This is the sort of people [with whom] he elected to surround himself,  she said, referring to Kavanaugh.Of the dozens of former Yale students HuffPost spoke with, almost all said DKE brothers in those years were known as heavy drinkers who often degraded women and themselves while partying   especially during pledging and hazing rituals.Yearbook photos of DKE brothers taken while Kavanaugh was an undergrad, and later while he attended Yale Law School, show students posing pantsless around a keg, holding cups of beer. In a photo taken in 1988, the year after Kavanaugh graduated, a student s testicles are clearly visible. In a 1991 photo, one student is holding what appears to be a rifle. HuffPost obtained DKE yearbook photos taken between 1984 and 1991   except for 1987, Kavanaugh s senior year, when the fraternity s photo was absent from the yearbook. It s not clear whether Kavanaugh himself appears in any of the photos.The year Kavanaugh joined DKE, two of his fraternity brothers marched through campus holding a flag made of women s underwear. A fraternity member claimed the underwear was obtained  consensually,  but a female classmate of Kavanaugh s said DKE brothers would ransack underwear from women s rooms.Several female Yale alumnae who spoke to HuffPost said they went out of their way to avoid DKE parties because of the fraternity s reputation for mistreating women. Participants in a  Take Back the Night  march to raise awareness of sexual assault were hesitant to walk by the DKE house because they worried they d get hassled, said Heather Gold, who was active in anti-rape organizing at Yale in the 1980s. There was a growing awareness of the threat of sexual assault in New Haven, Connecticut, in the 1980s.  It became obvious that women at Yale were worried about rape and that rape was an aspect of university life,  Beth Morrow, class of 1987, wrote in an essay in that year s yearbook.But it was still nearly unheard of for women to speak out about sexual abuse, female graduates said. There was the fear of being labeled a slut, of not being believed, and of being retraumatized in an insular community where it was hard for victims to avoid their assailants, Gold said. There also weren t many resources available to women on campus. The university s Women s Center was perceived by most students as a place for militant feminists or lesbians   both of which were alienating labels at the time, two alumnae recalled. The culture of silence contributed to a system that allowed powerful men to go unpunished for abusing women   and perhaps not even recognize their actions as abuse.Bryan Cole, a 1987 graduate who was friends with Ramirez, said her claim struck him as sadly plausible.  That it would happen to a woman and she would not feel comfortable to speak about it doesn t surprise me,  he told HuffPost. Unfortunately, guys like Kavanaugh still felt they could behave that way, especially when drinking,  Cole said.  There did not appear to be consequences for your actions. DKE s reputation has only gotten worse since Kavanaugh graduated. In 2011, the fraternity was banned from Yale for five years after videos surfaced of DKE recruits chanting in front of the University Women s Center:  No means yes, yes means anal.  Earlier this year, the Yale Daily News and Business Insider reported sexual assault allegations against more than half a dozen DKE members, including the fraternity s former president. Yale has launched an investigation into the matter.On Monday, Luckow asked her students at Yale what they thought of the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh.She was disappointed by the response. It s exactly the same way now as it was then,  one male student told her.  Nothing s going to change. This story has been updated with additional details.Need help?

When the police arrived, they questioned me and my sister. Then, they launched an investigation. Throughout that process, I felt safe, believed and heard. I was not badgered about the amount of information I could recall. I wasn t told that if I had acted differently, maybe the person would not have broken into my house. I was treated like the victim of a crime.There is a stark contrast between my experience as a victim of a break-in and the experiences of victims of sexual violence in today s world. This contrast is all too commonly felt and seen by many of my high school peers. This past week, my high school peers and I have watched as women like Dr. Christine Blasey Ford have come forward to accuse Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of committing sexual assault when he was a teenager. And we teenagers are paying attention to how our leaders are addressing these allegations and the messages they are sending to us young people.My peers and I fear coming forward to report any forms of sexual violence because we have no effective recourse. When I was in 9th grade, I was sexually harassed by a group of boys. When I came forward to report my harassers, I was scrutinized by my peers, who told me that I was  ruining their reputations  and that it was  just a joke.  I regretted my decision almost instantly.  My decision to report came so easily when I was calling 911 in a panicked fear that somebody was violating the safety of my home. But I did not have the same confidence reporting my harassers.The toxic rape culture that reverberates through the Kavanaugh conversation is echoed in many high schools across our nation. When girls get catcalled or get grabbed in the hallway in school, we are supposed to be flattered. Boys and adults will often defend these actions as meaningless jokes or even compliments that the girl reporting took too seriously. One of my friends was literally told,  It is prom season after all, what do you expect?  It seems as though someone can always find an excuse for the behavior in the  boys will be boys  handbook.I am now a high school senior. I was hopeful that the #MeToo movement would be a pivotal change in my life as a woman growing up in America. I hoped my adult life would be free of the fear of going out at night by myself, or going on a run past 8 p.m., or daring to tell my harasser I don t enjoy his actions. I would be free to walk around with my headphones in without fearing that I am missing sounds of danger, or free to wear whatever I feel most confident in. With the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, I saw more and more women come forward in public, and I saw more and more men held accountable for their actions. We were taking steps in the right direction. But this past week, our nation s political discourse has validated every young woman s decision not to report, to sit in agonizing silence while her assailant walks with impunity.Our leaders are supposed to set an example for younger generations. Right now, we are not getting the message we so desperately need. Our nation s leaders are writing off allegations of sexual assault and misconduct in high school and college as  typical teenage behavior.  High schoolers are hearing this message loud and clear.  Boys will be boys,  and girls should accept that. We are told that we come forward at  inconvenient times,  as if we deliberately sit in silence so that one day we can come forward when our accuser happens to be a nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States. Yes, President Trump, maybe Dr. Blasey Ford would have come forward sooner had she not been afraid. And instead of making the victims feel safe, they are being re-victimized as they are hearing their leaders dismiss their realities.I will not be silenced. I will not let my younger sister be told that her experiences should be swept under the rug so that her male friends can get their prep school scholarships and their football scholarships, while she sits in silence and fear of coming forward.Adults; The #TimesUp for you to address these issues in your young people s lives. Silence is complicity. This issue is not a liberal or conservative issue; it is a moral issue. We are all watching history being written before our eyes; please do not be on the wrong side of it.Do you have a personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

The Senate must vote!6:46 p.m. ETAfter nearly nine hours, the hearing has been adjourned.  Sara Boboltz6:45 p.m. ETSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) repeated the question asked by several other Democratic senators: Will Brett Kavanaugh ask the White House to start an FBI investigation into the allegations against him?After much back and forth without an answer from Kavanaugh, Harris said,  I m going to take this as a no and we can move on. Harris also asked Kavanaugh whether he agreed that it is possible for men to both be friends with some women and treat other women badly. Of course,  he replied, before repeating his assertion that he has many female friends who hold him in high regard.  Lydia O Connor and Sara Boboltz6:42 p.m. ETKavanaugh did not watch Christine Blasey Ford s testimony, the judge told Harris.  Sara Boboltz6:33 p.m. ET Sen. Feinstein:  Let me be clear. I did not hide Dr. Ford s allegations.

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) again defended why she didn t share Blasey s letter earlier.  I held it confidential until she decided that she would come forward.  When asked if her staff  leaked  the letter, she replied,  The answer is no.  I was asked to keep it confidential, and I m criticized for that, too,  Feinstein added.  Saba Hamedy6:32 p.m. ETSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) called out Kavanaugh for yet again invoking Leland Ingham Keyser s statements in his defense, saying that Kavanaugh isn t telling the whole story. She says she doesn t remember the night in question, but she also says that she believes Dr. Ford,  Booker said.  Lydia O Connor6:14 p.m. ETSen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) asked Kavanaugh, who has spent much of the hearing being agitated, whether  temperament  should also be  a trait we should consider  on the Supreme Court. She pointed out that he is not entitled to be on the court.  Marina Fang6:03 p.m. ET Judge, do you believe Anita Hill?  Blumenthal threw out in a last-minute question to Kavanaugh as Grassley moved the hearing along.  Lydia O Connor6:01 p.m. ET Kavanaugh has increasingly grown visibly frustrated with Democratic senators as the hearing goes on.During questioning from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Grassley finally had to step in to stop Kavanaugh from interrupting mid-question.  Lydia O Connor5:54 p.m. ETKavanaugh has now defended himself several times by referencing Leland Keyser s public statement that she does not recall Blasey s assault.It s a little more complicated: Blasey says Keyser was at the house where she was assaulted. After her accusation became public, a lawyer for Keyser put out a statement saying she does not remember the gathering yet believes her friend s accusation. Blasey said earlier Thursday that Keyser texted her to apologize for the statement after it was used to discredit her. Blasey also said she did not tell Keyser about the assault at the time.  Sara Boboltz5:40 p.m. ET  Yes, if Mark Judge were before us today we d be able to assess his credibility,  Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) snapped back at Kavanaugh as the nominee again listed witnesses at the party who reject Blasey s claims.The Republican-controlled committee has not called for Judge to testify.  Lydia O Connor5:38 p.m. ET Hatch raised his voice as he emphasized that Blasey s claims are from Kavanaugh s  teenage years.  He was an immature high schooler,  he said, dismissing other senators  inquiries into his past drinking habits.  Lydia O Connor5:37 p.m. ET Porn star lawyers with facially implausible claims are driving the news cycle,  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told the committee in reference to Michael Avenatti, who represents both Stormy Daniels and Julie Swetnick. Swetnick says she saw Kavanaugh at parties where women were raped.  Sara Boboltz5:33 p.m. ETBefore senators proceeded with their questioning after the break, Kavanaugh apologized to Klobuchar for responding to her questions about his drinking with questions about her own.  Lydia O Connor5:10 p.m. ET The hearing has paused for a 15-minute break.   Nina Golgowski5:09 p.m. ET  Drinking is one thing,  said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.),  but the concern is about truthfulness and in your written testimony you said you sometimes had too many drinks. She then asked whether Kavanaugh ever drank so much that he did not remember certain events. Kavanaugh twice directed the question back to Klobuchar, who said she does not have  a drinking problem.  Neither do I,  Kavanaugh said.  Sara Boboltz5:01 p.m. ET Kavanaugh appeared emotional while responding to Sen. John Cornyn s encouragement to persevere. I will always be a good person and try to be a good judge, whatever happens,  he told the Texas senator.   Nina Golgowski5:00 p.m. ET White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded to Graham s questioning of Kavanaugh, during which he erupted at Democrats. @LindseyGrahamSC has more decency and courage than every Democrat member of the committee combined,  Sanders tweeted.  God bless him. .@LindseyGrahamSC has more decency and courage than every Democrat member of the committee combined. God bless him.  Saba Hamedy 4:58 p.m. ET Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) asked a series of questions about captions in Kavanaugh s high school yearbook. The nominee said they referred to drinking games,  the F word  and flatulence, prompting some laughter from those gathered.  Sara Boboltz4:51 p.m. ET Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said the hearing was  the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics.  Are you a gang rapist?  Graham asked Kavanaugh. No,  Kavanaugh replied. (None of Kavanaugh s accusers have suggested he participated in a gang rape. One said she saw him attend parties where other boys engaged in such behavior.) This is not a job interview. This is hell,  Graham said forcefully.  This is going to destroy the ability for good people to come forward because of crap. Graham told Kavanaugh,  You have nothing to apologize for. He went on to unload on Democrats:  I would never do to them what you ve done to this guy. This is the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics.  Boy, y all want power,  Graham said in regard to Democrats on the committee running for office in 2020.  Boy, I hope y all never get it. Graham erupts at Democrats:  This is the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics.

Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) advised Kavanaugh to turn to White House counsel Don McGahn and request that the committee suspend the hearing and start an FBI investigate the allegations.The suggestion drew anger from Grassley. This committee is running this hearing, not the White House, not Don McGahn,  Grassley said.  I think an FBI investigation will help all of us on both sides of the issue,  Durbin concluded.  Nina Golgowski4:39 p.m. ET Leahy asked Kavanaugh point-blank whether he was the  Bart O Kavanaugh    a character who vomits in a car after a party   mentioned in Judge s memoir. Kavanaugh said Leahy would have to ask Judge before shouting over the senator, whom he accused of mocking him.Leahy also asked Kavanaugh to explain any references to drinking and sexual activity in his yearbook. The nominee responded by touting his academic and athletic record. We got a filibuster but no answer,  Leahy said.  Sara Boboltz4:32 p.m. ETThe hearing has resumed with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) questioning Kavanaugh, asking whether he believes Judge should be present to testify.Kavanaugh replied:  He s already provided sworn testimony to the committee.   Nina Golgowski4:26 p.m. ET Donald Trump Jr. tweeted that it s  nice to see a conservative man fight for his honor. I love Kavanaugh s tone. It s nice to see a conservative man fight for his honor and his family against a 35 year old claim with ZERO evidence and lots of holes that amounts to nothing more than a political hit job by the Dems. Others in the GOP should take notice!  Sara Boboltz4:17 p.m. ETPresident Donald Trump is  riveted  by the hearing and so far views Kavanaugh s testimony positively, said Washington Post reporter Robert Costa, citing unnamed sources inside the White House.President Trump is  riveted  and telling people,  This is why I nominated him,  in a positive way, per person close to him. Talking to lots of people inside WH about how he likes how Kavanaugh is fighting back. Admires the defiance.   Sara Boboltz4:11 p.m. ET The hearing is taking a 15-minute break at the request of Kavanaugh.  Nina Golgowski4:11 p.m. ET Kavanaugh said nothing in his personal calendars have been changed since he created them in 1982.  Nina Golgowski4:10 p.m. ET Mitchell went point-by-point through Blasey s story about the assault. Kavanaugh said he has never been alone in a room with Judge and Blasey, nor has he ever engaged in any sexual behavior with Blasey, including consensual behavior.  Sara Boboltz4:07 p.m. ET Kavanaugh called  the Swetnick thing  a  joke  and a  farce. Asked by Feinstein whether he wanted to say anything more on Julie Swetnick s accusation that he attended parties where women were gang-raped, Kavanaugh said forcefully,  No.   Sara Boboltz4:06 p.m. ET Kavanaugh continued to express anger over having not been able to address the allegations against him immediately.  It s an outrage that I was not allowed to come and immediately defend my name and say I didn t do this and give you all this evidence. I m not even in D.C. on the weekends in the summer of 1982.   Nina Golgowski4:02 p.m. ET Mitchell asked Kavanaugh how he knows Mark Judge.Kavanaugh identified Judge as a friend from school who was a  funny guy, great writer, popular, developed a serious addiction problem that lasted decades. Near death a couple of times from his addition. Suffered tremendously. Kavanaugh said he hadn t spoken with Judge in a few years.Kavanaugh said he knows of Blasey s friend Leland Ingham Keyser and wouldn t rule out having crossed paths with her in high school.  Nina GolgowskiCORRECTION: This entry previously misstated Judge s first name as Mike. 3:57 p.m. ETKavanaugh said the experience has been beyond challenging for him and his family. Explaining this to our daughters has been about the worst experience of our lives,  he said, before calling his wife his  rock. Kavanaugh also lamented the impact Blasey s accusation has had on his reputation. He said he may never be able to teach law or coach girls basketball again.  Nina Golgowski, Sara Boboltz3:56 p.m. ET Kavanaugh emphasized his long history of hiring female law clerks. If confirmed, he said, he would be the first Supreme Court judge with only female clerks.HuffPost previously reported that professors at Yale coached women seeking clerkships with Kavanaugh to dress a certain way. One said  it s no accident  Kavanaugh s clerks look  like models.   Sara Boboltz3:49 p.m. ET Kavanaugh recalled receiving a supportive text from a  liberal  female friend reading:  Deep breaths. You re a good man, good man, a good man. Kavanaugh s wife, sitting behind him, nodded several times upon hearing her husband talk about that assurance from a friend.  Sara Boboltz3:45 p.m. ET Kavanaugh said he drank alcohol in high school, saying the legal age to drink in Maryland was 18 at the time. I drank beer with my friends,  he said.  Sometimes I had too many beers. I liked beer. I still like beer. But I did not drink beer to the point of blacking out and I never sexually assaulted anyone. Judge Brett Kavanaugh:  I drank beer with my friends. Almost everyone did. Sometimes I had too many beers. Sometimes others did... But I did not drink beer to the point of blacking out and I never sexually assaulted anyone.  pic.twitter.com/Dmdcx0PHRQ  Nina Golgowski3:42 p.m. ET Kavanaugh defended his use of the calendar as evidence, pointing to appointments and workouts he crossed out if he d missed them. He acknowledged that the calendar isn t definitive, but rather one piece of evidence.He also appeared to cite his female friendships as further evidence that he would not sexually assault anyone.  Sara Boboltz 3:36 p.m. ETKavanaugh got choked up when talking about his dad, who taught him how to keep calendars. Lawyers for Kavanaugh released pages from his 1982 calendar this week as an attempt to prove that he didn t assault Blasey. The party was not listed on the calendar. However, it s feasible that a 17-year-old would not list a small gathering on his calendar.Kavanaugh insisted the calendar  all but definitively shows that I was not there.   Marina Fang3:31 p.m. ETKavanaugh mentioned his previously clean background in his defense. Until last week, no one ever accused me of any kind of sexual misconduct,  he said.  No one ever. A lifetime. A lifetime of public service and a lifetime of high profile public service at the highest levels of American government and never a hint of anything of this kind and that s because nothing of this kind ever happened.   Nina Golgowski3:26 p.m. ET Kavanaugh s voice broke when he told the committee one of his daughters wanted to pray for  the woman.   Sara Boboltz3:24 p.m. ET  I ve never sexually assaulted anyone,  Kavanaugh said.  Not in high school, not in college, ever. He cited a friendship with a woman who once told him she was sexually abused and talked about how his mother faced sexual harassment in her career. Kavanaugh said  allegations of sexual assault must always be taken seriously  but went on to say that  the person who is the subject of those allegations must also be heard.  Due process means listening to both sides,  he said.   Saba Hamedy, Sara Boboltz3:23 p.m. ET  This has destroyed my family and my good name, a good name built up through decades of very hard work and public service at the highest levels of public government,  Kavanaugh said.  Nina Golgowski3:22 p.m. ET Kavanaugh called the claims against him a  coordinated  partisan effort to derail his confirmation. What goes around comes around,  he said.  You may defeat me in the final vote, but you ll never get me to quit. Never.   Sara Boboltz3:19 p.m. ET Kavanaugh, reading from a previously unreleased statement and appearing visibly angry, said he had  demanded a hearing for the very next day  after Blasey s allegation became public.  Unfortunately, it took the committee 10 days to get to this hearing,  he said. My family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed by vicious and false additional accusations,  he said.  The 10-day delay has been harmful to me and my family, the Supreme Court and my family. Attorneys for Blasey said last week that they felt rushed and  bullied  by Republican senators pushing to hold the hearing as soon as possible.Kavanaugh also emphasized that four people allegedly at the gathering had not corroborated Blasey s story.  I was not at the party described by Dr. Ford,  he said.  This confirmation process has become a national disgrace.   Nina Golgowski, Sara Boboltz3:09 p.m. ET Kavanaugh just arrived to testify, holding the hand of his wife.

She is just as much a victim of this as Brett Kavanaugh because someone betrayed her trust,  he said, apparently referencing the fact that her letter became public despite her desire to remain anonymous.   Nina Golgowski2:19 p.m. ETMitchell concluded her questions for Blasey by pointing out that the format of the day s questioning was not ideal. She cited research that suggests the best way to talk to trauma survivors is one-on-one in private.Mitchell wraps up her questions for Ford -- and essentially rips the way this process was set up. Would you believe me if I told you that there s no study that says this setting, in 5-minute increments, is the best way  to do this?Lady female prosecutor CYA moment?  Sara Boboltz2:15 p.m. ET Grassley thanked Blasey for her testimony and called for a 45-minute recess.  Sara Boboltz2:11 p.m. ET  Nothing remarkable happened to them. They were downstairs,  Blasey said about statements made from her friend Leland Ingham Keyser and others at the party who have said they have no memory of the event. Mr. Judge is a different story,  she said.  I would expect that he would remember this happened.  Blasey Ford on statements from other party attendees:  I don t expect that P.J. and Leland would remember this evening. It was a unremarkable party. It wasn t a more notorious party. Because nothing remarkable happened to them that evening. They were downstairs.  pic.twitter.com/NrIJ9Cz9k0  Sara Boboltz, Nina Golgowski2:08 p.m. ETEd Whelan, Kavanaugh s friend and a conservative lawyer who last week promulgated a conspiracy theory designed to discredit Blasey s claims, came up during the questioning. He alleged that she may have mistaken Kavanaugh for someone else. I just don t feel like it s right for us to be talking about that,  Blasey said.  Marina Fang2:02 p.m. ET  We wanted her to know we support her and what she is doing is important,  one current student of Holton-Arms, where Blasey attended school, told The New York Times from her seat in the audience.  17yo woman in plaid uniform skirt & grey Holton-Arms sweatshirt is sitting in audience in Kavanaugh hearing rm listening to Ford (a Holton alumna). Doesn t want her name used.  We wanted her to know we support her & what she is doing is important,  she tells me. Here w 3 friends   Sara Boboltz2:02 p.m. ET Blasey said she went to four to five parties that Kavanaugh also attended during her freshman and sophomore years of high school.   Nina Golgowski1:58 p.m. ETBlasey s lawyers say they are not being paid and  have no expectation of being paid.   Sara Boboltz1:57 p.m. ET Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) praised Blasey for being  heroic.  Your brilliance, shining a light onto this, speaking your truth, is nothing short of heroic,  he said.  You are speaking truth that this country needs to understand and how we deal with survivors who come forward right now is unacceptable.   Saba Hamedy1:49 p.m. ETBlasey said she does not know how her letter to Feinstein became public. She agreed to sit down for an interview after reporters began showing up to her home and workplace.  Sara Boboltz1:46 p.m. ETMitchell pressed Blasey for an answer on who paid for the polygraph test she took. Let me put an end to this misery. Her lawyers paid for the polygraph,  said Debra Katz, one of Blasey s lawyers.  As is routine.  As is routine,  Michael Bromwich, another lawyer, repeated.  Sara Boboltz1:42 p.m. ETWhen Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) asked whether there was any political motivation behind her decision to speak out, Blasey said there was not.  I d like to reiterate that I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of what looked like equally qualified candidates,  she said of the other potential Supreme Court nominees released by President Donald Trump.  Nina Golgowski1:38 p.m. ET The hearing has resumed after a lunch break.  Nina Golgowski1:37 p.m. ETGraham told reporters that he is looking forward to hearing the rest of what Blasey has to say and is reserving judgment until the end of the hearing.  It does take a lot of courage for people to come forth and talk about being victimized. I ve represented people who have been accused of things that they didn t do and that s why I am listening,  he said, adding that he wants  more detail  on how Blasey got to the house where the event allegedly occurred and how she left.He said he s disappointed in and suspicious of his Democratic colleagues for how they have presented information.  Nina Golgowski and Igor Bobic1:25 p.m. ETSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), speaking to reporters during the break, said he is not convinced from Blasey s testimony and that her  hiring a lawyer and taking a polygraph makes me more suspicious.  Hiring a lawyer and taking a polygraph makes me more suspicious,  Graham says about Ford testimony so far, adding that she  can t say how she got (to the party) and how she left Later, he seemed to dismiss a woman who said she had been raped.That was me! @LindseyGrahamSC said he did not believe Dr. Ford because she couldn t recall the exact date of the assault. I told him I was raped 13yrs ago but don t know the date. So would he believe me?He said  I m sorry, but then you should go to the cops. #BelieveSurvivors https://t.co/UERpDmvBU9  Nina Golgowski 12:45 p.m. ET The hearing is taking a 30-minute break for lunch.  Nina Golgowski12:44 p.m. ETWhen asked why the polygraph test had happened at a hotel, Blasey said she  had just left my grandmother s funeral. Omg. Ford left her grandmother s FUNERAL to take her polygraph in a nearby hotel.   Saba Hamedy 12:44 p.m. ETBlasey, speaking of her experience taking the polygraph test, said she was  scared of the test itself but was comfortable that I could tell the information and the test would reveal whatever it was going to reveal. She said she was never given tips on how to take the test.  Nina Golgowski12:37 p.m. ET Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) echoed other Democratic senators in thanking Blasey for her courage. I believe you,  he said.  You have given American an amazing teaching moment. You may have other moments in the classroom but you have inspired and you have enlightened America. Blumenthal cited Blasey s polygraph test, as as well as her request for an FBI investigation and other witnesses to testify, as reasons behind his belief in her. But also you have been very honest about what you cannot remember and someone composing a story can make it all come together in a seamless way but someone who is honest ... is also candid about what she or he cannot remember as well,  he said.Blumenthal also asked Blasey whether she would like Mark Judge to testify before the committee. That would be my preference,  Blasey replied. She reiterated that knowing when Judge worked at a local Safeway, where she saw him working a few weeks after the incident, would help her narrow down the date.  Saba Hamedy, Nina Golgowski and Sara Boboltz12:28 p.m. ET Blasey told Grassley  it wasn t clear  to her that the chairman had offered to fly committee members to California to hear her testimony, as he stated earlier in the hearing. She told Grassley she sincerely appreciated the offer. I would have happily hosted you,  Blasey said.  Sara Boboltz12:27 p.m. ET Asked by Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) to respond to the excuse  boys will be boys,  Blasey said:  I think the younger you are when these things happen, it could possibly have worse impact than when you re brain is fully developed and you have better coping skills that you ve developed.   Nina Golgowski12:23 p.m. ET Across the world, people are watching the Kavanaugh-Ford hearing, and this includes passengers on airplanes. Here s the view aboard JetBlue flight 415 from New York to San Francisco. https://t.co/eOfz2NuhTI pic.twitter.com/mVLEWvYCmi12:21 p.m. ETMitchell asked Blasey a string of questions about her fear of flying. The questions seemed to be focused on the severity of the fear and Blasey s anxiety, as Mitchell pointed out that Blasey had traveled on airplanes to visit family, go on vacation vacation and appear at the committee hearing.Blasey has said the sexual assault has  drastically altered  her life and sparked a lifelong struggle with anxiety. Mitchell s line of questioning appeared to attempt to cast doubt on that claim.   Sara Boboltz12:19 p.m. ET Mitchell asked Blasey to describe why and when she had approached certain people with her story. I was panicking because I knew the timeline was short for the decision and people were giving me advice on the beach, people who don t know about the processes and many people told me you need to hire a lawyer,  Blasey said.  I didn t understand why I would need a lawyer. Somebody said [to] call The New York Times, call the Washington Post. Go to your congressperson. When I weighed those options, [my choice] was to try to do the civic route, which was go to my congressperson. And I also put in the anonymous tip to the Washington Post. Unfortunately, neither got back to me before the selection of the nominee.   Saba Hamedy12:13 p.m. ETWhen asked by Mitchell what she hasn t forgotten about the incident, Blasey answered:  The stairwell, the living room, the bedroom, the bed on the right side of the room as you walk inside the room ... the bathroom in close proximity, the laughter, the uproarious laughter and the multiple attempts to escape and the final ability to do so.   Nina Golgowski12:07 p.m. ET Mitchell questioned whether the Kavanaugh incident directly caused Blasey s anxiety issues or if it was one of many contributing factors. Blasey acknowledged that there may have been other risk factors that contributed to her anxiety, saying there may have been a biological predisposition to it, but said she couldn t think of another environmental risk factor    certainly nothing as striking as that event,  she said.  Nina Golgowski11:59 a.m. ET Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) lamented the lack of a FBI investigation, apologizing to Blasey that her request for one hadn t been fulfilled. Never in the history of background investigations has an investigation not been pursued when new, credible, derogatory information was brought forward about the nominee or the candidate,  he said.  In my view it s a grave disservice to you. ... I will make a personal pledge to you here, however long it takes, whenever it s possible I will do whatever s in my power to make sure your claims get a full and proper investigation.   Saba Hamedy11:57 a.m. ET Mitchell asked how Blasey had narrowed down the date of the incident. She said she was able to say it occurred in the summer of 1982 based on when she obtained her driver s license, but that it would be helpful if she knew when Mark Judge worked at the Potomac Safeway because she saw him working there a few weeks after the incident.   Sara Boboltz11:48 a.m. ETThe hearing has resumed with questioning by Mitchell.  Nina Golgowski11:32 a.m. ETThe hearing is taking a 15-minute break.  Nina Golgowski11:31 a.m. ET Dr. Ford says she ran into Mark Judge at a store 6-8 weeks after the alleged assault. His face was white,  she said.  We had previously been friendly together.... He looked a little bit ill. 11:31 a.m. ET Durbin praised Blasey s bravery to come forward and acknowledged that she is not expected to remember everything that happened to her. A polished liar can create a seamless story, but a trauma survivor cannot be expected to remember every painful detail,  he said.   Nina Golgowski11:28 a.m. ET  Dr. Ford, with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?  asked Durbin. 100 percent,  Blasey said.  Sara Boboltz11:26 a.m. ET  Mark Judge should be subpoenaed from his Bethany Beach hideaway  and testify before committee, said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). He also echoed Leahy in thanking Blasey for her courage in coming forward.  You had absolutely nothing to gain by bringing these facts to the Senate Judiciary Committee,  he said.  Saba Hamedy11:18 a.m. ET Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) asked Blasey what she couldn t forget about her sexual assault. Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter,  Blasey said.  The uproarious laughter between the two [Kavanaugh and Mark Judge] and their having fun at my expense.   Jenna Amatulli11:17 a.m. ET Mitchell asked Blasey to confirm details of her story. She asked whether Blasey drank before arriving or was taking any medications. Blasey said no.Mitchell then inquired about the atmosphere at the house where she was assaulted. Blasey once again said it was clear that Kavanaugh and Judge were drinking before they got there. She said the room was  sparsely furnished  and  fairly modern.  The scene was less of a  party  than a casual gathering that she assumed would lead to a party. It wasn t very loud.  Sara Boboltz11:14 a.m. ET Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), ahead of his questioning, said he has been inspired by Blasey s courage. You sharing your story is going to have a lasting, positive impact on so many survivors in our country,  he said.  We owe you a debt of gratitude. Thank you.   Nina Golgowski11:10 a.m. ETFeinstein asked Blasey to say how she knows it was Kavanaugh who pushed her into a room. The same way I know I m talking to you right now,  Blasey said.  Basic memory functions.  What you are telling us is that this could not be a case of mistaken identity,  Feinstein pressed. Absolutely not,  Blasey answered.  Nina Golgowski11:06 a.m. ETFeinstein asked Blasey why she had kept relatively quiet about the assault for so long. Blasey described the issues she has faced since the assault, including the claustrophobia that prompted her to push for a second front door to her family s home as they remodeled it. She said she suffered academically in the years directly following the assault and had difficulty making friends, particularly male friends.Blasey stated unequivocally that her accusation against Kavanaugh could not be a case of mistaken identity.  Sara Boboltz11:03 a.m. ETGrassley interrupted Mitchell s questioning of Blasey to allow Feinstein to begin asking questions.

pic.twitter.com/nIezV2CW6N10:54 a.m. ET Blasey said her  greatest fears have been realized  since coming forward with her allegation against Kavanaugh.  I ve had to relive this trauma in front of the world, and I have seen my life picked apart on television, on Twitter, on other media, and in this body,  she said.  I have been accused of partisan political motives. Those who say that don t know me. I m an independent person. I m no one s pawn. My motivation in coming forward was to be helpful. ... My responsibility is to tell you the truth.   Saba Hamedy10:50 a.m. ET Brett s assault on me drastically altered my life,  Blasey said. She explained that she did not want to tell her parents that she had been  drinking beer with boys  at a party without adult supervision. She said she told very few friends over the years about having been assaulted.Blasey said she was compelled to recount the assault while at couple s counseling in May 2012 because it had interfered with an extensive remodel of the family s home. Blasey insisted on adding a second front door, which her husband could not understand until she described her memory of being locked in a bedroom and assaulted.She then recalled the slow process of telling other people close to her about the assault as Kavanaugh emerged as a potential Supreme Court nominee.  Sara Boboltz10:41 a.m. ETIn Blasey s opening statements, she said she was  terrified  of giving her testimony.Blasey said she met Kavanaugh through friends and that they sometimes attended the same parties, although they did not know each other well. It was almost surely a spur-of-the-moment gathering,  Blasey said of the party where she says she was assaulted.  The details about that party that bring me here today are ones I will never forget.   Sara Boboltz10:40 a.m. ETBlasey beings to tear up as she delivers her prepared remarks on the night of the alleged assault.You can read her full statement here.  Alana Horowitz Satlin10:34 a.m. ET Feinstein concluded by saying,  This is not a trial of Dr. Ford, it s a job interview for Judge Kavanaugh. ... Is he the best we can do? The senator reviewed the allegations made by Debbie Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, along with statements from women who say they knew Kavanaugh at Yale University and that he drank much more heavily at that time than he has claimed.Ramirez told The New Yorker that Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face at a party in the 1980s. Swetnick says Kavanaugh attended parties where women were sexually assaulted, but did not accuse the nominee himself of assault.Grassley previously said that his staff made eight requests for evidence from attorneys for Ramirez and six requests for evidence from attorneys from Swetnick but that the attorneys did not make their clients available.  Nina Golgowski and Sara Boboltz10:31 a.m. ET Feinstein slammed the Senate Judiciary Committee for failing to subpoena Mark Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh who Blasey says was in the room during the alleged sexual assault. Blasey says she was pinned on a bed beneath Kavanaugh but escaped when Judge jumped on top of them.  Sara Boboltz10:29 a.m. ET Anti-Kavanaugh protesters are lining the stairwell leading up to the hearing room pic.twitter.com/302VNpPV20 I m here because I believe her,  said Meghan Foley, one of the demonstrators.  Igor Bobic10:27 a.m. ETFeinstein said the FBI investigated Anita Hill s allegations against Clarence Thomas and called the agency s involvement a  normal process and squarely within its jurisdiction.   Nina Golgowski10:23 a.m. ETFeinstein responded to Grassley s criticism by saying she withheld the letter at Blasey s request. Yes, I did receive a letter from Dr. Ford ... The next day I called Dr. Ford,  she said.  We spoke on the phone. She reiterated that she wanted this held confidential, and I held it confidential up to a point where the witness was willing to come forward. I think as I make my remarks perhaps you ll see why. How women are treated in the United States with this kind of concern is really wanting a lot of reform. Feinstein went on to thank Blasey for sharing her story.  Saba Hamedy10:22 a.m. ET Grassley further downplayed requests for the FBI to investigate the Kavanaugh allegations by quoting then-Sen. Joe Biden s remarks during the 1991 hearing for Clarence Thomas, who was a Supreme Court nominee at the time. Biden was quoted as saying,  The next person who refers to an FBI report as being worth anything obviously doesn t understand anything.  Biden was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when Thomas was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill.  Nina Golgowski10:18 a.m. ETGrassley pointed to the FBI s background check on Kavanaugh, saying nowhere in the report was there a  whiff  of inappropriate sexual behavior. He then emphasized that Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, was aware of Blasey s allegation against Kavanaugh but chose not to question him about it during the judge s original hearings earlier this month. He said Feinstein revealed her  secret evidence  in the  eleventh hour. The chairman also addressed calls for the FBI to reopen its background investigation on Kavanaugh, saying that doing so would not be of much help.  Sara Boboltz10:09 a.m. ETGrassley apologized to Blasey and Kavanaugh for the harassment and threats they and their families have endured over last few weeks. Both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh have been through a terrible couple of weeks,  he said, kicking off the hearing.  What they have endured ought to be considered by all of us as unacceptable and a poor reflection on the state of civility on the state of democracy. I want to apologize to you both.   Saba Hamedy10:05 a.m. ET Blasey has sat down before the committee with her attorney, and Grassley has gaveled-in the hearing.  Sara Boboltz9:53 a.m. ET More than 50 progressive groups wrote to Grassley on Thursday, asking him to resign as chair of the Judiciary Committee over his treatment of Blasey. You have publicly bullied a woman who has stepped forward to report allegations of sexual assault,  reads the letter, endorsed by groups including Progress Iowa and MoveOn.  You and your staff had knowledge of the allegation prior to it becoming public, and prepared a defense for the nominee while expeditiously moving through the nomination process with the hope it would never be uncovered. Grassley is probably not going to resign because a bunch of progressive groups want him to, but hey, points for trying. Read the full letter here.   Jen Bendery9:42 a.m. ETActress Alyssa Milano is among those attending the hearing, reportedly as a guest of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). She told reporters that she wants to show support for Blasey.Alyssa Milano, inside the Blasey Ford hearing:  We re here to support her and show our solidarity.

I met survivors of sexual assault in the hospital emergency room immediately after their attacks to try to provide them a safe place, and inform them of treatment options and support services. I would hold their hands through the excruciating forensic exam that collected evidence of their attack. I would sit with them while they reported their stories to the police. And I took hundreds, perhaps thousands, of calls from survivors in the middle of the night on our 24-7 hotline to offer strategies to manage their anxieties and fears. There are cases I can never forget: I witnessed changes that ensued in the lives of survivors. The woods were no longer a solace for one because the trees were silent as he held her down. For another, his family is no longer a refuge because his mom and dad couldn t fathom that their priest could do those things. Sleep is no longer restful for another survivor because the smell of her perpetrator seems it will suffocate her. And for some survivors, their bodies no longer feel clean because no matter how hard they scrub, they just can t wash the touch away. Rape crisis counselors witness these horrors, which occur every few minutes, every day, in every corner of the United States. Rape doesn t discriminate: It happens to young and old, male and female, rich and poor, conservative and progressive. When we counselors take our on-call shifts, we wait by our phones knowing we ll soon be called, knowing another person s life is about to be derailed. And we know that even if the survivors opt for the invasive, lengthy, and painful forensic exam, their evidence kit might never be processed, since most states don t prioritize the funding. We know, too, that only six perpetrators in 1,000 will be incarcerated. Members of your Senate Judiciary Committee are deciding now whether to approve the Supreme Court nomination of a man accused of engaging in such attacks. Many of the senators have demonstrated a disinterest in uncovering the truth. What is unfolding now in your committee is a second assault on our nation s survivors   an assault by public officials as they raise doubt, attempt to shame the brave women who share their suffering, and work to minimize the survivors  stories. So, I urge all Judiciary Committee members: Do not brush aside Christine Blasey Ford s testimony.  Do not disengage from reports by Deborah Ramirez, Julie Swetnick, or others who may choose to come forward. These reports are not just anecdotes from the past; they mirror the agonizing, ever-present burden carried by millions of survivors in this country. How we respond to these stories is a direct reflection of how much we value the lives of all survivors.Forcing Brett Kavanaugh s nomination would be a clear signal that our nation s leaders are disinterested in the integrity of the men who sit on our highest court. Each senator has thousands of constituents who have been sexually assaulted. Rushing Kavanaugh s confirmation is letting them know that their trauma isn t worthy of consideration. Each senator also has thousands, even millions, of young male constituents. Forcing the nomination implicitly affirms the  boys will be boys  mentality and accepts that  telling dirty jokes  and  drinking too much  eventually metastasize into  boys will rape girls and get away with it.  So I ask this of Judiciary Committee members: Listen carefully to Thursday s testimony. Withhold your judgement until all the relevant facts have been collected. Carefully consider the morals of those who may represent us on the nation s highest court. It s well past time that we listen to those who have been abused and attacked, support them through their trauma, take action to hold their perpetrators accountable, and change societal norms to decrease future assaults. It s well past time that we send a firm signal that perpetrators (whether adults or adolescents) are accountable for horrific actions. Now is the time for our nation s leaders to stand firm on the values of empathy, compassion and justice as it relates to Kavanaugh s nomination. And, since I have your attention, once this nomination process has concluded, it s well past time for you to ensure accountability within your own walls by establishing strict rules for sexual harassment claims within Congress. Also, I ll ask that you hold our nation s perpetrators accountable by earmarking funding to process the thousands of rape kits that are decomposing in warehouses. And finally, I ask that you use your voice to help change societal norms that blame survivors while giving perpetrators a pass.    Lori Bruce is the director of the Sherwin B.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) excoriated Republican senators for their  disappointing  response to sexual misconduct accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and reiterated her unwavering support for the accusers.Gillibrand   who earlier this week called for Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination   on Wednesday urged her colleagues to  actually listen  and show respect to Christine Blasey Ford, the California professor who has accused the nominee of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers. Ford is due to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.  I believe Dr. Blasey Ford because she s risking everything   her safety, her security, her reputation, her career   to tell this story at this moment for all the right reasons,  Gillibrand said in a powerful speech on the Senate floor.  If we allow women s experiences of sexual trauma to be second to a man s promotion, it will not only diminish this watershed moment of societal change we are in, it will bring shame on this body and on the court. In everything we do, we must remember: Our girls and boys are watching. What kind of message do we send by putting a man s promotion before a woman s trauma? My colleagues in the Senate need to step up and do the right thing. https://t.co/7qLUul9QD0Gillibrand criticized Republicans for  bullying  and  patronizing  Ford, and lambasted President Donald Trump for belittling Kavanaugh s accusers.Deborah Ramirez has alleged that Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face at a college party, and Julie Swetnick said the judge was present when she was gang-raped at a party in 1982. Trump has attacked Ford on Twitter and dismissed Ramirez s accusation as  nothing.  He also went after Michael Avenatti, Swetnick s attorney, on Wednesday, describing him as a  total low-life. Trump s raging  remind[ed] us once again that he has been credibly accused of sexual assault himself and denigrates not just women who accuse him but survivors everywhere,  Gillibrand said in her speech.She noted that the  retaliation and scorn  Kavanaugh s accusers have faced shows why many sexual assault survivors don t come forward with their stories. This process is sending the worst possible message to girls   and boys   everywhere,  Gillibrand said.  It s telling American women that your voice doesn t matter. It s telling survivors everywhere that your experiences don t count, they re not important and they are not to be believed.

I would venture to say that I have a hell of a lot more class than Donald Trump has ever had. The lawyer, whose client Julie Swetnick is accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, said that Trump s attack on him was  ridiculous.

Avenatti shot back, calling Trump a  habitual liar and complete narcissist who also is a disgrace as a president and an embarrassment to our nation. Avenatti said he was eager to do battle with those who doubt Swetnick s story.

Could the Senate s handling of the allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh cause a similar reckoning in the legal world?Law has long been an old boys club on par with Hollywood. Nothing salacious that has emerged in Hollywood, or anywhere else, is unimaginable in the legal profession. How might the rule-making institutions stand up to heightened anti-sexist scrutiny? Could the outrage we re seeing over Kavanaugh actually represent a tipping point?Students in law schools across the country will soon find out. Students and staff opposed to Kavanaugh s confirmation staged walkouts at Harvard, NYU, Temple and Yale. About half of Yale Law students attended anti-Kavanaugh demonstrations on Monday, and some 30 professors canceled classes to accommodate students who traveled to Washington, D.C., to join with like-minded others in the capital.  Among the protesters  grievances were the allegations that Yale professors had groomed would-be clerks to present themselves in ways Kavanaugh might find physically appealing. (Amy Chua, one of the accused groomers, has denied allegations against her.) Students were equally outraged that Yale had continued to pump clerkship applicants through the pipeline to Alex Kozinski   a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals jurist who stepped down in the face of credible sexual harassment charges   despite his reputation for inappropriate behavior.  That Yale is an epicenter of this uprising is significant not only because it is Kavanaugh s alma mater, but because it signals a deeper interrogation of the typical ways that students, faculty and alumni of elite law schools have uncritically celebrated the elevation of their problematic alums to the Supreme Court. A Yale Law degree is more than a feather in one s cap. Matriculating through Yale Law School is an elevator ride to the very epicenter of power in the legal profession. Supreme Court nominees who hail from Yale s halls are routinely celebrated by the institution, and alums trudge to the capital to swear to their good character and intellect. Elitism compels its beneficiaries to prioritize brand enhancement   even if that means overlooking the potential negative impact of a justice s ruling on issues that they care deeply about.A collateral consequence of the brand-enhancing orientation of elite law schools like Yale has been the now-standard sing-along that fellow alums are conscripted to perform in the face of probable ideological opposition to a nominee. Kavanaugh s supporters, anticipating a bumpy ride to confirmation based on his judicial record, bubble-wrapped the nominee with a statement signed by dozens of women and a photo op featuring a girls basketball team   all attempts to send the message that he is a  nice guy  to women. For all the concerns that his confirmation will constitute an end to reproductive freedom as we know it, being a nice guy from Yale who is beloved by countless women was (supposed to be) enough for Kavanaugh to sail through virtually unscathed.In an earlier period, it might have been enough. But then there was Me Too. The great brilliance of the Me Too movement is that it pulls the cover from nice guy narratives and brings daylight into the darkened pathways through which misogyny and male power become naturalized through law. It s still too easy to wrap up smarts, sometimes wit, and legal acumen into an unassailable package labeled  character    as though no man who can impressively dissect and reinvent legal doctrine could, at the same time, be ogling his clerks, harassing his secretary or abusing his wife.Law is placed  above  the fray. Smarts are seen as somehow an antidote to predation rather than a rationalization of it. Those who create and interpret the law aren t seen as violators of it, and even those who do violate the law are still elevated. All of this factors into why the legal profession is obscured as a site of sexual abuse.One-half to two-thirds of female lawyers in the U.S. have experienced or observed sexual harassment, and the problem is not unheard of in U.S. law schools, either. Three law school deans have stepped down after accusations of sexual harassment from both colleagues and students. The significant power imbalances from which judges benefit (where federal judges are appointed for life) and the importance of reputation and word of mouth mean that people who suffer abuse find it incredibly difficult to come forward. Given the career-destroying costs of speaking out against sexual assault, it is amazing that anyone ever talks. When they do   either to tell a story of abuse or to offer credibility to those who do   it is against enormous odds.  As it is on the casting couch in Hollywood, those who hold the power in law school and in courts can exact a high price for the opportunity to achieve fame and fortune in their chosen profession. The closed circles, the fear of earning a bad reputation for not going along, and even genuine respect and affection for abusers themselves all tip the scales in favor of silence, and even lying, in the face of accusations.  The Me Too movement has broadened the discourse in Hollywood beyond harassment, bringing into critical view the wider terrain of male dominance in institutions that shape what we see and think about the world.If Me Too takes hold in the world of law, judges will topple, SCOTUS pipelines will be disrupted and enablers will be exposed. But beyond the Weinstein effect on the powerful few might come a long overdue scrutiny of sexism in legal institutions and in laws themselves. One can t begin to fathom the consequences of such an interrogation of gender in the law   of the pay gaps, the hostile workplace conditions and the obstacles to power that shape the experiences of women   for law schools, law firms, the Supreme Court, and even the very content of legal doctrine itself. Republicans  disregard for even the appearance of taking sexual harassment seriously is a singular marker of the strength of a culture that enables rather than constrains male power. The sharp confrontation with this reality during the Hill-Thomas hearings spurred the Year of the Woman, but the deeper structures of gender subordination that have been enabled and practiced within legal institutions have escaped significant scrutiny. This time could be different.The institutions that produce legal professionals and regulate what we call sex equality exist within the same culture that has produced sex discrimination, harassment and abuse. Should the Weinstein effect take hold, the wider picture of the individual costs to women imposed by the rituals and reward structures within elite legal education   and their embodiment in the law itself   will become more fully legible.  Should Kavanaugh s confirmation come to pass, the newly minted right-wing majority will provide many opportunities for a discerning public to connect this end-game victory to the gendered dynamics that made it possible.

Although Republicans on the judiciary committee hired an outside counsel to do their questioning, the senators are now saying they may jump in and participate as well. Democrats have no idea how it will work when they have only five minutes each to try to get to the bottom of what Kavanaugh did or didn t do. And it s not clear whether the hearing will reveal everything or nothing at all. Some Republicans said this week that their vote hinges entirely on how the hearing goes. Others have refused to comment on the allegation until they hear from the accuser herself.  I hope that tomorrow s hearing gives us some guidance on how we vote,  Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a key swing vote, said on the Senate floor Wednesday.  But those of us on the committee have to be prepared for the possibility, indeed the likelihood, that there will be no definitive answers to the very large questions before us. Here s what is slated to happen: Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the committee chairman, will give an opening statement with no time limit. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking member, will then do the same. Christine Blasey Ford, a California research psychologist, will testify about her claims that, when they were teenagers, Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her by locking her in a room, pinning her down on a bed and groping her. Democratic senators will have five minutes each to question her. Republican senators will have the same amount of time, but they hired a sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona, Rachel Mitchell, to do the job for them. Kavanaugh will then testify, and the same round of questioning will occur. Written testimony from both Kavanaugh and Blasey has already been made public.Beyond that, it s anyone s guess how it will go. Capitol Hill staffers had trouble answering questions Wednesday about what they were expecting because, they said, everything was still in flux and unpredictable. GOP senators are expected to give their questioning time to Mitchell. That means that she will pursue a single line of questioning, if she chooses, and dig in deeper where she sees issues.But senators may not be able to help themselves and are leaving open the possibility that they will ask questions, too.  I m going to wait and see how the staff lawyer does,  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said.  I think a lot of the questions we would ask are pretty obvious. And if she takes care of everything I would ask a question about, I won t, but I reserve the right to ask questions. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John Kennedy (R-La.), who also sit on the judiciary committee, said they, too, reserved the right to ask questions. In her prepared testimony, Blasey said she hopes Republicans do jump in. Because the committee members will be judging my credibility, I hope to be able to engage directly with each of you,  she said. GOP strategists, however, are desperately hoping that the senators stay quiet. One told HuffPost that the last thing the party needs is  11 old white guys questioning a woman about teenage sex. On the other side, there are real concerns that Democrats will be at a disadvantage by the setup. Five minutes isn t long to pursue a line of questioning. In fact, it could lead to just one question and one answer if Kavanaugh filibusters in his response. Or senators may decide to make a point and just talk themselves for most of the time. But whatever the outcome, it could lead to a disjointed process on the Democratic side. So far, no senator has indicated that they will cede their time to another member to do more questioning, although there s been a bit of a push to let Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who have extensive prosecutorial experience, take the lead.  It s outrageous that Democrats will have only five minutes each to question Kavanaugh, especially given how evasive and dishonest he has been in previous hearings,  said Chris Kang chief counsel for the anti-Kavanaugh group Demand Justice.  Clearly, Republicans know that every time Kavanaugh speaks, he s losing, and they want to limit the damage as much as possible. Democrats also said they have had no coordination with Blasey and her team, while Kavanaugh s confirmation is being handled by the White House, which is in close touch with Republicans on Capitol Hill.Democrats said Wednesday that, in light of new sexual assault accusations, Kavanaugh should withdraw his nomination. They continued to insist that Senate Republicans should get the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations, and they still want Mark Judge   the booze-loving friend of Kavanaugh s who allegedly witnessed Blasey s assault   to testify.  This hearing is being run like a kangaroo court,  said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women s Law Center.  It s been set up without the benefit of a neutral investigation, without experts, and without witnesses (including Mark Judge and the other women who have come forward). There is no judge, only a highly partisan process that includes members of the Senate who have spent the last week rallying around Kavanaugh and discounting Blasey Ford. She added that she was grateful that Blasey was still going to attend the hearing, and she hopes  that this process doesn t further the trauma she has experienced. In a Senate floor speech, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Republicans were wrong to hold a single hearing before voting on the nominee in committee and on the floor as soon as next week. In the past week, two additional people have accused Kavanaugh of past sexually aggressive behavior, including one woman who came forward Wednesday.  That is not right. There is no need for such a rush,  Schumer said.  These women deserve to be heard, in a fair way, and their claims must be properly investigated. But even if the committee approves Kavanaugh on Friday, its investigation would continue, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told HuffPost.  The committee will keep investigating,  Hatch said.  Keep in mind when we put this man out of committee, that doesn t mean this is all over. Jen Bendery and Igor Bobic contributed reporting.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

She has said Kavanaugh pinned her down, groped her and attempted to remove her clothing at a high school party in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegation. Franklin Graham, son of the famed late preacher Billy Graham and a longtime Trump supporter, attempted to downplay the severity of Blasey s claim. He told the Christian Broadcasting Network last week that the allegation is  not relevant  because of how much time has passed and because Kavanaugh was a teenager at the time.  There s a lot of things that I ve done when I was a teenager that I certainly am ashamed of and not proud of,  Graham said in an interview last week.  People are up in arms over this like,  Oh, this is such a disaster.  You re talking about two teenagers 40 years ago. That has nothing to do with what we re talking about today about this man being a judge on the Supreme Court.   And they call it sexual assault?  he added.  No, I don t believe it.  Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, has said that, although he recognizes sexual abuse is a traumatic experience, Blasey s story was  very, very suspect.  Other evangelical leaders have outright mocked Blasey for waiting years before coming forward with the allegation   even though it often takes years for victims to find the strength to speak publicly about their abuse. One conservative organization, the American Family Association, claimed Blasey s charge didn t meet the  biblical standard  of having two or three witnesses for the crime. Over the past few days, several progressive Christians have taken to Twitter to point out that the evangelical leaders who are dismissing Blasey s sexual abuse allegation are often the same conservative voices that rail against queer love and preach a purity culture that shames people for any kind of premarital sexual activity.Conservative Christians often claim that their interpretation of the Christian sexual ethic is the only correct one   delivered straight from heaven and unchanged for 2,000 years. But at the same time, some evangelicals appear willing to support powerful leaders who don t subscribe to that ethic   giving out  mulligans  for actions they would typically condemn as immoral. The same religious leaders who told me as a teenager that premarital sex was a grave sin that would ruin my life forever have declared that no one can fault a 17-year-old boy for a little attempted rape,  Christian author Rachel Held Evans tweeted on Sept. 19. They always said  the world  would not understand our sexual ethic because  the darkness cannot comprehend the light,   Evans continued.  Maybe the world just doesn t get a sexual ethic in which being gay is a sin but chronic infidelity, sexual assault, &  pussy-grabbing  are just guys being guys. Read on to see how other progressive Christians are calling out the hypocrisy of leaders who are dismissive of Blasey s allegation. When Christians who passionately oppose same-sex relationships on the basis of  traditional sexual morality  minimize the gravity of sexual assault, they don t just reveal their hypocrisy they sully their credibility in any future discussions about sexual ethics, too. pic.twitter.com/ZRyZJlok0sI m not sure what s worse: all the men trying to tell women how they should react to being sexually assaulted by men or  the party of family values  telling young women that being sexually assaulted is a normal & acceptable part of high school.Both? Can both we worse?Listen, if  sensible conservatives  don t come out FULL FORCE against sexual assault, any overtures they make regarding caring for women in the abortion debate will ring hollow, and whatever moral high ground they think they have will disappear.Also, I m still confused as to why queer people having sex is V BAD, V SINFUL, but a straight man attempting to rape someone  shouldn t impact his SUPREME COURT NOMINATION. Straight Christians are WILD EVERYONE.The same world view that demonizes the supposed homosexuality of the Sodomites but doesn t bat an eye at Lot having sex with both his daughters is the same that condemns a woman for speaking about her rape but confirms the man who raped her. After having screamed incessantly for years about what goes on in people s bedrooms and in public bathrooms these  family values Christians  have had to ignore serial adultery, porn star affairs, Playmate payoffs, and assault allegations. https://t.co/BqEiFnvDZR Boys can t help themselves  Purity culture = Rape culture. https://t.co/clU9VSAWi4"

They died for us, and with us. And for themselves. They died, but they are great people. And we don t forget. In an earlier exchange, Trump asked a journalist where he was from, and the journalist identified himself as a Kurd.

Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) received an anonymous letter from a constituent accusing Kavanaugh of physically assaulting an unnamed woman he was dating 20 years ago, NBC first reported Wednesday. Senate staffers asked Kavanaugh about the incident over the phone, according to a redacted transcript of the call that was released by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.In the letter, dated Saturday, Sept. 22, the constituent claimed that in 1998, while Kavanaugh was authoring the Kenneth Starr report   which laid the grounds for impeaching former President Bill Clinton   he was socializing at a D.C. bar with the constituent s daughter and four friends. The constituent recounted the daughter s version of events:  Her friend was dating him, and they left the bar under the influence of alcohol. They were all shocked when Brett Kavanaugh shoved her friend up against the wall very aggressively and sexually. There were at least four witnesses, including my daughter. Her friend, still traumatized, called my daughter yesterday, September 21, 2018, wondering what to do about it. They decided to remain anonymous. Kavanaugh denied the allegation.   We re dealing with an anonymous letter about an anonymous person and an anonymous friend,  he told the committee, according to the transcript.  It s ridiculous. Total twilight zone. And no, I ve never done anything like that. HuffPost received an emailed copy of the letter from a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans. In an emailed statement, the spokesman told HuffPost the committee  regularly receives anonymous letters, some of which are viewed with credibility, but many of which are not.   To make sure no stone was left unturned, the committee asked Judge Kavanaugh yesterday about this anonymous letter. Judge Kavanaugh flatly denied any such event ever happened,  the spokesperson said.The Senate Judiciary Committee  received an anonymous letter with no name, address or any other contact information,  the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, confirmed to HuffPost on Wednesday.Gardner s office and the White House did not respond to HuffPost s request for comment.In the past month, three women have publicly accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford alleges that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in the early 1980s when they were both teenagers. Blasey claims Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party when he pinned her down, groped her and attempted to take off her clothes without her consent. The judge has vehemently denied her allegation.Two other women, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, came forward this week with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh, also from the 1980s.

Trump called the allegations a  con job  earlier in the conference and has repeatedly tried to discredit Kavanaugh s accusers.He didn t really answer the question. Instead, Trump chose to speak out against women accusing men of assault. This is a very big moment for our country, because you have a man who s very outstanding, but he s got strong charges against him   probably charges that no one is going to be able to prove,  Trump respondedTrump, who has himself has faced numerous credible allegations of sexual misconduct, figures that if Kavanaugh can be accused of assault, so can other potential candidates.As a result, the president claimed he may have trouble attracting people to be Supreme Court justices. I could conceivably be turned down by someone that desperately wanted this job two months ago,  he said.Trump said this  con game  at the  highest level  could  go on forever,  and claimed  it s a very dangerous period in our country. Trump then said Kavanaugh is currently facing a  guilty until proven innocent  situation, which he said is  a very, very dangerous standard. The president then predicted Thursday s appearance of Kavanaugh and his first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, before the Senate Judiciary Committee would be  a very, very important day in the history of our country.

For a Supreme Court nominee, that s deeply unusual   as NBC noted last week, it s the first time dating back to 2005 that a judge hasn t been favored for confirmation to the high court. Determining exactly how much of that unpopularity is owed to the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh remains somewhat tricky. Certainly, they haven t helped him. But Kavanaugh was already less popular than other recent nominees, including President Donald Trump s previous pick, Neil Gorsuch. And even absent any sort of scandal, Supreme Court nominees tend to see their numbers drop throughout the confirmation process. Added to that, public opinion polls naturally fluctuate from week to week, making it hard to distinguish sampling variation from a small-but-real shift in opinion.Initial HuffPost/YouGov polling found virtually no change in Kavanaugh s numbers after he was publicly accused of sexual assault; Gallup, which was conducting a poll while the story broke, also concluded that  opposition to Kavanaugh was already increasing before the allegations were publicized, and the allegations appeared to have had no immediately negative effect on public opinion.   But taken together, the latest set of polls paint a clearly negative and likely somewhat worsening picture:All the most recent surveys find considerable divides along partisan lines, with Republicans broadly supporting Kavanaugh and Democrats widely condemning him. The divide between Trump voters and those who voted for Hillary Clinton is even more pronounced.  Republicans, both men and women, strongly favor confirmation, while Democrats of both sexes overwhelmingly oppose it,  YouGov s Kathy Frankovic noted in a release about the Economist results.  But the gender gap among independents is particularly striking: currently, independent men favor the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh 43% to 38%; independent women oppose it 38% to 28%. Two weeks ago, independents were closely divided.  YouGov s polling for HuffPost, similarly, finds male and female Republicans about equally likely to favor Kavanaugh s confirmation, with independent men more than twice as likely as independent women to do so. In the Marist/PBS Newshour/NPR survey, Republican men and women are about equally likely to believe Kavanaugh over Blasey (61 percent and 57 percent, respectively, say they side with Kavanaugh), while Democratic men and women both say they believe Blasey (54 and 56 percent, respectively). Overall, 56 percent of Democrats say they believe Blasey, 8 percent say they believe Kavanaugh, and 37 say they re unsure.The downward shift in Kavanaugh s numbers on the Politico/Morning Consult poll, however, was due in no small part to a drop in support among Republican women, the pollsters said. Republican women were 19 points less likely than Republican men in their most recent survey to favor Kavanaugh s confirmation, although the percentages of each who opposed it were roughly similar. Republican women were more likely than Republican men to say they were unsure about the confirmation.Meanwhile, in a Pew Research poll released Wednesday, Supreme Court appointments joined health care and the economy, at least for the time being, among the pantheon of top midterm issues. Eighty-one percent of Democratic voters and 72 percent of GOP voters say court appointments will be very important to their vote. Republicans were about as likely to call the Supreme Court a top issue now as they were in 2016, the survey found, while the percentage of Democrats ranking it that highly rose 19 points.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But what do you do if you re stuck at work and really want to watch it? After all, this isn t your average Supreme Court nominee televised hearing; it s a huge cultural moment, both for Kavanaugh s confirmation process and the Me Too movement at large.There s a right way to ask your boss for permission, human resources experts say, granted you have a job where taking time to watch is possible. Come with solutions for your boss,  said Teresa Marzolph, the founder of Culture Engineered, an HR company in Phoenix.  Ask to take your lunch early so that you can watch, or offer to clock out. Ensure your manager that your work will still get done, or perhaps, if true, remind him or her that you re ahead on your projects. A particularly savvy boss might even see giving employees the option to watch as a way to emphasize the company s own harassment policies, said Deb Muller, the CEO of HR Acuity. We work with companies who are proactively using the Me Too movement as a springboard to encourage ongoing dialogue between employees and their leaders,  she told HuffPost. They re leveraging these types of events to foster a safe and healthy work environment where inappropriate conduct is not tolerated, employees feel empowered to report and employers have processes in place to effectively manage issues if they occur,  she added.That doesn t mean the hearings should be blasted on a big screen in your office, though. If you get the OK, use your judgment in watching. Respect your work s culture and remember that you re still at work, not dinner with a bunch of politically like-minded friends. When history is being made, we tend to let our guard down at work,  Marzolph said.  This can be a great opportunity to bond, but try to maintain healthy ground rules of respecting one another. Recognize that the subject matters discussed can be polarizing for co-workers and potentially triggering for those who ve survived sexual assault.If you don t get the OK to watch, you can still follow along: Catch up on your Twitter feed on your lunch break or sign up for mobile push updates from news sites you trust.

Those issues run the gamut from the bedroom to the boardroom   from reproductive freedom for women to gender equality in education, in the workplace, in the corporate hierarchy and in public service.The nominee s written opinions as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (including opinions restricting the autonomy of women with intellectual disabilities and women caught up in the immigration system), and his past personal statements about the Supreme Court s abortion precedents shed some useful light on his views on these matters. But that light is dimmed by the constraints that Kavanaugh was bound to observe in his role on what the Constitution calls an  inferior court. What makes the present moment particularly fraught is that those very issues now appear to be more brightly illuminated by episodes from the nominee s personal life   episodes that seem to reflect troubling attitudes toward women and even, if the allegations are true, a pattern of criminal sexual abuse that most would regard as disqualifying not only for a Supreme Court justice but for any judge.In the early days of the republic, to the degree that battles over Supreme Court nominations went beyond matters of legal competence and intellectual acumen, they focused on nominees  views of foreign entanglements, the creation of a national bank, the role of legal tender, the containment and eventual extinction of chattel slavery, and the regulation of business and labor. Those momentous issues were of course densely packed with emotion at the times they arose, but their intersection with court confirmations turned   with one of the few notable exceptions being Ulysses Grant nominee Caleb Cushing s prior support of slavery   on the nominees  philosophical and jurisprudential views, not the ways they had conducted their personal lives.Nor did previous battles over Supreme Court confirmations prominently implicate the personal lives of the senators conducting the hearings. The conspicuous exception there was the 1991 hearing on future Justice Clarence Thomas  alleged sexual harassment of professor Anita Hill, when Sen. Edward Kennedy, who would have otherwise taken a lead role in questioning, was hobbled by controversy over his extramarital dalliances and the lethal toll they took on a young woman s life. Even then, because the issues of sexual harassment and gender equality in the workplace had not yet appeared prominently on the nation s cultural agenda, there was little if any overlap between the questions of personal biography that the confirmation controversy surfaced and substantive concerns over how the nominee might approach contentious issues likely to reach the Supreme Court.What has made that overlap more likely today than in earlier times? I submit it is the way in which the Supreme Court   which had always played an important role on questions of government structure and, since the 1890s, had taken an increasingly important role on questions of economic and civil liberty   had not, until the past half-century or so, come to occupy a central role in social and cultural matters deeply affecting the fabric of everyday life.A prominent judicial role in such matters is one that most Americans had largely taken for granted in recent decades, although a slowly mounting chorus of dissent could be heard as well. Scholars and lower court judges, and occasionally Supreme Court justices speaking in dissent, had begun to complain that the high court has no business umpiring controversies over intimate personal matters and the allocation of power over social roles and issues of personal identity. But even as the pressures from such critics mounted, a number of dramatic decisions continued to make what many saw as advances on questions of sexuality and personal identity. Thus the court, sometimes by narrow majorities, ruled in what most would describe as a  liberal  direction when grappling with issues of contraception in 1965, gender discrimination and abortion in 1973, physical sexuality in 1986 and 2003, and marriage equality in 2015.It is against this background that political forces opposed to that drift came to national power over the past several years and have now put forth a nominee to the Supreme Court who is expected by those favoring his ascendancy to reverse what had become a decadeslong trend. Just as a new generation of Americans, followed sometimes grudgingly by their elders, is coming to terms with norms of gender parity and with the rejection of straight male privilege, we are faced with a nominee to the Supreme Court who is widely expected, at least by those who selected him, to reverse what many have come to accept as the enlightened approach to these morally freighted issues.To be sure, that bundle of issues played a role in the failed 1987 confirmation of Robert Bork and the subsequent confirmation of Anthony Kennedy, but in neither case did that cluster of issues converge with the personal histories of the nominees. Conversely, while a history of personal marijuana use quickly sank Douglas Ginsburg s nomination between Bork s defeat and Kennedy s nomination, the absence of a cultural upheaval over marijuana legalization at the time of that episode renders it an inept analogy for today s perfect storm.Today though, beyond the monumental and complex issues before the Supreme Court, there is the simple fact that Judge Kavanaugh is President Donald Trump s nominee. As such, he is the handpicked choice of a president who is simultaneously facing sustained legal attack for his constitutionally dubious decision to mix his private business interests with his public responsibilities and a criminal investigation for possible conspiracy with a hostile foreign power to win the presidency   and then for obstructing justice by seeking in a variety of arguably corrupt ways to undermine that inquiry. The resulting cloud over the nominating authority could pose difficulty for any Supreme Court nominee chosen by this president.But again that difficulty has been compounded by this nominee s own biography   his personal history and his professional judgment.Kavanaugh s opinions and other writings   even without the vast array of documents being withheld from the view of the Senate and the public by President Trump and the Senate majority leader   have revealed the nominee to have an unusually expansive view of presidential power and immunity, including immunity from indictment while still in office and from compulsory judicial process to compel the president to testify before a grand jury investigating his alleged offenses and those of others close to him. There is indeed strong evidence that the president added Kavanaugh to a list of possible nominees already composed by conservative outside groups with an eye to overturning the Supreme Court s precedents dealing with abortion   and that he did so because, alone among potential nominees otherwise meeting the president s pro-life and anti-affirmative action criteria, Kavanaugh seemed singularly likely to favor a constitutionally predicated shield that would protect the president from his mounting array of legal predicaments.Kavanaugh is, finally and inescapably, the choice of a president who has been accused of varying forms of sexual misconduct, up to and including rape, by more than a dozen women. Those accusations, some already involved in pending litigation and others still waiting in the wings, played a notable role in energizing the entire #MeToo movement with which the accusations against Kavanaugh have collided.That collision has doubtless informed and animated both the opposition and the support for Kavanaugh s confirmation. As for the opposition, it may in part be fueled by the unprecedented public reaction against Trump s election despite the existence of those allegations and in the face of his loss of the popular vote. On the other side, some Republicans on the Judiciary Committee appear to have hardened their support for Kavanaugh, their resistance even to reopening the FBI background investigation and their rush to judgment by what I would call #MeTooExhaustion. This backlash, which they package in the language of opposing  political correctness,  appears to at least partly reflect their own sense that, but for accidents of role and history, the predicament confronting the nominee might well have been   and in some cases might yet become   a personal predicament of their own.Thus have the political and personal interests of players on all sides of the current confirmation contest converged in a drama that uniquely blends law, politics, culture and intimate life history.

I walked out of my office and interviewed a few of those women in Washington Square Park. Women, they ve experienced these things,  said Mandy, 26, a student at the New York University School of Law who d walked out of class with two other law students. She seemed exasperated.  We know what it s like. We ve lived it. Almost every single women that I know, and I think... almost all women, have experienced some sort of harassment in their lives that has affected them long-term. All I could think was: She s not wrong.When I got home that evening, I sat on my couch and promptly burst into tears. I cried on and off for the next 24 hours   for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who says Kavanaugh attempted to rape her when she was 15; for Deborah Ramirez, who says Kavanaugh took his penis out and shoved it in her face at a party when they were both at Yale; for Renate Schroeder Dolphin, who recently learned she was the target of a cruel sexualized joke in Kavanaugh s yearbook; for my teenage self; for all of the women I know who have experienced bodily violations by men over the years and now live in a nation that tells them every day that their stories have no value or validity. As of Wednesday afternoon, a third woman, Julie Swetnick, has come forward with disturbing allegations about Kavanaugh and his friends during Beach Week (a debaucherous D.C.-area high school tradition). In all of these cases, according to the women, other young men were present, often laughing. That part feels familiar: the men s laughter, a signal of how little the women involved even mattered, how much of a joke these violations were seen to be.The reactions to the allegations of sexual assault and misconduct made against Kavanaugh have been demoralizing, if not surprising. On the right, the allegations have been characterized as a cynical political smear campaign, a case of mismanaged memory, or, perhaps most tellingly, simply not disqualifying. Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said he saw the allegations as  a little hiccup.  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) suggested that Blasey is simply  mixed up.  Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) averred that he simply  can t imagine the horror of being accused  of committing sexual assault. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) argued that if such allegations become  the new standard, no man will ever qualify for the Supreme Court again.  President Donald Trump, who has himself been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women, called the allegations  false  and said that Senate Republicans should have pushed Kavanaugh s nomination  through two weeks ago and we wouldn t be talking about this right now. I hope it is not the case but I fear tomorrow s hearing will confirm what a lot of us have known in our bones forever: women s pain is inconsequential. This fear is a big reason so few of us disclose our assaults. What s the point of getting hurt and devastated all over again?It s hard to describe how crazy-making it is to be told that you are not a reliable narrator of your own lived experiences, and that even if you are, the highest priority is protecting the opportunities of the men who forced those experiences upon you. Silence around trauma can be devastating, something that the viral hashtag campaigns of the last few years   #NotOkay, #YouOKSis, #MeToo, #WhyIDidntReport   have laid bare. There is power in owning your narrative, especially when, historically, women have had to watch their stories shaped by others.And yet: How many times do we have to publicly spill our pain? How many stories must come out before women and men who have been abused can be believed? How many times do victims have to explain why they waited to come forward before it sinks in? For so many men, no number seems great enough.This is not because these men are stupid. It s because sexual assault and harassment are, and have always been, tools used to forge male bonds and maintain male-dominated power structures. This is why, for Kavanaugh, the opportunity to serve on the Supreme Court is treated as an inalienable right, and why the allegations against him are merely seen as roadblocks to be overcome.And who pays the highest price when powerful men refuse to acknowledge the epidemic of sexual assault and harassment in this country? Women.In October 2016, just after the  Access Hollywood  tape surfaced of Trump bragging about grabbing women by the pussy without their consent, HuffPost s Laura Bassett reported that the tape in particular and Trump s rhetoric in general were literally making women sick. Women who had experienced assault said they felt triggered simply by reading the news. Something similar has been happening this past week. Not only have I heard these stories anecdotally, but a spokesperson for the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network told me that over the weekend, the group s sexual assault hotline saw a 57 percent uptick in calls.On Monday, my friend told me she d been sitting for hours, paralyzed by flashbacks to her college assault. Another woman told me the next evening that a friend of hers had called her at work to discuss both of their assaults. She ended up reserving a room in her office and just shaking. Several of my colleagues casually mentioned their own ramped-up anxiety and depression, and the memories that have flooded back despite years of therapy trying to undo the damage they d wrought. I grew up just a 10-minute drive in Montgomery County, Maryland, from Georgetown Prep, where Kavanaugh went to high school. The particulars of Ford s and Swetnick s accounts have hit especially close to home. I went to countless suburban house parties and Georgetown Prep lacrosse games. I attended Beach Week in Ocean City, and now, 13 years later, I m seeing how lucky I was.That s what my high school friend and I were texting about Wednesday morning   how very lucky we were. Lucky that the vast majority of boys we socialized with during high school were kind and respectful and didn t attempt to rape us during our most vulnerable coming-of-age moments. How lucky. I got lucky.That s it. I was lucky. I didn t dress differently than any of these women. I didn t put myself in less precarious situations. I didn t drink less. I didn t fight back harder. I didn t respect myself more. I didn t hang out with better people.I just got lucky.And yet even the luckiest of us have memories that resurface at moments like this, when there is a national re-examination of the teenage experiences we once considered  normal.  Like the 21-year-old man whose parties we attended at 15, who magnanimously and casually warned us not to take a drink from those guys. Or the lap dances we were strongly encouraged to give older boys at those parties, while other boys looked on   laughing, of course. Or the more popular boy in my class who cornered me drunkenly at a party in 11th grade and tried to force himself on me, only to write a vague, rambling apology in my yearbook a few months later. (At the time, I thought I was supposed to be flattered by his attention.)None of these incidents rises to the level of trauma that Blasey, Ramirez and Swetnick have described. But what disturbs me in retrospect is how normal I considered those occurrences to be. They were simply the cost of being a teenage girl who is desired and valued   two things that are inextricably linked in the moral universe of a teenage girl. Teenage girls deserve better than the world Blasey, Ramirez and Swetnick grew up in. They deserve better than the one I grew up in, too. As the nation prepares to hear Blasey testify in front of the Senate on Thursday, we can only hope that her bravery, like Anita Hill s before her, starts to build a better world for the teenage girls of tomorrow.Need help?

I believe it was four women, you can check with Sean Hannity, you can check with Fox, because they covered it very strongly,  he said.  I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me. We caught them and the mainstream media refused to put it on television. They refused to even write about it. There were four women, and maybe more. Nearly two dozen women have credibly accused the president of sexual misconduct. I think the number s four or five, but one had a mortgage paid off her house, maybe $52,000 dollars,  he added.Trump was likely referring to women s rights attorney Lisa Bloom, who set up a GoFundMe for client Jill Harth, who said in a 1997 lawsuit that Trump forced her into a bedroom at Mar-a-Lago and attempted to rape her. As Snopes points out, Harth never even wished to go public with the accusation to begin with   she was outed by reporters in 2016. And her GoFundMe raised only $2,317. And the one that reported it, I believe was offered $750,000 to say bad things about me, and she s the one that reported it,  Trump continued.  This woman is incredible. She reported it instead of taking the money. So I ve had numerous accusations about me. I mean they made false statements about me knowing they were false. I never met them. I never met these people. And what did they do? What did they do? They took money in order to say bad things. Trump also suggested if George Washington were a current Supreme Court nominee, Democratic lawmakers would vote him down.George Washington  may have had a bad past... didn t he have a couple of things in his past?  - Donald Trump questions record of America s first president and says Democrats would not vote for founding fatherhttps://t.co/Ho7fsxxD6i pic.twitter.com/U2eWmXahVN George Washington, the Democrats would vote against him, just so you understand,  he said.  And he may have had a bad past, who knows? Didn t he have a couple of things in his past? George Washington would be voted against one hundred percent by [Sen. Chuck] Schumer and the con artists. One hundred percent, one hundred percent. Earlier this year, the president took to Twitter to say the women making accusations about him were  taking money to make up stories.  A woman I don t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security..........cameras running. Another False Accusation. Why doesn t @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? One had her home mortgage paid off. Only @FoxNews so reported...doesn t fit the Mainstream Media narrative.During Wednesday s address, the president then said that the sexual abuse he has been accused of  absolutely  impacts how he views the claims waged against Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of forcibly holding down a girl at a high school party, covering her mouth and attempting to take off her clothes. Two other women have also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Professor Christine Blasey Ford is set to give testimony about her experience on Thursday. I m a very famous person,  the president reminded the country.  People want fame. They want money ... It s happened to me many times. I ve had many false charges.

Asked during a press conference in New York whether he thinks the three women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct are liars, the president at first responded,  I won t get into that game. But then he added,  I only tell you this: This is one of the highest quality people that I ve ever met. And everybody that knows him says the same thing. These are all false to me. These are false accusations. Trump also reiterated his claim that the allegations are a  con job  by Senate Democrats. I guarantee they go into a room and they laugh like hell at what they ve pulled off on the public,  the president said.When asked what kind of message it sends to women to call the allegations a con job, Trump answered,  That s probably the nicest phrase I ve ever used. Three women have independently come forward in recent weeks to publicly accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Christine Blasey Ford, a California psychology professor, told The Washington Post earlier this month that the future judge held her down on a bed, covered her mouth and groped her at a party when they were both in high school. Deborah Ramirez alleged in an interview with The New Yorker on Sunday that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and thrust his penis in her face during a party when they were both students at Yale University in the 1980s.A third accuser, Julie Swetnick, came forward on Wednesday with the allegation that she was a victim of gang rape at a party in Washington in approximately 1982 and that Kavanaugh was present at the party. Blasey is expected to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday regarding her allegations. Democrats on the committee have unanimously called for Kavanaugh to withdraw from consideration for the Supreme Court in light of the allegations. The committee is still scheduled to vote on his nomination on Friday.At the Wednesday press conference, Trump brought up the effect the allegations may have on Kavanaugh, whom he called  a great gentleman, a great intellect, a brilliant man. Asked again whether he believed the judge s accusers to be  liars,  the president said he would be watching Thursday s hearing to decide.  I could be persuaded,  he said.One of Trump s main talking points about the allegations has been to question why the accusers didn t come forward sooner. He hit that theme again on Wednesday:  36 years, no charges,  he said, referring to the time that has elapsed since the alleged attack on Blasey.He also claimed that the allegations have a chilling effect on other men.  People are going to be scared, because we could say it about you. Thirty-five years ago you met someone. ... What is going on? Why did they wait so long? Trump could have been referring to his own situation, as several reporters pointed out. When asked whether the allegations by more than 20 women accusing him of sexual misconduct have influenced his perspective on Kavanaugh, Trump claimed that some of those women were  paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.

(The Senate passed the bill last week, 93-7.)While the bill would provide $674.4 billion for defense, $12.1 billion for government labor programs and $90.5 billion for health programs until October of next year, the bill would fund other government programs until just Dec. 7, meaning lawmakers will need to return after the midterm elections to work out a number of contentious issues.Trump and most congressional Republicans still hold out hope that they can persuade Democrats to fund a border wall   or else enter into a partial government shutdown   come December. But Trump s earlier vows to shut down the government over Democratic objections to the wall are once again ringing hollowThe president is expected to sign the bill and allow lawmakers to get out of town and back on the campaign trail without a messy shutdown fight. But Trump could always pull a Trump, going back on his promise to GOP leaders that he would sign the bill and instead siding with his other previous promises. The president and his conservative allies, however, seem resigned to the temporary, tactical withdrawal.Trump and Republicans might be more willing to fight for the wall in December after the midterms, particularly if they lose their majority in the House. A fight in December could be their last chance.But such a gambit is still unlikely to work. For one, Trump and Republicans have continually caved on funding the government without money for the border wall. Also, by funding parts of the government for a full fiscal year, the worst effects of a shutdown will already have been tempered. In addition to the full year of funding for defense, labor and health programs in this bill, the president already signed a full-year package of three appropriations bills into law: military construction and veterans affairs, energy, and the legislative branch.Finally, if Democrats do take the majority in the House, they could simply wait out Trump and a shutdown until Congress changes hands in January, at which point the House could easily put forward a spending bill without the wall money and force Senate Republicans or Trump to continue the partial shutdown.What s more likely is that Trump and Republicans will once again relent in December   or Democrats will trade a renewal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program for portions of a border wall. That s a trade almost all congressional Democrats have been willing to make throughout the entirety of Trump s presidency.The bill Wednesday does mark the first time in 22 years that the Pentagon will be funded on time. Usually, it takes Congress a number of extensions past October s fiscal year deadline to fund the massive Defense Department. That sort of  regular order  governing would normally be a point of pride for Republicans, proof that they can govern. But the unimpressive achievement of funding the government on time comes with some asterisks. Lawmakers passed none of these bills under what are known as  open rules,  which allow any member to offer any relevant amendment during floor debate, and they packaged bills together, requiring less time to pass them all.There s also the matter of Trump s less-than-consistent leadership on funding the government and his promises to have a fight in December over the border wall. Any bragging about the largest troop pay raise in nine years or funding the government on time have been almost entirely drowned out by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s ongoing saga and the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the future of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

President Trump s attacks on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez are beyond the pale and utterly lacking credibility,  said a statement from Lisa Boyne, Rachel Crooks, Samantha Holvey, Jessica Leeds, Melinda McGillivray, Natasha Stoynoff, Temple Taggart and Karena Virginia, organized by media company Brave New Films.  We know from personal experience that he is a serial sexual harasser and abuser. Blasey, Ramirez and a third woman, Julie Swetnik, have accused Kavanaugh of engaging in sexually predatory behavior while he was in high school and college.Trump has been accused by more than 15 women of sexual misconduct, with allegations ranging from groping to workplace harassment to forcible kissing and assault. The president has consistently dismissed the allegations against him as baseless, though he has bragged on tape about grabbing women  by the pussy  without their consent. On Tuesday, he called the allegations against Kavanaugh a  high level con game  perpetrated by Democrats in an  effort to destroy a fine person.  Trump has dismissed our claims, lied about his conduct and attacked us,   Boyne, Crooks, Holvey, Leeds, McGillivray, Stoynoff, Taggart and Virginia wrote in their statement.  Now he s painting with the same brush to salvage the Kavanaugh nomination. It s a standard move from his playbook. The women also emphasized their support for Blasey, Ramirez and Swetnick, calling on the Senate to delay Kavanaugh s confirmation until an independent investigation into the allegations against him could be completed.  We believe women, and we believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Debbie Ramirez and Julie Swetnick deserve to be heard. We stand with them in calling for a full, independent investigation of Brett Kavanaugh s conduct in high school, college and beyond. Senators must not vote on his nomination until they have the facts. Public allegations against the judge have emerged within the last several weeks. Blasey alleges that Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and groped her at a house party when she was 15 years old. Ramirez told The New Yorker that when they were at Yale, Kavanaugh took his penis out at a party and put it in her face while other students laughed. On Wednesday, Swetnick became the third woman to come forward. In a statement posted on Twitter by attorney Michael Avenatti, Swetnick alleged that in high school she witnessed the future Supreme Court nominee engaging in  abusive and physically aggressive behavior towards girls. Both Blasey and Kavanaugh are set to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday morning.Need help?

The federal judge is actually in the middle of the most intense job interview of his life, for one of the best gigs in the country: lifetime appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.It s not going great. Kavanaugh is now facing allegations of sexual misconduct from three women.The White House has stood by its nominee. But if Kavanaugh were gunning for a position in the private sector, his situation would be vastly different in this Me Too era.These days, many major companies would avoid hiring someone with sexual misconduct allegations hanging over their head, particularly for a high-profile position, according to hiring, legal and management experts who talked to HuffPost. Businesses are increasingly concerned with their reputations regarding sexual harassment. And a company wouldn t want to turn off other job candidates by becoming known as a place that tolerates misconduct, said Brian Kropp, a vice president in human resources at the consulting firm Gartner.Companies don t want to upset their employees, either.  Who wants to work at a place that hires a bunch of harassers?  Kropp said.That doesn t mean a man with a dodgy background would be out on the streets, by any stretch. At the highest levels of most firms, there are still older men making the hiring decisions, and they likely wouldn t take issue with the kind of conduct Kavanaugh is accused of. I think there are a lot of men particularly in positions of power that absolutely wouldn t have a problem with these allegations,  said Liz Stapp, a professor at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado.  Public companies are under a bit more scrutiny now. But at the average company, the person in the hiring position most likely can relate and empathize with someone like Kavanaugh.  Last week, Christine Blasey Ford said that when she and Kavanaugh were teenagers, he pushed her down, covered her mouth and attempted to rape her at a party   behavior some men have described as  horseplay.  Deborah Ramirez came forward last week and said that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her on an occasion when they were both drunk in college. And a third woman, Julie Swetnick, came forward on Wednesday and said Kavanaugh was  present  at a house party where she was raped sometime in the early 1980s.Stapp said there are plenty of men in powerful positions who think this kind of behavior is basically normal for young guys. She noted that CBS s board of directors were willing to overlook sexual misconduct allegations against chief executive Les Moonves for months, until they were forced to contend with the situation because of bad publicity.And of course, in 2016, millions of voters overlooked the various allegations of sexual misconduct hanging over Donald Trump s head. I don t care if 30 more women come forward and allege this kind of stuff,  83-year-old producer Arnold Kopelson, who until recently sat on CBS s board, reportedly told his colleagues about Moonves.A tainted Kavanaugh-like candidate probably wouldn t land in something like a CEO role   but many companies would still bring in someone like that to consult or work behind the scenes, Stapp said.What s more, she said, it s unlikely that any company would even find out about these types of long-ago incidents. Companies don t dig that deep   particularly for sexual misconduct allegations. Still, the Me Too movement has shaken things up. Even in the male-dominated world of finance, typically a safe haven for men with old-fashioned ideas about women, firms are much more wary of the optics where sexual misconduct is concerned, said John Singer, a New York attorney who represents more than a dozen men in the securities and entertainment industries who have faced accusations of harassment or other misconduct.Banks and other companies are now more likely to publicly announce a firing over misconduct   something that just wasn t done before   and a lot less likely to take a chance on someone with a tainted past.The change in attitude happened right after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke last fall, Singer said. Pre-October there would have been little to no impact on a banker or trader s ability to get hired at a new firm,  he said.Even conservative-leaning law firms would be wary of hiring someone like Kavanaugh in this climate, Singer said. On the one hand, a longtime Beltway insider like Kavanaugh would be an  extraordinary rainmaker,  and the right side of the aisle likely wouldn t care much about the sexual misconduct question. However, even those firms have become increasingly sensitive to these issues.  I d have a hard time believing he d get hired,  Singer concluded.Smaller companies and firms, particularly those without any female employees, would probably be more amenable. For example, it took less than a year for Brian Cagney, founder and CEO of the startup Social Finance, to land on his feet after leaving the company in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations. Just nine months after he d quit his former company, venture capital firms had given him millions of dollars to start a new business. In the end, of course, Kavanaugh likely needn t worry about any of this.

Groping a woman? At 18?  she said, before asking her daughters,  I mean, how many guys do you know who think that s no big deal?  After the two girls nodded in agreement, the mother reiterated,  It s not a big deal.  a Trump supporter on MSNBC told her daughters that men groping women is  no big deal  pic.twitter.com/QbYubOJpXlThe woman insisted that even if the assault allegations against Kavanaugh are true, it  doesn t take away from his character and his job to do what he needs to do as a Supreme Court nominee. She added,  If he was pro-abortion, the liberals wouldn t be fighting this hard. As you might have predicted, many Twitter users didn t agree with her beliefs about groping. My mom went on television and said it was no big deal,  is a future #whyididntreport moment.  I m not making light of it -- that s really what it is. So sad to see.  The message they are being taught.So her daughters bodies are available to be touched whenever some man feels like it? What about what her daughters want? Groping  doesn t even begin to describe what he s been accused of. Regardless, her low expectations of 18-year-old males  behavior is extremely disturbing.Let s hope that woman also isn t raising a son who ll go on to grope a new generation of women & let s hope her daughters learn enough elsewhere to not continue perpetuating this toxicityNeed help?

Today, 1,600 men signed a full-page ad in The New York Times in support of Hill and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Palo Alto University professor who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982 at a high school party.  We believe Anita Hill. We also believe Christine Blasey Ford,  the statement says, splashed across the full page. The new ad was crowdfunded online with the support of organizations such as the Phenomenal Woman Action Campaign and Futures Without Violence. The campaign, which was created over the weekend, has exceeded its fundraising goal of $100,000, receiving $137,000 as of Wednesday afternoon.  We are 1,600 men who now stand behind both Professor Anita Hill, as well as Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, because we believe them,  the main statement in the ad reads.  We believe survivors, and we call on all men of good will to stand with us to ensure that Dr. Blasey Ford s story is carefully and fully examined without bias or prejudice,  the ad continues.  It is imperative that the politics of this moment not discolor the facts. Justice demands that both Dr. Blasey Ford and her story be treated fairly, impartially, and with respect. Story continues below. The ad cost $100,000 and, according to the crowdfunding page, the remaining money will go to Futures Without Violence for violence prevention programming.  For decades, a culture of misogyny has allowed men to act with impunity and without consequence,  the ad reads.  We demand an end to that culture, and we pledge to do our part in dismantling it. That s why we are speaking out today in favor of a just process, and for the rights of women like Dr. Blasey Ford to be heard fully, fairly, and with respect.  In the words of Anita Hill,  There is no way to redo 1991, but there are ways to do better,   the powerful statement concludes. The 1991 ad was fashioned in a similar vein and published in support of Hill after lawmakers and the media attacked her for accusing Thomas of sexual harassment. The larger banner at the top of the ad reads:  African American Women In Defense of Ourselves.  27 years ago, 1600 black women took out a full page ad in the NYT to show support for Anita Hill. I was 20 years old. I put $25 toward the price of the ad and signed my name. pic.twitter.com/I9AvWsoeGmThree women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct as of Wednesday afternoon. Earlier this month, professor Blasey was the first woman to accuse him of sexual assault.On Sunday, Deborah Ramirez claimed that the judge exposed himself to her and thrust his penis in her face during a party when they were students at Yale University during the 1983-84 school year. On Wednesday, Julie Swetnick alleged that Kavanaugh was present during a  gang rape. Blasey is scheduled to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in a public hearing on Thursday. A committee vote on Kavanaugh s nomination is set for Friday. Read the statement in the New York Times ad in full below:We believe Anita Hill. We also believe Christine Blasey Ford.27 years ago, on November 17, 1991, 1,600 black women joined together and placed a full-page ad in the New York Times to support Professor Anita Hill when she faced backlash for accusing Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. They called it,  African American Women in Defense of Ourselves.  Today we follow in the footsteps of those courageous women.We are 1,600 men who now stand behind both Professor Anita Hill, as well as Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, because we believe them.As men who are allies in the fight to end violence and harassment against women and girls, we write to express our strong support of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford for her willingness to speak out publicly and testify before the Senate about the sexual assault that she says was perpetrated against her by Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh.We believe survivors, and we call on all men of good will to stand with us to ensure that Dr. Blasey Ford s story is carefully and fully examined without bias or prejudice. It is imperative that the politics of this moment not discolor the facts. Justice demands that both Dr. Blasey Ford and her story be treated fairly, impartially, and with respect.Too frequently, survivors of sexual assault are forced to suffer in silence. Those that choose to speak out often face backlash, skepticism, and ridicule. As we ve seen once again the last few weeks, that kind of virulent backlash is most acutely on display whenever those accused of misdeeds are powerful men. If appointed to the Supreme Court, few men would be more powerful than Judge Kavanaugh.We are a group of men with varying political and legal views. But we each believe women should no longer have to carry these burdens alone.For decades, a culture of misogyny has allowed men to act with impunity and without consequence. We demand an end to that culture, and we pledge to do our part in dismantling it. That s why we are speaking out today in favor of a just process, and for the rights of women like Dr. Blasey Ford to be heard fully, fairly, and with respect.In the words of Anita Hill,  There is no way to redo 1991, but there are ways to do better.

His accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, will also be questioned about the night when she says Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, covered her mouth and groped her.They were both teenagers in the 1980s. Back then,  only yes means yes  was not yet part of the vernacular, but teenagers today say not much else has changed. Boys groping without consent and worse is an experience still firmly entrenched in everyday reality.HuffPost asked four teens to talk about the predatory incidents they endured in high school, at home and at parties. We have left out last names and, in some cases, used pseudonyms for first names to protect their privacy. The interviews were edited for length and clarity.  When I was a sophomore at a high school in upstate New York, my boyfriend started pressuring me to have sex. We had been dating for a month and a half and he was a senior. I said,  I m not ready for that,  because I was a virgin at the time. He would act like he had heard me, but then a few hours later would try to revisit the topic. One day we were just, like, kissing and touching and taking our clothes off. He brought up the topic of sex again and I made it clear that I wasn t ready. We had our hands all over each other anyway, and then he just started having sex with me. As soon as it started, I really did freeze up and quit responding to the situation. We had been getting in fights where he would scream at me, and I was really worried that if I said something, it would turn into a violent sort of thing. I really just lay there. I focused on what the rest of my day looked like. He definitely didn t seem to recognize directly afterwards or during that there was anything wrong. The fact that I was suddenly completely unresponsive should have been a clue.We stayed together for a few more months, but I didn t tell anyone about the assault for about a year. I was embarrassed of it being such a bad virginity story. At first I thought it was an uncomfortable sexual encounter in the way that everybody has a crappy first time. But my former boss at summer camp helped me realize that I was raped. I remember I started to cry and I told her everything that happened. She said,  Yeah, that s assault. I was a very vulnerable and insecure high school freshman in New Jersey. An older guy asked me to send him a sexy picture. I thought this guy liked me and I sent him a photo of myself in a bra. He said I was different from the other girls and it seemed like he wanted to date me. Then he asked me to hang out. He said he wanted to watch a movie, but once I got to his house, it became clear what he wanted to do. I did some of it but not all of it. The next week at a football game, my friends asked me if I had hooked up with him. He had told everybody,  She gave me a blow job.  It was so terrible. The only reason I did this to begin with was for validation from this guy. Then I found out he was sharing the photo of me with his baseball team. Someone texted it to a male friend of mine and then he asked,  Is that you?  At the time I acted like I was proud of it. I wanted the girls who were pretty and popular to like me. They were the kind of girls who went out with guys like this. My actual personality was ashamed of what I did, and I became more ashamed as time went on. The next semester I was put in a class with the guy who sent my photo around, and it involved a lot of public speaking. I had to do presentations while he was staring at me from across the room.Last year I had been Instagram messaging with a guy from my university in Nashville. After our Christmas break he said,  Do you want to come over?  I was kind of excited to go to his dorm. I had recently broken up with my high school boyfriend, and I was like,  I can get over this and explore a new relationship.  We sat on his bed and started watching an episode of  Black Mirror.  Before going over, I had thought we would maybe hook up. But as I was sitting there, I started to feel uncomfortable. I started to feel like,  Should I be doing this? Or is this just an immature reaction to breaking up with someone I cared about? I thought,  Yeah, I don t know that I really want to do this,  but at that point he put his hand on my thigh.He slowly moved his hand to unbutton my jeans, and then he started touching me. I was in shock and just kind of froze. I just couldn t really say anything or do anything. I was scared of how he might react. I felt like it was pretty obvious that I wasn t comfortable. I was pent up and I wasn t looking at him. I kind of started disassociating. I guess it was kind of a way to defend myself. I just wasn t there for most of it. I feel like he should have just kissed me first. And then he should have asked,  Do you want to go further?  If you re in a situation where the person seems unenthusiastic, you should ask them if they are comfortable. I walked out of his dorm and went back to my room. I cried in the shower and was like,  What just happened to me?  I knew it wasn t just a bad hookup. I felt dirty and bad about myself. It s the only time in my life where I ever felt like I am not a good person.I grew up in a small, very conservative town in Ohio where it s just kind of accepted that men are better than women. If you are married to a woman, they are basically your property. I didn t really go to parties because I just knew how the guys acted at school. I didn t know what they would do to me outside of school, especially if there was a group of men to egg each other on. This past summer I went to a Fourth of July party and a classmate tried to pressure me into having sex with him.I said,  No, that s really not my deal. I have a boyfriend.  But he wouldn t stop and he tried to kind of climb on top of me and kiss me. I went home really early.In high school, during the evenings, I worked at a pizza shop with a 16-year-old kid from my school. He was always flirting with me, but then things started to escalate. He would threaten to kiss me at work, lock me in the walk-in freezer so we could have sex, and come to my house.When I told one of my managers about the harassment, he said something to the effect of  guys will be guys, you just have to deal with it. I didn t feel safe at work or even, eventually, at home. When I came in to school every morning, I would be looking around to make sure he didn t pull up his car behind me or follow me. I always hoped that it wouldn t escalate to physical assault.Then one day at work he grabbed my butt. He and a colleague laughed about it, and he said,  Oh, do you like that? Do you want more?  It was disgusting. Had I been able to leave the job that day, I would have, but I couldn t afford to.When I told the manager about the incident, he said,  Well, maybe if you flirted back with him a little, he wouldn t have felt the need to do it.

On Tuesday s episode of  Late Night With Seth Meyers,  the host dug into the comments Kavanaugh made during a Fox News interview Monday and showed no mercy. It does not matter if you were a virgin. You re being accused of sexual assault, not sexual intercourse,  Meyers said during the show s  Couple Things  segment.  Those things have nothing to do with each other. It s the same as saying,  I couldn t have robbed that bank, I m a virgin.  Christine Blasey Ford went public earlier this month after The New Yorker published a bombshell report in which she accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her about 35 years ago when they were in high school. She alleged he pinned her down at a party, groped her and tried to take off her clothes.On Sunday, Deborah Ramirez also came forward and said Kavanaugh exposed himself to her when they were in college.And although Kavanaugh and Blasey are set to give their accounts of the first incident before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, it didn t stop President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee from publicly defending himself on Monday. We re talking about allegations of sexual assault. I have never sexually assaulted anyone,  Kavanaugh told Fox News.  I did not have sexual intercourse, or anything close to sexual intercourse, in high school or many years thereafter. He also mentioned that he had several female friends during the time period in question. But Meyers didn t have any patience for that argument either. Stop saying that you were friends with women,  the late-night host said.  That s not a defense. Just because you re friends with one woman, doesn t mean you haven t been awful to another. That s like saying you re a vegetarian because you didn t eat your dog. Meyers then goes on to point out that Fox News is an odd place to profess your innocence against sexual misconduct allegations given the network s own sexual harassment troubles involving ousted star Bill O Reilly and late CEO Roger Ailes.

The details in this declaration are specific,  Avenatti said in a phone call to  The View.   They are shocking, but above all else, they are true. He added:  And my client stands behind them 100 percent. And she s looking forward to having an opportunity to meet with one or more FBI agents, hopefully, and describe what happened. She s also prepared to testify, if she s permitted to do so, to the U.S. Senate. Swetnick is the third woman to come forward with claims against Kavanaugh from when he was in high school or college. She said in a signed declaration released by Avenatti that Kavanaugh was present at a 1982 party where she was gang raped, but didn t identify Kavanaugh as an assailant. Swetnick  understands the magnitude  of her allegation and  she does not make them lightly,  said Avenatti, who also represents former porn actress Stormy Daniels, who has claimed to have had an extramarital affair with Donald Trump.  Here is a picture of my client Julie Swetnick. She is courageous, brave and honest. We ask that her privacy and that of her family be respected. pic.twitter.com/auuSeHm5s0Swetnick  believes that the truth should be known and that this process is a search for the truth,  Avenatti told  The View  co-host Abby Huntsman, explaining why Swetnick is coming forward now. She  wants the American public to know the truth about Brett Kavanaugh and about his conduct,  Avenatti added.Co-host Sunny Hostin pressed Avenatti on whether Swetnick s story includes Kavanaugh doing anything specifically to her, but the lawyer offered no examples. I want my client to have an opportunity to be heard,  he said.  I want Dr. Ford to have an opportunity to be heard. And I want the corroborating witnesses to have the opportunity to be heard. Swetnick s declaration says Kavanaugh was present at the party with his high school friend, Mark Judge. Judge also was identified by Christine Blasey Ford as being present when she says Kavanaugh groped her, tried to undress her and put his hand over her mouth.The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hear Blasey s testimony on Thursday and vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation on Friday.

He added that it  would be absolutely outrageous  for senators to vote  under the circumstances.  There should be no rush to confirm this man to the U.S. Supreme Court,  Avenatti said.  Delaying this matter a week or a month, or slightly more than a month, would be of no consequence. We need to make sure that we get this right, 100-percent right. The testimony of Judge, for example, would help shed light on the accusations, he said. Judge has said he doesn t recall the incident Blasey described. There is no excuse, no excuse for the committee or for Brett Kavanaugh not calling Mark Judge to testify for the committee,  Avenatti said.  This is a man that is one of the closest friends of Brett Kavanaugh at the time period of this issue.  He added:  All you have to know is that they are hiding Mark Judge from the American people. And I can assure you if he had positive things to say about this time period, and positive things to say about Brett Kavanaugh s conduct, we would have already heard from him. "

False accusations?  Like those crimes your fixer Cohen pled to? You are an habitual liar and complete narcissist who also is a disgrace as a president and an embarrassment to our nation. You are so inept that your  best and brightest  are Cohen and Giuliani. Let s go.Washington, D.C., resident Swetnick alleged in a sworn declaration that she was a  victim of one of these  gang  or  train  rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present  at a party in approximately 1982.  This is ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone,  Kavanaugh said in a statement responding to the new allegation.  I don t know who this is and this never happened.  He has denied all of the allegations against him.The new claim comes less than a week after Deborah Ramirez told The New Yorker Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and thrusted his penis in her face at a party. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Kavanaugh of pinning her down and groping her at a party in the early 1980s, was the first woman to allege the nominee had sexually assaulted her.Other Republican lawmakers have come to Kavanaugh s defense in the wake of Swetnick s latest accusation.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a statement,  If Republicans bail out on this good man because of the smears and character assassination perpetrated by Michael Avenatti, we deserve our fate. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told HuffPost that he has  great suspicions about people who suddenly at the last minute are trying to delay this or stop this, and I don t think we should play that game.

Conservatives are now citing these accusations, which have stalled his confirmation for only one week, as evidence that no men, particularly conservative ones, can ever be nominated to the Supreme Court again because they will all face false allegations of sexual impropriety. I m thinking, is there any man in this room that wouldn t be subjected to such an allegation? A false allegation?  Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said at an Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition event on Sept. 22.  How can you disprove something like that? Which means, if that s the new standard, no man will ever qualify for the Supreme Court again.  If stupid, bad, or drunken behavior as a minor back in high school were the standard, every male politician in Washington, DC would fail,  former Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.) tweeted on Sept. 17. I think it s like we see over and over again, it s character assassination,  Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) said in a Fox News interview on Monday. He added that other conservative men have faced similar allegations.  We saw this with Judge Roy Moore.  A Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Alabama in 2017, Moore was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women when they were as young as 13 and he was in his 30s. If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried,  Politico anonymously quoted a lawyer close to the White House as saying.  We can all be accused of something. And then there is this:The Democrats have been working very hard through the Obama years to now to delegitimize the United States Supreme Court.  That s why they don t care about the truth of the Kavanaugh allegations.  They want to delegitimize our institutions and would do this to any nominee.This all fits with the centuries-old claim by conservatives that they and the people who hold power are the real victims in society. But it faces the obvious problem that it is false.For example, someone   a quite conservative male someone named Neil Gorsuch   was nominated to the Supreme Court just last year and did not face accusations of sexual impropriety. He was strongly opposed by Democrats after the seat he was appointed to was held open by Senate Republicans for more than 400 days as they refused to offer President Barack Obama s nominee Judge Merrick Garland a hearing, let alone a vote.Gorsuch was confirmed with the fifth-smallest margin for a Supreme Court nominee in history without ever being accused of anything untoward, aside from being really, really conservative. (There are, of course, numerous nominees over the years who withdrew from consideration, were rejected by the Senate or, in the case of Garland, were ignored entirely.)Kavanaugh and Justice Clarence Thomas are the only two high court nominees ever to be accused of sexual impropriety. (Judge Douglas Ginsburg quickly withdrew from consideration after he was accused of smoking marijuana as an assistant professor after President Ronald Reagan nominated him to the court in 1987.)Perhaps conservatives would like to argue that only nominees who could markedly shift the balance of the court to the right will face these kinds of allegations. Thomas  replacement of Justice Thurgood Marshall, a liberal icon, certainly was one of the biggest changes in the Supreme Court s ideological makeup in recent memory.While Kavanaugh is viewed as more conservative than Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose seat Kavanaugh would fill, his appointment would not be the largest swing in ideology since Thomas . Justice Samuel Alito s replacement of Justice Sandra Day O Connor in 2006 was a bigger swing than a Kavanaugh-for-Kennedy trade would be. And Alito never faced allegations of sexual wrongdoing.If the argument   which it is not   is that this doesn t happen to liberal men in politics, it does. Al Franken is not a senator anymore. John Conyers is not a congressman. Eric Schneiderman is not New York s attorney general. Nor is Eliot Spitzer the governor of New York.So conservative men can be nominated to the Supreme Court and not face allegations that they drunkenly attempted to remove a girl s clothes while holding their hand over her mouth to keep her from screaming   or anything along those lines.These look like claims about individuals like Kavanaugh and Thomas, not claims against conservative men collectively. That is something you d think Kavanaugh s defenders could understand.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

C-SPAN already has a page already up that previews its live stream, which will begin at 10 a.m. Thursday. ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News, NBC, PBS NewsHour, MSNBC and Vice News are expected to carry live coverage of the hearing. Some outlets may require subscriptions to watch.The California psychology professor, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, was the first of multiple women in the wake of Kavanaugh s nomination to come forward with allegations against him. Blasey told The Washington Post that he pinned her on a bed, groped her and held his hand over her mouth at a party more than 30 years ago. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Judiciary Committee, is expected to make an opening statement with no time limit, followed by a statement from ranking Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) who also will not have a time limit.In the first round of questioning, each senator will have five minutes to either ask Blasey questions or yield to counsel.Rachel Mitchell, an Arizona prosecutor specializing in sex crimes, was tapped to question Blasey on behalf of Republicans in the committee to avoid the poor optics of a group of men interrogating a woman about an alleged sexual assault. Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee, which includes several women, will conduct their own questioning.Blasey will then leave the hearing room, at which point Kavanaugh is expected to enter, be sworn in and deliver a statement. Then there will be another round of questioning in which senators will have five minutes each to ask questions or yield their time to outside counsel.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

They say it s inappropriate because a full investigation into Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s claims has not been conducted.The woman, who goes by the name Christine Blasey professionally, is scheduled to testify on Thursday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about her allegation that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her when they were both teenagers. While the Democrats on the committee plan to interview her themselves, the all-male GOP majority bloc has enlisted a veteran prosecutor from Arizona, Rachel Mitchell, to conduct its questioning.  It makes absolutely no sense for a sex crimes prosecutor to be hired to do the job of the senators on the committee,  said Linda A. Seabrook, general counsel at Futures Without Violence, a nonprofit working to end violence against women, calling the arrangement unprecedented. This is not a criminal case. What is the standard of proof? And what will she be asking exactly when no investigation has been conducted into the allegations?  she said.  As a former prosecutor, I can t imagine what I would be asking about when I have no investigative material on which to rely.  She added that it was irresponsible to not demand the appearance and questioning of Kavanaugh s high school friend, Mark Judge, who Blasey has said was present in the room when the alleged attack occurred. Blasey has appealed for a full FBI investigation into her sexual assault accusation before testifying before the committee, a request that a number of Senate Democrats support. On Sunday, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked for an immediate postponement of proceedings related to Kavanaugh s nomination. She also urged the White House to direct the FBI to investigate Blasey s allegations, as well as sexual misconduct claims brought by a second woman. Deborah Ramirez, a classmate of Kavanaugh s at Yale University, told The New Yorker that he exposed his penis to her at a party when they were both students.On Wednesday, a third woman, Julie Swetnick, came forward, alleging that Kavanaugh was sexually aggressive with girls in high school and was present at a party where she was  gang-raped.  Kavanaugh has denied any wrongdoing.The chairman of the committee, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), has said an FBI investigation is not warranted and is continuing the proceedings without pause. He plans to hold a committee vote on Kavanaugh at 9:30 a.m. Friday, the day after the hearing. Grassley explained his decision to hire Mitchell, the chief of the Special Victims Division of the Maricopa County attorney s office, in a statement released on Tuesday night.  I m committed to providing a forum to both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh on Thursday that is safe, comfortable and dignified,  Grassley said.  I ve taken this additional step to have questions asked by expert staff counsel to establish the most fair and respectful treatment of the witnesses possible. Others HuffPost spoke to had a less charitable explanation for his decision. What I actually think is that they want to ask asshole questions but don t want to do it themselves, so they re going to have her do it for them,  said one longtime advocate for women facing gender violence, who works with Congress and asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation. Indeed, even Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) implied that Republicans had hired someone else so that they wouldn t be shown on television screwing up.  [A senator] will do something that you guys will run 24/7, and inadvertently somebody will do something that s insensitive,  he told reporters Monday.Bringing in Mitchell is  a transparently clumsy attempt to avoid the visual of a panel of all-male Republican Judiciary Committee members grilling a survivor about her sexual assault allegations,  said Michael Polenberg, vice president of government affairs for Safe Horizon, a victims  advocacy organization in New York.  Whereas prosecutors normally put sexual assault survivors on the stand in their capacity as witnesses to a crime, in this case the prosecutor is clearly being retained to malign and cast aspersions on Ms. Ford s credibility. The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, a group that represents the leading U.S. organizations working to end violence against women, released a letter last week denouncing the committee for trying to ram through Kavanaugh s nomination.  In this very public arena, with these incredibly high stakes, we need to get this right,  they wrote.  Justice demands a fair process that treats Professor Ford far better than with the derision, scorn, and humiliation to which Professor [Anita] Hill was subjected 27 years ago.  Roger Canaff, a former prosecutor specializing in sex crimes, criticized the Senate Judiciary Committee for rushing the process. He said he knew Mitchell, the prosecutor tapped to interview Blasey, and called her a sincere and serious person. But without a real investigation, he added, there s not much she can do. Grassley has stated that they are trying to depoliticize this; they are trying to get to the truth,  he said.  There is no way that that is going to happen   not even close   in the form they are suggesting. He said if the committee is not going to allow for a full investigation, which could take days or weeks, they may as well do their jobs and question Blasey themselves.  They want to be able to tell the American people, we brought in a female prosecutor with 30 years of experience, and she helped us make a determination, and I just think that s fatuous,  he said.  It is going to end up being political theater. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Julie Swetnick, a Washington, D.C., resident who has spent her career working for the federal government, said Kavanaugh was sexually aggressive at parties in high school. In a sworn declaration released by lawyer Michael Avenatti, Swetnick said she was a victim of a gang rape at a party where Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge  were present  in the 1980s. (She did not allege that Kavanaugh himself raped her.)Kavanaugh, who is currently a federal judge, denied the allegation in a statement, calling it  ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone.  He added that he doesn t know Swetnick and that  this never happened. Swetnick is the third woman after Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in his youth. Blasey first came forward in a Washington Post story last week and is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, as is Kavanaugh. Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said his staff is investigating the new claims but that he thought it would be rude to Blasey if the committee delayed Thursday s hearing.  The committee is going to go ahead because I don t feel that we should disadvantage Dr. Ford any more than she s already been disadvantaged in the sense of people wondering whether the hearing was going to be last week or this week,  Grassley told reporters on Wednesday.Several Republicans said committee staff have asked Avenatti to have Swetnick sit for an interview under oath.Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a senior Republican on the committee, said the panel will investigate Swetnick s claims but that he thought they sounded suspicious.  I naturally have great suspicions about people who suddenly at the last minute are trying to delay this or stop this and I don t think we should play that game,  Hatch told HuffPost.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is also on the committee, cast doubt on Swetnick s allegations, telling reporters Swetnick is two years older than Kavanaugh and that her claim that he and his friends would get girls drunk so they could be gang-raped is wildly inconsistent with other testimonials in support of the nominee.  They re accusing him of being Bill Cosby as a young man,  Graham said.  It s not a high school thing, it s a character flaw. And every woman who has worked for Judge Kavanaugh has said he was nothing but respectful when he was their supervisor. I have a difficult time believing any person would continue to go to ñ according to the affidavit ñ ten parties over a two-year period where women were routinely gang raped and not report it.Graham also mocked Avenatti as  the lawyer to porn stars.  The flashy and outspoken lawyer has become a cable news celebrity for accusing President Donald Trump of attempting to silence his client, adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Daniels alleged that she had an affair with Trump in 2006. It seems to me he wants to protect people who are involved in pornography and that he s running for president,  Grassley said, adding that he didn t really know much about Avenatti.  What s important here isn t the lawyer, what s important here is the person who claims she s been harmed,  Grassley said.While Kavanaugh s allies on Capitol Hill voiced familiar skepticism about the new allegations, it remained unclear Wednesday afternoon how Swetnick s declaration would affect key senators who are seen as swing votes regarding the nomination.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) derided the vitriolic attacks on both Blasey and Kavanaugh and their families in a speech on the Senate floor, but he declined to comment on the new allegation against the judge because he had not yet read it.Sen. Susan Collins, meanwhile, noted that Judiciary Committee staff was already in the process of setting up an interview with Swetnick. The centrist Republican from Maine did not, however, address how the new claims would affect her vote. Obviously, I take it seriously and believe that it should be investigated by the committee,  Collins said.Need help?

I think we have to look into this further,  Severino said when asked by MSNBC s Craig Melvin whether Kavanaugh should still be confirmed.  From what we know so far, we don t have corroboration yet. If the Senate votes on this soon, I think they would have to go on what they know so far. I know the Senate Judiciary Committee is going to look into this before they would move forward to a vote. This seems significant. The chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, the main outside group supporting Kavanaugh s nomination, is unwilling to say definitively that Kavanaugh should be confirmed in light of Swetnick s new allegations. pic.twitter.com/yAPbithoKoSeverino clarified her remarks in a tweet Wednesday afternoon, saying her group still fully supports Kavanaugh.Not true. The further examination I referred to is the SJC asking Avenatti to submit any corroborating evidence they have, something they asked for days ago and he has yet to do. Our ads are still up and we still fully support Judge Kavanaugh and look forward to his confirmation. https://t.co/8zWPwtLcgDThe Judicial Crisis Network sits at the center of a network of groups and conservative legal activists behind the selection of judges by President Donald Trump. JCN was co-founded by Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society executive who pushed Kavanaugh s nomination on Trump, as the society s political arm to publicly advocate for judicial nominees.The role of JCN is to publicly support those nominees with seven-figure television advertising buys and extensive advocacy on television programs, such as the one Severino, a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, appeared on.Severino s public comments on Kavanaugh are significant   it s her job to promote Kavanaugh s confirmation, and she s previously been one of his biggest defenders. She told MSNBC on Tuesday that the accusations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh are part of a  partisan smear campaign  led by Democrats.In a Sept. 18 interview with CNN, Severino downplayed the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford, who claims Kavanaugh pinned her down, groped her and tried to remove her clothes at a party when the two were in high school in the 1980s. Severino said Blasey s accusations  cover a whole range of conduct, from boorishness to rough horseplay to actual attempted rape.  There s 35 years of memory that we re trying to play with here, and I m saying the behavior she described could describe a whole range of things,  Severino said.The White House continued to stand by its candidate, with press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders telling CNBC that Trump still has confidence in his pick.Kavanaugh was one of 25 candidates named in a list of acceptable conservative court picks provided by The Federalist Society to Trump. Kavanaugh s name was added late as a bid by his friends Leo, White House counsel Don McGahn and conservative activist Ed Whelan to get Trump to choose him.Jenna Amatulli contributed to this report.

For people to say, let s go back to high school to stop you from moving forward   I ve heard of your transcript mattering in ninth grade for college, but I didn t know your ninth and 10th grade actions could really reflect on what happens in the Supreme Court,  he said.Kilmeade conceded in a different part of the discussion that the accusations against Kavanaugh should be  taken seriously.  Still, many Twitter users took the Fox News personality to task.watching Brian Kilmeade s reactions to the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh leaves you with the irrepressible question of what was Kilmeade up to in high school?Wonder if it was in his sons character to put his hands over a girls mouth while on top of her drunk? What a moron.Wait, so since he got away with it in high school, he gets a free pass forever?Had he been punished when he was 17 would he still be able to be a SCOTUS justice? It would have affected his career path, so no; he wouldn t.So what difference does it make when it comes out?I mean....it s not like you need to be a person with a good understanding of right or wrong....kids in high school can t possibly know that drugging folks to assault them is wrong???Kilmeade is also the guy who thought Trayvon Martin deserved to be shot because he wore a hoodie. So we re clear...White 17 y/o gets to sexually assault so he can eventually sit on SCOTUSBlack 17 y/o deserves to be killed because of a hoodie and going to convenience store.GOP logic: I don t really care about your sexual harassment until it personally affects me.Clarification: Language in this headline and story has been amended to better characterize Kilmeade s argument.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Judge Kavanaugh has staunchly declared his respect for women and issued blanket denials of any possible misconduct, but those declarations are in serious doubt. At least three women   Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick   have alleged in recent weeks that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh and Blasey are scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday called on Kavanaugh to withdraw from consideration following the release of Swetnick s allegations.Schumer urged Senate Republicans to  immediately suspend  confirmation proceedings related to Kavanaugh s nomination due to  multiple, corroborated allegations  against him.  I strongly believe Judge Kavanaugh should withdraw from consideration,  Schumer said in a statement.  If he will not, at the very least, the hearing and the vote should be postponed while the FBI investigates all of these allegations. He continued:  If our Republican colleagues proceed without an investigation, it would be a travesty for the honor of the Supreme Court and our country. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Wednesday echoed Schumer s call for Kavanaugh to withdraw. A Supreme Court nomination is not worth more than the lives of survivors,  Booker tweeted.Mr. President, enough. A Supreme Court nomination is not worth more than the lives of survivors. There must be a full investigation of these allegations of criminal behavior, and Judge Kavanaugh s nomination must be withdrawn.Blasey first identified herself in a Washington Post interview published earlier this month as the author of a confidential letter sent in late July to two members of Congress. She alleges Kavanaugh pinned her down, groped her and attempted to remove her clothes during a small party when they were both high school students.A week later, The New Yorker reported accusations from Ramirez, who alleges Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face during a drinking party when they were both freshmen at Yale University in the early 1980s.On Wednesday, Michael Avenatti, best known as the attorney representing former adult film actress Stormy Daniels, released a signed declaration from Swetnick accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.Swetnick alleges she witnessed Kavanaugh and one of his friends at several high school parties getting  drunk  and  being overly aggressive with girls.  I witnessed Brett Kavanaugh consistently engage in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women during the early 1980s,  Swetnick stated. She alleged she was the victim of a  gang rape  where Kavanaugh was  present  at one party. She did not name the assailants.Despite the mounting allegations against Kavanaugh and Senate Democrats  strong rhetoric again him, the White House said Wednesday that Trump was standing by the beleaguered judge.Trump responded to Swetnick s allegations by attacking Avenatti on Twitter.

Trump tweeted.Avenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He is just looking for attention and doesn t want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life!CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated that Swetnik alleges Kavanaugh  coordinated  a rape she experienced at a party.

It cannot be fair and thorough,  Hill said during an interview with NPR s  All Things Considered  published Tuesday.   It cannot provide, not only the senators with enough information to make a reasonable conclusion, but it cannot provide the public with the information that it will need to understand the significance of these charges,  she continued.The attorney and professor is in the unique position of knowing exactly what Christine Blasey Ford, known professionally as Christine Blasey, is going through. Blasey publicly accused Kavanaugh earlier this month of sexually assaulting her at a high school party in 1982. The Palo Alto University professor is set to testify in one last hearing on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee votes Friday on whether to send Kavanaugh s confirmation to the full Senate. Twenty-seven years ago, in 1991, Hill testified to the Judiciary Committee that then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her when the two worked together. Similar to Blasey, Hill was harassed and defamed for coming forward.  To do it better, we have to have a fair process,  Hill said.  And a fair process starts with and becomes framed by a real investigation. She added that there is an inherent power imbalance when testifying against a Supreme Court nominee.  In a real hearing and a real investigation, other witnesses would be called, including witnesses who could corroborate, witnesses who could explain the context of the experiences of Dr. Blasey Ford and Judge Kavanaugh during that period in their lives, as well as experts on sexual harassment and sexual assault,  she said.In an op-ed for The New York Times published last week, Hill urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to avoid making the same mistakes it did nearly three decades ago.  In 1991, the phrase  they just don t get it  became a popular way of describing senators  reaction to sexual violence,  she wrote.  With years of hindsight, mounds of evidence of the prevalence and harm that sexual violence causes individuals and our institutions, as well as a Senate with more women than ever,  not getting it  isn t an option for our elected representatives. In 2018, our senators must get it right. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The documents, first reported on by USA Today, list various high school activities, from sports games and beach trips to sleepovers and college interviews.The calendar pages, submitted Tuesday night to the Senate Judiciary Committee, are part of an effort by Kavanaugh and Republican allies to exonerate the nominee and discredit Blasey s allegation.Defenders of Kavanaugh have also claimed that Blasey may have mistaken him for someone else, and that she is  mixed up  and misremembering the incident.When asked by HuffPost, several GOP senators on Tuesday would not say whether they think Blasey is lying, although many of them have declared their support for Kavanaugh and called Blasey s claims into question.On Tuesday night, Blasey submitted her own corroborating documents to the committee: signed affidavits from her husband and three friends with whom she shared her story in recent years, prior to Kavanaugh s nomination.Kavanaugh and Blasey are expected to testify before the committee on Thursday.Kavanaugh also faces sexual assault allegations from his Yale University classmate Deborah Ramirez, who says Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her when they were in college.A third woman, Julie Swetnick, came forward Wednesday morning claiming that when she and Kavanaugh were in high school, he regularly participated in drunken parties where he would  engage in abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls,  such as groping them without their consent.Writing in a sworn declaration, Swetnick also alleged that Kavanaugh and Judge  were present  when she was subject to  gang rape  at one of these parties.Swetnick wrote that some of this alleged abuse occurred during  Beach Week.  Kavanaugh lists a  Beach Week  in his June 1982 calendar, though it s not clear whether that is the same Beach Week. Swetnick did not specify the year her alleged assault happened, but said the parties where she, Kavanaugh and Judge were all present took place between 1981 and 1983.See Kavanaugh s calendar below.Brett Kavanaugh 1982 calendar by  on ScribdThis story has been updated with details about Swetnick s allegations against Kavanaugh.Need help?

Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) just publicly and undoubtedly stated her support for Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.  The credibility is there for her. So I believe her,  Hirono told The New York Times of the Palo Alto University professor, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, on Tuesday. This whole idea that the Republicans have, that women just sit around making these things up, that is not borne out by the reality,  she added, referring to the dozens of comments from Republicans questioning Blasey s story. Two women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Earlier this month, Blasey accused Kavanaugh of assaulting her at a high school party in 1982 when she was 15 years old and he was 17. On Sunday, Deborah Ramirez claimed that the judge exposed himself to her and thrust his penis in her face during a party when they were students at Yale University during the 1983-84 school year. Kavanaugh has denied both allegations, adding,  This is a smear, plain and simple.   I don t think either one of these women have any reason to lie,  Hirono said of Blasey and Ramirez, adding that she  definitely  does not believe Kavanaugh is credible enough to sit on the highest court in the U.S.Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), an integral swing vote, stressed to The New York Times how important it is that we take Blasey s and Ramirez s allegations seriously.  We are now in a place where it s not about whether or not Judge Kavanaugh is qualified,  Murkowski said.  It is about whether or not a woman who has been a victim at some point in her life is to be believed. She added that, at the end of the day,  we need to be able to listen.  Hirono, who is one of only four women on the Senate Judiciary Committee, reiterated just how much Blasey and Ramirez have risked by coming forward.  For these two women who have come forward, their lives are upended and they have basically invited maximum scrutiny. I think that is very telling,  she told The New York Times.  And at the same time, Judge Kavanaugh continues to stonewall any kind of independent investigation. Both Blasey and Ramirez have asked the FBI to investigate their claims, but GOP leaders have refused their requests. Blasey is scheduled to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in a public hearing on Thursday. Ramirez said she might be willing to testify even if the FBI probe she has requested doesn t happen. A committee vote on Kavanaugh s nomination is set for Friday.

We demand an immediate FBI investigation into the allegations. Under no circumstances should Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed absent a full and complete investigation. pic.twitter.com/QHbHBbbfbEHere is a picture of my client Julie Swetnick. She is courageous, brave and honest. We ask that her privacy and that of her family be respected. pic.twitter.com/auuSeHm5s0In a sworn declaration, Swetnick   a Washington, D.C., resident   said she was a  victim of one of these  gang  or  train  rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present  at a party in D.C. in approximately 1982. During the incident, I was incapacitated without my consent and unable to fight off the boys raping me,  she wrote, noting that she shared what happened with  at least two other people  shortly after the incident.  I believe I was drugged using Quaaludes or something similar placed in what I was drinking. Swetnick said she first met Kavanaugh and Judge, a classmate of Kavanaugh s who came to the nominee s defense, around 1980 or 1981. She described the two as  extremely close friends  who were  joined at the hip. She said she attended  well over ten house parties  from 1981 to 1983. Between 1981 and 1982, she said at these parties she began to notice Judge, Kavanaugh and others would attempt to   spike  the  punch  at house parties I attended with drugs and/or grain alcohol so as to cause girls to lose their inhibitions and their ability to say  No.   Kavanaugh and Judge, she said, would   target  particular girls   it was usually a girl that was especially vulnerable because she was alone at the party or shy.  She said she has a  firm recollection  of seeing boys   including Judge and Kavanaugh    lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their  turn  with a girl inside the room. HuffPost has not independently corroborated these claims.The White House released a statement from Kavanaugh in response to the claims. This is ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone,  the statement said.  I don t know who this is and this never happened. Trump also responded to the claims Wednesday, calling Avenatti a  total low-life  who is  just looking for attention.  Avenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He is just looking for attention and doesn t want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life!Avenatti, who also represents the adult film star Stormy Daniels, first said in a tweet Sunday that he had a new client with  credible information  regarding Kavanaugh and Judge.The newest allegation comes days after Deborah Ramirez, in an interview with The New Yorker that was published Sunday, claimed Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and thrust his penis in her face during a party when they were both students at Yale University in the 1980s. Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the claims.In an interview with Fox News  Martha MacCallum on Monday, Kavanaugh denied the sexual assault allegations against him and said he was not going  to let false accusations drive us out of this process.  We re talking about allegations of sexual assault. I have never sexually assaulted anyone,  Kavanaugh told Fox News.  I did not have sexual intercourse, or anything close to sexual intercourse, in high school or many years thereafter. .@marthamaccallum joined #TheFive to discuss her exclusive interview with Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, airing tonight at 7p ET on Fox News Channel.  https://t.co/QFmLfIwW4R pic.twitter.com/QzymMZa2KVAvenatti has repeatedly called for Kavanaugh s nomination to be withdrawn.

Kavanaugh, now a federal appeals judge, has vehemently denied the allegation.Blasey first told her husband she had experienced sexual assault around the time they were married in 2002, according to Ford s affidavit. She revealed additional details during a couple s therapy session 10 years later, Ford stated. She said that in high school she had been trapped in a room and physically restrained by one boy who was molesting her while another boy watched,  Ford wrote.  She said she was eventually able to escape before she was raped, but that the experience was very traumatic because she felt like she had no control and was physically dominated. He added:  I remember her saying the attacker s name was Brett Kavanaugh, that he was a successful lawyer who had grown up in Christine s home town, and that he was well-known in the Washington, D.C. community.  Blasey was conflicted about whether to go public with her allegations, but ultimately felt it was  her civic duty to speak,  Ford said. Keith Koegler, who described himself as a  close friend  of Blasey and Ford, said he first learned of the alleged assault in the early summer of 2016. I remember the timing of the conversation because it was shortly after Stanford University student Brock Turner was sentenced for felony sexual assault after raping an unconscious woman on Stanford s campus,  Koegler stated.He continued:  Christine expressed anger at Mr. Turner s lenient sentence, stating that she was particularly bothered by it because she was assaulted in high school by a man who was now a federal judge in Washington, D.C. Blasey did not mention the assault again until June 2018, when Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his resignation, Koegler said. In an email exchange, Blasey told Koegler her assailant was Brett Kavanaugh and that he was on President Donald Trump s short list of potential nominees, according to Koegler s affidavit.Two other friends, Adela Gildo-Mazzon and Rebecca White, stated in their declarations that Blasey confided in them about being assaulted.Gildo-Mazzon said Blasey told her about the incident in June 2013 while they shared a meal at a pizza place in Mountain View, California, and believes she still has the receipt. Christine told me she had been having a hard day because she was thinking about an assault she experienced when she was much younger,  Gildo-Mazzon stated.  She said that she had been almost raped by someone who was now a federal judge. After reading Blasey s first-person account of the alleged assault in The Washington Post earlier this month, Gildo-Mazzon contacted Blasey s legal team  to advise them that she had told me about the assault in 2013. White said Blasey told her the story in 2017 while discussing a social media post White had written about her own sexual assault. She then told me that when she was a young teen, she had been sexually assaulted by an older teen,  White stated in her affidavit.  I remember her saying that her assailant was now a federal judge. I have always known Christine to be a trustworthy and honest person. Blasey and Kavanaugh are scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. The panel has scheduled a vote for Friday on whether to advance Kavanaugh s confirmation to the full Senate.The New Yorker on Sunday published the account of Deborah Ramirez, who said Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face at a drinking party when they were freshmen at Yale University in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation.Ramirez s attorney suggested on Wednesday that she would be willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.Hours later, Michael Avenatti, best known as the attorney representing former adult film actress Stormy Daniels, released a signed declaration from a third woman accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.Julie Swetnick, who attended high school at the same time as Kavanaugh, said she witnessed Kavanaugh and one of his friends at several house parties in the early 1980s getting  drunk  and  being overly aggressive with girls,  according to a declaration she provided to Avenatti. I witnessed Brett Kavanaugh consistently engage in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of sexual nature with women during the early 1980s,  Swetnick stated. She alleged she was the victim of a  gang rape  coordinated by Kavanaugh and his friends at one party. She did not name the assailants.Kavanaugh denied Swetnick s allegations in a statement on Wednesday. This is ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone,  he said in the statement.

We reached out to the Senate Judiciary Committee to schedule a call to discuss how best to bring them that information and they have refused to meet all scheduled appointments,  Clune wrote in the tweet.  We have officially requested an FBI investigation and our client remains adamant that is the appropriate venue for her to discuss her trauma. Ramirez, a classmate of Kavanaugh s at Yale University, has accused Kavanaugh of shoving his penis in her face at a party when they were undergraduates. She came forward a week after Christine Blasey Ford, a California psychologist, accused Kavanaugh of groping her, trying to undress her and covering her mouth with his hand when they were in high school.Clune told CNN that a scheduled phone call with the Judiciary Committee was canceled because  they sent us an email saying for a condition for us to even have the phone call, you need to give us a list of all the evidence that you have and break it down for us before we ll even talk to you by the phone.  A call finally took place Tuesday evening, but only Democratic members of the committee were present, Clune said.  So, feels like there s a lot of game-playing that s going on right now by the majority party,  said the lawyer.  Every time we try to set up a phone call, the majority party either changes the rules of the phone call or they want additional information as a condition of even having a phone call with us.

The Republicans say Democrats are simply trying to delay any confirmation vote on any Supreme Court nominee until either a lame-duck session of Congress or until the seating of a new Congress in January.Democrats insist they want to stop Kavanaugh on the merits   he d be bad for women s rights and health care, and someone facing sexual assault allegations shouldn t be fast-tracked onto the nation s highest court. But there s no doubt that they are thinking about what could happen if Kavanaugh s nomination stalls and their party gains the Senate majority. The first move under those circumstances  needs to be to pressure Republicans to not move ahead with a nominee (from President Donald Trump) during the lame duck,  said Brian Fallon, who served as press secretary for Hillary Clinton s 2016 presidential bid and now is the executive director of Demand Justice, an advocacy group.Then, upon Democrats taking control of the Senate in January,  their position needs to be anyone on Trump s list is unacceptable,  he said, referring to the list Trump released during the campaign, shaped largely by suggestions from the conservative Heritage Foundation.He said the Democrats shouldn t embrace the 2016 tactic adopted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that blocked Merrick Garland, then-President Barack Obama s Supreme Court nominee, from even having a hearing.  They should consider a nominee that s a true moderate,  Fallon said.  It s unclear if Democrats, especially those who have built their careers on claims of political moderation and bipartisanship, would follow Fallon s advice.Still, looming over these various calculations is the escalating battle for the Senate. If you believe that there s a shot that [Democrats] could take back the Senate, you have to confirm Brett Kavanaugh now,  said a former member of Trump s administration who is monitoring Senate races and requested anonymity to comment.  There isn t a shot in hell that Chuck Schumer (the New York Democrat who presumably would become Senate majority leader) is going to confirm a Trump Supreme Court nominee. None of this would matter if Democrats didn t have a chance to win the Senate and claim a mandate. But such a scenario could happen, according to interviews with 10 strategists on both sides of the aisle. None would venture as far to predict a Democratic victory, but all admitted it was a possibility. If we were gathered here in January 2017, nobody would even be talking about [winning back the Senate],  the head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, told reporters last week.  There is a credible path to a Democratic Senate majority. It s a narrow path, but it s gotten wider as the months have gone on. Reasons for that include:* The solid re-election prospects for Democratic incumbents in four rust-belt states   Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin   that Trump carried in 2016.* The improved re-election chances for Democratic incumbents West Virginia and Montana   states Trump won by double digits.* The likelihood of a continued close race in Florida, where the GOP had been banking that Democrats would be forced to abandon the incumbent, Sen. Bill Nelson.* The pickup opportunities that have developed for Democrats in races for open seats in Arizona and Tennessee, and the stunning possibility that Rep. Beto O Rourke s could upset GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas. All of this has Republicans worried, although they insist the Democratic chances for a Senate majority remain low. GOP operatives are guaranteeing Rep. Kevin Cramer will deliver a pickup for the party by defeating Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota. And in that case, Democrats would have to pretty much have to have every other competitive race go their way to overcome the GOP s current 51-49 Senate majority.The first requirement for Democrats to take back the Senate is to protect their own incumbents. Twenty-five of the senators who comprise the chamber s Democratic caucus are up for re-election this year; just eight GOP seats are on the ballot. Among the seats the Democrats need to hold onto, 10 races are in states won by Trump. Republicans began this cycle confident they could add   perhaps significantly   to their slim Senate majority and block Democrats from any real chance of controlling the chamber until 2022, at the earliest.But critically, Sens. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Debbie Stabenow in Michigan and Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin   all from states Trump won after Obama had carried them twice   are favored to fend off Republican challengers.So far, neither party s outside groups are spending a dime in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. And most are steering clear of investments in Wisconsin (though Democrats still have some concerns about Baldwin, given that the Koch network of conservative donors has targeted her and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson defied polls showing him trailing to win re-election in 2016.)  Trump has alienated working-class voters in a lot of these states to a greater degree than people recognized,  said J.B. Poersch, a top Schumer ally head of the Senate Majority PAC. The money Democrats don t envision having to spend in those four rust-belt states ñ Ohio was the site of 2012 s most expensive Senate race, and Pennsylvania was the costliest contest in 2016   frees up cash to funnel to Florida, one of the nation s most expensive locales to run a political campaign. For months, Republicans had been promising that the fundraising prowess and personal wealth of their Senate contender in the state   Gov. Rick Scott   would force Democrats to abandon Nelson, who s seeking a fourth term. Come mid-September, national Democrats are going to hand Bill Nelson a canteen and a pistol and leave him for dead,  Steven Law, president of the Republican super PAC Senate Leadership Fund, predicted to Politico in June. Instead, Nelson survived a GOP barrage. Scott and his allies outspent Democrats by about $20 million over the summer, to almost no effect. Polls show a tight race, and Democrats and Republicans are now spending about equally on Florida s airwaves.Democrats still worry about a last-minute injection of cash from Scott   he spent $14 million in the last week of his gubernatorial re-election campaign in 2014   and Republicans think he has defied the national political environment to keep the race close.Operatives in both parties agree Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum s triumph in the Democratic gubernatorial primary could help Nelson by increasing turnout among black voters.The only state on the Senate map more expensive than Florida is Texas, where a week s worth of advertising across the state s 19 media markets can cost $4 million or more. Despite the high cost, the Democrats  main Senate super PAC is now looking at entering the contest. It s possible,  Poersch told HuffPost.  There s no reason to take it off the table. National Republicans have yet to make a full investment in the race, either, though the Club for Growth made a $1 million buy attacking O Rourke in two of the state s mid-sized media markets   El Paso and San Antonio. Right now, however, Texas isn t central to either party s plan for Senate control, even though among the Democratic base, O Rourke has emerged as perhaps the cycle s most exciting candidate and is generating unheard of amounts of cash for his uphill bid against Cruz. O Rourke raised $9 million online in August. That means it s possible he could force national Republicans to spend without any response from out-of-state Democrats. Beyond Florida, there are eight states where both parties are spending heavily on Senate races. Democrats are bullish about their prospects in two of those contests   the re-election bids by Sens. Jon Tester in Montana and Joe Manchin in West Virginia.Trump seems to have maintained his popularity in each state after winning them by overwhelming margins two years ago. But both Tester and Manchin are seasoned politicians, and they ve had success depicting their opponents as out-of-state carpetbaggers.Other Democratic incumbents face especially tough races in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota. Of those, GOP strategists are convinced that Cramer will unseat Heitkamp.Democrats are  going to lose North Dakota,  said Josh Holmes, a top political lieutenant to McConnell.  That s what s going to happen.  And that would mean, he asserted, that Democrats  have got to run the table  elsewhere to win the Senate.Holmes is probably right: If they lose their seat in North Dakota, Democrats would need to sweep the GOP seats in Nevada, Arizona and Tennessee to claim a Senate majority   assuming they can t take down Cruz in Texas. This scenario also assumes the Democrats can keep their seats in Indiana and Missouri, which is far from a safe bet.In Missouri, Sen. Claire McCaskill is under heavy assault from GOP outside groups criticizing her as a corrupt career politician. But she has a major money edge over GOP challenger Josh Hawley and should be able to air more ads in the final weeks of the campaign. In Indiana, some public polls show Sen. Joe Donnelly pulling away from Republican Mike Braun, who as a candidate so far has underwhelmed national GOP operatives.In Nevada, Dean Heller is the only Republican senator up for re-election this year in a state Clinton won in 2016. He s in a tight contest with Rep. Jacky Rosen.In Arizona and Tennessee, meanwhile, GOP incumbents decided against seeking re-election. Each race features Democratic moderates who are two of the party s strongest recruits this cycle: Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona and former Gov. Phil Bredesen in Tennessee.  The Republicans are guarding the goal line  in the Nevada, Arizona and Tennessee races, Poersch said.  If Democrats want to win back the Senate, that s where they have to break through. Republicans are countering Sinema and Bredesen with strong candidates of their own: Reps. Martha McSally in Arizona and Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee, both of whom have been strong fundraisers. Bredesen has repeatedly told reporters he doesn t believe control of the Senate is at stake in his contest.  I really don t think so, when you look at all the things that have to happen,  he said in an interview in Nashville earlier this month.While that might be helpful to his campaign s goal of winning over Republican voters, it has caused Democrats some complications in their messaging.The DSCC s e-mailed fundraising missives to supporters hype the party s path to a Senate majority as running through the southwest   Arizona, Nevada AND Texas   even though Tennessee is a far more likely pick-up opportunity for Democrats than the Lone Star State. Indeed, the DSCC has yet to indicate it plans on spending money in Texas.If there remain unknowns in the battle for the Senate, they center around the political impact of the turmoil that has come to surround Kavanaugh. Republicans, for now, insist any move to abandon or withdraw his nomination to the high court would devastate GOP voters  morale. I think most Republican voters will think  What s the point of voting? They didn t even stand by Kavanaugh,   the former Trump administration official said.Democrats have been skeptical Kavanaugh s nomination ever had the ability to turn swing voters against Democrats, even those running in states Trump won handily. Polling showed most undecided voters said a Supreme Court nomination wouldn t impact their vote.But in the wake of the sexual assault allegations, polls have shown that supporting Kavanaugh would hurt Democrats with core voters they need to win.  Even before the allegations, red-state Democrats had more to lose by supporting Kavanaugh then they had to gain,  Fallon said.  Now that he s been credibly accused of sexual assault, there s no reason for them to consider (backing) Kavanaugh s nomination. They re risking a backlash from women and progressive voters that they need. There s nothing but downside to vote for him now.

He switched political sides in 1998 and later apologized to Hill, who had accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, for printing false rumors about her.Now Brock warns that the Republican Party is moving to deploy a strategy similar to counter the allegation by California research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in the 1980s. What they ll cook up is that she s confused,  Brock told HuffPost.  She s misremembered. That sort of leads you to the idea that she might be a little crazy. And that certainly was put out there, including by me, about Anita Hill.Blasey and Kavanaugh are both expected to testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Republicans will likely let the psychologist, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, tell her side of the story without any aggressive rebuttal, Brock predicts. They will simply argue that they believe her assertion that she was harmed at some point but that she has misremembered the incident and mistaken her assailant s identity.Several senators have already expressed sympathy for Blasey while leaving open the possibility that she may be mistaken about what transpired 35 years ago.  I don t doubt that she believes what she says,  Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the committee, said Wednesday.  I believe we should attempt to make this as comfortable a process for her as possible,  Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Friday.Meanwhile, Kavanaugh supporters took up the argument that Blasey is mistaken about who assaulted her. In an editorial titled  The #MeToo Kavanaugh Ambush,  The Wall Street Journal editorial board argued that this  old and unprovable  accusation should be ignored, although adding,  This is not to say Christine Blasey Ford isn t sincere in what she remembers.  Kavanaugh ally Ed Whelan advanced this argument by positing a theory on Twitter, with Google Maps coordinates and floor plans of homes in Maryland, to argue that Blasey was assaulted by a totally different person   publicly named by Whelan   who attended Kavanaugh s high school. Whelan ultimately deleted his thread and apologized for defaming someone based on his amateur internet sleuthing.Though the GOP s tactics against Blasey may resemble those against Hill, the tone adopted by Republican lawmakers has significantly changed. Unlike in 1991, Blasey s allegations come amid a national conversation about how men abuse their power, position and privilege to harass, harm and hamper the careers of women. Notable figures from Hollywood, Congress and the press have resigned or been fired, indicted or sentenced as women, and men, have begun to tell long-hidden stories about their treatment at the hands of these powerful perpetrators.Instead of being  overtly aggressive and prosecutorial to her,  Republicans will  adopt a respectful stance  while simultaneously working to  undermine her credibility.  The 1991 questioning of Hill, by both Republicans and Democrats, was considered, even then, over the top. Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican in 1991, reportedly voiced regret over the way he went after Hill s credibility before he died of cancer in 2012.Committee Republicans have also decided that they will not be asking Blasey questions on Thursday. They will instead defer to an as-yet-unnamed female lawyer who is being brought on to question Blasey in place of the all-white male cast of Republicans on the committee. Hill, an African-American woman, faced an all-white and all-male committee, Republicans and Democrats, in 1991.Democrats will handle this hearing differently from how they handled the Hill-Thomas hearings, Brock believes.Thomas called that hearing a  high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves  in his testimony. This statement effectively  muted the Democrats,  according to Brock. Public opinion polls found Americans believed Thomas more after his testimony by a two-to-one margin with little difference between white and African-American and male and female respondents. African-American respondents were more likely to agree with Thomas  assertion that he was treated differently because of his race.Kavanaugh is not African-American. He would be the court s fifth white male, sixth Catholic and ninth graduate of either Yale or Harvard law schools. He comes from a privileged background in suburban Maryland, where he attended an all-boys private prep school. Any assertion of victimization would fall on deaf ears to Democrats in Kavanaugh s case.The committee s demographics present another change that will affect how Democrats respond to allegations of sexual misconduct. In 1991, during Thomas  hearings, there was not even a  women s restroom in the Senate, let alone a woman on the judiciary committee. Today there are four Democratic women on the judiciary committee, a record high.There are also no Democrats on the committee with histories of mistreating women. During the Thomas-Hill hearings, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), the main congressional opponent to Judge Robert Bork s 1987 Supreme Court nomination and a well-publicized womanizer, was notably withdrawn when questioning both Thomas and Hill. You ve got a new crop of Democrats on that committee, and I think they ll be more aggressive than the Democrats who were pretty sheepish during the Clarence Thomas hearing,  Brock says.Though it may seem effective, the GOP strategy to declare Blasey to be confused and Kavanaugh to be innocent may create a dangerous problem for themselves   and their nominee   in the future.  What they re really doing is hatching a plot for Kavanaugh to commit perjury,  Brock argues.If more information emerges later or if Kavanaugh repeats his Fox News attempt to paint himself as a choir boy, which numerous people who knew him in college and high school have already rebutted, the decision to have him testify without any prior investigation by the FBI or another outside observer could cause him to perjure himself. Brock believes this is exactly what Thomas did in his testimony. We ve been living with somebody who almost certainly committed perjury on the Supreme Court for like 25 years now,  he says.  And I don t think we can afford another one. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Their word has never been enough.American laws once allowed a husband to rape his wife, once required a report of sexual assault to police within three months, once required additional witnesses or other evidence beyond the survivor s testimony and once urged juries to doubt a woman s testimony about what occurred in private. Every one of these laws prevented or discounted the testimony of women, codifying just one aspect of systemic, second-class citizenship. Every one of these laws enabled the sexual assault of women. Thankfully, we have ended many of these laws. There is more to do.Because we have ended these laws, some only recently, American prosecutors now every day use due process to convict people who commit sexual assault based on the testimony of one credible survivor. One witness whose testimony is believed by a jury or a judge can meet the high standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case. This is crucially important law. Any other rule enables crime wherever and whenever there are no additional witnesses. The standard of proof is necessarily high because a person s freedom is at stake.What is now at stake for Judge Brett Kavanaugh is entirely different and much less than his freedom. He is a job applicant seeking a position of vast power and public trust that he would like to exercise for the rest of his life. He is asking to wield this power over us, his employers, including in matters involving women and their consent.Proof of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt has nothing to do with job applications, even his. Like any job applicant for a crucial position of public trust, Kavanaugh needs to show that his judgment and moral character are truly exemplary, or he doesn t make the cut. There are many other possible hires who are equally or more qualified in law but whose histories raise far fewer concerns. And professor Christine Blasey Ford s allegations need to be fully explored without pre-judgment because they are concerning.In order to avoid fairly exploring Blasey s allegations, Judge Kavanaugh s partisans have a two-part trick. First, they falsely frame this important job interview as if it were a criminal proceeding in order to invent an unduly high burden of proof they claim Blasey must meet. This is nonsense; it is the applicant, Judge Kavanaugh s, burden to prove he is worthy.Second, Judge Kavanaugh s partisans obliterate the truth-seeking procedures of a criminal matter that make meeting high burdens possible. Requested documents will not be provided. Requested investigation will not be done. A key potential eyewitness and friend of Judge Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, will not be subpoenaed, much less testify, about his claimed lack of memory. Blasey s witnesses to her prior reports of the assault are precluded from testifying. Days before the hearing, some fact finders reported they already believed Judge Kavanaugh, a pre-judgment that would immediately disqualify them from serving on a jury or as a judge in any criminal matter.The trick is then complete when Judge Kavanaugh s partisans remind us daily that Blasey s allegations are just a  he-said, she-said  matter, as if what  she said,  no matter how credible, is legally insufficient. That is not the law. That is not our belief in equality as modern Americans. We should not go back in time with them.As proud Americans, we need to move forward, away from our history of testimonial disenfranchisement of women. No gender should be presumed to own the truth. When Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh offer testimony Thursday, we must reject pre-judgment, insist on fair procedures and have open minds, focused on the question of whether or not Judge Kavanaugh has shown that he and his character are so exceptional that he is worthy of our hiring him for the U.S. Supreme Court.The alternative is another generation of young women and girls who learn that, even before they speak, their word will never be good enough and another generation of young men and boys who learn that sexual assault is not serious enough to affect their futures.Larry Krasner is the elected district attorney of Philadelphia. He has been a trial lawyer in criminal justice and civil rights for over 30 years."

Blasey has accused Kavanaugh of pinning her to a bed and attempting to remove her clothes during a party when they were high school students in the 1980s. Ramirez alleged in an interview with The New Yorker on Sunday that Kavanaugh exposed himself and thrust his penis in her face at a party when they were students at Yale University during the 1983-84 school year.Kavanaugh has denied the allegations, and both women have asked for the FBI to investigate their accusations. The confirmation process should be conducted in a way that fosters trust in the process and the Supreme Court, and that seriously considers allegations of sexual violence,  Kent Sinclair and Douglas Rutzen said in a statement to the Post on Tuesday. A third member of Yale Law School s class of 1990, Mark Osler, told the Post that the circumstances around the allegations  need to be probed. All three men had signed an Aug. 27 letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee that commended Kavanaugh as a man with a  considerable intellect, friendly manner, good sense of humor and humility.  Akhil Amar, a Yale law professor who taught Kavanaugh and also testified in support his appointment, said Monday that an investigation  is the best way forward. The Post noted that it reached out to more than 30 Yale alumni who knew Kavanaugh and wrote letters in support of his nomination, many of whom said they still support him.But with the recent calls, the men join a growing chorus calling on federal investigators to look into the allegations against the judge as Republicans on the judiciary committee attempt to rush through his nomination. A coalition of Mormon women also called on lawmakers to  go slowly  on the nomination if they hoped to  truly respect women. President Donald Trump has remained steadfast in his support of Kavanaugh, and several GOP lawmakers have lambasted the allegations as a politically motivated  smear  campaign meant to delay the judge s appointment to the nation s highest court.The president on Tuesday moved to discredit Ramirez, saying she had  nothing  and that she was  totally messed up  when the alleged event happened. The woman told The New Yorker that she was inebriated at the time of the alleged sexual misconduct but said she was confident in her recollection and hoped the FBI would investigate the claims. Oh, gee, let s not make him a Supreme Court justice because of this,  Trump said sarcastically during the comments, made in New York City while he was there to attend the United Nations General Assembly.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the date of an endorsement letter from Kavanaugh s former classmates.

A day earlier, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, echoing Gingrich s words, characterized the allegations against Kavanaugh as a  smear campaign.

Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho.) Our mutual faith teaches that any sexual abuse or assault in any context is contemptible and worthy of the most severe condemnation,  the group said in a statement.  If these accusations are proved false, an investigation will prevent harm to the court s legitimacy. If they are true, then Judge Kavanaugh must not be confirmed. Several of the group s leaders furthered that call in an open letter published later Tuesday, in which they said recent allegations by two of Kavanaugh s former classmates were  serious   no matter when they happened. Earlier this month, Christine Blasey Ford accused the nominee of pinning her to bed and trying to remove her clothes when they were both at a party during their high school years. A second woman, Deborah Ramirez, came forward Sunday and alleged that Kavanaugh exposed himself and thrust his penis in her face at a party when they both attended Yale University. Both have asked for an  FBI investigation into their claims.Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the allegations. Such allegations must be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated,  Tuesday s letter reads.  If we brush them aside, or minimize them, or excuse them away because  he was young  or  he was drunk,  we are sending an appalling and incredibly damaging message to both the young women AND the young men of our country. Sharlee Mullins Glenn, the group s founder and president, told The New York Times that none of the four senators has responded to the letter.Some of the lawmakers the group is targeting have been staunch defenders of Kavanaugh throughout the mounting allegations, including Hatch, who recently accused Democrats of orchestrating a  smear campaign  against the nominee. The Utah senator slammed the party this week, saying:  No innuendo has been too low, no insinuation too dirty. Everything is an excuse for delay, no matter how unsubstantiated. Blasey is expected to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, and the all-male contingent of GOP lawmakers has hired a female sex crimes prosecutor to question Blasey. Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has scheduled a vote on Kavanaugh s nomination for the following day at 9:30 a.m.That decision has prompted condemnation, including from the group of women in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). Stop pushing forward despite the clear objections of Dr. Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez, and millions of other women across the country,  the group wrote Tuesday.  Women comprise half of your constituents. If you truly respect women, then demonstrate it by honoring our requests to go slowly here. The appalling audacity of some of your colleagues in declaring their intention to simply take this seat with or without the broad support of women everywhere is just as troubling as the allegations against Kavanaugh.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the committee, confirmed Tuesday that the all-male Republican side had hired a female attorney to question Blasey and Kavanaugh. He declined to name the attorney at the time, citing safety issues.By using a female prosecutor to question Blasey, Republicans will be able to avoid the poor optics of a group of men interrogating a woman about an alleged sexual assault.Mitchell, the chief of the sex crimes bureau of the Maricopa County attorney s office in Phoenix,  has been recognized in the legal community for her experience and objectivity,  Grassley said in a statement.  I ve taken this additional step to have questions asked by expert staff counsel to establish the most fair and respectful treatment of the witnesses possible. Mitchell s boss, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery, has been criticized as being one of the most overzealous prosecutors in the nation. Montgomery s office sought capital punishment so frequently the county ran out of specialized defense lawyers to handle death penalty cases in 2017. Montgomery, a Republican, frequently fights against criminal justice reforms in his state. In 2013, Montgomery fought changes to the Arizona state bar rules that require prosecutors to turn over new evidence that suggests a defendant was wrongfully convicted. The Arizona Supreme Court ultimately adopted the rules.Blasey has come forward with allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party over 30 years ago, when they were both high school students. She told The Washington Post that he pinned her on a bed, groped her and held his hand over her mouth, making it hard for her to breathe. Democratic senators will be asking their own questions of both Blasey and Kavanaugh. The Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee includes women. Even though Republicans have agreed to give Blasey a chance to testify, they ve made it clear they still plan to move forward with Kavanaugh s confirmation. On Tuesday, Grassley announced he planned to hold a committee vote on Kavanaugh at 9:30 a.m. Friday, the day after the hearing.  For Republicans to schedule a Friday vote on Brett Kavanaugh today, two days before Dr. Blasey Ford has had a chance to tell her story, is outrageous,  said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the committee s ranking member.Kavanaugh is also facing accusations from a second woman, Deborah Ramirez, who told The New Yorker that he pulled down his pants and exposed his penis to her while they were students at Yale University.

Kavanaugh told host Martha MacCallum on Monday that back then he was focused on  trying to be No. 1 in my class and being captain of the varsity basketball team and doing my service projects, going to church  and that a  vast majority of the time I spent in high school was studying or focused on sports and being a good friend to the boys and the girls that I was friends with.  He also said he was a virgin in high school and for  many years thereafter.  His portrayal of himself as a wholesome young man was clearly meant to rebut allegations from both Blasey and Deborah Ramirez, a second woman who came forward over the weekend and accused Kavanaugh of exposing his penis to her when they were both attending Yale University. In both allegations, which the high-court nominee has denied, Kavanaugh was described as heavily intoxicated, and his drinking has been mentioned by others as a factor that significantly affected his behavior. The notion that Kavanaugh was a choir boy was undercut again when his freshman roommate at Yale released a statement following the Fox News interview that described him as  a heavy drinker  who became  aggressive and belligerent  when drunk.  Based on my time with Brett, I believe that he and his social circle were capable of the actions that Debbie [Ramirez] described,  James Roche said Monday.Kavanaugh s case may also have suffered after The New York Times published an article the same day detailing his high school yearbook page, which included apparent references to drinking and partying. He and his friends appeared to boast about their supposed sexual conquest of a young woman from a neighboring school, a reference she described as  hurtful,  according to the Times.Democratic lawmakers said Tuesday that Kavanaugh s answers in the Fox News interview brought up more questions about whether he has been fully truthful with the American people. I think he raised issues as to credibility, claiming facts that may be untrue,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told HuffPost.Blumenthal also signaled that at Thursday s hearing, Democrats plan to ask Kavanaugh about his yearbook page, which the senator described as a  minefield. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), meanwhile, said Kavanaugh s comments this week and the latest revelations underscored the need to reopen the FBI background investigation into the nominee. It seems to me the nominee himself would ... say,  I believe I m innocent. Here we are every few hours having something else be brought to light. I ought to ask the president to open an FBI investigation and clear my name,   Wyden said.Republicans, however, told HuffPost that they weren t concerned about Kavanaugh facing credibility problems given his comments this week. They said they were looking forward to hearing from Blasey before voting on the nomination. I thought he was very truthful about the facts at hand, and so I don t think that will be a problem,  Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said on Tuesday.Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) declared he had no reason to doubt Kavanaugh s description of his life as a young man. The senator sought to draw a distinction between allegations of sexual assault and questions over alcohol consumption. If he s going to make a blanket denial, then he s going to have to back that up,  Lankford said of Kavanaugh s portrayal of his high school years.  But it s one thing for him to be able to talk about sexual assault; it s another thing to talk about drinking.  Obviously, he hasn t hidden the fact that he drank a lot in high school and college,  Lankford claimed, although he noted that he had not watched the Fox News interview in its entirety.While Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee plan to question Kavanaugh and Blasey directly on Thursday, Republican panel members said they will rely on an unnamed woman as outside counsel to do it for them.The move probably has something to do with the fact that every GOP senator on the committee is male, and they don t want to be seen as bullying a woman who is speaking out about being sexually assaulted   especially with the midterm elections just weeks away. I think it s really smart of them to get outside counsel,  Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told reporters on Tuesday.When asked why, Corker said,  Somebody will do something that you guys will run 24/7, and inadvertently somebody will do something that s insensitive.

It was an allusion, repeated on other boys  pages, to the supposed sexual conquest of a girl named Renate Schroeder.This kind of macho bragging, whether based on real events or not, can give a young woman what s politely referred to as  a reputation.  What teenagers like Kavanaugh probably didn t bother to consider is how giving a girl that kind of reputation can open her up to bullying, abuse and a lifetime of emotional trauma.I know because I was the  class slut.  Ask anyone from my high school class, and I m sure they d tell you. What I wish I could have told them then, and what I wish I could tell them now, was just how dangerous and damaging that label turned out to be.It started on the first day of sixth grade.On the last day of camp in upstate New York, I d had my first real kiss with the boy I had a crush on all summer   in the hammock on the front porch of his bunkhouse as we said goodbye. I ll spare you the mopey song lyrics I copied into my diary when I got home to Bethesda, Maryland, and missed him terribly, so far away in Westchester County, New York. When I arrived for the first day of middle school, still pining for a romance that could never be, I told my friends in the cafeteria about our magical kiss.Word got around and somehow one fairly chaste kiss turned into making out. As I was apparently the first to have kissed anyone, or at least to have told people about it, this was evidence that I was  fast.  But of course, the rumors didn t stop with kissing. Though my behavior was pretty on par with what I witnessed and heard of my classmates doing, I was the  slutty one.  So by seventh grade everyone  knew  that I was giving blow jobs, though I never had.Boys openly groped me in our school hallways. My AOL instant messages were filled with propositions for sex acts I hadn t even heard of at that point, let alone actually done. The rumors of my sluttiness made their way to the high school boys, who came on to me while we loitered on Wisconsin Avenue outside the local movie theater. Eventually, I let a 17-year-old take me into the park up the street. He expected a blow job. I just wanted to make out. He got his way.Things escalated further when a boy asked if I would meet him in the stairwell during third period to talk about an issue with his brother. He groped me, and when I said no, he pushed me to my knees and unzipped his pants. I ran away, back to class, though I doubt I learned whatever the teacher was trying to teach that day. My mind was reeling from how quickly a boy I had been friends with for years could get physically aggressive. How he felt so entitled to my body, all by eighth grade.Weeks later, a boy put a price tag sticker on my shirt at a school dance   because I was a whore, get it? All these years later and I can still feel the shame and hurt of that moment. I shoved him into a trash can because he deserved it, and because I didn t know how to tell him that his rumors and jokes had just led one of his peers to shove his penis in my face.Being labeled a slut at 11 years old meant I spent the next seven years in school fending off advances and narrowly dodging being raped. Though I was hurt by those interactions, I never conceived of them as anything outside the range of normal. As far as I could tell, this was just the way boys behaved.That I never once felt like the adults in my life would take me seriously if I told them what was happening can be attributed to the  boys will be boys  attitudes that permeated my public schools, the elite private schools some of those boys attended and American culture writ large.By high school, the rumors were out of control. In sophomore year, a classmate supposedly found video online of me doing porn (the only resemblance was in the shade of our hair and general size of our breasts). I heard that after our senior prom, I d had sex with six different guys, including my prom date. (He was gay. While others spent after-after-prom drinking at house parties, my group of friends went back to Michelle s basement and played board games.)By senior year, word of my supposed sexual prowess made its way from Walt Whitman High to Landon, an all-boys prep school up the street (and a rival of Georgetown Prep). I met a Landon boy when, I think, he IMed me one day. The first and only time we hung out, he parked his Jeep on the access road along Wilson Lane and leaned over to kiss me.I told him I only wanted to be friends; I had a boyfriend. He told me he d heard from the guys at my school that I gave the best head. He wrapped his hand tightly around the back of my neck and pushed my head into his crotch. When my screaming made it difficult for him to stay erect, he hit me hard across the side of my head with an open hand. I wrestled free of his grip and then kicked the door and window of his car until I could break away and run home. The sound of his epithets faded as I sprinted down Aberdeen Road to the safety of my bedroom a couple of blocks away.The friends I told at the time   about the rumor of my blow job skills, not a word about the violence   said I should take it as a compliment.The message to boys has always been clear: Any girl who s a  slut  is there for male enjoyment and doesn t have any right to say no. A  slut  said yes to some other guy, so she doesn t get to say no to you. The girls and women whose real or imagined promiscuity lands them with that label become the scapegoat for boys  and men s harmful behavior. One kiss at summer camp somehow set me on a path where many boys didn t recognize that I had any right to withhold consent.I stayed away from dating or hooking up with most of the boys in my school for years, having learned that it wasn t safe. Instead, I dated older boys, who seemed more respectful. I thought dating older guys made me cool. Obviously, I was smart and fun and mature, not like the other girls my age.These older  boys  were grown men   24-, 25-, 26-year-olds who wanted to spend time with me, as long as the night ended with them getting off to their own  Barely Legal  fantasies. I fantasize now about getting them charged with statutory rape.My high school experience left severe and lasting effects on my self-esteem. What I came to expect from the way boys and men saw and treated me as a teenager became a self-fulfilling prophecy for a while. If they were going to call me a slut no matter what I did, I might as well be one. It s all boys and men wanted from me anyway, right?Twenty years after I told friends about that first kiss and it spiraled into a reputation I was never able to shake, I still sometimes struggle to relate to men who aren t trying to fuck me.My classmates were being kids   cruel jerks who didn t realize how this label would follow me. I wonder if they realize now what rumors can do. I wonder if Brett Kavanaugh and his prep school friends know or care now about the straight line between bragging about their supposed sexual conquests and the ways boys and men feel entitled to abuse   and legislate about   women s bodies.I wonder if any of them would care that I still have a nightmare nearly every week where I m trying to kick my way out of a Jeep whose window and door never break.Do you have a personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

Bush in 2001, detailed her own experience with sexual assault and staying silent. She says her experience has pushed her to back Kavanaugh s accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally.The former treasurer said she was exposed to sexual abuse at age five and kept silent about her assault for nearly 20 years. Marin wrote in her op-ed that she didn t even mention the abuse to FBI investigators as a part of her background check to be confirmed in 2001.The former head of the U.S. Treasury wrote that she believed Blasey: Professor Ford has absolutely no reason to make something like this up. This is not fun, and it s not a pathway to a better life   just the opposite. This is so very hurtful. She has lived with those atrocious feelings all these years, and the trauma even affected her marriage. Why would she put herself on this torturous path unless what she says happened is true?Blasey claims that Kavanaugh pinned her down, forced himself on her and attempted to take off her clothes without her consent during a high school party more than 35 years ago. Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegations. Since publicly coming out with her accusations, Blasey has received death threats and been forced to relocate with her family. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R -Ky.) called the allegations against Kavanaugh a  smear campaign  on the Senate floor Monday. Blasey and Kavanaugh are set to speak to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday to give their personal accounts of the allegations. Senate Republicans, who are leading Kavanaugh s confirmation process, have denied Blasey s request for an FBI investigation before her testimony.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

He declared Tuesday, surrounded by his GOP leadership team, that he is  confident we are going to win,  though it s not clear whether he has the votes already.So if most Republicans have already made up their minds, what does it say about how they view the allegation by Blasey? They either believe her claims   that Kavanaugh drunkenly pinned her down, groped her and covered her mouth so nobody would hear her scream   and don t think they matter for putting Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court, or they think she s lying. HuffPost spent Tuesday asking GOP senators if they think Kavanaugh s accusers, Blasey and Deborah Ramirez, are telling the truth. Most of them avoided the question entirely. (Ramirez has accused Kavanaugh of shoving his penis in front of her face while they were freshmen at Yale University.) I think we ought to take everyone seriously,  said McConnell, despite already dismissing the women s claims as smears.  We re going to have the hearing on Thursday that should give us enough evidence of a way to evaluate the two people who could be the only people who apparently know anything about this, listen to the evidence, evaluate the evidence and then vote. Kavanaugh and the California psychology professor, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, are set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, and McConnell is on track to rush through a confirmation vote as soon as early next week.Kavanaugh has denied Blasey s accusation, as well as the second allegation by Ramirez, revealed in a Sunday piece in The New Yorker. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of the Republican leadership team, thought for a few seconds before answering if he thought Blasey and Ramirez were lying.  I think the fact that nothing is confirmable is interesting,  he said.  I have no way of knowing that yet,  said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.). Asked if there s any reason to believe Kavanaugh s accusers are lying, Perdue appeared taken aback.  I have no comment on that comment. It s possible that nobody is lying, said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), since maybe Blasey and Ramirez have misremembered their distant pasts.  The event happened in their life, but whether Kavanaugh was the one who was even physically there or not is a great unknown because we ve got a very strong denial from Kavanaugh,  Lankford said.  It s 35 years ago with alcohol, and with everything else it s very difficult to be able to say it was definitely this person. The  somebody else  theory has been tried. Ed Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center   and a close ally of Beltway Republicans   claimed last week that Blasey may have mixed up Kavanaugh with another student, suggesting a specific classmate of Kavanaugh s. Blasey responded that she remembered both of them and would never have mixed them up; Whelan subsequently said he d made an  appalling mistake  and took a leave of absence from his job.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said McConnell owes an apology to Blasey for the way he s characterized her claims.  It s absolutely galling for leader McConnell, Republican senators and the White House to call Dr. Ford s allegations against Judge Kavanaugh a smear job,  he said Tuesday. Some Republicans, such as Sens. Jon Kyl (Ariz.) and John Barrasso (Wyo.), straight-up ignored HuffPost s question on whether they think Kavanaugh s accusers are telling the truth. Those on the Senate Judiciary Committee, like Sens. Tim Scott (S.C.) and John Kennedy (La.), said they wanted to hear directly from Blasey before deciding if they believed her. I haven t met her. Have you met her?  asked Kennedy.  Nobody has met her except The Washington Post. Others suggested she may be a liar. People lie all the time,  said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).  People don t report things that happen to them all the time. There are millions of women who were abused that never come forward. There are accusations made against men that are not true. The bottom line with Kavanaugh, he said, is that it would be  bad and wrong to ruin somebody s life who has led I think a noble life.  Asked about the idea that it was Blasey s life that was ruined by Kavanaugh s alleged assault, Graham framed the Supreme Court confirmation process as a court trial and said it s not fair to  convict  people based on accusations. All I can tell you is this accusation by Dr. Ford against Judge Kavanaugh doesn t meet the basic standards of legal reliability,  he said.  If this becomes it, just an accusation, and you can t tell the person when it happened and where it happened, God help the rest of the [president s] nominees. Igor Bobic contributed reporting.

The man who nominated him to the Supreme Court is Donald Trump, himself accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct. His high school pal is Mark Judge, a well-known conservative author whose writing reveals a deep disdain for women and especially feminists. But perhaps one of the most influential figures in Kavanaugh s career is his longtime mentor: Alex Kozinski, a well-known federal judge who resigned last December after many women came forward to describe his sexual harassment and misconduct. Kavanaugh has steadfastly claimed he knew nothing about Kozinski s behavior, and couldn t recall anything inappropriate about him. Yet considering the overwhelming evidence that s piled up about Kozinski, Kavanaugh s denial seems preposterous. Everybody knew,  writes longtime legal columnist Dahlia Lithwick for Slate, explaining she had experience with Kozinski since the late 1990s. There s no way Kavanaugh didn t know,  a man who clerked for Kozinski more than a decade ago told HuffPost recently. Others have asked how Kavanaugh could have possibly been ignorant of the judge s sexism and misconduct. The former clerk is the rare man to speak up about Kozinski   most of the judge s accusers are women. Indeed, this man says he even took the almost unheard-of step of telling Kozinkski that his behavior was inappropriate.During the man s clerkship, Kozinski showed him a video of naked women skydiving, he told HuffPost.  He thought it was hilarious to watch their breasts  flap  back and forth,  he recalled.The former clerk declined to be named in HuffPost for privacy reasons, but Catharine MacKinnon, a prominent professor at the University of Michigan Law School who first conceptualized the notion of sexual harassment in the legal system, confirmed his story. He spoke of hearing in the chambers things Judge Kozinski said that I vividly recall were sexually salacious,  she said, adding that the judge made this man extremely uncomfortable. The former clerk was MacKinnon s research assistant years ago.Men weren t typically the butt of Kozinski s jokes. The former clerk remembered that while Kozinski was evaluating the application of a woman who was second in her class at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, the judge had described her as the sort of woman who would only give you a handjob.Even as a bystander, the former clerk said, he was offended. He thought it was discriminatory, harassing to everybody in the chambers. He was absolutely horrified and attempted to convey his lack of enjoyment of this to the judge,  MacKinnon said.The former clerk said he set up a meeting with Kozinski to directly confront him, telling him these comments about women were just too much and that the overall atmosphere felt abusive.He said Kozinski responded by telling him a joke:  How can you tell if a woman has an orgasm?  The answer:  Who cares. The message was: Kozinski didn t care.A week later, the law clerk quit.He tried to get another clerkship, but found that Kozinski had thrown up roadblocks, he said. Suddenly, he had no prospects,  MacKinnon recalled.  He struggled professionally for some time trying to recover. MacKinnon said she never again recommended Kozinski to students who were looking for coveted legal clerkships.The former clerk s story perfectly illustrates why someone like Kavanaugh, an ultra-ambitious lawyer on a glide path to the Supreme Court, would never admit to knowing what his mentor was truly like.  That kind of complicity is how harassers stay in power.Kavanaugh clerked for Kozinski in 1991 and remained in close contact with him over the years. They co-authored at least one book and sat on panels together. They even helped vet law clerks for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, an incredibly influential role. Judge and law clerk are in fact tethered together by an invisible cord for the rest of their mutual careers,  Kozinski famously wrote in a paper called  Confessions of a Bad Apple,  published in the Yale Law Review the same year Kavanaugh clerked for him.  Kozinski, of course, is THE ultimate judicial bad apple.Fifteen women, including one judge and several former clerks, told The Washington Post last year how Kozinski, a Reagan appointee on the country s biggest federal court, had shown them pornographic images in his chambers, made grossly inappropriate comments, and stared at and groped their breasts.Heidi Bond, who clerked for Kozinski in 2006 and 2007, described how the judge showed her photos of naked people, asking her if she was turned on.  When I first arrived in chambers, the outgoing clerks suggested that we should watch The Aristocrats, a documentary about a notorious dirty joke, to prepare ourselves for the upcoming year,  Bond, who left the legal profession entirely, wrote in Slate recently.  Having clerked in his chambers, I do not know how it would be possible to forget something as pervasive as Kozinski s famously sexual sense of humor,  she said.Kozinski was one of a handful of federal judges known for feeding clerks to the Supreme Court. If you landed a job clerking with him, you scored a golden ticket to a prestigious legal career in the United States. Indeed, after Kavanaugh s clerkship with Kozinski ended, he went on to work for Justice Anthony Kennedy on the high court and subsequently skipped down the path to his current nomination.Crossing Kozinski almost certainly would ve put a halt to all that.Even if we take Kavanaugh at his word that he had no idea one of his most important professional contacts was a serial abuser, it raises a crucial question: Does he understand what sexual misconduct looks like? Who knows what kinds of sexual harassment issues Kavanaugh will have the opportunity to decide on over the next 30 years or so,  Elie Mistal wrote in Above the Law this summer.  Whether the man can even recognize sexual harassment WHEN HE SEES IT is relevant. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The Senate already passed the bill 85-7, and Trump will have until Sunday to sign it to keep most federal government agencies from having to shut down at midnight. What part of  no wall  are you having trouble understanding?  laughed Rick Wilson, a Republican consultant and a Trump critic since the start of his presidential candidacy in 2015.  It shouldn t surprise anyone that Trump lied about this. He lies about everything. There was never going to be a wall. Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies that wants to restrict immigration into the United States, said the quandary Trump faces over the wall is his own fault for making such a big deal about the need for the barrier rather than better border enforcement broadly. At some point, people are going to say: Okay, where s the wall?  he said.With critical congressional elections now just six weeks away, some Trump allies fear that his strongest supporters will stay home out of disgust over the wall issue.  He s going to have to do something before the election,  said Sam Nunberg of Citizens of the American Republic, a group created by former top White House aide Steve Bannon.Bannon has for months advocated a government shutdown over the lack of wall funding as a way to energize Trump s base of voters. Nunberg suggested an executive order of some sort that makes it appear the administration is doing something to advance it.  He s got to have a deliverable on this,  he said. White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley on Tuesday criticized Democrats for opposing the wall:  Democrats do not want a single dime spent on securing the border, building a wall, or on any other safety measures because they want open borders and sanctuary cities. But Trump s White House did not address why Trump failed to get the Republican-led chambers of Congress to include any money to construct a wall along the southern border. Trump famously promised the wall in his candidacy announcement speech and said he would force Mexico to pay for it. He repeated both promises hundreds of times over the course of his campaign.As president, Trump has taken multiple positions about signing another spending bill that does not include wall money. In March, just before signing a $1.3 trillion package, Trump lashed out at the Republican-led Congress over the funding omission.He tweeted that one reason is he was considering a veto of that funding measure was because  the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded. He posted that message just hours before he wound up signing the bill, anyway.He explained he was doing so because of all the money going to the military, and then claimed his wall was also getting some funding.  We have $1.6 billion for the wall,  he said.  We re going to be starting work, literally, on Monday. That assertion, however, was false. While there was $1.57 billion for border security  procurement, construction and improvements,  98 percent of it could not be used to build any type of structure that wasn t already in use by 2017. Only $38 million was set aside for  border barrier planning and design    but not construction.Since then, at his campaign rallies, he has repeatedly vowed to shut down the government if Congress did not give him wall money.  We re about to get really nasty over the wall. We re either getting it or we re shutting down government,  he said in August in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.But earlier this month, Trump began signaling that he would be following the advice of congressional GOP leaders who desperately want to avoid a pre-election government shutdown. They told him to wait until December to fight for his wall because he would have more leverage then, Trump has said. We ll do it right after the election where hopefully, frankly, it will be easy because we have more Republicans, not less,  he told Fox News just before a Sept. 6 rally in Billings, Montana. I have no idea what the logic is,  Krikorian said, arguing that exactly the opposite political dynamic will probably be true   that Democrats and those Republicans who oppose building a wall will have far more leverage after the elections than they do now, particularly if Democrats retake the House in November and are only weeks away from gaining formal control in January s new congressional session. What is he going to do in December if he doesn t get his wall funding?  Krikorian asked.  What s he going to do, shut the government down? I m not sure what the thinking is. The details of the spending legislation Congress is currently working on will likely diminish Trump s leverage even further. Agencies including Defense, Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs will be funded through October 2019. Only about a third of the government would shut down if Trump refused to sign a new spending bill by Dec. 7   but that third would include DHS, which is charged with border security. The effect would be to hurt Border Patrol agents, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and others whom Trump frequently claims to support. Are the Democrats really going to cave because of that? I don t think so,  Krikorian said. Whether and how much Trump s failure to deliver on the wall will matter in the coming midterms remains a matter of some debate among Republicans.While Bannon has argued that winning money for the wall is critical for Republicans to have any chance of holding onto the House ñ  The wall is not just totemic. The wall is absolutely central to his program,  he told CNN in June ñ others think that not even his hardcore base ever truly believed Trump would actually build one.Rick Tyler, who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz s 2016 presidential campaign, said Trump s promise to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it was simply something he invented for his rally speeches.  The whole wall thing was a shtick,  he said, likening Trump s rallies to professional wrestling shows where the audience is in on all of the set pieces.  As long as they were applauding it, he was going to go keep repeating it. It s just part of the concert lineup. GOP consultant Frank Luntz said he doubts most of Trump s strongest supporters will even learn that he failed to get wall money in the pending spending bill. The fight over Trump s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh,  what s happening in China and a host of other issues will overshadow this,  he said.Wilson, who recently published a book excoriating Trump, said the president s most loyal supporters ignore news sources that do not portray him in a flattering light.  His base would literally believe that a bucket of dung was a bucket of ice cream if he told them it was,  he said.  He s going to do his rallies and claim the wall is already halfway built, and it s 400 feet tall. And people will cheer and whoop. Krikorian, nevertheless, does not believe that Trump can get away forever with  promising a wall but never delivering.  The president has talked himself into a box,  he said.  You can t keep making threats and not follow up. This story has been updated with comment from the White House.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The nominee portrayed himself as a choir boy during his high school and college years, even saying (completely irrelevantly) that he didn t have  sexual intercourse  in high school nor for  many years  after. (But his college roommate remembers Kavanaugh as a frequent drinker and an  aggressive and belligerent  drunk and said he is  inclined to believe  Ramirez s allegations).And still, Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation hearings continue, even while attorney Michael Avenatti warns a third accuser will shortly come forward   someone whose charges Avenatti said include gang rape corroborated by multiple witnesses. All of this could be over if two Republican senators in the closely divided Senate simply decided they d had enough (and that Americans had had enough) and displayed the courage to stand up to Mitch McConnell and announce they won t be supporting the judge s confirmation   or, better yet, that Kavanaugh should withdraw himself from consideration. Whether they announce it beforehand or not, if McConnell pushes this fiasco to an up-or-down vote, as he threatened on Monday, any two Republican senators could simply vote against Kavanaugh.It s mind-boggling to me that Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) have allowed this nomination to go this far. Murkowski has held herself up as a defender of women s rights, as has Collins   who, along with Flake and Corker, has said she needs to hear from Blasey before she can vote to confirm Kavanaugh. That s the only reason why a hearing is even scheduled for Thursday. Senate Republicans would ve happily voted as soon as possible if not for the calls by Collins, Flake and Corker for a hearing with Blasey. Aware that additional allegations were coming over the weekend, senior GOP staffers on the Judiciary Committee last week allegedly tried to speed up the confirmation process instead of slowing it down to investigate.Collins has now said Ramirez should be called to testify as well, which could push any vote well into next week or even later (though Republican leaders seem set on a faster vote in anticipation of the Supreme Court s new term starting next Monday). The White House claimed on Tuesday that Ramirez could testify on Thursday with Blasey, but Collins had earlier rejected that idea, noting that Ramirez hadn t even been interviewed by committee investigators yet. Yes, Collins  new demand would create more time to consider Kavanaugh s nomination, but it seems like she s simply seeking cover for her eventual yes vote. If Collins   and Murkowski, Flake, Corker or any other GOP senators   actually wanted the full truth on which to make a decision, they d be demanding that the Judiciary Committee subpoena witnesses like Mark Judge; bringing forth classmates, faculty, trauma experts and others; and calling for a thorough FBI investigation. (Murkowski made a vague statement alluding to the latter idea when pressed on Tuesday, but her comment fell far short of actually calling for an FBI probe.)From the moment Trump nominated Kavanaugh, Collins has telegraphed that she s likely a yes vote by claiming she didn t think the judge would overturn Roe v. Wade, which she s defended as an abortion rights senator. Last Friday (in an interview released Monday), well after Blasey s accusations became public (though before Ramirez s allegations had surfaced) Collins said again that she doesn t believe Kavanaugh is going to vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.The Maine senator has got to be one of the last people in America who actually believes that nonsense, since many advocates on both sides of the issue, as well as many legal and judicial experts, are confident that he will. Collins also said she was  very close  to making her decision on the nomination.As I noted in a previous column, Collins reportedly signed off on Kavanaugh during a consultation with Trump before the president even nominated him   something she strenuously denies. It seems like she s either worried about a primary challenge that Trump could help stoke in 2020 or has made some other deal no one knows about. The bottom line is that she desperately wants to vote yes on this nomination even though it goes against everything she claims to stand for. Murkowski, who s spoken out in Alaskan media on her support of the Me Too movement and even introduced a bill last June with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) to combat sexual harassment, faces opposition from Alaska s independent governor, Bill Walker, who came out against the nomination. She s also making a decision on Kavanaugh amid outrage in her home state over a judge s recent slap on the wrist (no prison time) for a man who d sexually assaulted a woman and been charged with felony assault.That Murkowski is even still in the process of making up her mind is pretty gutless   and exposes her fealty to McConnell.Flake and Corker have both spoken out strongly against Trump s recklessness, his ugly rhetoric and the damage he s done to the office of the presidency. They both chose not to run for re-election this year, so this is their chance to say no to the excesses and abuses of a president who they agree has made horrendous decisions. Beyond Kavanaugh s judicial philosophies, which they likely support, the evidence that the nominee has engaged in the very same kind of abuses of women that Trump has allegedly engaged in should have them voting no. Is backing Kavanaugh really how they want to end their tenures in the Senate?  As support of Kavanaugh s nomination sinks in the polls, Democrats are now likely unified against voting to confirm. Any hint that a GOP senator or two would turn against Kavanaugh would surely solidify that.Just two or three of these Republicans could end this national nightmare. The question comes down, as it has throughout Trump s presidency, to whether they put their party loyalty above women, above the American people and above the country itself.Michelangelo Signorile is an editor-at-large for HuffPost.

I understand why both women would keep this information to themselves for so many years, without involving the police,  Lakshmi wrote.  For years, I did the same thing. To people saying  Why didn t he/she report it?  When something so evil happens to you it takes a long time to process it. In our victim-blaming culture it takes incredible courage to come forward. The victim is treated like the perpetrator.Lakshmi said she began dating an older man when she was 16 years old. We were intimate to a point, but he knew that I was a virgin and that I was unsure of when I would be ready to have sex,  she wrote.On New Year s Eve, several months after they started dating, they went to some parties and then back to his apartment where Lakshmi said she promptly fell asleep. She awoke to a  very sharp stabbing pain  between her legs, she said.  Afterward, he said,  I thought it would hurt less if you were asleep.  Then he drove me home. Lakshmi said she didn t report the assault to anyone and that it took her  decades to talk about this with intimate partners and a therapist. There were a number of reasons for this. Lakshmi blamed herself, and she didn t classify the incident as  rape  in her head initially.She also described an earlier experience of molestation when she was 7 years old, which resulted in her parents sending her to live in India for a year when she told them about it. The lesson was: If you speak up, you will be cast out,  Lakshmi wrote. Trump on Friday attempted to cast doubt on Christine Blasey s story that Kavanaugh forced himself on her when they were high school students.  Why didn t someone call the FBI 36 years ago?  he questioned in a tweet. According to the federal government s own estimates, two-thirds of people who are raped or sexually assaulted don t report it.Sexual assault survivors shared their own experiences in response to Trump s question, using the hashtag #WhyIDidn tReport.I was 7 the first time I was sexually assaulted. He was a relative of my mom s second husband. I told my folks and they sent me away. #WhyIDidntReportThe second time I was 16 years old and a virgin. He was my boyfriend.  Date rape  wasn t discussed in the 80 s. I was horrified and ashamed. #WhyIDidntReportThe third time I was assaulted I was 23. I thought that no one would believe me, because no one wanted to stand up to him. I had seen the way Anita Hill was treated when she came forward. #WhyIDidntReportOn Tuesday, Trump similarly questioned the credibility of Deborah Ramirez, who says Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her when they were in college. The president claimed Ramirez  has nothing  because  she admits she was drunk  at the time of the alleged assault.Questioning whether assault victims were drunk, what they were wearing or why they didn t come forward sooner, Lakshmi said, reinforces the very views that keep survivors silent.  We all have a lot to lose if we put a time limit on telling the truth about sexual assault and if we hold on to the codes of silence that for generations have allowed men to hurt women with impunity,  she wrote.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated when Ramirez alleges the assault took place. She says it was in college, not high school."

Instead, they are hiring a woman as outside counsel to do it for them.There s a simple reason Republicans are doing this: Every GOP senator on the committee is male, and they don t want to be seen as bullying a woman who is speaking out about being sexually assaulted as a teenager. There s no particular expertise that a questioner is going to have in this situation,  said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).  Why are my colleagues hiding from their role as members of the Judiciary Committee? The woman they ve hired as counsel is a prosecutor with expertise in sex crimes. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the committee, said he is not releasing the woman s name because he is concerned for her safety. He said the public probably won t know the person s identity prior to the hearing.  We have done it because we want to depoliticize the whole process like the Democrats politicized the Anita Hill thing,  Grassley said. Blasey s legal team does not even know the woman s name, according to two people familiar with the conversations.The decision by Republicans to have a woman who is not in the Senate stand in for them may spare them from some embarrassing fumbles. But it will also, unavoidably, serve as a reminder that 27 years after Anita Hill faced an all-male Senate Judiciary Committee, Republicans don t have a woman in their ranks on the panel.Democratic members of the committee   a group that includes multiple women and people of color   are slated to do their own questioning of Kavanaugh and Blasey on Thursday. The woman hired by Republicans is expected to question Kavanaugh as well. Democratic senators feel capable of asking their own questions,  a Democratic staffer said.  [Republicans] apparently feel they need to hire an outside woman. Ever since it became clear that there would be a hearing with testimony from Blasey, Republicans have been looking for a way to overcome their representation problem. As HuffPost first reported, another option under consideration was having their female staff attorneys do the questioning.Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) on Tuesday said it was  smart  for GOP senators to bring in outside counsel, because, he told reporters,  Somebody will do something that you guys will run 24/7 and inadvertently somebody will do something that s insensitive. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) added that he is personally fine with letting a female attorney do the questioning he would normally do. I m happy to have a professional do it,  he told reporters.  If there s something I want to know about, I ll ask. A Democratic staffer noted that there are rules on bringing in outside counsel. A person at a law firm would have to quit his or her job to do the questioning   the individual could not take a leave of absence and could not do it pro bono. This is a developing story.

Blasey is expected to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. So is Kavanaugh, who has vehemently denied the assault allegations.So far, the accusations by Blasey as well as Deborah Ramirez, a classmate of Kavanaugh s at Yale University, have done little to deter GOP Senate leaders from attempting to move full speed ahead with Kavanaugh s confirmation.Murkowski is perennially seen as a swing vote on conservative judicial nominations because of her pro-choice views on abortion.

The second accuser has nothing,  Trump told reporters of Deborah Ramirez, who told The New Yorker in an interview published Sunday that she believes Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face when they were freshmen at Yale University in the early 1980s.  She was totally messed up. She admits she was drunk.  Oh gee, let s not make him a Supreme Court justice because of this,  the president added in a sarcastic tone,  according to The New York Times.WATCH:  She admits that she was drunk,  President Trump says of Deborah Ramirez, the second woman to accuse Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct; accuses Democrats of playing a  con game  pic.twitter.com/lK6EOkR8GdKavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge, has been the subject of mounting sexual misconduct allegations in recent weeks.Christine Blasey Ford, a 51-year-old research psychologist in Northern California, has alleged Kavanaugh pinned her down, groped her and tried to remove her clothes when they were high school students around 1982. A week later, The New Yorker published Ramirez s accusations, in which she alleges Kavanaugh exposed himself during a drunken dormitory party.Ramirez told The New Yorker that she was initially hesitant to speak out because she had been drinking at the time and there were gaps in her memory. After six days of assessing her memories and consulting her attorney, Ramirez told the news outlet that she felt confident about what Kavanaugh had done.Kavanaugh, 53, has vehemently denied the allegations.Trump s comments on Tuesday fly in the face of sexual assault survivor advocacy groups, which note that victims of abuse should be believed and are never at fault   even if they were intoxicated at the time. Some victims blame themselves for drinking too much at a party or putting themselves in a potentially dangerous situation,  according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network s website.  It s important to remember that if a sexual assault occurs under these circumstances, it is still not your fault. The blame falls on the perpetrator who took advantage of you. Some members of the Trump administration, including U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, have distanced themselves from the president s aggressive rhetoric on the matter. While discussing the Kavanaugh allegations Sunday on CNN, Haley said sexual assault accusers should not be blamed or second-guessed. Accusers go through a lot of trauma and some handle it one way and some handle it the other way,  Haley said.Trump also claimed on Tuesday that the Kavanaugh allegations were part of Senate Democrats  efforts to  delay and obstruct  the judge s confirmation. It s a con game,  Trump said.  They re playing a con game. They re playing actually much better than the Republicans. Blasey and Kavanaugh are scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. The panel has delayed its vote on whether to advance Kavanaugh s confirmation to the full Senate in order to hear Blasey s testimony.This story has been updated with more details about Trump s comments and about sexual assault survivors.Need help?

Based on my time with Brett, I believe that he and his social circle were capable of the actions that Debbie described. In The New Yorker article, Roche described Ramirez as  exceptionally honest and gentle.   I did not observe the specific incident in question, but I do remember Brett frequently drinking excessively and becoming incoherently drunk,  he said in his statement.Roche s recollection goes against what Kavanaugh told Fox News  Martha MacCallum in an interview Monday night. He said he had never been drunk enough to forget any of his actions.The following is a statement from James Roche, Brett #Kavanaugh s freshman roommate at Yale. pic.twitter.com/VfHUgPj3cVRamirez came forward after the account of Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor who claims Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school.GOP Senate Judiciary Committee leaders rebuffed Blasey s call for an FBI investigation into her story, but she has nevertheless agreed to testify at a hearing on Thursday.Kavanaugh has steadfastly denied the assault allegations and said Monday he wouldn t withdraw in the face of what he called  false accusations.

Why is it so hard to talk about? Well, part of it is fear and part of it is doubt,  said Lemon, a survivor of sexual assault who remained silent for years.  Will I be believed? Will I be blamed? Will I have evidence? Do I have to relive what happened? Will everyone judge me? And if I speak out, will it even matter? Lemon s comments came amid attacks on Christine Blasey Ford, the California professor who accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982 but did not come forward until now. President Donald Trump selected Kavanaugh as his Supreme Court nominee and has described him as a  wonderful man.  Trump has also called the accusations false and attacked Ford and her parents.Lemon grew emotional as he recounted his own experience, and had tears in his eyes as he spoke of a family member who came forward to him only last week. I ve been thinking about why she told me this and about why she didn t tell me sooner,  Lemon said.  And I ve been thinking about why these women are coming forward to tell the whole country what they say happened, knowing that they will be judged.  See his full monologue in the clip above.

He also claims she will publicly come forward within 48 hours. So let this be a warning to Donald Trump, Brett Kavanaugh and other surrogates on the Senate Judiciary Committee,  Avenatti said.  Be very, very careful if you launch some smear campaign against my client because you will ultimately be shown to be a fraud. During the interview, Avenatti also disputed the Supreme Court nominee s  absolutely unbelievable  claims that he couldn t have sexually assaulted anyone as a teenager because he was a virgin in high school and  for many years thereafter.   I think the American people are smarter than this,  Avenatti said.  I don t believe that America is going to believe what Brett Kavanaugh just stated on Fox News. Avenatti leveled accusations at Kavanaugh in a tweet on Sunday that showed what appeared to be a screenshot of an email sent to the chief counsel for nominations to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the email, he claimed to have  significant evidence  that Kavanaugh and a friend from high school participated in  targeting  women at house parties with  alcohol/drugs. Avenatti has yet to publicly specify the nature of Kavanaugh s involvement or cite evidence for the allegations. Check out the full segment in the clip above.

Whether Grassley knew of the coming allegations, or senior staff knew and pressed him to expedite the session, is unclear.  The second aide couldn t directly link GOP staffers  knowledge of the coming allegations to Grassley s decision to expedite the hearing, but said it was  widely known  among top aides that The New Yorker was about to report new allegations. GOP staffers were  factoring that into their strategic thinking about how to move forward,  the aide said.Both Democratic aides requested anonymity in order to speak freely.Republican senators on the committee, including Grassley, insist they didn t know about The New Yorker story on Deborah Ramirez s allegations until it broke on Sunday. That means senior GOP staffers either knew about the coming allegations and didn t tell GOP senators, or they did communicate it to senators and someone isn t telling the truth.Grassley spokesman Taylor Foy said he moved up Kavanaugh s hearing to Monday because the attorney for his first accuser, Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford,  was all over TV the previous Monday  saying Ford wanted to testify before the committee.  The hearing was scheduled immediately in order to afford her that opportunity without delay,  said Foy.He did not clarify if Grassley knew that more Kavanaugh allegations were coming before The New Yorker story hit.Ramirez, who went to Yale University with Kavanaugh, alleges that he waved his penis in her face against her will. Her allegations come after Ford alleged that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school, pinning her down on a bed and covering her mouth when she tried to scream. Kavanaugh has denied all allegations.The New Yorker piece touches on the fact that Republican staffers knew about the allegations last week. It notes that some  expressed concern  about the effect they could have on Kavanaugh s nomination   and that, soon after, GOP senators made a new push to speed up Kavanaugh s vote.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, tweeted Wednesday that it was  imperative  to hurry up and vote on Kavanaugh. It is imperative the Judiciary committee move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination and a committee vote be taken ASAP.Asked Monday if this was because Graham knew The New Yorker story was coming, spokesman Kevin Bishop said no and that Graham learned about the new allegations on Sunday along with everyone else. No,  said Bishop.  You need better sources. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), also a member of the Judiciary Committee, didn t know about the coming allegations either, according to his office. No one on our staff had any hint of the Ramirez story before the Drudge link,  said his spokesman, Conn Carroll. Drudge Report sent an alert Sunday that the New Yorker story was about to be published.This story has been updated with comment from Grassley s spokesman.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The same day disgraced actor Bill Cosby began his sentencing hearing in Norristown for sexual assault, people marched to the state capitol about 100 miles away in Harrisburg to support survivors of child sex abuse by Roman Catholic clergy. The rally drew the support of Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D), a bipartisan group of legislators, and victims of former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar. They all urged quick passage of reforms recommended in a grand jury investigation report in August that identified 301  predator priests  and over 1,000 victims in six Pennsylvania Catholic dioceses over 70 years. Meanwhile, Cosby s sentencing hearing started in Montgomery County with emotional victim impact statements from Cosby s accuser, Andrea Constand, and her family.Cosby, 81, was convicted in April on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault for attacking Constand, a former Temple University basketball coach, in 2004. Constand, who initially thought of Cosby as a mentor, said the actor drugged and sexually assaulted her at his suburban Philadelphia home.More than 60 other women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct.Prosecutors recommended that Cosby serve a sentence of five to 10 years in prison on Monday, The Associated Press reports. A judge is expected to deliver Cosby s sentence on Tuesday.Advocates for survivors drew links on Monday between Cosby s predatory behavior and that of predator priests. There are clear similarities in predator behaviors and the grooming and selection process of those they choose to offend upon,  Jennifer Storm, Pennsylvania s victims advocate, told HuffPost in an email. Predators use their status as mentors, celebrities, coaches or priests to gain victims  trust, Storm said. Marci Hamilton, a child sex abuse expert with the nonprofit Child USA, told HuffPost that the Cosby case helped reinforced her conviction that society prefers and protects  powerful adults at the expense of the vulnerable.  Hamilton said the aspersions cast on the women making sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have only contributed to her belief. It is a reminder that this society often attacks and ignores the first whistleblower,  Hamilton wrote in an email.  If Times Up means anything it must mean that victims are heard and treated with respect.  And powerful men uniting against a female victim need to think twice which side they choose,  she added.Watch a Facebook livestream of the rally below.On Monday, survivors and their allies urged Pennsylvania lawmakers to adopt all four of the recommendations put forward by the grand jury investigation on abuse in the Catholic church. After sifting through hundreds of pages of church documents and hearing testimonies from dozens of witnesses, the jurors came to the conclusion that Catholic church officials in Pennsylvania worked hard to protect and cover up abuse by pedophile priests while brushing aside victims  concerns. The grand jury recommended removing the statute of limitations for victims of child sexual abuse. Currently, Pennsylvania state law requires victims to file criminal charges by the age of 50. Jurors also advised opening a two-year  civil window  for victims older than 30 to sue the dioceses.Pennsylvania Catholic dioceses said Friday that they d be willing to set up a victim s compensation fund, which would protect church records from the scrutiny of lawsuits, The Associated Press reports. The dioceses also fear that opening up a window for civil litigation of old cases could be financially crippling for Pennsylvania Catholic schools and charities.On Monday, Pennsylvania s state House approved a bill that would fulfill these first two recommendations. The bill, which could get a final House vote on Tuesday, is expected to face resistance from Republican members of the state Senate, according to the AP.The grand jurors also recommended tightening laws about mandatory reporting and making sure confidentiality agreements don t bar victims from taking their cases to the police. The last recommendation was tested in the Cosby case. In 2016, months after he was charged with criminal sexual assault, Cosby tried suing Constand for violating a decade-old confidential settlement by cooperating with police. A district judge later dismissed Cosby s claims.At the rally, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) stressed the importance of passing all four recommendations.  The time for institutions to protect their reputations over the victims is over,  Shapiro said.  That is true for the Catholic Church, that is true for USA Gymnastics, that is true for Hollywood, that is true for cartels of political power in this country.

The nominee denied the accusation in a Fox News interview Monday evening, maintaining that he s  not going anywhere.  I know I m telling the truth. I know my lifelong record, and I m not going to let false accusations drive me out of this process,  Kavanaugh said in an interview alongside his wife, Ashley Estes Kavanaugh.Top Senate Republicans also dismissed the latest accusation, attacking Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee for withholding information about the alleged incident from their GOP counterparts despite hearing about Ramirez s story last week. They just wanted it to wind up in the press. Another orchestrated, last-minute hit on the nominee,  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday in a fiery speech on the Senate floor, vowing to hold a vote on Kavanaugh s nomination no matter what comes out during a scheduled hearing on Thursday with Christine Blasey Ford, the research psychologist who last week accused Kavanaugh of groping her at a high school party while they were both teens.Ramirez, meanwhile, alleged that Kavanaugh pulled down his pants and thrust his penis in her face at a Yale party during the 1983-84 school year. She says both she and Kavanaugh were intoxicated at the time and that she wasn t entirely sure of her memories. The New Yorker interviewed multiple people who Ramirez said were at the party, but none of them said they could recall such an incident.Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans pointed to the lack of corroborating witnesses in Ramirez s story as well as Democrats  involvement with her coming forward behind the scenes as reasons to dismiss her allegation. You re always going to have these phony allegations come.... that s always the case when you have such an invested situation,  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told reporters on Monday when asked if he wanted to see Ramirez testify before the Senate.When a reporter pressed the Utah Republican to explain how he knew the allegation was  phony,  Hatch simply said,  Because I know it is, that s why. Hatch also said he didn t  see any reason  to call Kavanaugh s high school friend Mark Judge to testify before the Senate, despite the fact that The New Yorker reported Sunday that Judge s ex-girlfriend once recalled how he and other classmates took turns having sex with a drunken woman in school. Democrats said the latest allegation concerning Judge is even more reason why the FBI ought to reopen a background investigation into Kavanaugh s nomination. Last week, Blasey claimed that Judge was in the room while the now-Supreme Court nominee allegedly groped her   an incident Judge said in a letter he has  no memory  of.Hatch said of the committee vote on Kavanaugh s nomination:  It ought to be done before the end of this week.  Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), another Judiciary Committee member, told reporters he believed that Democrats are  just taking shots in the dark  with the latest allegation against Kavanaugh, adding that he is  prepared to move forward with the vote  on the nomination barring any new incriminating information that may arise at Thursday s hearing with Blasey.Republicans who are considered swing votes on Kavanaugh s nomination similarly didn t appear to find the latest sexual misconduct allegation against him as disqualifying.Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told CNN she believes that Senate Judiciary Committee investigators should interview Ramirez. The centrist Republican did not, however, call on Ramirez to testify in public, as she had done with Blasey last week. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), another undecided senator on the nomination, told reporters she didn t know whether Ramirez ought to testify.Kavanaugh s firm denials on Monday   as well as his unusual decision to address the allegations in a television interview with his wife by his side   also appeared to give Republicans some reassurance about firmly sticking by their nominee despite not yet having heard Blasey s testimony and the possibility that more allegations involving Kavanaugh could surface in the future. I think part of it is Judge Kavanaugh s resolve,  Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said Monday when asked why top Republicans seemed to have so much faith in the nominee s denials.  He said he s not going to withdraw, that this is a smear. He s staying in this and obviously willing to go out and make his own case even before the hearing. The Missouri senator, who is the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, added that GOP leadership believes a vote on Kavanaugh  is something that everybody should be prepared to have a position on in the foreseeable future.

I have never seen anything like this in my career in over three decades  working as a judge and district attorney, she said on  The Five.   I ve never seen so many repressed memory cases in my life, especially against one guy. So,  my question is, if there s something awry going on, was there hypnosis, are they using confabulation? I don t want to get in the weeds here, but you know what? This is where they have a right to true cross-examination,  she said.Christine Blasey Ford, who is planning to testify Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, has not publicly mentioned any  repressed memories  concerning her accusations against Kavanaugh. The Northern California research psychologist, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, told The Washington Post earlier this month that Kavanaugh shoved her into a bedroom at a party when they were both in high school, locked the door, pinned her to the bed, groped her and put his hand over her mouth to stop her from screaming. A second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, told The New Yorker that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and thrust his penis in her face during a party while they were both freshmen at Yale. She talked to reporters Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer after  carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney,  they said.Kavanaugh has categorically denied accusations from both women.Stormy Daniels  attorney Michael Avenatti has said he is representing a third woman with a sexual misconduct allegation against Kavanaugh.I represent a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. We will be demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the committee and will likewise be demanding that Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify. The nomination must be withdrawn.The Montgomery County Sentinel in Maryland also reported Monday that an alleged witness to an unspecified incident involving Kavanaugh that occurred in high school in the 1980s contacted local police over the weekend, according to sources. A police statement said that no alleged victim or attorney had contacted police to launch an investigation against Kavanaugh. But the statement did not specifically address the Sentinel s report about a witness.Pirro first floated her hypnosis theory as a guest on Sean Hannity s program last Thursday.

Dr. Blasey, as the California professor is known professionally, first told her story during marriage counseling in 2012   a revelation captured in her therapist s notes. Her account is most vivid when most traumatic: a drunken Kavanaugh covering her mouth to suppress screams, causing her to fear suffocation. She placed another witness in the room, Mark Judge, making her an extremely incautious   therefore, I proposed, improbable   liar. I further noted the ample evidence that Kavanaugh and Judge were active participants in a culture of teenage binge drinking   about which Judge subsequently wrote a book describing himself as a blackout drunk. The gaps in Blasey s memory, I noted, are consistent with trauma and the passage of time; her failure to report this as a teen squares with feelings cited by countless victims of sexual assault   trauma, self-blame, and the fear of shaming and ostracism.Unlike Kavanaugh, I reasoned, there is no compelling motive for Blasey to lie about this now. By coming forward, Blasey is poisoning the rest of her life   Anita Hill personifies the opprobrium she must endure. And Blasey s request that the FBI investigate her charges, I concluded, further buttresses her credibility.Foolishly, I suggested all this means that she deserves a fair and respectful hearing. But nothing impeded Kavanaugh s dauntless internet defenders from exposing her insidious plotting. A sample: Blasey, lucky woman,  stands to make millions from TV interviews and book deals.  As for me,  you liberals are very very special with your never ever ending lies. Blasey, another insisted, is  a Democratic activist.  Still another intimated that she had  major connections to a pharmaceutical company.  One sage grasped that  liberals already have the FBI in their back pocket,  rendering an investigation pointless.If Blasey was assaulted, a particularly astute informant advised me,  Kavanaugh wasn t her attacker    omitting, to my distress, the source of this dispositive insight. After all, a compatriot insisted,  politics is her reason to lie. Why hadn t I thought of that?Chastened, I scoured the Internet for further revelations, only to be thwarted. Dr. Ford received harsh negative reviews from students   sadly, the wrong Dr. Ford. She made sexual assault allegations against Trump s previous Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch   which, strangely, went unreported until now, no doubt concealed by her agents in the liberal media.Her brother worked at a law firm connected to the Russian investigation   cleverly covering his tracks by leaving 12 years before the probe commenced. Finally, paydirt: Blasey is a major Democratic donor   with contributions totaling less than $100 between 2013 and 2017, she trails her competitor in funding the party, George Soros, by mere multiples of millions. No wonder she needs a book deal.To my astonishment, I stumbled on what an oversensitive soul might misinterpret as misogyny. Some peerless wits circulated a caricature of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with the caption,  Abe Lincoln pinched me,  doubtless provoking hearty chuckles from Harvey Weinstein and Les Moonves.The everñamusing Alex Jones (on trial for exposing the hoax perpetrated by the phony parents of the fictitious kids never murdered in Newtown, Connecticut) took time to describe a picture of a young girl with her face obscured as that  hussy  and  captain of the sluts  Christine Blasey ñ who, he somehow divined, passed out at parties to secure  plausible deniability. In search of higher moral ground, I turned to Republican evangelicals. But Ralph Reed was simply concerned that a failure to confirm Kavanaugh would depress evangelical turnout. Franklin Graham confused me by revealing facts apparently unknown to Kavanaugh   even if the encounter happened,  she said no and he respected it and walked away.  Anyhow, Graham assured the faithful, whatever Kavanaugh did was irrelevant.Fortunately, the newly preeminent moral leader of Republican evangelicals, Donald Trump, was there to fill the void.  I have no doubt,  he tweeted,  if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents.  Helpfully, he added:  Facts don t matter. Still, I thought, a coherent theory might be nice. So I was pleased to locate a source for my earlier informant s revelation that Blasey had confused Kavanaugh with another teenage male   Twitter postings by Ed Whelan, a Kavanaugh friend and supporter with close ties to the right-wing judicial pipeline, the Federalist Society, which sponsored the embattled nominee. And I was even more relieved when Whelan posted photographs of the real assailant, one of Kavanaugh s high school classmates.Clarity at last. After all, don t all teenage sexual assailants look alike? No wonder Blasey was confused! Imagine my distress, then, when Whelan was forced to apologize for making a false charge against a blameless guy as part of a disinformation campaign orchestrated by a public relations firm which represents, of all things, the Federalist Society.So the last thing I needed was more reportage from Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow (the latter being the Pulitzer Prize-winning scourge of Weinstein and Moonves). But there they were, writing in The New Yorker that a female college classmate of Kavanaugh s asserts that, amid a drunken gathering, he thrust his penis at her, forcing her to touch it. More charges and counter-charges began swirling.So I guess I m on my own. As a public service, I hereby render my best assessment of what Kavanaugh s defenders are really saying:Christine Blasey Ford is no mere academic   she s a keen observer of the judicial totem pole, bent on destroying innocent Republican aspirants to the Supreme Court. In 2012 she realized that she once knew one guy among many who might actually get nominated to the bench, assuming a Republican got elected president in 2016.That same year, with diabolical foresight, she commenced marriage counseling in order to plant an accusation against Kavanaugh during a therapy session, making it vivid enough that her therapist would write it down. Patiently, Blasey waited six more years for the dominoes to fall   first, the election of Trump; second, after the detour of Gorsuch s ascension to the high court, the nomination of Kavanaugh. The rest is history.Feel better now? I certainly do.Richard North Patterson is the New York Times best-selling author of 22 novels, a former chairman of Common Cause, and a member of the Council On Foreign Relations."

Kavanaugh claimed Monday in a Fox News interview that he couldn t have sexually assaulted anyone as a teenager because of his virginity. Christine Blasey Ford, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, has accused him of attacking her at a party more than 35 years ago when they were both in high school.Kavanaugh and Blasey are scheduled to give their separate accounts of the incident on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. We re talking about allegations of sexual assault. I have never sexually assaulted anyone,  Kavanaugh told Fox News.  I did not have sexual intercourse, or anything close to sexual intercourse, in high school or many years thereafter. .@marthamaccallum joined #TheFive to discuss her exclusive interview with Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, airing tonight at 7p ET on Fox News Channel.  https://t.co/QFmLfIwW4R pic.twitter.com/QzymMZa2KVBlasey alleges that Kavanaugh pinned her down, groped her and attempted to take off her clothes during a party. She contends that he was drunk at the time and that he only stopped after a classmate threw himself on top of them, giving her a chance to run away.It should go without saying that virginity does not mean a person is not capable of drunkenly groping another person against her will. Kavanaugh s statement on his virginity was called into question on Tuesday when history professor Stephen Kantrowitz tweeted that Kavanaugh told him a different story during their freshmen year at Yale University. Kantrowitz told HuffPost in an emailed statement that he was compelled to reveal a private conversation with Kavanaugh due to the  tremendous importance of honesty and integrity to serving as a Justice of the Supreme Court.   Contrary to his assertion that he remained a virgin  for many years  after high school, during our freshman year he described losing his virginity,  Kantrowitz wrote.  I remember this distinctly because it was the first time I had had such a conversation with an acquaintance who was not a friend. I have no first-hand knowledge of any of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, but I thought this conversation was relevant as it goes to the question of his truthfulness. A second woman, Deborah Ramirez, has accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself and thrusting his penis at her face when they were both college students at Yale during the 1983-84 school year. Ramirez says they were both intoxicated at that party and that she isn t entirely sure of her memories. The New Yorker, which first published Ramirez s account on Sunday, was not able to independently confirm if Kavanaugh was at the Yale party she described, but interviewed several of Ramirez s classmates, who recalled hearing about the alleged incident in vague terms.Kavanaugh has also pointed to a letter signed by 65 women he has known for decades attesting that the judge has always treated them with  decency and respect.  This letter is also not evidence that he did not commit sexual assault. A person can treat hundreds of women well and still mistreat some other women.A New York Times report on Monday that examined a copy of Georgetown Preparatory School s 1983 yearbook shed new light on Kavanaugh s behavior in high school.The phrase  Renate alumni,  printed under a group photo of nine football players, including Kavanaugh, is a reference to Renate Schroeder Dolphin, then a student at a nearby Catholic girls school, the Times reported.The football players used the phrase as a way to brag about their alleged sexual conquests, two of Kavanaugh s classmates told the Times.Dolphin was one of 65 women who say they knew Kavanaugh in high school and signed a letter defending his character following Blasey s accusations. Dolphin told the Times she was unaware at the time of the apparent reference to her in the yearbook. I learned about these yearbook pages only a few days ago,  Dolphin said in a statement to the paper.  I don t know what  Renate Alumnus  actually means. I can t begin to comprehend what goes through the minds of 17-year-old boys who write such things, but the insinuation is horrible, hurtful and simply untrue. I pray their daughters are never treated this way. I will have no further comment. A Kavanaugh representative told the Times the phrase  Renate alumni  referred to Kavanaugh and Dolphin attending  one high school event together and nothing else.  Judge Kavanaugh was friends with Renate Dolphin in high school,  the representative said in a statement.  He admired her very much then, and he admires her to this day. The statement continued:  Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Dolphin attended one high school event together and shared a brief kiss good night following that event. They had no other such encounter. The language from Judge Kavanaugh s high school yearbook refers to the fact that he and Ms. Dolphin attended that one high school event together and nothing else. Dolphin, in a statement issued by her lawyer, denied kissing Kavanaugh.Arthur Delaney contributed to this report.This article has been updated to include the report about Kavanaugh s high school yearbook and a statement from Stephen Kantrowitz.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

McConnell was filled with indignation on the Senate floor, graduating from previous assurances of a fair process for Kavanaugh accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford to unwavering certainty that all the women coming out against Kavanaugh are lying. The majority leader appears to have made up his mind.He called the latest allegation against Kavanaugh released Sunday night  another orchestrated, last-minute hit on the nominee,  and he vowed to hold a floor vote no matter what comes out during a scheduled hearing with Blasey and Kavanaugh on Thursday   or before or after that.The Kentucky Republican charged that Senate Democrats were trying to  destroy a man s personal and professional life on the basis of decades-old allegations that are unsubstantiated and uncoordinated.  That is where we are,  McConnell continued.  This is what the so-called  Resistance  has become: a smear campaign, pure and simple, aided and abetted by members of the United States Senate. Even as McConnell thunders on in the Senate, however, more voters now oppose Kavanaugh s confirmation, according to a Fox News poll released Sunday. Only 40 percent would confirm him, as opposed to the 50 percent who would not. More importantly, a few Republican senators seem to be on the fence about President Donald Trump s Supreme Court pick.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) has said these are  serious charges,  and he made it clear to McConnell and other GOP leaders that if the Senate didn t give Blasey  a chance to be heard,  he would vote no on the nominee.Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) are also potential no votes, although Collins recently told Showtime that she didn t believe Kavanaugh would repeal Roe v. Wade.Still, with Kavanaugh s support wavering among the public, at least one GOP senator told Politico on Monday that the electoral considerations in abandoning Kavanaugh might weigh more on McConnell and other GOP leaders than a potentially embarrassing vote where a couple of Republicans defect and join the Democrats in voting no   and that McConnell s promise to hold a vote whether or not Kavanaugh has enough support seems to be a message aimed at those possible defectors, telling them he will make them go on the record in their opposition to the nominee.But with voters increasingly siding against Kavanaugh, and with the Thursday hearing moving forward, McConnell s threat to hold a vote might not scare those wavering Republicans enough.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) in an interview at the Values Voter Summit over the weekend in Washington.  We don t want to blow this. We don t want to blow this!  A member of President Donald Trump s Evangelical Advisory Board, Bachmann said she believes that due to Trump,  on every metric  America has experienced  blessings  that are  without parallel.  In the interview at the annual conference of evangelicals organized by the anti-LGBTQ Family Research Council, she elaborated on her assertion. For men, for women, for young people, for blacks, for Hispanics, we ve never had it better economically,  she said.  We ve never had it better on a foreign policy level. We ve never had a more pro-life president, a more pro-Israel president. Nor has there been a chief executive  who cares [more] about the religious liberty,  Bachmann, a featured speaker at the values summit, said in the interview, which aired on SiriusXM Progress.At the same gathering last year, Bachmann explained in an interview how Trump had become a  man of faith  who  asked God for help and for wisdom. As Trump cultivated celebrityhood through coverage in tabloids and with his reality TV show  The Apprentice,  he was never associated with any religious movement. But Bachmann, in her comments last year,  said Vice President Mike Pence had assured her of Trump s religiosity.The onetime GOP presidential candidate expanded on that subject this year, detailing her belief that God is working through Trump. He has so rocked everything he s done,  she said of the president.  Everything he has touched has literally almost turned to gold on every level. People s lives are better because of this one man. And I think that can t be lost. We ve seen an answer to our prayers from two years ago. Attendees at this year s event seemed in full agreement.A woman named Helen, who only wanted to give her first name and said she was an Armenian immigrant, was at the summit with her sister, also an immigrant. We 100% support President Trump,  she said.  We are here because we are Christians and also because [we support] Trump. He is the best we ve ever had.  A man named Kevin, who also didn t want to give his last name, described himself as in  complete and utter shock  that he came to fully support Trump. But he said he believed Trump has  honored God  and, like Bachmann, he now believes God is working through him.LISTEN: #VVS18 Attendee  Kevin  explains how Donald Trump has honored God on The @MSignorile Show -  Donald Trump has done more than anyone I ve seen in my lifetime, Reagan being right up there with him, in terms of honoring God  pic.twitter.com/YyxCZx4mX9How does Kevin explain God doing so when Trump in his actions and rhetoric has so often been offensive, misogynistic, racist and vulgar? God uses whom he will,  he answered.  God will use someone to bring about his purposes in this world, regardless of whether that person, that man or woman, is a faithful person or not. So, when God does use someone to bring about his purposes in the history and in the timeline of civilization, God using someone is no measure or stamp of his approval on that person s moral or spiritual life. Trump last year became the first sitting president to speak at the values summit. This year Pence represented the administration; he praised Trump for delivering on his policy promises to evangelicals and called embattled Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces sexual assault allegations from two women, a  man of integrity.

Susan Collins (R-Maine) has once again indicated that she trusts Brett Kavanaugh would uphold abortion rights if confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite what the conservative judge has said to the contrary.  First of all, I do not believe he s going to repeal Roe v. Wade,  Collins said in an interview released Monday for Showtime s  The Circus.  Collins said she is  very close  to making a decision on Kavanaugh s confirmation but is waiting to hear from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused the nominee of sexually assaulting her when they were both in high school. How could I decide before hearing the testimony of Professor Ford?  Collins said. .@AlexWagner and @JHeil met with @SenatorCollins from Maine to discuss the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and the role of gender amid the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford. #SHOCircus #TheCircus #Showtime pic.twitter.com/C3PFkqJZAbCollins is one of a handful of moderate senators considered to be swing votes on Kavanaugh, who needs the approval of all but one Republican in the Senate to be confirmed. She has said in the past that she could not support a Supreme Court nominee who is hostile to Roe, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion throughout the United States. Kavanaugh reportedly assured Collins in a one-on-one meeting that he believes Roe is  settled law    a statement she appears to have accepted without question. But Kavanaugh has consistently ruled against abortion rights as a federal judge. He has written that the Supreme Court  can always overturn  Roe and that some conservative justices  would do so.  I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent,  he wrote in a 2003 memo that was released earlier this month. Even if Kavanaugh didn t vote to overturn Roe, the Supreme Court could have many opportunities in the coming years to gut abortion access by allowing states to regulate it out of existence, as Texas tried to do with a pair of laws in 2013 that shut down half the abortion clinics in the state. Collins is facing a massive amount of pressure in Maine to block Kavanaugh, as polls show a majority of her constituents support Roe v. Wade. But she could also face a primary challenge from the right in 2020, raising the stakes of her voting against her party. Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said Collins would be betraying women, sexual assault survivors and the reproductive rights movement if she voted for Kavanaugh. We worked very, very hard since the day Kavanaugh was nominated to frame exactly who this guy is, how hostile he is towards women, particularly on abortion rights,  Hogue said on  The Circus.   You ve got this woman who sacrificed everything to tell her story, and if they move forward on top of that, they re telling all of us that we don t matter. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated how many Republican votes in the Senate are needed to confirm Kavanaugh. It is all but one, not every one.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Blasey claims that Kavanaugh pinned her down, groped her and attempted to take off her clothes during a high school party when they were teenagers. She alleges that Kavanaugh was drunk at the time and only stopped after a classmate threw himself on top of them, giving her a chance to run away.MacCallum didn t ask Kavanaugh about the person Blasey said had interrupted the alleged assault, Mark Judge. Judge sent a statement to the Senate committee claiming he did not remember the incident and did not wish to speak on the matter publicly. Kavanaugh told MacCallum he had never been drunk enough to misremember or forget any of his actions. Judge, however, wrote an entire memoir about being blackout drunk in high school.

Ramirez says both she and Kavanaugh were intoxicated at the time and that she isn t entirely sure of her memories.The New Yorker, which first published Ramirez s account Sunday, was not able to independently confirm if Kavanaugh was at the Yale party she described, but interviewed several of Ramirez s classmates, who recalled hearing about the alleged incident in vague terms.James Roche, who was Kavanaugh s roommate at the time of the alleged Yale incident, told The New Yorker that he recalled Kavanaugh to be  frequently, incoherently drunk.  Another former classmate who chose to remain anonymous told The New Yorker he believed Ramirez s claims and described Kavanaugh as someone who was  relatively shy  who could become  aggressive and even belligerent  when he drank alcohol. Kavanaugh has denied both women s allegations against him and will provide his account to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. This story has been updated with additional details from Kavanaugh s interview and the New Yorker article.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Even though I was getting married it was really important to me to make the effort to show up. Coming forward is never easy and puts the survivor at such risk and I m so appreciative of the women who do this work every day, and who tell their story and make other people feel supported to tell theirs. On Monday, people around the country participated in a national walkout to denounce the backlash women often face when they go public with their accounts of being sexually harassed, assaulted or raped. The two women who have come forward against Kavanaugh   Christine Blasey Ford, joined Sunday by another woman, Deborah Ramirez   are facing massive amounts of vitriol for saying the now-Supreme Court nominee victimized them decades ago.Earlier this month, Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a party when they were both in high school in the 1980s. Ford has been receiving death threats ever since and has had to vacate her home. Ramirez told The New Yorker s Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow that Kavanaugh exposed himself and put his penis in her face at a party when Ramirez and Kavanaugh were both at Yale, also in the 1980s.Kavanaugh has denied the allegations and has made it clear that he won t withdraw his nomination.Anti-sexual harassment organization Times Up, which facilitated Monday s walkout, tweeted on Sunday that  WOMEN MUST BE HEARD  in a  MOMENT OF SOLIDARITY  and urged people to wear black. Survivors must be heard. Wear black and join the national walkout on Monday, Sept. 24 at 1 pm ET/10 am PT in solidarity with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. https://t.co/XcLucrziMJ #BelieveSurvivors #TIMESUP pic.twitter.com/s3RQY40Mf5McCaffrey said she was motivated to attend the walkout, even on her wedding day, because she believes women and thinks that  people need to know that their voices matter.  I think enough women have come forward that we need to withdraw this nomination,  McCaffrey told HuffPost, referring to Kavanaugh.  Republicans in the Senate are trying to push this nominee through for a lifetime position. But this isn t a lawsuit, it isn t a hearing. It s an interview for a lifetime position on the highest court in the land. These brave women should be listened to. The bride told HuffPost that she wanted to be at the White House promptly at 1 p.m. for the walkout, but her nuptials weren t done by then. So she arrived a bit later because she  still thought it important to go. McCaffrey said her new husband is  completely supportive and agrees on all points I just mentioned.  He also knows that there s no where else I d rather be than doing a little civil disobedience for the sake of solidarity on my Big Day,  she wrote.After showing her support for women, McCaffrey said she ll be celebrating her union with  many sweet treats and toasts  and  may or may not  make sure everyone in her family makes a call to Congress as a wedding gift."

The move had the potential to endanger special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into Russian election interference, which Rosenstein oversees.Reports shifted by midday Monday, however. The New York Times, for one, seemed to back away slightly from its earlier story, reporting that Rosenstein was  considering quitting.  Rosenstein, who remains deputy attorney general for now, will meet with President Donald Trump on Thursday.But, as you might imagine, in a social media universe that moves at a lightning pace even on a day with no news, Monday was like a chaotic ball of frenzied cats. Twitter users responded to the chaos in hilarious ways.If you re just joining us, Rod Rosenstein has resigned but also hasn t resigned yet and is going to the White House in order to resign and also to be fired and also he s already BEEN fired and is already gone and also isn t resigning or getting fired.Maybe it s just a guy who looks like Rod Rosenstein that resigned?It was a mere THREE hours ago that Rod Rosenstein was verbally resigning.I m old enough to remember when Rod Rosenstein was resigning.Are we sure Rod Rosenstein even exists at this pointDo not start a GoFundMe for Rod RosensteinDo not start a GoFundMe for Rod RosensteinDo not start a GoFundMe for Rod RosensteinDo not start a GoFundMe for Rod RosensteinDo not start a GoFundMe for Rod RosensteinDo not start a GoFundMe for Rod RosensteinDo not start a GoFundMSomehow this day is going to end with Rod Rosenstein nominated for SCOTUSRod Rosenstein is denying that he will resign, which means the White House will have to fire him.If this is true, it s great news for all the businesses who get to sell markers and poster boards to all the protesters tonight.If Trump thinks he can divert attention from the Kavanaugh hearing by scheduling a meeting with Rod Rosenstein that same day, he s going to be sorely disappointed when he learns that women can multitask. https://t.co/bRwae6tqCcDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Christine Blasey Ford has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a house party when they were teenagers. The two of them are tentatively scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. On Sunday night, The New Yorker published a piece with allegations by a second woman, Deborah Ramirez, who said Kavanaugh exposed himself to her when they were students at Yale. The Supreme Court nominee has denied both claims.  This alleged behavior would render Judge Kavanaugh unfit for the Supreme Court, or for any court,  said Emily Martin, vice president for education and workplace justice at the National Women s Law Center.Kavanaugh s confirmation is increasingly in doubt, a sharp turn from what initially seemed like a smooth path to the Supreme Court. But even if Kavanaugh doesn t get confirmed to the nation s top court, he will remain a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, an incredibly powerful body that s just a step below the Supreme Court.On Sunday, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) lamented that Kavanaugh s reputation will forever be tarnished, saying it will be very hard for him to return to the D.C. Circuit if he doesn t get onto the Supreme Court. You are taking his career, and the idea that this guy could in fact go back to the court of appeals and continue to serve after this if he were not confirmed, I think is   is really unlikely,  Christie said. But if the allegations are serious enough that they tank Kavanaugh s Supreme Court confirmation, there will be pressure to remove him from his current position as well. If you stand with survivors, the path forward is clear: Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached   not promoted,  said Heidi Hess, co-director of the progressive group Credo Action. Brian Fallon, executive director of the anti-Kavanaugh group Demand Justice, similarly said that Kavanaugh is not fit to hold a judgeship at any level. If and when they regain power, Democrats need to resume the full investigation into Kavanaugh s lying and alleged sexual abuse that Republicans have so far refused to conduct,  he said. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) also said that if the allegations against Kavanaugh are true, the House Judiciary Committee  must open an investigation into these allegations to determine whether Kavanaugh should keep his current job or whether there are grounds for impeachment. The D.C. Circuit judge has also been a lecturer at Harvard Law School since 2005, and a group of students there are calling on the university to reconsider whether he should automatically return in January to teach a class.Kavanaugh issued a statement on Monday denouncing the  smears  he has faced, calling them part of a  grotesque and obvious character assassination.   I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process,  he said.  The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. The last-minute character assassination will not succeed. The chief judge of the D.C. Circuit is Merrick Garland, the man whom President Barack Obama nominated to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and whom Republicans blocked from ever receiving a hearing or a vote.

There is now a frenzy to come up with something   anything   that will block this process and a vote on my confirmation from occurring,  he wrote, alluding to Democrats  demands that a full investigation into the two allegations take place before he and his accusers testify on the events and before they vote on his nomination.  These are smears, pure and simple,  he continued.  And they debase our public discourse. But they are also a threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination   if allowed to succeed   will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service. Kavanaugh stands accused of sexual assault by two women: Christine Blasey Ford, who said she feared Kavanaugh  might inadvertently kill  her as he held her down and groped her during a party when they were both in high school in the early 1980s; and Deborah Ramirez, who came forward Sunday with allegations that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and thrust his penis in her face during a party when they were students at Yale University.Kavanaugh will get a chance to defend himself against the allegations on Thursday during another round of questioning before the Senate committee. The same day Kavanaugh sent the letter, his accusers  supporters engaged in a national walkout, wore black and congregated in public spaces.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Every justice sitting on the Supreme Court attended either Yale s or Harvard s law school. Yale Law School perpetuates a broader power structure in which a small group of the wealthy and well-connected have the power to shape the law in ways that create and exacerbate profound inequities in American society,  Pogin said in a statement.  This is a moment of reckoning for the country as well as for the Yale Law School community, given the disproportionate power this institution holds over the legal profession and how we have collectively chosen to wield it. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that the law school canceled 31 classes to facilitate protests. Faculty members canceled the classes."

Is it really hard to grasp why Dr. Christine Blasey Ford has been reluctant to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and field questions, possibly from an un-elected, outside counsel acting as the GOP s hired gun?One week ago, Ford courageously came forward with allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her at a party in high school.Just as they did with sexual misconduct allegations against Donald Trump and Roy Moore before, the Republican Party has looked the other way, in the process revealing to the American people the extraordinary lengths they will go to suppress the truth and silence women in America. It turns out Republicans were trying to beat the clock as some Senate Republican staffers were reportedly already aware of another allegation of sexual misconduct that occurred during Kavanaugh s college years that became public on Sunday night.The Republican smear machine went into action as conservative conspiracy theorist Ed Whelan began stalking Ford on LinkedIn ñ even before her name became public. Since the only people who knew Ford s identity at that point were The Washington Post and the White House, it s not hard to ascertain who leaked her name to Whelan. If Democrats retake control of Congress in November, there will almost certainly be an investigation into the White House s handling of Kavanaugh s confirmation. Ford has spent the last week being subjected to the same sexist responses from Republican men   including the president   that Anita Hill experienced in 1991.Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who was a part of those proceedings 17 years ago, went on national television and suggested that Ford was  mistaken  and  mixed up.  The idea that a victim of sexual assault would somehow misidentify her attacker reveals the level of ignorance and blatant sexism that exists throughout the Republican Party.From there, a conservative public relations firm with close ties to both the White House and the Senate Judiciary Committee orchestrated a blatant smear campaign against Ford that culminated with Whelan falsely suggesting that someone else had sexually assaulted her.Mike Davis, the Judiciary Committee staffer in charge of nominations for Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), tweeted defiantly,  Unfazed and determined. We will confirm Judge Kavanaugh. #ConfirmKavanaugh #SCOTUS. Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell echoed Davis  tweet in a speech on Friday.  Here s what I want to tell you: In the very near future, Judge Kavanaugh will be on the United States Supreme Court,  he declared.  We re gonna plow right through it and do our job. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), also a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Fox News that he s not  going to ruin Judge Kavanaugh s life over this  and that Ford s testimony in front of the committee wouldn t change anything as far as he was concerned. Amid all of this, a press adviser helping to lead the Senate Judiciary Committee s attacks on Ford had to resign because of previous sexual harassment allegations made against him.So the Republican men who run the Judiciary Committee and the Senate have openly declared that they don t believe her and that nothing she says can change their mind. The last thing Senate Republicans are interested in is the truth. They spent the bulk of the week trying to bully Ford into participating in a sham hearing designed to discredit her and expedite the confirmation of Kavanaugh. If Senate Republicans were serious about sex crimes, they would put the brakes on Thursday s scheduled hearing to hear from Ford and Kavanaugh. And the president would direct the FBI to re-open their background investigation into Kavanaugh. But that s not happening. Instead, the all-male Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are trying to orchestrate this rigged hearing where Ford will be cross-examined on national television by the best litigator taxpayer money can buy. They don t even have the guts to question her themselves. But they have the audacity to question her memory, judgment, character and morality. By their actions, Senate Republicans have revealed their true selves: scared, weak and cowardly old men whose time is almost up.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Sunday released the confidential letter that Christine Blasey Ford sent to Democratic lawmakers accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they both were in high school.The letter, along with a cover letter in which Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) writes that she expects Grassley to maintain confidentiality, was posted on the committee s website. As you know, the letter was given to me in confidence and I am giving it to you with the expectation that you will maintain its confidentiality and that it will not be released publicly or disseminated further, as requested by Dr. Blasey Ford s counsel Debra Katz,  Feinstein wrote in the cover letter. Committee members wrote a separate post on the website: The Committee did not learn of the actual contents of the letter until CNN published a redacted version of the letter on September 17. We do not know who leaked this letter to the press, notwithstanding Dr. Ford s request for confidentiality. Despite revelations of Dr. Ford s identity, the Ranking Member and Dr. Ford s attorneys to date still have not publicly released a copy of the original version of the letter or shared it more broadly than the 21 members and senior staff of the Judiciary Committee. The Chairman has repeatedly called for the public release of this hidden evidence. In the letter, Blasey identifies Mark Judge as the person she says assisted Kavanaugh the assault. His name was redacted from the version made public by CNN.Feinstein has maintained that she did not disclose the letter, dated July 30, when she received it because Blasey had sent it to her in confidence.Grassley also asked lawyers for both Kavanaugh and Blasey to provide  any and all written, audio-visual, or electronic materials  relating to the allegations. He also asked for the results of a polygraph that Blasey said she had taken in August.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

There s a  fairly high level of evidence for this kind of a case  to be published, Farrow said on CNN s  New Day.    Very often there are not people who are willing to speak in these cases,  he explained.  This case, the primary people who are likely to be witnesses are people alleged to have been egging him on and to have been part of this alleged misconduct.  Ramirez s story adds to the uproar surrounding Kavanaugh s nomination since Christine Blasey Ford stepped forward to accuse him of sexually assaulting her when they were high school students. Ramirez said she and Kavanaugh were at a party during the 1983- 84 school year when he put his penis in front of her face and she touched it when she pushed him away.Kavanaugh denied the claim, saying the event  from 35 years ago did not happen.  This is a smear, plain and simple,  Kavanaugh told the publication. He also has steadfastly denied Blasey s story.Farrow, on  Good Morning America,  challenged the claims that people who knew Kavanaugh from his college years dispute his article. Instead, Farrow said Kavanaugh s college pals bolstered the story. The point I want to make here is this: It is not accurate to say those who knew him at the time dispute this,  said Farrow.  We talked to a roommate from the time that was living with him when this alleged incident took place who said he was indeed frequently drunk, that he took part in activity that made him unsurprised by this claim and that he found this woman credible. Farrow also added that he, his co-writer Mayer, and The New Yorker  wouldn t have run this if we didn t have a careful basis of people who had heard at the time and found her credible.

Deborah Ramirez ... wants an FBI investigation. She wants this to proceed carefully,  said Farrow.He added:  She wants to be fair to Brett Kavanaugh. In many statements, she said that to me. Ramirez s story has holes, and she admitted in Farrow s article that she had been drinking heavily at the party and her memory is not clear. Farrow told  New Day  host John Berman that Ramirez s allegation is  a matter of news, whether she tells her own version of the story or not  in front of senators considering Kavanaugh s nomination. That put her in an exceptionally difficult position, and I think the public deserved to hear her version of this story because it will be a source of tremendous conflict on the Hill in the coming days,  the reporter said.  Already, there is a very significant conservative PR apparatus that has been fully directed at her and at this story.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated  Good Morning America  host George Stephanopoulos  last name as Papadopoulos."

According to @RAINN,  calls to the National Sexual Assault Hotline were up 42% on Friday and Saturday compared to an average Friday and Saturday.  The # is 800-656-4673.The reported spike in calls came on the heels of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s accusation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party when the two were teenagers   and the attacks and skepticism she s faced from the White House, top Republican lawmakers and others since she went public with her story. President Donald Trump, who himself has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women, went after Ford on Twitter on Friday, questioning why police hadn t  immediately  been called if the assault had been  as bad as she says. The tweet prompted the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport to go viral as survivors of sexual violence came forward with their own stories.RAINN responded directly to the president with a pointed tweet of its own. In reality, seven out of every 10 victims don t report to the police.On Sunday, a second woman, Deborah Ramirez, came forward to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.The judge has categorically denied both accusations and the White House dismissed Ramirez s allegations as being part of a  coordinated smear campaign.  As The Cut noted, the National Sexual Assault Hotline saw a similar surge in calls in 2016 after Trump s infamous sexual assault remarks made headlines.RAINN told Reuters earlier this year that the Me Too movement had also spurred victims to reach out in record numbers.If you need help, you can call RAINN s National Sexual Assault Hotline at800-656-4673.

I am with him all the way,  Trump said of Kavanaugh, whom he called  an outstanding person  and  a fine man with an unblemished past.  There s a chance that this could be one of the single most unfair, unjust things to happen to a candidate for anything,  he continued, calling Ramirez s claims  highly unsubstantiated. He again questioned why Ramirez and Christine Blasey Ford were coming forward now. For people to come out of the woodwork from 36 years ago, and 30 years ago, and never mention it,  he said.  All of a sudden it happens. The president s comments came after The New Yorker on Sunday evening published a bombshell report detailing new allegations from Ramirez, who alleged that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and thrust his penis in her face at a party while they both attended Yale University in the 1980s. In her account, Ramirez said she was inebriated at the time and that there were large gaps in her memory, but she felt confident enough in her account to urge the FBI to investigate her claims.She said she was hesitant to come forward, afraid she d be attacked for admitting that she had been drinking at the time.In the New Yorker article, Ramirez rebutted claims from classmates that she was  politically motivated  to come forward, saying that she  works toward human rights, social justice, and social change. On Sunday night, Kavanaugh issued a strong denial, saying the event  from 35 years ago did not happen  and calling the allegations a political  smear. The White House also moved to discredit Ramirez shortly after The New Yorker story was published, releasing a lengthy statement in an attempt to turn the woman s words against her.The new claim, however, is sure to add to Kavanaugh s mounting confirmation difficulties following another set of allegations from Christine Blasey Ford, who went public earlier this month with her own claims of sexual assault. In an interview with The Washington Post, Blasey alleged that a  stumbling drunk  Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and attempted to remove her clothes at a party when they were both teenagers in the early 1980s.Kavanaugh also denied those allegations, and both he and Blasey are expected to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday after fierce back and forth negotiations with lawmakers.Blasey s attorneys had also urged the FBI to step in and probe her claims before she made any public appearance in an effort to remove political bias from what s expected to be a closely watched hearing. A research psychologist living in Northern California, Blasey has been subject to several death threats and was forced to leave her home amid widespread attacks on her credibility.This story has been updated with more comments from Trump.Need help?

This may be the first time we ever heard of allegations against someone as a teenager who did not prey upon women thusly as he became powerful,  Conway said during an appearance Monday on  CBS This Morning.  It s when men become powerful and think that they can use women and interrupt their careers if they want to for their own predatory proclivities that then they start preying upon women,  she continued.  The allegations against him are all from when he was a teenager, and then we re supposed to believe he s a judge of a dozen years hiring female law clerks to boot.

Christine Blasey Ford identified herself last Sunday as the woman who sent a confidential letter in late July to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) to express her concern over Kavanaugh s nomination.Blasey alleged Kavanaugh pinned her down and groped her when they were teenagers at a small party in suburban Maryland in the early 1980s.On Sunday, The New Yorker published a report detailing accusations from a second woman, Deborah Ramirez, who claims Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face during a drunken dormitory party when they were undergraduates at Yale University.Michael Avenatti, best known as the attorney for former adult film actress Stormy Daniels, announced Sunday that he is representing a third woman  with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh. But Conway on Monday appeared to throw cold water on the accusations, stating she felt the mounting allegations were  starting to feel like a vast left-wing conspiracy.   She made several eyebrow-raising statements during her CBS appearance, such as claiming some women don t report their sexual assaults because other women  make false accusations.  I can tell you that some women do not come forward because they fear not being believed, and a lot of other women don t come forward because of other women who make false accusations,  Conway said.  So it cuts both ways. But according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, most women who don t report their sexual assault choose not to for fear of retaliation, feel it s a  personal matter  or  not important enough to report,  or believe police would not or could not do anything to help. I just don t think one man s shoulders should bear decades of the Me Too movement,  Conway told CBS.

Ford, a 51-year-old psychology professor, has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers. She claims a  stumbling drunk  Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her, attempted to take off her clothes and clamped his hand over her mouth to silence her.   I thought he might inadvertently kill me,  Ford told The Washington Post last week. She has agreed to testify on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.On Sunday, Ramirez, a 53-year-old former Yale classmate of Kavanaugh s, went public with her own accusation of sexual misconduct. She told The New Yorker that Kavanaugh exposed himself at a college party and thrust his penis in her face, which she said she inadvertently touched while attempting to push him away. Brett was laughing,  Ramirez recalled.  I can still see his face, and his hips coming forward, like when you pull up your pants.  The Trump administration, as well as many leading Republican lawmakers, have cast aspersions at both women and their allegations.The president, who has himself been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women, attacked Ford on Twitter last week.The White House has dismissed Ramirez s allegations as being part of a  coordinated smear campaign.  Kavanaugh has categorically denied both accusations.

Dr. Christine Blasey alleges that 35 years ago, when she was 15 and Kavanaugh 17, he drunkenly attempted to rape her, covering her mouth while she screamed. In response, women are shouting stories of their trauma from digital mountaintops   my Twitter timeline and Facebook newsfeed are filled with women talking about surviving sexual trauma. The hashtag #WhyIDidntReport began trending on Friday morning. If it feels hauntingly familiar, that s because it is. We ve done this already. Almost one year ago, The New York Times published its expose of Harvey Weinstein and the many allegations of sexual assault, harassment and exploitation against him. The New Yorker published another the same week, thus opening the floodgates for what became the Me Too movement. Women   and some similarly brave men   exposed our wounds, ripped off scabs and shared our deepest pain in an effort to change the way women are treated not just at work but at home and out in the world. Some wrote essays, some wrote Facebook posts, some spoke to reporters and some simply tweeted  #MeToo.  The wave of women who came forward as victims of sexual violence or harassment was astonishing and remarkably powerful. Rape culture and sexual harassment were no longer something the public would or could contend with in private   it was in everyone s face, forcing us all to grapple with and confront it. Somehow in that important process, though, surviving sexual violence became a dark take on a pre-existing social media trend, like Sunday brunch or your trip to Iceland: Post about it or it didn t happen. But is that really the system upon which we should rely to solve this problem?It s been one week since Dr. Blasey came forward with her story in The Washington Post. In just seven days, she has been doxxed, hacked, threatened with death and forced to leave her home and separate from her children for their safety. Kavanaugh, on the other hand, has received endless support from President Donald Trump and the entire Republican party. Like the Me Too movement, where a seemingly endless amount of horror stories were mined and shared, many perpetrators have managed to dodge any modicum of accountability for their actions.Harvey Weinstein, who 87 women have accused of sexual harassment or assault, bailed himself out of any criminal punishment. Louis C.K. is a similar case. Allegations of sexual harassment circulated online for years without his victims coming forward for fear of being entirely blacklisted from the industry. When they did finally come forward to The New York Times last October, C.K.   who admitted to forcing women to watch him masturbate and ejaculate   faced minor consequences before making an unannounced comeback last month. His victims finally came forward only for the comedian to walk into a comedy club and receive a standing ovation. Other  victims  of the Me Too movement, as their sympathizers have dubbed them, are also planning their comebacks. It s not that the movement wasn t important or didn t matter   for many survivors, sharing their stories is empowering, and they should continue to do so if it still is. Victims  statements mattered a year ago, like Blasey s do today; everyone who chooses to share their story should be able to do so without the ensuing trauma and harassment. And the intention behind flooding Twitter feeds and Facebook timelines with horror stories is a valid one. But ultimately, support and solidarity with survivors do not have to come at the cost of re-traumatization from sharing your own experience. Donations can be made to the Time s Up legal defense fund; checking on friends and colleagues who you know are survivors is another way to participate, as is calling out men whose behavior falls anywhere on the scale of boorish to predatory. Donating money or time to women s shelters, joining protests and marches, amplifying others  stories through social media, joining grassroots political campaigns and supporting women in office are all ways of contributing to the mission of Me Too without having to insert your own personal story into it.In fact, any pressure to disclose these horror stories should fall squarely on the shoulders of men: men who have perpetuated the crimes, men who have been present as those crimes happened and didn t do anything to stop them (ahem, Mark Judge), and men who didn t engage in predatory rhetoric but laughed along with it (ahem, Billy Bush). These are the perpetrators of a cruel system. It should be on them to repair it.Jenavieve Hatch is a politics reporter at HuffPost.Need help?

In the article, Ramirez alleged that Kavanaugh exposed himself at a party when they were both attending Yale University in the early 1980s, thrusting his penis in her face and forcing her to touch it to get away from him.The Trump administration wasted little time in beginning a campaign to discredit her claims:New: White House just sent out a statement reprinting every line in the @NewYorker that could be seen as weakening Debbie Ramirez s allegation, that Brett Kavanaugh aggressively exposed himself to her at a party during their freshman year at Yale. pic.twitter.com/TP7D2WCSRGUnder the subject line:  What You Need To Know About The Allegations Made In The New Yorker,  the administration s bullet-pointed list focused on Ramirez s admissions of drunkenness and her reluctance to speak about the alleged assault.However, the statement failed to include other details from Ramirez  account, including her claim that she remembered Kavanaugh standing next to her, laughing and pulling up his pants while another person at the party yelled:  Brett Kavanaugh just put his penis in Debbie s face.  Several of her classmates from the 1983-84 school year also said they had been told about the incident in vague terms when it happened, per The New Yorker.Ramirez said she was hesitant to come forward with her allegations in light of the political and threatening attacks on sexual assault accuser Christine Blasey Ford. She repeatedly admitted that she was inebriated at the time of the incident and said that there were gaps in her memory. However, Ramirez also expressed confidence in her recollection and urged the FBI to investigate the claims.Trump s Supreme Court nominee has denied the allegations, calling them an attempted  smear, plain and simple.  This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,  Kavanaugh said of the Ramirez claim.  The people who knew me then know this did not happen, and have said so. The New Yorker was unable to independently verify if the gathering where the alleged assault took place actually happened. On Sunday, The New York Times said it had been chasing the story for a week but was unable to confirm its authenticity.Statistics demonstrate that many victims do not come forward after experiencing sexual violence. Department of Justice figures show that nearly two-thirds of people who are sexually assaulted don t go to the police.Blasey, who went public with her own allegations against Kavanaugh earlier this month, expressed her hesitation to do so. She said she was worried the publicity would be detrimental to her family. Those fears have proven true, and she was forced to leave her home amid death threats.Blasey is slated to testify about her experience before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, has called for the hearing to be canceled.Trump has stood by Kavanaugh in recent days, though he has remained relatively silent throughout the mounting scandal. At a rally on Thursday, he praised his nominee as a  great gentleman  and questioned why Blasey took decades to come forward with her allegations.

I also ask that the newest allegations of sexual misconduct be referred to the FBI for investigation, and that you join our request for the White House to direct the FBI to investigate the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford as well as these new claims. In her interview with The New Yorker, Ramirez said she  would think an F.B.I. investigation would be warranted.  Other Democratic senators   including Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.)   echoed Feinstein s calls for an FBI investigation. Merkley tweeted that the Ramirez accusations  presents a pattern of conduct  that makes it  absolutely clear  that Kavanaugh is  entirely unsuited to serve on the Supreme Court. The additional information provided by Ms. Ramirez regarding Kavanaugh s behavior in college presents a pattern of conduct that makes it absolutely clear that he is entirely unsuited to serve on the Supreme Court.

Instead, he suggested she may have been attacked by a classmate of Kavanaugh s who looked very much like him. Whelan named the man and posted a photo of him in his tweet thread.Realizing too late that he had linked the man to a crime, he apologized profusely on Friday, calling it an  appalling and inexcusable mistake of judgment,  and deleted the tweets.Whelan, a friend of Kavanaugh s, offered to resign from the Ethics and Public Policy Center during a  telephonic meeting  Friday, according to a statement from the organization s board.The board refused to accept his resignation, and Whelan is instead taking a leave of absence. But the board will  meet in a month to review the situation,  according to its statement. Edward Whelan, who has led EPPC with integrity and excellence for many years, offered his resignation in light of what he described as an  appalling and inexcusable  error in posting online a series of comments that he has now deleted and for which he promptly publicly apologized,  said the board s statement.After deliberation, the board  declined to accept Mr. Whelan s resignation, but determined that he will take a leave of absence. I made an appalling and inexcusable mistake of judgment in posting the tweet thread in a way that identified Kavanaugh s Georgetown Prep classmate. I take full responsibility for that mistake, and I deeply apologize for it. I realize that does not undo the mistake.After Whelan posted his theory, Blasey told The Washington Post that she knew both Kavanaugh and the man Whelan named when they were teenagers, and  socialized with them. There is zero chance that I would confuse them,  she added.A Wall Street Journal editorial last week also mentioned the possibility of mistaken identity in Blasey s accusation, though it didn t name anyone. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who believes Kavanaugh s denial that an attack took place, also said:  Clearly, somebody s mixed up. Whelan, who has advised on Kavanaugh s confirmation process, is friends with Leonard Leo, the president of the Federalist Society, which has played a key role in developing conservative judicial nominations, including Kavanaugh s.Blasey is planning to testify about her encounter with Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Ramirez said the group was playing a drinking game and she became inebriated. Later in the evening she was on the floor and remembered a  penis being in front  of her face before she pushed the person away, causing her to touch it. She said she recalled Kavanaugh standing next to her, laughing and pulling up his pants. Another student then yelled down the hall:  Brett Kavanaugh just put his penis in Debbie s face. She noted that there are large gaps in her memory and said she was hesitant to come forward, afraid that she would be attacked because she had been drinking at the time. But Ramirez said her experience, along with that of Christine Blasey Ford, would warrant an FBI investigation into the nominee s behavior.Kavanaugh denied the claims in a statement to the outlet, saying the event  from 35 years ago did not happen. The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple. White House spokesperson Kerri Kupec rejected Ramirez s allegations, telling The New Yorker they are the latest in a  coordinated smear campaign.  A spokesperson for The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost s request for comment on Sunday evening.The New Yorker said it was unable to independently confirm if Kavanaugh was at the party, but interviewed several of Ramirez s classmates who recalled being told about the incident in vague terms within days of it allegedly happening. Several others disputed the claims, saying the behavior was  completely out of character for Brett. The outlet also noted that senior Republican aides learned of Ramirez s claims last week, telling the outlet that they worried about its impact on the Kavanaugh s nomination. Shortly thereafter, some GOP Senators publicly expressed their desire to quickly move forward on the nomination.In a subsequent statement Sunday evening, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said the committee s majority staff learned about the new allegations from the New Yorker report. He said that Senate Democrats had  actively withheld information from the rest of the Committee only to drop information at politically opportune moments. The Ramirez claims are the latest in a whirlwind week of allegations against the Supreme Court s nominee.Blasey, a psychologist working in Northern California, has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a party in the 1980s when they were both in high school. In an interview with The Washington Post, Blasey said a  stumbling drunk  Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and attempted to take off her clothing before she was able to escape.Kavanaugh has roundly denied the allegations.Blasey s legal team said Sunday that she had agreed to speak with the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday after days of heated negotiations. Despite actual threats to her safety and her life, Dr. Ford believes it is important for Senators to hear directly from her about the sexual assault committed against her,  her attorneys said in a statement.The New Yorker piece also included serious allegations against Mark Judge, a classmate of Kavanaugh s who came to the nominee s defense after Blasey first went public with her own allegations. Elizabeth Rasor, a former girlfriend of Judge s, said that the man was lying when he claimed that there was no  horseplay  culture at Georgetown Prep, the high school both Judge and Kavanaugh attended.Rasor claimed that at one point during her three-year relationship with Judge, he told her of an incident where he and others had sex with an inebriated woman. His lawyer said Judge  categorically denies  the allegations.Judge has refused to testify at any Senate hearing, although some have been urging the committee to issue a subpoena.Michael Avenatti, the lawyer who represents the adult film star Stormy Daniels and is a vocal critic of the Trump administration, leveled his own accusations at Kavanaugh in a tweet late Sunday showing what appeared to be a screenshot of an email he sent to the chief counsel for nominations to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the email, the lawyer said that he claimed to have  significant evidence  that Kavanaugh and a friend from high school, Mark Judge, participated in  targeting  women at house parties with  alcohol/drugs. Avenatti did not specify the nature of Kavanaugh s involvement or cite evidence for these assertions in his tweet, but said he would be releasing evidence to both the public and lawmakers  in the coming days.  HuffPost also reached out to the White House about Avenatti s claims.Trump has supported his nominee throughout the allegations, and used a rally in Las Vegas on Thursday to praise Kavanaugh as a  great gentleman  he called  one of the finest human beings you will ever have the privilege of knowing.  He also roundly attacked Blasey, questioning why she didn t step forward with her claims earlier.Nearly two-thirds of people who are raped or sexually assaulted do not go to the police at all, according to U.S. Department of Justice figures.This article has been updated to include Michael Avenatti s accusations and a statment from Sen.

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) said Friday that he can t be sure there won t be additional abuse allegations brought against him, more than a month after his former girlfriend publicly accused him of domestic abuse.Ellison, the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has denied Karen Monahan s allegations accusing him of repeated verbal abuse, and at least one instance of physical abuse, during their yearslong relationship.Monahan wasn t the first woman to accuse Ellison of abusive behavior. In 2006, Amy Alexander wrote a piece in The Wright County Republican claiming he  berated  and  pushed  her during their on-and-off relationship between 1993 and 2005. Ellison has denied Alexander s allegations as well.During a televised debate Friday against his Republican opponent in the Minnesota attorney general s race, Ellison hesitated when asked about the potential for future abuse allegations against him.

In one instance, she said he dragged her off a bed by her legs and told her to  get the fuck out  of his house.Ellison said Friday that there was an ongoing, independent investigation into the allegations, but wasn t sure when it would be completed when asked if its findings would be released before the midterm elections in November.Doug Wardlow, Ellison s Republican challenger in the Minnesota attorney general s race, attacked the credibility of any such investigation.

It took me years after my assault to voice the experience to my closest friends,  Milano wrote.  It took me three decades to tell my parents that the assault had even happened. I never filed a police report. I never told officials. I never tried to find justice for my pain because justice was never an option. She continued:  For me, speaking up meant reliving one of the worst moments of my life. It meant recognizing my attacker s existence when I wanted nothing more than to forget that he was allowed to walk on this Earth at all. This is what every survivor goes through. Blasey has alleged Kavanaugh pinned her down and groped her at a small party in suburban Maryland when they were both high school students. Blasey, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in Northern California, has received death threats for coming forward in recent weeks, according to her legal team. Telling our stories means being vulnerable to public attacks and ridicule when our only  crime  was to be assaulted in the first place,  Milano wrote.Milano s essay expanded on a series of tweets she posted over the weekend as sexual assault survivors used the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport to share their heart-wrenching stories of abuse.Hey, @realDonaldTrump, Listen the fuck up.

Steve King (R-Iowa) on Saturday went after Christine Blasey Ford s sexual assault accusation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, calling her story an attempt at  character assassination.  The Republican lawmaker said Blasey s allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers wasn t credible because she couldn t remember all the details 35 years later, the Des Moines Register reported. I m thinking, is there any man in this room that wouldn t be subjected to such an allegation? A false allegation?  King said at an Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition event on Saturday.  How can you disprove something like that? Which means, if that s the new standard, no man will ever qualify for the Supreme Court again. King s remarks echo President Donald Trump s skepticism of the allegations. In a pair of tweets, the president questioned why Blasey didn t immediately tell law enforcement officials that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her.Trump s tweets propagate the misguided notion that victims of sexual assault will typically respond by calling the police. In fact, nearly two-thirds of women who are raped or sexually assaulted don t contact law enforcement. In a Washington Post op-ed published Friday, Patti Davis, a daughter of President Ronald Reagan, explained why she too didn t tell anyone she was raped until decades later. It doesn t surprise me one bit that for more than 30 years, Christine Blasey Ford didn t talk about the assault she remembers,  Davis wrote in the Post. Your memory snaps photos of the details that will haunt you forever, that will change your life and live under your skin,  she added.

President Donald Trump s evangelical base seems to have a particularly hard time with this. Amid allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford several decades ago, it has become clear that prominent evangelical leaders will do whatever it takes to trivialize such an incident in the name of political and patriarchal power. Franklin Graham, son of the late evangelical leader Billy Graham, said publicly that whether or not Kavanaugh is a rapist is  irrelevant  to the nomination because  they were teenagers  and it shouldn t be held against him.This is not the first time the younger Graham has publicly endorsed and defended someone accused of or found guilty of sexual assault. His endorsement and defense of Alabama Republican Roy Moore, a man accused of sexual misconduct by several women, solidifies a pattern of Graham endorsing public officials who move forward his political agendas.Graham s notion that someone s age mitigates sexual assault or that the trauma of an assault has a time limit reflects the double standard that evangelical churches operate with: Teenagers (and all unmarried women, really) shouldn t be having sex, and if they do, they deserve whatever harm or stigma comes their way.Graham s own denomination created  True Love Waits,  an abstinence-only Christian education platform that promotes sexual purity outside of marriage, yet he has no purity notions when it comes to the candidates he supports.The church loves to talk about sexual purity, but cannot take responsibility for sexual assault within its community. This double standard only serves to reinforce patriarchal power by protecting men as impulsive beings just doing whatever comes naturally to them while characterizing the women they victimize as beguiling, lustful sinners. This is not new, and the Bible has plenty of stories, including the resurrection of Jesus himself, where a woman s perspective is called in  idle tale.  In scripture, women are either unbelieved truth tellers or have completely unrecorded perspectives in narratives that are full of sexual violence perpetrated by men. It isn t surprising, then, that Christians like Graham and the religious right would have a problem decrying sexual violence when the men they worship in scripture either perpetrate violence, disregard it or cover it up (all of which King David himself does   so much for a man after God s own heart). If Christians do not look to Jesus and his treatment, inclusion and defense of women, they will always land in patriarchy devoid of women s voices and perspectives. This is rape culture in action: silencing women to protect and empower men. It is birthed in many Christian churches and spaces and has made its way to politics as evangelicals make their allegiances to problematic men.  Since the allegation against Kavanaugh, other prominent leaders, including Trump, have responded with predictably dismissive and problematic statements that both uphold this patriarchy and purity culture. Trump tweeted that if the attack  was as bad as [Blasey] says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities.  He sets up a strongman argument in a patriarchal culture implying that severity and quickness to report are correlated while reinforcing the victim-blaming and shaming that prevents women from coming forward to begin with.  The pattern is clear in politics and in the church: Men in power are protected, women are disbelieved and accused of falsehood and promiscuity. Grace and mercy are given to men while suspicion and questions are assigned to women, who are statistically and overwhelmingly honest in their reporting of sexual assault.  For a community so set on inviting and talking about good news, the church continues to create contexts where there is little to no good news for survivors of sexual trauma. The church would rather blame the  world  or the  culture  of hypersexualization, pornography, media, or rap music rather than blaming the real problem: men who rape and churches that protect them. For people intent on being the  light of the world,  it is true that the church, through patriarchy, spreads their dark and problematic ideologies through endorsing politicians accused of sexual assault as long they carry their agendas.At the end of the day, the church can t be a safe place for women if it cannot put its politics aside long enough to see the impact of endorsing such men. It must take claims of sexual assault seriously, dismantle gaslighting structures and practices in their congregations and promote (when making political endorsements) candidates whose practices and crimes do not communicate to women that they are disposable objects. The evangelical movement must develop a default posture of believing women. It cannot consistently and unabashedly endorse, protect and elevate sexual abusers   and thus sexual abuse in its own ranks. If evangelicals will protect politicians they do not know, they will almost certainly protect those men in power in their midst.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Sunday continued to voice skepticism about Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. During an interview on  Fox News Sunday,  the Senate Judiciary Committee member said he needed more evidence to believe Blasey s allegation that Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and groped her during a high school party in the 1980s. What do you expect me to do? What am I supposed to do? Go ahead and ruin this guy s life? I don t know when it happened, I don t where it happened, and everybody being named in regard to being there said it didn t happen,  Graham said when asked if he s keeping an open mind about Kavanaugh s nomination. Unless there s something more, no, I m not going to ruin Judge Kavanaugh s life over this,  the South Carolina Republican added.  But she should come forward, she should have her say, she will be respectfully treated. After days of negotiations and uncertainty, the Senate Judiciary Committee and Blasey s attorneys on Saturday reached a tentative agreement for the California psychology professor to publicly testify at a hearing on Thursday. The committee s staff is expected to continue negotiating details of the hearing with Blasey s legal team on Sunday. Republicans, however, have so far resisted her demands to allow the questioning of additional alleged witnesses at the hearing.Four people Blasey initially cited to have attended the party in question have issued statements saying they don t have any recollection of the alleged incident. On Saturday, a lawyer for a longtime friend of Blasey s named Leland Keyser said she  does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present. Before she went public with her allegation, however, Blasey told The Washington Post she did not think Keyser would remember the party because nothing remarkable had happened there, as far as Keyser was aware. It s no surprise, if another person was   in the house that night and had no occurrence like the one that was stated by Dr. Ford, there s no reason why they wouldn t even remember that party scene 36 years ago,  Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Sunday on ABC s  This Week. Mark Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh s who Blasey said was also in the room when the alleged incident took place, also said he had  no memory  of it.Democrats said that dismissive statements like the one from Graham on Sunday illustrated the need for an FBI investigation into the alleged incident. That s the way the Senate Republicans have set this up: Do you believe her or do you believe him? That is exactly why we ve been pressing for an FBI investigation,  Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said Sunday on NBC s  Meet the Press. The Washington senator noted that the Senate Judiciary Committee allowed additional witnesses and an FBI investigation during the 1991 hearing focusing on Anita Hill s accusations of sexual harassment by then-nominee Clarence Thomas, who now sits on the Supreme Court. The Senate Republicans have predetermined the outcome ... that this will be a he said, she says, by taking that away,  Murray added.Last week, Graham suggested proceeding to a vote on Kavanaugh s nomination  as soon as possible  because a longer process would be  not about finding the truth, but delaying the process till after the midterm elections. As of now, Republicans are still planning on holding a committee vote to send the nomination to the full Senate later this month.This story has been updated with comments from Sen.

Haley, appointed to her post by Trump, was asked on CNN s  State of the Union  whether she was  comfortable  with the president s comments. The message I m comfortable with is that accusers go through a lot of trauma and some handle it one way and some handle it the other way,  Haley told host Jake Tapper.  Regardless, you never   it s not something that we want to do, to blame the accuser or try to second guess the accuser. She continued:  We don t know the situation she was going through 35 years ago. We don t know the circumstances. ... What I ve said often is she deserves respect. She deserves to be heard. Kavanaugh, who has been accused, deserves to be heard.

Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) to express her concern over Kavanaugh s nomination. She has alleged Kavanaugh pinned her down, groped her and covered her mouth with his hand when they were teenagers at a small party in suburban Maryland.Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, said on CNN that Judiciary Committee members have  a huge responsibility  to make sure their consideration of Blasey s accusations is  fair.  They have to take the politics out  of their examination of the allegation, she said.

A number of important procedural and logistical issues remain unresolved, although they will not impede the hearing taking place.  pic.twitter.com/Od76mL8senThe announcement comes less than a day after a tentative agreement was reportedly reached during a short call late Saturday between Blasey s attorneys and the committee s chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), according to reports from The New York Times, Politico and The Daily Beast.Blasey, a 51-year-old psychologist in Northern California, has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers.Since she publicly identified herself as the accuser last weekend, her lawyers have been embroiled in intense back-and-forth negotiations to set a hearing that Blasey would be comfortable with. Earlier Saturday, Blasey accepted the Senate Judiciary Committee s invitation to provide  first-hand knowledge  of Kavanaugh s alleged sexual misconduct  next week. In the past week since Blasey s allegations went public, she and her family have become the target of death threats and  vicious harassment,  according to her lawyers. Attorney Debra Katz said on Friday that Blasey had to meet with the FBI because of the threats.Blasey s legal team on Friday requested that the committee follow several conditions for Blasey to attend the hearing, including having only one camera in the room, asking Kavanaugh to testify first, barring outside counsel from questioning Blasey, bringing in other potential witnesses   such as Mark Judge   to testify and holding the hearing on Wednesday.Blasey s legal team said Sunday that Blasey agreed to testify despite the committee s refusal to subpoena Judge and invite other witnesses  who are essential for a fair hearing that arrives at the truth about the sexual assault. Several issues surrounding the hearing remain unresolved, but will not affect her decision to testify, Blasey s attorneys said in their statement Sunday. Kavanaugh will appear again before the committee following Blasey s testimony, the Senate Judiciary Committee announced Sunday.It s official: Senate Judiciary Chairman @ChuckGrassley announces that Dr. Ford will testify Thursday 9/27 at 10a.

They also gave Blasey a 10 p.m. deadline for an answer, giving Blasey less than a day to think it over. Then, in response to a scathing email accusing Republicans of bullying a sexual assault victim, Grassley granted Katz s late-night request to extend the deadline one more day.Kavanaugh previously sent a letter to Grassley accepting the invitation to testify on Monday, a date previously set by committee Republicans.

Tell me, what boy hasn t done this in high school?  she asked on camera on CNN.Sosa made the startling comment in a story Thursday on reactions from a group of five Republican women in Florida on Christine Blasey Ford s allegation against Kavanaugh.Blasey has said that Kavanaugh shoved her into a bedroom at a house party when they were both in high school, locked the door, pinned her to the bed, groped her, pulled at her clothing and put his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. She said she managed to escape when a second teen in the room jumped on top of them. We re talking about a 17-year-old boy in high school, with testosterone running high,  said Sosa.  Tell me, what boy hasn t done this in high school? Please, I would like to know.  Sosa lost the Florida GOP primary for the 27th congressional district last month with less than 2 percent of the vote.All five women in the group said they believed Kavanaugh s denial that the alleged attack occurred.GOP voter Irina Villarino said that even if an assault had occurred, it was no big deal.  In the grand scheme of things, my goodness, there was no intercourse,  she said.  There was maybe a touch. Really? Thirty-six years later she s still stuck on that?  Republican Lourdes de Castillo de la PeÒa, who hosted a $1,000-a-plate fundraiser last year for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), insisted Kavanaugh  has an impeccable reputation.  She added:  I have no sympathy  for Blasey.  Perhaps maybe at that moment she liked him and maybe he didn t pay attention to her afterward ... and she got bitter.  Twitter went crazy.Please tell me they re not raising sons.Or daughters.They can have plants, but that s it.God help any girl that ends up at a party with one of their precious boys.I would consider myself a complete failure as a parent if my son even had a passing thought that this would be acceptable behavior.I will never understand how people stay so enthusiastically misinformed.I didn t force myself on any women in high school.

There is a big difference between a boy being a boy  And putting your hand over a girls mouth and turning the music up so no one can hear her scream.Indeed, figure your shit out #GOP women.Jesus.

Kavanaugh, himself a Yale graduate, currently stands accused of sexually assaulting California professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers in the 1980s.   Everything that is being said about the advice I give to students applying to Brett Kavanaugh   or any judge   is outrageous, 100% false, and the exact opposite of everything I have stood for and said for the last fifteen years,  Chua said.She insisted in the statement that she always encouraged students to dress professionally, not casually, for interviews with any federal judge.  Yet a woman who recently graduated from Yale Law School and received advice from Chua on interviewing for a coveted clerkship position with Kavanaugh, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, disputed the professor s statement.  She s lying,  the woman told HuffPost.The professor specifically told her not to wear a suit when she met Kavanaugh, the woman said, requesting anonymity for fear of career reprisals.The woman spoke with a friend the following day about other advice Chua gave her, according to a text transcript viewed by HuffPost.Chua asked the woman if she came from a low-income or disadvantaged background, claiming this would make a good  sob story  to appeal to Kavanaugh, according to the transcript. At his confirmation hearings earlier this month, character witnesses chosen by Republicans repeatedly praised Kavanaugh for the diversity of his law clerks over the years.Chua had also mentioned that another woman whom she d helped nab a clerkship with Kavanaugh had a  bossy  personality, the woman told her friend via text.A former Yale student previously told HuffPost that the professor specifically told her to behave and dress in an  outgoing  way. Meanwhile, Chua s husband, Yale law professor Jed Rubenfeld, advised the woman that Kavanaugh preferred female clerks with a  certain look. An unnamed Yale student also told The Guardian that Chua said it was  not an accident  Kavanaugh s clerks  looked like models.  The comment echoes those given to HuffPost from three students who had drinks with Chua last year. I personally heard her state that it s not an accident that all his clerks look like models,  a current Yale Law student told HuffPost on Saturday.  So I personally know that for her to say the allegations are 100 percent false is a lie, because at least that one is definitely true. Outside Yale, Chua is best known as the self-described  Tiger Mom  for her 2011 book The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.In her message to the Yale Law community, Chua said she tells students to dress professionally and  prep insanely hard  because  substance is the most important thing.  She continued:I advise them to read every opinion, including dissents, the judge has ever written as well as important recent cases from the circuit and Supreme Court. I tell them to review all the black-letter courses they ve taken and to be prepared to answer hard questions about their writing sample. I tell them to be courteous to everyone, including the staff and clerks. I advise students, male and female, to dress professionally   not too casually   and to avoid inappropriate clothing. I remind them that they are interviewing with a member of the judiciary. I always try my best to be frank and transparent, and to hold students to the highest professional standard, and every year for the last decade I have been invited by affinity groups like Yale Law Women, the Black Law Students Association, and Outlaws to host clerkship advice sessions. My record as a clerkship mentor, especially for women and minorities, is among the things I m most proud of in my life.The Chua story and Blasey s accusation against Kavanaugh has stoked outrage in the world of Ivy League law, as previously reported by HuffPost. A growing number of students are criticizing Yale leadership for issuing a statement in support of Kavanaugh s nomination in July and for staying silent on Blasey s accusation. Students at a school event on Thursday confronted faculty over HuffPost s story and subsequent reporting from The Guardian. Particularly galling to students is the idea that Yale might have known about the sexual misconduct of one federal judge, Alex Kozinski   a popular judge for Yale students to clerk with, as well as Kavanaugh s mentor. He resigned last year from his position on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit after a wave of harassment allegations.In Rubenfeld s conversation with the former Yale student, the professor told her that Kozinski was a known sexual harasser, HuffPost reported. Students feel pretty deeply betrayed by professors being aware of allegations for years against federal judges, but continuing to funnel students to them,  third-year student Catherine McCarthy told HuffPost on Friday.Multiple attendees said professors responded in part by pinning the responsibility for vetting judges on the students, not the professors who advise them.Doug Kysar, deputy dean of Yale Law School, sparked criticism this week for telling students that he knew of Kozinski s behavior since 1998, which many students took as a reference to sexual harassment. Kysar then clarified that he only meant that Kozinski  seemed like an asshole,  and was not aware of the sexual harassment until last year. Given what I did know, do I wish I had done more? Yes,  he said.  I always wish I had done more. Students hung protest signs this week on Yale s campus. One read:  DO MORE NOW! Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). Attorneys for Blasey have been sparring with committee Republicans over conditions for her testimony all week, accusing Grassley and his colleagues of bullying their client by setting  arbitrary  deadlines. The attorneys  letter does not make clear whether Blasey plans to testify about Kavanaugh in an open hearing or would prefer to provide information in some other way.  Dr. Ford accepts the Committee s request to provide her first-hand knowledge of Brett Kavanaugh s sexual misconduct next week,  reads the letter by attorneys Debra Katz and Lisa Banks.It continues:  Although many aspects of the proposal you provided via email, on September 21, 2018, at 2:33 p.m., are fundamentally inconsistent with the Committee s promise of a fair, impartial investigation into her allegations, and we are disappointed with the leaks and the bullying that have tainted the process, we are hopeful that we can reach agreement on details. A White House official told CNN that Kavanaugh s team does not consider Blasey s attorneys  response to be a  yes,  however, pointing to the request for further talks. Grassley initially asked Blasey to appear before the committee on Monday, Sept. 24. Katz told the committee that plan was  not possible,  citing the death threats her client has received. (Blasey and her family had to move after her name became public.)Democrats have maintained that the accusation should be investigated by the FBI. Earlier reporting had suggested they were largely sitting out these negotiations.Blasey described the harrowing incident in a bombshell interview with The Washington Post last weekend. Kavanaugh, she said, pinned her down to a bed while he groped her and attempted to remove her clothing. When she tried to scream, Blasey said, Kavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand.  I thought he might inadvertently kill me,  she told the Post. The Supreme Court nominee has categorically denied the accusation.Blasey said she escaped Kavanaugh when his friend Mark Judge jumped on top of them. Both boys attended the all-male Georgetown Preparatory School, while Blasey attended the nearby all-female Holton-Arms School. Although Kavanaugh has agreed to defend himself against the disturbing accusation, Judge has declined, stating that he has no memory of the incident Blasey described.Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have criticized the GOP plan to hear testimony from only Blasey and Kavanaugh, saying that Judge should be compelled to testify as well.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

In fact, that sentiment was on frequent display from the moment his nomination was first announced, one headline at USA Today blaring,  Don t sacrifice Democrats  Senate seats in a futile fight against Kavanaugh confirmation. Despite the fact that there were signs pointing to hope   Kavanaugh was among the most unpopular judges ever nominated and he had ties to a judge with sexual harassment in his background   the punditry remained dismissive of the value of a fight. Thankfully, a segment of progressive activists were undeterred.Rather, the grassroots fought even harder and have even developed new activism techniques like the  Be A Hero  campaign s strategy of raising money for an eventual opponent to Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) if she votes for Kavanaugh. That fund, along with the support of other groups like Maine People s Alliance and Mainers for Accountable Leadership, has now raised more than Collin s current cash on hand, piercing the facade, common among pundits, that her re-election was certain.The Pledge Against Collins campaign is a tactical innovation worthy of note. With the Senate elected to staggered six-year terms, activists have long struggled with the fact that senators often make pivotal decisions when they are years away from being held accountable at the polls. But this sort of campaign erases that timeline, allowing citizens to instantly make a pledge to hold that elected official responsible for their actions. It s also a tactic that s both effective and consistent with the progressive value of small-donor democracy.According to analysis from my think tank, Data for Progress, women have disproportionately funded the anti-Collins campaign. Marie Follayttar, Executive Director of Mainers for Accountable Leadership, which partnered with Maine People s Alliance to build the strategy, tells me,  We re showing how small donor democracy can compete with big money. Politicians spend hours dialing for dollars and hearing their donors. Now they have to listen to us. Ady Barkan, founder of the Be A Hero Campaign, a project backed by the Center for Popular Democracy Action, tells me,  For me, this fight is personal. Collins took $5 million from PACs and the Koch Brothers, in exchange, she voted to cut their taxes and take health care away from people like me. We re doing what millionaires and billionaires do every day behind closed doors except with 50,000 people we re doing it out in the open. The all-out strategy has been working, and the blitz against Kavanaugh on ethics, corporate power and reproductive rights has made him toxic, even in deep Republican states. Polling fielded before Christine Blasey s sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh came to light showed only 38 percent support for his confirmation. The Navigator completed other polling before the sexual assault allegations were public and found Kavanaugh s unfavorable rating to be minus-10 (26 percent favorable, 36 percent unfavorable). Polling by YouGov Blue and Demand Justice provided to me suggested that, even in deep red states, Kavanaugh s favorability was weak before the sexual assault allegations. In none of the five states examined   West Virginia, Indiana, North Dakota, Missouri and Florida   did a majority of individuals support his confirmation.Demand Justice polling also found that likely voters overwhelmingly favor a slower process. The survey asked respondents two questions: one queried voters whether the nomination should be slowed after Michael Cohen s convictions and another asked whether it should be slowed until the National Archives could provide all available documents in October. In both cases, likely voters supported a slower process, with net support in double digits for all states analyzed.The campaign has also substantially weakened Collins. Recent polling from Public Policy Polling puts Collins  approval underwater (35 percent approve, 48 percent disapprove) and finds that 48 percent of Mainers are opposed to confirming Kavanaugh. Even more importantly, the polling finds that 53 percent of Mainers say that Collins  handling of the Kavanaugh nomination has made them view her less favorably, while only 19 percent view her more favorably. Last year, the same pollster found her at 59 percent approval and 34 percent disapproval. Just this week, Wall Street Journal polling suggests that support for Kavanaugh s nomination has slipped dramatically, with 38 percent of registered voters opposing his nomination, a surge from 29 percent opposed a month ago (only 34 percent support him, with the remaining 28 percent undecided). Among women, 28 percent favor the nomination and 42 percent oppose.Brian Fallon, executive director of Demand Justice spoke to me about the Be A Hero campaign.  At the start, Susan Collins was openly bragging that she was not seeing much grassroots opposition to him in Maine,  he said.  This effort helped turn the tide. It has been a thermometer that has displayed, in real time, the heat that has been turned up on Collins. For the first time perhaps in her entire Senate career, people sense she would really be vulnerable in two years. Neither Kavanaugh s nomination nor Collin s re-election, should she vote for him, are now assured. Much of the credit for that lies with the grassroots progressives who fought Kavanaugh when no one thought he could be beaten.Sean McElwee is a writer and researcher based in New York City and a co-founder of Data for Progress.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), after a woman came forward to accuse President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault in the 1980s. According to NBC News, a female Republican staffer working for the North Carolina General Assembly said Ventry sexually harassed her in 2017 when Ventry was working for North Carolina House Majority Leader John Bell. Sources told the outlet that he was dismissed over that incident and because parts of his resume were found to be embellished. Ventry denies the harassment accusation. He submitted his resignation Friday night, he told The Washington Post.Taylor Foy, a Senate Judiciary Committee spokesman, said in a statement that Ventry simply resigned  to avoid causing any distraction from the work of the committee.  He had been brought on temporarily to assist the committee with Kavanaugh s confirmation, a committee spokesperson told the Post. The now-former adviser appeared on Fox News this week to defend Grassley s response to the allegation against Kavanaugh. The Senate Judiciary Committee is currently negotiating with lawyers for Christine Blasey, the California professor who says the nominee once pinned her on a bed and covered her mouth to muffle her screams.

Whelan shared the theory   which involved a Kavanaugh doppelg‰nger   over Twitter and was immediately met with criticism and mockery.While both Politico and NBC News reported that Ventry once worked at CRC, neither could confirm whether he is still employed there.

Beto O Rourke, the Texas Democrat hoping to replace Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in the U.S. Senate, believes unarmed black Americans shouldn t be killed by police in their own home.Cruz apparently disagrees.Prior to the two candidates  debate Friday night in Dallas, Cruz took to Twitter to attack his opponent. But it seemed like more of an endorsement. In Beto O Rourke s own words,  the Republican candidate tweeted, with a video of O Rourke speaking at a church about yet another unarmed black American being killed by a white police officer.In Beto O Rourke s own words #TXSenateDebate pic.twitter.com/uUzW7DSqgo How can it be in this day and age, in this very year, in this community, that a young man, African-American, in his own apartment, is shot and killed by a police officer?  O Rourke said in the video.  And when we all want justice and the facts and the information to make an informed decision, what is released to the public? That he had a small amount of marijuana in his kitchen. O Rourke was referring to the recent killing of Botham Shem Jean, a black Texan who was killed in his own home Sept. 6 by officer Amber Guyger, who claimed she thought she was in her own home when she fatally shot the unarmed man twice.Just hours after the killing, police obtained a search warrant and later released what they found to local news: marijuana.  They immediately began to smear him,  attorney Lee Merritt, who represents Jean s family, told The Associated Press. How can that be just in this country?  O Rourke asked the congregation in the video posted by Cruz.  How can we continue to lose the lives of unarmed black men in the United States of America at the hands of white police officers? That is not justice. That is not us. That can and must change. Are you with me on this? The crowd can be seen cheering for the nominee.

And that s not good for Joe Biden, who s thinking of running for president in 2020.  This is going to educate who is under the age of 35 and may not have grown up knowing Joe Biden s role in all of this,  said a Democratic strategist who requested anonymity to speak candidly. It s been 27 years since the law professor electrified the nation with her testimony about the sexual harassment she faced from Clarence Thomas, who was then up for confirmation to the Supreme Court. That hearing was widely considered a disaster, a textbook case of how not to treat a woman who comes forward. Republican senators went after Hill and tried to make her seem like a liar, a mentally ill person and a spiteful jilted lover. But Democrats held the majority at the time, and Biden, then a senator from Delaware, was the chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee and, more than anyone else, could determine the direction and parameters of the discussion.The fact that it went so badly was in part because of the decisions he made. With Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh now facing a sexual assault allegation from professor Christine Blasey Ford, who may testify next week, senators are eager to avoid Biden s missteps. In other words, one of the biggest mistakes of Biden s career is being replayed over and over in a closely watched political fight, and it s being used by his own party as a shameful episode. Biden, the former vice president, was asked about Hill when he appeared on NBC s  Today  show on Friday morning with his wife to promote the Biden Cancer Summit. Biden said Kavanaugh s accuser, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally,  should not have to go through what Anita Hill went through.  But when asked whether he did enough to help Hill, Biden offered no apologies and defended himself. He expressed  regret  for what happened in 1991 but portrayed himself as Hill s ally.  My biggest regret was I didn t know how I could shut you off if you were a senator and you were attacking Anita Hill s character,  he said.  Under the Senate rules, I can t gavel you down and say you can t ask that question. Although I tried. Biden has never apologized to Hill. In November, after hearing that Hill didn t believe he treated her fairly during the Senate hearing, Biden said he was  so sorry if she believes that.  The thing about Biden is he still hasn t gotten the apology right,  said the Democratic strategist.  Saying you wish you could have done more just doesn t cut it. That s like a robber saying,  I wish I could have done more to stop the burglar,  instead of saying,  I m sorry I robbed your house.   Joe Biden needs to take a long, hard look in the mirror and think about what they did back then and the long-lasting ramifications it had on a generation of women,  said Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of the progressive women s group UltraViolet.  As painful as this may be for him, it is far more painful for the women who felt like they could not come forward because of the way his committee treated Dr. Hill. And every senator who might question Dr. Blasey Ford next week needs to take a long, hard look at what happened with Dr. Hill and make sure history doesn t repeat itself. In 1991, most significantly, Biden did not call three other witnesses to testify who could have strengthened Hill s allegations. But in other ways, too, Hill said she felt like she was left out to dry, without an ally on the committee. Most evident from the televised Judiciary Committee hearings was the fact that I sat in that hearing room without a patron on the panel. That image still resonates,  she wrote in a 1995 essay. From the beginning, Biden said he recognized that Hill s allegations against Thomas were  a giant incendiary bomb.  But he didn t act like they were, according to Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, who wrote Strange Justice, a thorough book about the Thomas confirmation battle. Hill s allegations became public just days before the Senate was set to vote on Thomas  confirmation. Biden initially wanted to delay the vote by two weeks, but a GOP senator who was a Thomas supporter convinced him that fairness demanded the proceedings move faster.Biden scheduled Hill s testimony for Oct. 11, and agreed that the Judiciary Committee would not take another vote before sending Thomas to the full Senate on Oct. 15   a one-week delay. He also said he would keep questions about Thomas  general sexual conduct   such as his interest in pornography   out of the hearings. Joe bent over too far to accommodate the Republicans, who were going to get Thomas on the court come hell or high water,  Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) told Mayer and Abramson.Biden also handed a major victory to Republicans in agreeing to let Thomas testify both before and after Hill   most crucially, scheduling his response to her allegations for 9 p.m. on a Friday, when millions of people were tuned in for their prime-time broadcast.  In the end, Biden voted against Thomas. But when he did so, he said on the Senate floor,  For this senator, there is no question with respect to the nominee s character. In the years afterward, Biden became a champion of women s rights. Even his critics from the time say he became a stalwart ally, speaking on violence against women and promoting female representation in politics. But it s clear that the Hill episode will not go away and that, with Blasey and Kavanaugh in the national spotlight, Biden s missteps will be long discussed.  The problem is not just that many voters and activists will be learning about his actions in the Thomas hearings for the first time,  said another Democratic strategist. It s that he still refuses to acknowledge any regret for those actions. Women are fired up and know that Anita Hill deserved better from the Democrat leading the effort. He should, too.

Just look at what is now being exposed in our Department of Justice and the FBI. Look at what s going on. You have some real bad ones. You see what s happening at the FBI   they re all gone, they re all gone, they re all gone,  he said. But there s a lingering stench, and we re going to get rid of that, too,  he added.Trump s comments at a stop in Springfield where he backed GOP Senate candidate Josh Hawley came in the wake of a Friday New York Times article citing unnamed sources that said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein suggested last year secretly recording Trump. He also talked about recruiting Cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to oust Trump as unfit for office, according to the Times. Rosenstein called the story  inaccurate and factually incorrect.  An insider source who requested anonymity told HuffPost that Rosenstein was being sarcastic and that he never intended to record the president.In response to the report, a surprising source urged Trump not to fire anyone: Fox News host Sean Hannity. Hannity warned the president on his program Friday that this was a  set up.  Trump  needs not to fall into a trap,  said Hannity. I have a message for the president tonight: Under zero circumstances should the president fire anybody,  said Hannity.  They are hoping and praying that the president does just that. They re hoping he gets mad, that he gets sick and tired of it,  and then they ll turn it into a political scandal, he added.Hannity claimed the Rosenstein story is part of a  coup  by an anti-Trump  deep state  within the government, referencing a conspiracy theory. The news host also said that the  deep state  is  crumbling from within at this very hour. Sean Hannity on Rosenstein:  I have a message for the president tonight.

Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) blasted professor Christine Blasey Ford s accusation of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as  absurd  because they were merely drunken teenagers at the time. Besides, Cramer added, it was  supposedly an attempt that never went anywhere. The California psychology professor, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, has said that Kavanaugh pushed her into a room, locked the door, pinned her down on a bed and held his hand over her mouth while he pawed at her clothing and pushed against her. She said she escaped when a high school friend of Kavanaugh s jumped on top of them. Kavanaugh has  categorically  denied her accusation. His nomination is before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Cramer, who s battling to unseat Democratic incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in November, revealed his take on the sexual assault allegation in an interview Friday on  The Jarrod Thomas Show  on Grand Fork s KNOX-AM.Cramer compared Blasey s accusation to law professor Anita Hill s 1991 testimony about Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas  alleged sexual harassment. Thomas was later confirmed to the court. This case is even more absurd because these people were teenagers when this supposed alleged incident took place; teenagers,  he emphasized. These are teenagers who evidently were drunk, according to her own statement,  he continued. Blasey has said that both boys were  stumbling drunk  while she had had a single beer. They were drunk. Nothing evidently happened in it all, even by her own accusation,  Cramer added.  Again, it was supposedly an attempt, or something, that never went anywhere. Cramer warned that it s going to be difficult to get  good people  for judgeships and government jobs if  this is going to be the standard   if you have to have a perfect record in junior high and high school. Check out the interview in the audio file above. Cramer s comments about the  supposed attempt  begin at about the 5:20 mark.It remained unclear late Friday if Blasey would testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week. The committee on Friday afternoon had set a 10 p.m. EDT deadline for her to agree to its conditions for a Wednesday hearing, but her attorney asked for another day to decide on the request, calling the  arbitrary  deadline an attempt to  bully  her client.Later Friday, committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) indicated he had allowed a day s extension for her decision, tweeting:  I want to hear her. Judge Kavanaugh I just granted another extension to Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w the statement she made last week to testify to the senate  She shld decide so we can move on  I want to hear her.

But about an hour later, Republicans extended the deadline a day.In an email sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee s staff near the time of the deadline, attorney Debra Katz criticized the panel s Republicans for giving Blasey only until 10 p.m. EDT Friday to decide whether she would testify on Wednesday and without many of the conditions she had requested for the hearing.Katz urged the committee to extend the response deadline by a day and criticized Republicans for rejecting several of the conditions Blasey had requested for the format of the hearing.Responding to Katz s email after the deadline Friday night, committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tweeted that he did grant an extension to Blasey s team.Grassley complained that he had already granted extensions  five times  since Blasey publicly identified herself Sunday as Kavanaugh s accuser. Several minutes later, though, he added:  With all the extensions we give Dr Ford to decide if she still wants to testify to the Senate I feel like I m playing 2nd trombone in the judiciary orchestra and Schumer is the conductor.  Five times now we hv granted extension for Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w her desire stated one wk ago that she wants to tell senate her story  Dr Ford if u changed ur mind say so so we can move on I want to hear ur testimony.

It s not my normal approach to b indecisiveWith all the extensions we give Dr Ford to decide if she still wants to testify to the Senate I feel like I m playing 2nd trombone in the judiciary orchestra and Schumer is the conductorOn Friday afternoon, Republicans on the committee had proposed that the hearing be held Wednesday and set the 10 p.m. deadline for Blasey to respond, giving her less than a day to decide.Katz called the 10 p.m. deadline  arbitrary  and  aggressive  and accused the Republicans of bullying Blasey while she receives death threats.The deadline s  sole purpose is to bully Dr. Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-altering implications for her and her family,  Katz wrote.Grassley had threatened Blasey s lawyers to hold the vote for Kavanaugh s nomination on Monday if she did not respond by the deadline, according to The Associated Press.Katz s email was obtained by reporters from The Washington Post, Politico and journalist Yashar Ali.New: Letter from  Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s lawyer Debra Katz to the Senate Judiciary Committee Majority staff. pic.twitter.com/Gn5QV7KusWBlasey s attorneys, on a conference call with committee staff members Thursday night, had laid out conditions under which the professor, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, would be willing to testify.They asked that Kavanaugh testify first and that senators preside over questioning instead of bringing in outside counsel. They also requested that the hearing take place next Thursday instead of Monday, which Grassley had suggested earlier in the week.Blasey s attorneys also asked if the committee could subpoena Mark Judge, Kavanaugh s high school friend who Blasey said was in the room during the alleged assault. Judge has denied witnessing the alleged assault and refused to testify before the committee.The GOP counter-offer largely ignored these requests, instead proposing a Wednesday hearing in which Blasey would testify first. It also specified that lawyers for the committee   rather than the senators themselves   would oversee questioning and that no outside witnesses would be called. We want to hear Dr. Ford s testimony and are prepared to accommodate many of your demands, including further delaying a hearing that is currently scheduled for Monday,  Grassley said in a statement.  We are unwilling to accommodate your unreasonable demands. Outside counsel may not dictate the terms under which committee business will be conducted. The negotiations came after Republicans on the committee rejected Blasey s calls for an FBI investigation into her allegations before she would be called to testify.Katz, in her response late Friday, harshly criticized the way the Republican committee members were treating Blasey.The deadline and hearing negotiations had  created tremendous and unwarranted anxiety and stress on Dr. Ford,  Katz wrote.  Your cavalier treatment of a sexual assault survivor who has been doing her best to cooperate with the Committee is completely inappropriate. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) called Kavanaugh a  good man,  and said senators should judge his character today. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) expressed sympathy for Kavanaugh, saying he couldn t  imagine the horror of being accused of something like this.  On Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reassured Republicans that Kavanaugh will be confirmed   even though Blasey has not yet testified about her allegations.  Don t get rattled by all of this,  he said.  We re going to plow right through it and do our job. Blasey is currently negotiating the conditions under which she will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. In a letter to the committee on Friday, members of the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence admonished senators for failing to treat Blasey with respect, saying lawmakers  actions and comments have set the clock back on responding to sexual violence. Your actions and comments in the past week have taken us back 25 years, as if VAWA never existed, as if all of the hard-won, evidence-based, best practices we have invested in as a nation were for naught. How can Congress legislate a coordinated community response for the nation, yet fail to live up to its own mandate?  the letter asks.Elsewhere, the letter notes:  If the committee is not willing to engage in a process that upholds the dignity and safety of a person who has come forward to report that she was a victim of sexual assault, then they cannot pretend to care about the reauthorization of VAWA.   The Violence Against Women Act   which directs the national response to crimes of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking   was set to expire at the end of September, but was extended through Dec. 7 under a stopgap spending bill. A bill to enhance and extend the law for another five years, introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), has not been taken up by either house of Congress.  There s an enormous amount of frustration on the part of sexual assault experts who have spent endless hours with judiciary committee staff,  said Kim Gandy, president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, one of the groups in the task force.  They are outraged at the behavior of senators publicly treating a survivor of sexual assault in this manner. We ve expended all this time trying to work with them, and this is where we end up?  The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence called on Congress to enlist the advice of experts on how to engage in trauma-informed questioning prior to the hearing and called for a full FBI investigation before Blasey testifies.  Survivors across the country are watching and paying attention,  said Teri Poore, policy director with the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, another group in the task force.

But she didn t speak of it for several years, Patti Davis revealed in a powerful Washington Post op-ed Friday. I never told anyone for decades   not a friend, not a boyfriend, not a therapist, not my husband when I got married years later,  noted Davis, an author. Nor did she remember some important details of the attack.Both situations are common for survivors of assault, according to experts.Davis revealed her experience in support of Christine Blasey Ford, the California psychology professor who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were teens.Davis  article appeared while Twitter messages from sexual assault survivors flooded #WhyIDidntReport in response to President Donald Trump s dismissive comments about Blasey s experience and his assumptions about the ease of reporting sexual assault.  If the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents,  Trump tweeted Friday. He also said he wanted to know the  date, time and place. In Davis  case, the attack occurred when she met with a music executive in his office about songs she had written.  He was ... on top of me   so quickly   with his hands under my skirt and his mouth on mine, that I froze,  she recalled.  I lay there as he pushed himself inside me. She no longer remembers what month it was, if the executive s assistant was outside the door, what her attacker said. It doesn t surprise me one bit that for more than 30 years, Christine Blasey Ford didn t talk about the assault she remembers,  Davis added. Nor does it surprise her that Blasey doesn t remember where it occurred or the specific day. Your memory snaps photos of the details that will haunt you forever, that will change your life and live under your skin. It blacks out other parts of the story that really don t matter much,  Davis wrote.Perhaps the  aging men  ready to question Blasey should think about the  courage it takes for a woman to say: Here is my memory. It has haunted me for decades ... you need to know about it now because of what is at stake in this country,  said Davis.It s not the first time Davis has challenged Trump s positions. She wrote in the Post in June that her father would have condemned Trump. He would plead with Americans to recognize that the caustic, destructive language emanating from our current president is sullying the dream that America once was,  she wrote.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

When Anita Hill, who had previously worked for Thomas, testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he d sexually harassed her several times, he indignantly denied it. His conservative supporters relished the opportunity to both dismiss the narrative of rampant workplace harassment and be seen publicly supporting a black man   albeit one who was cut from the same ideological cloth as they were.Thomas  characterization of those hearings as a  high-tech lynching  was, perhaps, the most significant development in the confirmation process. Invoking race proved a boon for Thomas and those who backed his nomination, diverting at least some attention from the embarrassing details of his alleged sexual harassment to the perceived injustice he faced in being asked about them.Twenty-seven years later, certain aspects of Judge Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court bear a striking resemblance to the Thomas nomination. Kavanaugh, whose confirmation seemed a foregone conclusion until allegations surfaced of an attempted rape during his teenage years, is now preparing to testify in a public hearing also featuring the woman who has accused him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.But where Thomas  perceived lack of privilege as a black man served him mightily in the public eye, Kavanaugh s wealth of privilege as a well-to-do white man will, ironically, make him more vulnerable to failure. Amid allegations of sexual harassment, Thomas was able to personally associate himself with a trauma familiar to many black Americans: the experience of being unfairly targeted. At the time, the conservative machine   which included politicians and media figures   was eager to embrace this defense, despite their strident denial of racism as a prominent factor in black American life prior to the Thomas nomination.The strategy of inverting Hill s accusations in this way, and making a righteous accuser out of the accused, turned Thomas into a revolutionary black martyr pitted against his liberal enemies and hoisted him onto the Supreme Court bench, where he has sat ever since.Brett Kavanaugh will need to rely on a different playbook.The specter of race was, in fact, always present in the nomination of Clarence Thomas, even before he conjured it in his own defense. By choosing Thomas to fill the seat vacated by Justice Thurgood Marshall, President George H.W. Bush had seemingly selected a retributive heir to Marshall s legacy. Marshall was a civil rights icon and the court s first black justice, while Thomas, his career forged in the conservative establishment, was the ideological opposite. If Marshall s presence on the bench represented a glimmer of light to blacks hoping for social justice, Thomas  nomination and the hardening of the high court s conservative majority stamped out that light in a matter of months.During the same year Congress passed valuable civil rights legislation, the Senate elevated a black man to the Supreme Court who could be used as a cudgel to blunt the law s impact. Thomas  nomination defied several civil rights organizations and delighted their many foes, who championed the nominee s black conservatism as noble.This was Thomas, a vocal opponent of affirmative action, simultaneously existing as its greatest beneficiary. And were it not for Anita Hill coming forward, his confirmation might have proceeded seamlessly.But reporting from 1991 reveals that observers were skeptical that a black woman s suffering would rise to the level of national outrage. They were proven right by the polling: In numerous surveys taken after Hill s testimony, more than 50 percent of Americans were in favor of Thomas  confirmation. Among blacks, that number ballooned to 70 percent. Perhaps the most sobering reflection on the widespread support for Thomas despite the gravity of Hill s claims came from political science professor Linda Faye Williams, who remarked to the Chicago Tribune,  No black man has ever been lynched for doing anything to a black woman. They ve been lynched for doing things to white women. Brett Kavanaugh will not benefit from the perfect storm of circumstances that helped Thomas. And without that, Kavanaugh s elevation to the Supreme Court is less secure.  Firstly, the woman who has accused Kavanaugh is white. Though we do not yet know how much sympathy she will be afforded by the public following her testimony (should she choose to share it), Christine Blasey Ford will have the relative luxury of knowing that she won t be categorically disregarded in the way a black woman would be.Secondly, the public s assessment of Kavanaugh will differ from that of Thomas because he is white. In fact, he is very white. He is not just  I have black friends  white. Literally, he is  my mom once taught black kids  white. Unlike Thomas, nothing about Kavanaugh or his life will animate Americans around cynical claims that he faces discrimination.To put it plainly, Brett Kavanaugh is a throwaway candidate in a way that Clarence Thomas was not. His nomination doesn t represent anything that couldn t also be represented by any number of other extremely conservative judges. He was not, like Thomas, plucked from America s lower caste and given the power to keep that caste at bay.Instead, he was granted power and privilege at birth, only to bungle it through potentially perjurious hearings and the revelation that he may have tried to rape someone once.There aren t bootstrap stories about Kavanaugh s grueling ascent from the wealthy community of Bethesda, Maryland, to the halls of Yale Law School. There is no captivating tale of the privileges that eluded him, the opportunities that systematically passed him by.There is just Brett Kavanaugh. And while Republicans yearn for another conservative justice to roll back legislative accomplishments made over the past century, there is no actual reason   politically or otherwise   that Kavanaugh has to be that guy.Brett Kavanaugh, the individual, is essentially useless."

Shortly after that, I wrote a piece for HuffPost explaining how coming forward about that experience radically changed my life. My story has been featured on NBC s New York City affiliate. I have been interviewed by multiple local newspapers. I have received well over 1,000 messages directly relating to my revelation, and all of them have showered me with gratitude and praise for my courage.I have been told that I have saved innumerable lives. I ve heard that I am a voice for victims who are no longer here to share their tales of abuse. I have learned that I have inspired others to speak out about what they have been through. On dozens of occasions, I have been called a hero (a term I flatly reject, for what it s worth).Aside from the trolls in the cesspools known as the comments sections of local news sites, not a single person   no friend, acquaintance or stranger   has questioned my account, my motives or the authenticity of my story. I ve been on this planet for 41 years, and I have never felt as loved and supported as I do today.Sadly, such love and support have not been granted to Christine Blasey Ford, a professor and research psychologist who came forward   first in a confidential letter and last week by name   about a sexual assault she says she suffered at the hands of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when they were in high school. Like me, Blasey says her attack took place in the 1980s, and like me and countless others who say they have survived sexual assault, she says she has been living with this abuse for the better part of her life.Whereas I have been celebrated for coming forward about what happened to me all those years ago, Blasey s allegations have, to put it mildly, received decidedly less applause. After alleging that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her while he was  stumbling drunk  at a party over three decades ago, she was met with a storm of scorn, ridicule and disbelief unlike any other in recent memory.   Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have been careful not to publicly question Blasey s motives or reputation   but they don t have to. They have the entire right-wing echo chamber to do their dirty work for them.Ann Coulter s twitter feed has transformed itself into a forum dedicated to Blasey bashing featuring the pundit s patented petty and sophomoric digs at the professor and retweets from friends and followers offering the same disgusting vitriol.Conservative social media has whipped itself into a frenzy with attacks on Blasey s family, memory, motives, professional qualifications and political beliefs.Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) even went so far as to grotesquely make light of her grave allegations when, during a recent debate, he joked,  Ruth Bader Ginsburg came out saying she was groped by Abraham Lincoln. And after originally offering what many believed to be a remarkably measured response to Blasey s claims, Donald Trump fired up his Twitter on Friday morning to all but dismiss her story by stating that he has  no doubt  that if the  attack   was as bad as she says,  she would have filed a police report 30 years ago directly after the alleged assault.I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn  date, time, and place!As a result of going public about her experience, Blasey has faced harassment and death threats so sinister, she has been forced to leave her home and go into hiding.In light of all that has taken place over the past week, I can t stop wondering why I m have been dubbed a hero whose motives and accounts of abuse are above reproach while Blasey has been painted as hyperbolic or, more often, a liar who is merely looking to derail the appointment of a supposedly honest, God-fearing family man to the Supreme Court.   I m not naive. I know that because of the hyperpartisan system we find ourselves living in and continually grappling with, moments like these can cause many of us to retreat to our respective corners, to rally around our flags. It has happened with television shows. It has happened with professional sports. It has even happened with Budweiser. But shouldn t the denunciation of sexual abuse and the support for survivors be considered well beyond any political divide? Shouldn t all of us, no matter our party affiliation or political beliefs, want to search for and ultimately find the truth of this matter and welcome an investigation into Blasey s claims?Take it from someone who has been there: None of this is easy to talk about, folks. Living with memories (remembered or repressed) and their psychological ramifications is no walk in the park. It harms the survivor. It damages relationships. It can lead to a host of medical problems such as anxiety, depression, hypertension and substance abuse. I should know; I experienced many of these conditions because of the abuse that I suffered and the pain and shame that resulted from my inability to discuss it until very recently. What s worse, opening up to a loved one or a trained professional can seem impossible at times for any number of reasons, from worrying you won t be believed to fearing the consequences you might face if you come forward. Now imagine how daunting it would be to open up to the entire country about something as personal and stigmatizing as sexual assault.I m able to keep forging ahead only because I have the wind at my back. I have the gift of an overwhelming army of people who believe in me and support me. Nobody has doubted the sincerity or authenticity of my allegations against my abuser. Like Blasey, my life has completely changed because I spoke out   only in my case, it s been for the better.Sharing my story has allowed me to come to grips with the fact that I was not crazy and that what I endured all those years ago was not normal. I have friends, family members and strangers who are willing to stand beside me and help fight to make sure the subcultures that have fostered child abuse and sexual assault for centuries are exposed, rectified and halted once and for all.Most important, unlike Blasey, I have never been lambasted for waiting 30 years to speak out. Not once. Quite the contrary: Everyone I ve encountered has understood why it took so long. If you re fortunate enough never to have experienced an assault, you might not understand how the human psyche can work to suppress traumatic experiences   or the internal bargaining you engage in to keep yourself safe and as whole as possible in the aftermath of that trauma. What s more, you probably haven t come up against the wall of disbelief that so many women face in the aftermath of assault. And if you can t understand what any of this is like or at the very least acknowledge how difficult all this must be, you re simply unqualified to offer an opinion.Knowing all this makes the attacks on Blasey all the more gut wrenching. They re coming from individuals who are either woefully uninformed about the situation or who are approaching her account with nefarious intentions in order to help confirm Kavanaugh at any cost. If any one of these people or someone they loved had endured sexual abuse, I believe they wouldn t be behaving like this.Very few people (if any) wake up one day and say,  You know what? I m going to tell the world that I am a survivor of sexual abuse!  It just doesn t work that way. For many of us, something sparks our memories or inspires us to tell our stories.I was triggered when I encountered two stories that broke within weeks of each other: news that my former archbishop Theodore McCarrick was an abuser and that a groundbreaking Pennsylvania grand jury s findings documented the scope of clergy abuse in the state.Blasey was prompted to speak out when she learned the man she claims assaulted her at a party was in line to become a Supreme Court justice.Such similar experiences with such different outcomes. One of us is called a hero. The other is deemed mixed up or a flat-out liar. It s this difference in how Blasey and I are seen that is so confounding to me. Which leads me to believe that gender plays an even bigger role in this situation than politics does. The mistrust and doubt that Blasey is facing is exactly the same   though magnified by her position in the public square   as the mistrust and doubt that so many women before her have faced. Even though we know that false accusations of rape are rare, women s stories and motivations are routinely questioned, and that s one more reason so many don t speak out. Even if they did, who would believe them? And even if a woman is believed, all too often she s then criticized for wearing provocative clothes or sending mixed signals or otherwise doing something that supposedly made the attack not an attack or somehow justifiable.Even in the era of Me Too, when so many women have bravely come forward to tell what has happened to them, the right wing s instinct is to slut-shame first and ask questions later.  As a survivor   and as a fellow human being   I find this kind of behavior sickening.Thankfully, Blasey has supporters. Thankfully, there are millions of Americans who believe her story and hope that she is somehow, someday able to find some semblance of peace. But too many people do not, and too many people refuse to even entertain the thought of offering her the decency of a formal investigation of her claims.I was lucky. When I spoke out, I was heard. I was believed. I was celebrated.But there is no difference between Christine Blasey Ford and me. We both have allegations that date back three decades. We both are adamant that those allegations are true and that what we said happened actually did happen. We both have been forced to stand up to powerful institutions. And we both are able to offer enough circumstantial evidence and corroborating claims to warrant further investigation into what we allege took place all those years ago.If I am a hero, she is a hero   and she deserves the chance to tell her story.Ed Hanratty is a freelance political journalist.

At Yale Law School, the embattled Supreme Court nominee s alma mater, a growing number of students are denouncing administrators for their rote support of Kavanaugh and are demanding changes to a culture that enables powerful elites to get away with sexual misconduct.At a Yale Law Women event on Thursday, students confronted faculty over statements Yale put out over the summer in support of Kavanaugh s nomination and the school s silence since Dr. Christine Blasey Ford alleged that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teens.Students also demanded to know if the school was aware of the conduct of Alex Kozinski, a high-profile judge many alumni clerked for who resigned late last year amid accusations of sexual harassment.   Students feel pretty deeply betrayed by professors being aware of allegations for years against federal judges, but continuing to funnel students to them,  said Catherine McCarthy, a third-year student who was at Thursday s town hall and was one of about 30 students who helped organize a campus protest the following day.Doug Kysar, deputy dean of Yale Law School, told students on Thursday that he d known of Kozinski s behavior since 1998.  We all inferred he meant that he knew about sexual harassment,  McCarthy said.Kysar later clarified in an email to students that he actually didn t learn of the sexual misconduct allegations until recently, and was only aware that Kozinski seemed  like an asshole  from the time Kysar himself was a law student decades ago.  I did not know, until news broke last year, of his reputation for sexual harassment and how much more deeply harmful and offensive his behavior actually was. Nor did I make a report of what I had heard during my student years to any relevant official body,  Kysar said.  Given what I did know, do I wish I had done more? Yes. I always wish I had done more. pic.twitter.com/qJ8uCIvesuStudents didn t really buy Kysar s explanation.  Personally, I was appalled,  said a female student who declined to be named out of fear of career repercussions.  Do more now!  read one of the many signs students placed on campus to protest Kysar s comments and the administration s  complicity  in enabling a culture of sexual harassment and assault. Yale Law School s culture was thrust into the spotlight this week when HuffPost and subsequently The Guardian reported that two well-known law professors told students seeking clerkships with Kavanaugh that he liked female clerks with a  certain look. Amy Chua, who s known as the  Tiger Mom  for her 2011 book The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, told students that it s  not an accident  that Kavanaugh s clerks  look like models.  Chua is currently hospitalized with an undisclosed but reportedly serious illness. Chua s husband, Jed Rubenfeld, had reportedly warned one student about another federal judge who was a sexual harasser. Rubenfeld himself is on leave pending an investigation into his own personal interactions with students. In a statement to The Guardian, Rubenfeld said he didn t know anything about the allegations.But when a student asked faculty about what changes they planned to make following those reports, they didn t have much to offer. Faculty members replied with pro forma statements of support for students. But then they put the onus on students to do more research about judges, according to multiple students who attended the event.  These professors are the gatekeepers to these judges,  said another student who attended Thursday s meeting.  If they have access to private information of sexual harassment that we have no knowledge of, that s ridiculous to put that on the students as an independent obligation. Gallingly, Kysar asked students to take a moment to reflect on how much progress Yale has made since 2004, when  it was routine and commonplace  for the career services center to instruct students to wear short skirts for clerkship interviews, recalled a student who attended the event.  We all know that s now a bad thing,  Kysar said, according to students who attended.The notion outraged students.  There were a lot of text conversations happening concurrently,  said McCarthy, the third-year student. Another student said there were a lot of eyes shining with tears in the room. Yale Law School is an educational institution and its failure in the last day to take these allegations and its students  safety and concerns seriously is deeply disappointing,  read a statement from about 30 students emailed to HuffPost. The statement highlighted  Yale Law School s complicity in and facilitation of federal judges  sexual harassment of and discrimination against their clerks, particularly with regard to Judge Kavanaugh. Students insist not all that much has changed since the short skirt days. One female student told faculty in attendance on Thursday that after just a week on campus, she d heard about how you have to take certain professors out to drinks to get clerkships. Two other students HuffPost spoke to said it is well understood that they must ingratiate themselves with the right professors if they want to get the most prized clerkships.  An underground network,  is how McCarthy described it.Some Yale Law School faculty, however, appear to be listening to students  complaints. A majority of professors, including the past two deans, Harold Koh and Robert Post, signed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday urging it to  conduct a fair and deliberate confirmation process  and allow the FBI to first investigate allegations against Kavanaugh before there s another hearing. I think some of the faculty realize that this has to be the beginning of a process,  one of the students involved in Thursday s meeting said.Professor Abbe Gluck s name has also quietly been removed from a press release Yale sent in July congratulating Kavanaugh for his Supreme Court nomination. In the original release, Gluck said Kavanaugh is  humble, collegial and cares deeply about the federal courts.  Her quote is no longer featured on the school s online version of the release.Gluck signed Friday s letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The quote has been removed because it has been consistently misread by the press and both sides and unfairly misappropriated by the White House,  she said, adding that she still believes  thorough review of Judge Kavanaugh s record is still needed before any vote should occur, including review of the unreleased documents, as well as a full airing of the serious personal allegations through a process that is fair for all involved. Yale Law School s dean, Heather Gerken, also released a statement on Thursday evening addressing the allegations that Chua and Rubenfeld had coached students about how they should look before meeting with Kavanaugh, as well as their knowledge of Kozinski s alleged sexual harassment. The allegations being reported are of enormous concern to me and to the School,  Gerken said in the statement.  While we cannot comment on individual complaints or investigations, the Law School and the University thoroughly investigate all complaints regarding violations of University rules and take no options off the table. Yale Law students are not alone   some students at Harvard Law demanded that Kavanaugh stop teaching at their institution   and they aren t about to give up. A coalition of students involved with groups like Yale Law Women, Black Law Students Association, Title IX and the Asian Pacific American Law Students Association,  is going to pressure [school administrators] to put on a town hall next week,  according to a student involved in the planning.And students are keeping up the pressure. On Friday, they placed signs on campus stating,  [Yale Law School] is a model of complicity,  and  YLS, you knew about Kozinski.  Two signs framed a picture of Kavanaugh hanging on campus. They said,  We still believe Anita Hill,  and  We believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. #metoo About 30 students are also organizing a trip down to Washington, D.C., on Monday. Things have changed in the hallways in the last two days,  said another law student who attended Thursday s meeting.  Things have changed.

Why didn t she come forward earlier? And, after all, boys will be boys.But the rhetoric that stands out most starkly to me as a survivor of an adolescent rape are arguments like that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who said on Fox News,  How much in society should any of us be held liable today when we lived a good life, an upstanding life by all accounts, and then something that maybe is an arguable issue took place in high school? Should that deny us chances later in life? Or, as New York Times opinion columnist Bari Weiss said on MSNBC,  Let s say he did this exactly as she said. Should the fact that a 17-year-old presumably very drunk kid did this   should this be disqualifying? It s the Brock Turner effect, the reverence for the sanctity of the perpetrator s future, his great promise. There are many problems with this line of reasoning, but the one that sticks in my craw, as the survivor of a sexual assault as a teenager, is the way it ignores my pain, my stolen promise.  I think it derailed me substantially for four or five years,  the professor, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, told The Washington Post of her alleged assault, in which she says Kavanaugh pinned her down, groped her, covered her mouth and attempted to remove her clothing before she escaped.Blasey said she later struggled academically and socially and was unable to have healthy relationships with men, describing the event as a  trauma with lasting impact on her life.  I can relate.Since I was raped by a group of teenage boys after school when I was 14 years old, I have struggled with substance abuse issues and sexual compulsivity issues. For nearly a decade after my assault, I cut myself off from processing and experiencing the overwhelming feelings associated with it. Instead, I dedicated myself to the business of self-destruction, numbing the brain-bending tidal wave of suppressed emotion with cocaine and alcohol. According to the National Center for PTSD (Blasey and I were both diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder), rape survivors are  three to four times more likely to use marijuana, six times more likely to use cocaine, and 10 times more likely to use other major drugs.  I self-medicated at least in part to avoid confronting the pain of my assault.I also repeatedly put myself into dangerous and degrading sexual situations, retraumatizing myself repeatedly in my brain s misguided attempt to regain control of what happened to me. At 25, I got sober and began the slow, painful work of recovery from my sexual assault in therapy. The feelings that finally began to surface during that process were nearly too painful to handle. I scoffed at the idea of  one day at a time,  when I was struggling to tolerate the immense grief and sorrow I felt for even a minute at a time. I spent those early years afraid of heights solely because I was terrified I might impulsively fling myself off of them.  According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, 33 percent of women who are raped contemplate suicide and 13 percent of women attempt suicide. Like many survivors, I struggle with mental illness, in the forms of anxiety, depression and PTSD. But I am lucky. I am alive. I am also lucky to have generally had access to treatment for my assault and its symptoms. But both the time and financial commitments have been overwhelming in scope   countless hours of various types of often expensive therapy   cognitive behavioral, 12 step, Gestalt, group, psychodrama workshops, emotionally focused therapy. If something seemed like it might help, I tried it. I have written letters to my inner child. I have gotten acupuncture. I have meditated. I am medicated. Still, at 35 years old, 21 years after those boys decided their pleasure was more important than my humanity, I still struggle day by aching day to deal with the havoc they wreaked in my life. It still sometimes threatens to capsize me.It has often struck me as unfair, the nature of trauma. How can the relatively short period of time in which my assault took place   less than an hour   have incalculably altered the comparative eons of time of the rest of my life? And yet that s what trauma does. It s like a glass of water spilled on a keyboard   a split second of bad luck that works its way into your motherboard, corroding the very parts that allow you to function. The damage can be treated, but it can never be undone. And when we talk about treating sexual assault, we are talking in terms of a lifetime. Rape is a long-term crime. I ve spent decades of my life engaged in the hard, painful work of recovery from sexual assault. I have spent decades of my life in pain. Just as I ll never know who I could have been without my sexual assault, I ll never know what I might have done with all the time I ve spent recovering from it. That time was stolen from me. My life wasn t ruined by what was done to me, but it was irrevocably altered.In our rush to spare rapists the pain of consequences, we ignore the sea of suffering they inflict. Why should perpetrators get to put their actions behind them when victims don t? What makes their lives more important than ours?  So when pundits ask,  Must a sexual assault when he was a teenager follow him around for his whole life?  Remember: Christine Blasey Ford didn t get a choice.

I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn  date, time, and place!There are many reasons why victims of sexual assault do not report the incidents to police immediately or ever, including fear of retaliation, shame and, in many cases, the likely lack of consequences for the perpetrators. Trump himself has a long history of suggesting that women who do come forward to accuse powerful men of abuse aren t telling the truth. Here s a rundown:Jessica Leeds once sat next to the future president on an airplane in the early 1980s. Shortly before the 2016 election, she told The New York Times that Trump had groped her breasts and put his hand up her skirt. Trump denied the story.When it came out that Ivana Trump, the president s first wife, said in a 1990 divorce deposition that he once raped her, he denied the incident took place. (She later reversed her story. Per a nondisclosure agreement, she is no longer allowed to speak about her marriage to Donald Trump.)Kristin Anderson said Trump put his hand up her skirt and touched her genitals in the early 1990s. He denied it.Jill Harth said in a 1997 lawsuit that Trump once attempted to rape her. Both he and his daughter Ivanka Trump denied it.Trump s presidential campaign triggered an avalanche of other accusations of untoward behavior. Cathy Heller said he grabbed her and kissed her at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 1997. Temple Taggart said that was the same year he kissed her upon meeting her. Karena Virginia said Trump groped her breast the following year. Natasha Stoynoff said Trump forcibly kissed her as she was reporting a story for People magazine in 2005. Rachel Crooks said Trump kissed her in 2005, too, after shaking her hand and not letting go.Jessica Drake said Trump grabbed and kissed her in 2006. Summer Zervos said he grabbed her, groped her and kissed her on two occasions in 2007. Trump in October 2016 said the women speaking out against him were  horrible, horrible liars.  Neither he nor his spokespeople have ever budged. After former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson sued Ailes in 2016 for allegedly terminating her for refusing his  sexual advances,  nine other women came forward describing many incidents of sexual harassment. One woman said the Fox News chief blackmailed her into performing sexual acts. Speaking to NBC News, Trump defended his friend, saying,  It s very sad. Because he s a very good person. I ve always found him to be just a very, very good person. The Fox News star was forced out of the network last year following accusations of sexual harassment. In a 2011 affidavit, O Reilly s ex-wife swore that he once slammed her against a wall and dragged her down a flight of stairs in their home. Speaking to The New York Times, Trump said O Reilly is  a good person  and should not have settled the multiple harassment suits against him. I don t think Bill would do anything wrong,  the president said.In late 2017, the Alabama Republican stood accused of sexually harassing and assaulting multiple underage girls when he was much older than them. Trump at first emphasized Moore s own denial of the claims.Then, at a rally, the president attacked one of Moore s accusers, suggesting she might have tampered with a piece of evidence.Porter resigned earlier this year after two former spouses said he d abused them in incidents that allegedly included choking and punching. Without mentioning the women, Trump told reporters that Porter had done a good job at the White House and wished him well, saying,  It s obviously a tough time for him.  It was very sad when we heard about it,  the president said.  He says he s innocent. I think you have to remember that. Directly after a tape emerged in which Trump had once seemed to brag about sexual assault, the then-candidate for president held a press conference with four women who had raised sexual harassment and assault claims against former President Bill Clinton, the husband of Trump s rival for the White House.After women began coming forward last fall with disturbing allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein   a frequent Democratic donor   Trump said he was  not at all surprised. Trump was also quick to pounce on then-Sen. Al Franken when a woman publicly accused the Democrat of sexual misconduct, saying that a photo she provided as evidence  speaks a thousand words.   Where do his hands go in pictures 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 while she sleeps?  Trump asked.When it comes to abuses against women, it s painfully clear on whose side the president always stands.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

I made an appalling and inexcusable mistake of judgment in posting the tweet thread in a way that identified Kavanaugh s Georgetown Prep classmate. I take full responsibility for that mistake, and I deeply apologize for it. I realize that does not undo the mistake.On Thursday night, Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, posted a series of tweets laying out a conspiracy theory suggesting that Blasey misidentified Kavanaugh in her accusation. Whelan claimed instead that a high school classmate of Kavanaugh s assaulted Blasey, posting detailed information about the classmate.He has since deleted the tweets.Blasey rejected Whelan s theory in a statement to The Washington Post, saying that she knew Kavanaugh and the classmate and once visited the latter in the hospital. There is zero chance that I would confuse them,  she said.Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which may hear testimony from Blasey and Kavanaugh next week, sought to distance themselves from Whelan, who has advised on Kavanaugh s confirmation process. Whelan is also friends with Leonard Leo, the president of the Federalist Society, which has played a crucial role in shaping conservative judicial nominations.On Friday the White House said that it  had no knowledge  of Whelan s theory before his Thursday night tweets.Whelan told The Washington Post on Friday that he had  not communicated at all  with White House officials or Kavanaugh about the conspiracy theory.Others have tried to defend Kavanaugh by similarly calling into question Blasey s allegation and trying to discredit her.Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said this week that she may have been  mistaken  and that  clearly somebody s mixed up. The Wall Street Journal editorial board this week posited that  mistaken identity is also possible,  and The Washington Post ran a piece by opinion columnist Kathleen Parker under the headline  Is There a Kavanaugh Doppelganger?

He suggested the Judiciary Committee delay its confirmation vote until after she testifies. She should not have to go through what Anita Hill went through, and some of the questions she got asked, and the way the right went after her on national television, and questioned her integrity, questioned her, not just her honesty, questioned her behavior,  Biden said.  I mean, that s just not appropriate. You shouldn t haven t to be twice put through the same exact thing. He added:  I hope that they understand what courage it takes for someone to come forward and relive what they believe happened to them, but treat her with respect. Ask tough questions ... but don t go after the character assassination.  What should happen is the woman should be given the benefit of the doubt and not be abused again by the system.  @JoeBiden talks Anita Hill and Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford pic.twitter.com/TicXcSZvGlBiden has long been criticized for not doing enough to prevent attacks against Hill, a law professor, as she was questioned by members of the all-male, all-white Judiciary Committee. He also declined to allow testimony from other women who accused Thomas of sexual misconduct or who may have helped corroborate Hill s story.Biden on Friday again expressed  regret  for what happened in 1991, but immediately defended his record, citing his support of female lawmakers and his work on the Violence Against Women Act. It seems like you get it now, versus back in  91,  host Craig Melvin said. Well, I think I got it in  91,  Biden replied, pausing.  I don t think   well, people have their own opinion. That s why I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. Biden has acknowledged that Hill, now a law professor at Brandeis University and an advocate against workplace sexual harassment, was  vilified  during Thomas  confirmation, but has never formally apologized to her.  When Melvin asked if he had a message for Hill, Biden again defended himself, saying he  believed  and  supported  Hill. I am sorry I couldn t have stopped the kind of attacks that came to you,  Biden said.  But I never attacked her. I supported her. I believed her from the beginning, and I voted against Clarence Thomas. Hill did not immediately return a request for comment on Biden s remarks.Biden was asked in November to answer Hill s feeling that she wasn t treated fairly at Thomas  hearing. Biden said he was  so sorry if she believes that.  Let s get something straight here: I believed Anita Hill. I voted against Clarence Thomas,  Biden said.  I am so sorry that she had to go through what she went through. Hill told The Washington Post later that month that Biden s comments were  not enough  and the equivalent of  I m sorry if you were offended. Hill said in an interview with Elle magazine published this week that she s not waiting for an apology from Biden. People were asking,  When are you going to apologize to her?  It s become sort of a running joke in the household when someone rings the doorbell and we re not expecting company.  Oh,  we say,  is that Joe Biden coming to apologize?   she said.  There are more important things to me now than hearing an apology from Joe Biden. I m okay with where I am. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The FBI isn t the right agency to call.The whole premise of Trump s morning tirade against someone who says she was sexually assaulted fails under the misguided belief that all sexual assault victims call the police. In fact, nearly two-thirds of people who are raped or sexually assaulted don t go to police at all.And the president s attack on Blasey Friday is an example of why many victims don t share their stories. Blasey s closest friends have said she was hesitant to come forward with her story because she feared a swath of attacks, and she s getting exactly that. Pundits like Fox News  Tucker Carlson have piled on, blaming all sexual assault victims who don t go to law enforcement.Blasey, a Palo Alto University psychology professor, told The Washington Post that she was scared Kavanaugh  might inadvertently kill  her when he forced himself on her and groped her while they were high school students in the 1980s.This story has been updated with more details.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Attorneys Debra Katz and Lisa Banks offered the suggestions during a call held with the committee s staff members on Thursday night after the attorneys notified the committee in an email that the Californian, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, was prepared to testify next week.The negotiations for the hearing mostly focused on logistics and safety issues and lasted only about 30 minutes, The New York Times and Washington Post reported.

The attorneys also asked if the senators could preside over questioning instead of bringing in outside counsel, a senior congressional source with knowledge of the call told CNN. With no female Republicans on the committee, the senators considered using their female aides to question Blasey at the hearing.Blasey s attorneys also asked if the committee could subpoena Mark Judge, Kavanaugh s high school friend whom Blasey said was in the room during the alleged assault, according to The Associated Press. Judge has denied witnessing the alleged assault and refused to speak publicly on the matter.They also discussed having only one camera in the room during the hearing and asked that the hearing take place on Thursday instead of Monday, which committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) had suggested earlier this week.After the call, Taylor Foy, a Grassley spokesman, said the senator  will consult with his colleagues on the committee. He remains committed to providing a fair forum for both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. Earlier Thursday, Katz emailed the Senate Judiciary Committee to let them know that Blasey was prepared to testify next week as long as  terms are fair  and  ensure her safety. However, Katz maintained that Blasey still preferred that the committee fully investigated her claims before she testified.Blasey, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, has publicly accused Kavanaugh of drunkenly assaulting her during a party in Maryland when they were both in high school. In an interview with The Washington Post, Blasey said Kavanaugh pinned her down on a bed and groped her as Judge, who also appeared to be drunk, watched. Blasey claimed Kavanaugh covered her mouth when she tried to scream. She said was able to escape after Judge jumped on them both and toppled them off the bed. Kavanaugh and Judge have both denied Blasey s allegation.In a letter sent to the committee on Thursday, Kavanaugh said he looked forward to the Monday hearing, adding that he wanted one  as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name.

She said that when she confronted a student holding the flag, he quipped:  Hey, your panties might be here.  I was totally shocked that something like that would happen at Yale,  Eisler recalled in a recent interview with the News.A member of the frat at that time told the newspaper the underwear was  obtained consensually.  It was probably part of a  scavenger hunt  pledges were typically sent on, with the underwear  donated willingly  by women who wanted to  play along,  he said.But a female classmate of Kavanaugh s complained in a post on the YaleWomen Facebook page that DKE brothers would often ransack women s rooms while they were in class to grab their underwear.

It can compound the guilt that survivors might already feel for not being able to prevent or stop their own attack.   In the few public statements she has made, Blasey has been frank about the tremendous internal struggle she had in coming forward with her allegation that, when they were teens at a party, Kavanaugh pushed her into a bedroom, turned up music to drown her out and tried to take her clothes off while holding his hand over her mouth. In her July 30 letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), which was read aloud to CNN, Blasey wrote,  It is upsetting to discuss sexual assault and its repercussions, yet I felt guilty and compelled as a citizen about the idea of not saying anything.  I feel like my civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation,  Blasey later told The Washington Post s Emma Brown for an article about why she came forward. Blasey is trying to stop Kavanaugh from being confirmed to a lifetime Supreme Court seat, not trying to prevent other women from being personally victimized by him. Still, her statements reveal the struggle that countless sexual assault survivors grapple with: a sense of responsibility for stopping an assailant, and guilt if they fail to do so. Rebecca Campbell, a professor of psychology at Michigan State University who has studied sexual assault survivors for 25 years, said that preventing someone else from being victimized is one of the most commonly cited reasons survivors cooperate with the criminal justice system.  It s a very, very gut-wrenching equation for them,  Campbell said.  Wanting to protect others, wanting to protect public safety, making sure that it doesn t happen to anyone else and feeling that responsibility. But if that pressure comes from the outside   say, law enforcement pressuring a survivor to report or testify against her attacker   this altruistic motivation to spare others from pain and terror can be transformed into something more insidious that can make survivors feel blamed. Silence is complicity, as the saying goes, and, in the public narrative, the victim is transformed into victimizer if he or she doesn t say something.  It can feel very pressuring, and many survivors have used the word  manipulative,   Campbell said.  They re being manipulated to do something that they don t feel ready for. Sarah Layden, a public policy expert at the sexual violence survivors organization Resilience in Chicago, noted that some survivors feel this motivation naturally, but it doesn t mean that it should be used to pressure them to report.  Survivors should be encouraged to come forward through empowerment, support and being believed, not via the pressure to prevent others from being harmed,  Layden wrote in an email.  I just caution communities putting this type of pressure on survivors due to the internal pressure they already feel around this, compounded by feelings of self-blame, guilt, fear of not being believed or of retaliation, the stigma of sexual assault and so much more! Casey Gwinn, CEO of Alliance for HOPE International in San Diego, knows this on a personal level. When he was 11, a stranger molested him in a supermarket while his mother was somewhere else in the store. After it happened, he thought often about what he could have done at the time.  I should have yelled. I should have screamed. I should have done something,  Gwinn said.  But I didn t. I froze. I didn t know what to do. He never told anyone about it until eight months ago   46 years later. He began talking about it first among his family, then at events to promote his new book. And the questions he encountered insinuated that Gwinn, at 11 years old, didn t do enough to stop a man who probably went on to hurt other people.  Just the very voicing of it felt like it was my fault,  Gwinn said.  That if there were other victims, it was my fault, when, in fact, it s his fault.  He s the one who did it,  he continued.  And it s his responsibility to be held accountable for his conduct.  This idea that assault victims are responsible for the future predation of their abusers is an old one, and it has disturbing legal ramifications, according to advocates for assault survivors. Prosecutors who want to put rapists and predators behind bars have the ability to detain and jail assault survivors if they believe the victims do not want to willingly testify against their abuser. In the most infamous cases, the survivors suffer further abuse in jail from other inmates or guards. Critics of this practice say that there is other evidence beyond the testimony of the victim that can land a conviction for prosecutors. Gwinn, whose organization works with municipalities to create centers where victims of sexual assault can find the services they need in one place, says that Alliance for HOPE never takes the position that the victim is responsible for coming forward in order to prevent more violence.   What we try to say is, we as a society are responsible for holding the perpetrator accountable,  he said.  The focus isn t on trying to hold the victim accountable.  Blasey has already taken the most difficult step, which is to come forward about her experience, Gwinn said. Instead of attacking her and her statement, it s time to turn the spotlight on Kavanaugh, he said."

Bill Walker (I) and Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott (D) announced Thursday their opposition to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, increasing the pressure on Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who is undecided, to follow suit.In a joint statement, the top Alaska state officials voiced concern about Kavanaugh potentially voting to strike down the Affordable Care Act s Medicaid expansion and its protections for patients who have pre-existing conditions. Last year, Murkowski helped defeat a Republican-led effort to repeal the health care law in the Senate.Walker and Mallott also cited the recent sexual assault accusation made against President Donald Trump s high court nominee, stating that  a thorough review of past allegations against Mr. Kavanaugh is needed before a confirmation vote takes place. Republicans, however, have so far resisted calls for opening up an FBI investigation into the claim, urging the California professor who has accused Kavanaugh to testify before the Senate next week and tell her story.Murkowski has already been under pressure from a key constituent group to oppose Kavanaugh s nomination. Earlier this month, the Alaska Federation of Natives   a massive statewide Native-American organization that represents more than 20 percent of the state s population   went from taking no official stance on Kavanaugh to announcing its opposition on Sept. 12.Walker and Mallott noted in their statement that Alaska is home to 227 indigenous tribes, arguing that Kavanaugh s views on Native issues could jeopardize the  Indian Child Welfare Act, Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and other laws that enable tribal self-determination. Murkowski has been tight-lipped about Kavanaugh s nomination. But the Alaska senator appeared to downplay questions about his views regarding tribal law earlier this month. This is not a body of law he is often exposed to,  Murkowski told reporters last week, after Kavanaugh testified at his Senate confirmation hearing.Still, it s not clear how much Walker s opposition to Kavanaugh will factor into Murkowski s decision. While Murkowski has relied on independents as a base of political support in Alaska, Morning Consult found Walker s approval rating at 29 percent and his disapproval at 54 percent, making him the fifth most unpopular governor in the country.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Don t tell, don t tell,  said the former student, who overlapped at the school in North Bethesda, Maryland, with current Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, class of  83. It was a code of preppy omerta to which Kavanaugh himself has alluded. But then,  the former student continued,  you re getting all these 14-, 15-, 16-year-olds, 17-year-old kids doing whatever the fuck they wanted to do, with no repercussions. Drugs everywhere. Partying everywhere. Drinking   just whatever we wanted to do. It was unbelievable, off the rails. And that s just how it was. Sexual misconduct, the former student says, was routine, shrugged off.  My friend, who went to one of the private girls  schools, said she woke up with a guy on top of her,  the former student said.  And this was not a situation where people would talk about it. They would just say:  Oh, well, how d you do? How was your weekend?   Oh, well, I got attacked.  And that was just normal then. It was an attitude where  No  didn t necessarily mean  I m going to stop.  It meant  I m going to keep going,  and  I m going to keep going because I m privileged and I m allowed to and I m not going to get in trouble for it.  Just in to @wusa9 We ve been able to look at Judge Bret Kavanaugh high school yearbook from 1983 at Georgetown Prep in Bethesda.He describes being part of the  Keg City Club.  pic.twitter.com/kYeDeJxxqgThe former student would speak about his time at Georgetown Prep only on the condition of anonymity, fearing attacks from his fellow alumni. Based on the response to Christine Blasey Ford s allegation that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her when they were both in high school, his fears are not unfounded.The former student recently spoke with HuffPost about the party scene in which our current Supreme Court nominee spent his formative years. The conversation, which has been condensed and edited for clarity, is below.First, just generally, I d be interested in hearing what you remember about the culture of Georgetown Prep while you were there.I guess you could call it a fraternity between a bunch of rich kids. All this shit happens, and then nobody really wants to talk about it, because if one person crumbles, the whole system crumbles, and everybody tells on everybody. And that s not the way Georgetown Prep has ever been.And you and Kavanaugh were there at the same time?When Kavanaugh and I overlapped, it would have been 1982, and that s when Kavanaugh was a senior. [Current Supreme Court Justice] Neil Gorsuch [who also attended Prep] would have been a sophomore. Now, as far as Gorsuch goes, he was so straight-up. He was like,  Golly gee,  one of those kids. And Prep has always been a very elite school with 400 students. One hundred per class   that s all they would ever let in. Some of it was academic merit, but the rest of it was privilege. I didn t have a lot of interaction with Kavanaugh, but I did know of Mark Judge, the other guy who was named. My first reaction I had was,  Oh, that guy. Yeah, that seems to be the general sentiment around him.I mean, we were teenagers, but there was sex and drugs and more drugs and more partying and belligerence and disrespect, all going on at all times while I was there. Around 1986 is when Georgetown Prep really changed, and it went back to a more strict, Jesuit-based style.What prompted the change?A lot of the stuff that happened in the  70s and the  80s and the time that Kavanaugh was there and those parties that Judge described, it was common. That s what happened all the time.The police would be there, but they would say,  Oh, are you going to the party? We ll escort you.  That kind of thing. And, you know, they re escorting a load of teenage kids in a car who were all going to underage drink and party. And as I remember, it was hundreds of kids   boys and girls from different schools, all private. No public schools were involved. And what would happen was a lot of drinking. There was one room full of drugs, everybody would be doing coke. And in another room, everybody would be smoking weed. And then in another room, people would be having sex. And there would be all sorts of unwanted stuff going on.What do you mean when you say  unwanted stuff ?These were the situations where, I think, you could talk to any prep school girl, and they would say, yeah, I was attacked or I was abused or I was touched or I was done in this improper fashion. And like I said, it was a fraternity, but it was also a situation where the girls wouldn t talk about it later on, either. A lot of these women basically became kept women.Was the assault that Christine Blasey Ford described typical?Yeah, and a lot of that happened. And I think she said she was in a bathing suit, so that happened at Beach Week, I would guess. [Editor s note: Blasey told the Washington Post that the alleged incident occurred in the summer at a house in Montgomery County.]That s where everybody would go down to the coast, over to Ocean City [Maryland], or Rehoboth [Beach, Delaware], one of the local beaches. And somebody would have a house, or somebody would rent a house, and then it would just turn into a free-for-all there. My friend, who went to one of the private girls  schools, said she woke up with a guy on top of her. And this was not a situation where people would talk about it. They would just say:  Oh, well, how d you do? How was your weekend?   Oh, well, I got attacked.  And that was just normal then. It was an attitude where  No  didn t necessarily mean  I m going to stop.  It meant  I m going to keep going,  and  I m going to keep going because I m privileged and I m allowed to and I m not going to get in trouble for it. But every weekend there was some sort of party base during the school year where there was drugs, alcohol which was typical, but we re talking about 14-, 15-, 16-, 17-year-old kids. How would you hear about parties or meet kids from the other private schools?Most it was based on the football schedule. Like, as a football team, we played all the other prep schools. That s where all the parties started, and that s where all the parties went. I don t think it was something that we invented. I think that it was a culture that had been there for a long time, and then it just progressively got more abusive, and more and more and more and more abusive.How often did these Beach Week parties happen?They were considered a rite of passage. An end-of-the-year blowout. Partying at the beach was typically way more crazy than what happened during the school year. Inhibitions were thrown out the window. Fighting was a lot less common, but there was more sex involved and even more liberties taken because the parents were so far away. At least, that s what I concluded from my experiences at Beach Week every year.It was a game of who could party the most, who could drink the most, who could get the most girls, who could get away with the most crazy shit. A lot of these kids at these prep schools had family homes at the beach. And if not, they rented homes for the week.Do you think people would have even remembered something like what Blasey described? Like, would it have registered?Every weekend there was this whole idea of,  Hey, where are you going this weekend?   Well, so-and-so s having a party or someone s having a party at their house.  Usually because their parents were gone   that would happen all the time. Then everybody would go over there, the entire class. Or at least, anybody who was cool or anybody who could party would go. Anybody who could get a ride, or anybody who had a car. And then all the girls  schools in the area. If you talked to any of the girls there, they would all say,  Oh, yeah, of course there was a culture where assaults like that happen. But was it something people ever talked about at the time?It was just a weird culture of how there was no telling   you know, don t tell, don t tell. But then you re getting all these 14-, 15-, 16-year-olds, 17-year-old kids doing whatever the fuck they wanted to do, with no repercussions. Drugs everywhere. Partying everywhere. Drinking   just whatever we wanted to do. It was unbelievable, off the rails. And that s just how it was. Most of the kids I went to school with were either privileged or from foreign governments or whatever. They could get away with anything.One last question: Blasey said her assault happened at a smaller party   four boys in total. Were smaller parties like that common, in addition to these big ragers?It was more common to have at least 50 people there at a party. But these smaller parties   usually what happened was that it was a Beach Week party, where the kids went to the beach. Somebody had a house, and whoever was there and whoever heard about the party went to the party. So there may have been as few as five people. There may have been as many as a hundred. It just depends. But that was not uncommon. As soon as I read the description, I was like,  Oh, yeah, that s your typical prep school party, where it s just a bunch of kids just going off the rails.  That s the best way to describe it.CORRECTION: This article previously mischaracterized the involvement of individuals in a drug purchase.

We hoped that our experiences   and those of many more who remain nameless   would spur Congress to fundamentally reform the deeply flawed system it now uses to address claims of harassment and discrimination,  the former aides wrote in a letter sent Thursday.  But it has been nearly one year since the #MeToo movement shed needed light on the prevalence of harassment and assault in our workplaces and yet no legislation has become law. We are dismayed and disheartened by Congress s failure to act and take care of its own. The Me Too movement forced congressional leaders to examine Capitol Hill s arcane policies for addressing such claims, a process plagued by a lack of transparency, and one that often had the effect of favoring the alleged perpetrator, not the victim. But Congress has yet to finalize its reforms, despite the House and Senate each passing bipartisan legislation earlier this year   and even as senators this week struggle to address Christine Blasey s sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who helped negotiate the Senate s bill, told HuffPost earlier this week that lawmakers  probably  won t have time to address the final reforms until after the November midterm elections.Some of the reported sticking points in resolving differences between the two bills include whether the legislation should prevent lawmakers from using taxpayer money to settle workplace sexual abuse claims and whether accusers can be provided lawyers to represent them.A spate of lawmakers has resigned in the last year after a cascade of sexual misconduct allegations, including Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.) and Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas).Farenthold s former communications director Lauren Greene, who has described how he sexually harassed her and told another aide about how he had  wet dreams  about her, was one of the signatories of Thursday s letter.The former congressman has yet to pay back his $84,000 taxpayer-funded settlement.As the Me Too movement accelerated last fall, nearly 1,500 former congressional staffers signed a letter in November calling on Congress to improve its sexual misconduct procedures. Kristin Nicholson and Travis Moore, who founded the group Congress Too, spearheaded the campaign. Anna, Rebecca, Ally, Katherine, Winsome, Lauren, and Melanie have bravely shared their stories of sexual harassment and abuse on Capitol Hill, and Congress needs to act,  Nicholson and Moore said in a statement Thursday.  As they and countless former colleagues have recounted publicly and privately, Congress has a sexual harassment problem. Members of our group have described a climate of fear and secrecy, a burdensome and confusing reporting process, and a system designed to protect congressional offices at the expense of victims.

Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) opened a debate in his home district Thursday by joking that he almost had to skip it and return to Washington to deal with a new sexual assault allegation concerning the Supreme Court Did y all hear this latest late-breaking news on the Kavanaugh hearings?  Norman asked the crowd at the Kiwanis Club of Rock Hill, South Carolina.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg came out saying she was groped by Abraham Lincoln. Norman was mocking the allegation by California college professor Christine Blasey Ford that Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump s pick for Supreme Court, held her down and sexually assaulted her at a party when they were both in high school. He also was mocking the high court s oldest justice, the 85-year-old Ginsburg.According to the Charleston-based Post and Courier, Norman s crack  appeared to elicit some scattered nervous laughter and applause  from the debate crowd. The South Carolina Democratic Party was quick to condemn the tasteless joke. This is disgusting. What sexist is writing your jokes, @RalphNorman? https://t.co/Ah8rh37VfbNorman is not the first prominent Republican to make light of Blasey s allegation. Donald Trump Jr., in an Instagram post earlier this week, seemingly compared the alleged interaction between Blasey and Kavanaugh to a schoolyard crush. A post shared by Donald Trump Jr. (@donaldjtrumpjr) on Sep 15, 2018 at 12:30pm PDTBlasey s allegation, of course, is serious. She told The Washington Post that she thought Kavanaugh might inadvertently kill her while, she said, he held her down and cupped his hand over her mouth to silence her screams. She and her lawyers have urged the Federal Bureau of Investigation to review the incident and she is negotiating with the Senate Judiciary Committee about testifying before it next week.Norman barely defeated Democrat Archie Parnell in a June 2017 special election for the House seat. The two face each other again in November s midterm election and they were squaring off in a debate when Norman made his joke.Parnell has had to deal with controversy stemming from his 1973 divorce, which according to court records was granted to his then-wife  on the ground of physical cruelty.

But after she learned how he allegedly pinned down a teen girl and groped her in high school, she recalled similar situations with her classmates at a high school in Brooklyn. Some of these boys don t know how to keep their hands to themselves,  she said, sitting with three friends on a bench in Fort Greene park.  We get a lot of cases of sexual assault and stuff like that.  She described how guys touch girls without asking or peer pressure them into having sex at parties even when they are too drunk to fully consent. Ashanti said social media was also a problem. She described how teen boys will encourage girls to send them sexy pictures and then post them to Facebook or Instagram without their permission.  Excuse my language,  she said, but  this generation is fucked up. On a Wednesday afternoon in Brooklyn, while most schools in New York City were closed for the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur, HuffPost talked to many male and female teenagers about their opinion of Kavanaugh, and their experiences with sexual consent and rape culture.Most teens HuffPost talked to had not heard of the Supreme Court nominee, but they could relate to what he was accused of doing. Rampant rape culture in schools is very much alive and well, they said, in part because teachers never discuss consent in the classroom. What s even more surprising is that despite coming of age in the Me Too era, a time when teens are more self-aware than ever before, many kids said misogyny and harassment are ubiquitous in their school lives. After School Rape JokesFour teenage girls crowded around the steps of a brownstone and talked about rape jokes.  No means yes, and yes means anal,   said 13-year-old Nia, a student at a liberal arts K-8 school in Brooklyn.

Oona and her friends, whose last names HuffPost withheld to protect their privacy, stopped at a hole-in-the-wall called Mario s Pizzeria to eat before heading to a nearby park. Though the girls say their school is more progressive and open-minded than others, they still hear misogynistic comments. It s the culture,  says Oona.  [Boys] have to do it to be cool and to be part of the crew.  They believe their friends are joking, and they don t feel physically threatened   after all, in eighth grade, most of the girls are taller than the boys, she said.But when the girls thought about the jokes a little longer ñ and how jokes can escalate into the kind of assault allegations currently facing Kavanaugh ñ they become more somber.  It is upsetting,  said Nia s classmate, 13-year old Sadie, dressed in a Jimi Hendrix T-shirt and army pants. While she believes some boys are just joking around, she worries about other boys.  We re a relatively small school, but I don t know where everyone s mind is,  she said.The Boys Worry, Too  Sean, a 15-year-old who attends the Catholic high school Bishop Loughlin Memorial, said his male peers often become more aggressive if a girl rejects their advances.  Hearing  No  makes them want it more,  he said, sitting in Fort Greene park and watching a high school football practice. Wearing his school s uniform navy blue pants and a black tank top, Sean said he worries that rape culture is becoming  worse and worse  because teens are raised with  less boundaries and less manners.  His classmate, 15-year-old Jah, said he believes his friends, who are fluent in  hook-up culture,  are more promiscuous than any generation before. That means conversations about consent don t happen. Instead, when hooking up one person just assumes,  you may be down or okay with it, when that s not the case.  Carlos, a 13-year-old who attends a charter school in Brooklyn, said he sometimes sees his male classmates touching or play fighting with girls in a way that  crosses a line.  He said the department of education should require teachers to talk about consent.  You got to be taught how to control yourself,  he said, standing on a street corner in Fort Greene.  Kids are going through puberty, and they are getting horny and stuff. So I think they should be taught and be more mindful of what they re doing.  Sex Ed Gets A Failing GradeThough some teens told HuffPost their male classmates would never act like Kavanaugh allegedly did, they all agreed that sexual education curriculums fail to talk about consent. Most said the issue has never even come up. They described how sex ed programs mostly covered anatomy and disease, rather than desperately-needed conversations about power dynamics, gender roles and alcohol. Sadie, the eighth-grader from a liberal arts school in Brooklyn, said kids should learn about consent at a young age, so that by the time teens start having sexual experiences, they know how to ask each other questions about boundaries. There is this myth of sex, where you don t ask questions, and it s just something that happens,  she said.  It s more complicated than that. You have to be on the same page as the other person at all times. She and her friends said they worried that though they have a sophisticated grasp of consent, their male peers do not. They don t think about it,  said Nia.  At this age between boys and girls, there s a huge maturity gap.  Jah said he would like to talk more about consent in school, but that the Catholic sex ed program teaches him to  practice abstinence, which may not be as realistic. Jah said he thinks people have a responsibility to speak up when they feel uncomfortable in sexual situations, rather than after-the-fact.  A lot of girls, they kind of feel bad and don t say how they feel,  he said.  They could have said  I m not okay with this,  and the whole situation could have been avoided. Honesty is important.

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, to discuss a potential hearing, Politico reported.The lawyers requested that the hearing take place next Thursday and that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh deliver his testimony first, according to sources familiar with the discussions. They also said Blasey was opposed to being questioned by outside counsel and asked that there be only one camera allowed in the room.Grassley s office confirmed the call had taken place in a statement and said the senator would  consult with his colleagues on the committee. No commitment or deal yet on a hearing with Ford, per new Grassley statement:  Chairman Grassley s staff had a call with Dr. Ford s attorneys today to discuss receiving her testimony in the Judiciary Committee, and will consult with his colleagues on the committee. PREVIOUSLY: Christine Blasey Ford, the psychology professor who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both in high school, said she would be willing to negotiate the terms of testifying next week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, her lawyers said Thursday. She wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety,  Blasey s attorney said in an email to the committee.NEW: Text of e-mail from Christine Blasey Ford s lawyer to Senate Judiciary Committee. pic.twitter.com/UlRZVEUhxmBlasey s lawyer said a hearing on Monday, as initially planned, was  not possible  and that the insistence of some key Republicans on the committee that it move forward on that date was  arbitrary. The professor on Tuesday called for an FBI investigation into her allegations before she testified. But the Justice Department indicated it had no intention of reopening its background investigation of Kavanaugh, telling NPR in a statement that the FBI  does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation.  The purpose of a background investigation is to determine whether the nominee could pose a risk to the national security of the United States,  the agency said.  The allegation does not involve any potential federal crime. The FBI s role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, also rejected calls that the FBI help investigate Blasey s claims and earlier in the week appeared immovable on the Monday hearing date. We ve offered Dr. Ford the opportunity to share her story with the committee, as her attorney said yesterday she was willing to do,  Grassley said in a statement Tuesday.  We offered her a public or a private hearing as well as staff-led interviews, whichever makes her most comfortable. The invitation for Monday still stands. Democrats, however, supported Blasey s request and accused the GOP of rushing the process while attempting to put Blasey on the national stage before the allegations could be properly looked into. I support Dr. Blasey Ford s request for an FBI background investigation before a hearing,  Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said Tuesday on Twitter.  She should not be bullied into participating in a biased process and we should not rush forward before facts are gathered. Blasey has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a party when they were both in high school in the 1980s. Since coming forward with her allegations, her attorney said in the email Thursday,  she has been receiving death threats, which have been reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and she and her family have been forced out of their home. The prospect of rehashing her alleged sexual assault on a public stage is also complicated by the fact that every Republican senator on the committee is male, and lawmakers are known to employ aggressive questioning during hearings. For that reason, HuffPost learned Tuesday that Republicans on the committee were considering having their female aides or lawyers question Blasey and Kavanaugh should she testify about her allegation.Committee Republicans reportedly decided earlier on Thursday to hire an outside counsel to lead their questioning of Blasey during a hearing, The New York Times reported. They have yet to hire someone to fill the role, a Republican Senate official familiar with the decision told the Times.This article has been updated with Thursday night talks over a hearing time.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Unless a full and fair investigation is conducted, Harvard Law School cannot allow Kavanaugh to continue teaching its students and the Senate cannot confirm him to the Supreme Court,  write Molly Coleman, Vail Kohnert-Yount, Jake Meiseles and Sejal Singh in a new op-ed in The Harvard Law Record, a student publication.Kavanaugh has been a lecturer at the law school since 2009, and is scheduled to return in the new year for a course called  The Supreme Court since 2005.  Kavanaugh, who is up for consideration for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, is facing sexual misconduct allegations from Christine Blasey Ford.A number of Kavanaugh s former students signed a letter of support for his confirmation. While many of them still stand by him, at least two have said they no longer do. Coleman, Kohnert-Young, Meiseles and Singh are part of a group known as the Pipeline Parity Project, which is working to end harassment and discrimination in the legal profession.Kohnert-Yount told HuffPost that as a woman, she wouldn t be comfortable taking Kavanaugh s class and that by continuing to have him teach at the school, it puts students in a  very uncomfortable position and necessitates that vulnerable people self-select out of a learning opportunity. Meiseles said Kavanaugh is known as a  feeder judge,  meaning getting a position with him or getting him to help can lead to prestigious jobs in the judiciary, often on the Supreme Court. But there would be an  unfair burden on women  who wouldn t feel comfortable being in his class, and they would therefore be losing out on a career opportunity.The Pipeline Parity Project will also be handing out buttons that say,  I Believe Christine Blasey Ford. Blasey alleges that when they were at a party in high school, Kavanaugh locked her in a room, pinned her to a bed and attempted to remove her clothes   while covering her mouth with his hand to stop her from screaming. Kavanaugh has denied her claims.Kavanaugh also allegedly preferred his female clerks to have a  certain look.  A student at Yale Law School told HuffPost that she was told by her professors to dress a certain way if she was going to interview for a position with Kavanaugh.Harvard Law School did not return a request for comment. The students also said that so far, they have not received any word from the school administration. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

We have to all take a step back and be respectful of Professor Ford. This is not only, if it is true, it is not only a sexual assault   it s a childhood sexual assault,  New York Times columnist Charles Blow said on a Wednesday night segment of CNN s  Cuomo Prime Time.   And if you have never been the victim of a childhood sexual assault, everybody needs to calm down and take a step back. Stop asking why she didn t say anything. The conversation, which included CNN anchor Chris Cuomo and two other commentators, surrounded the recent accusation of the professor, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally. She publicly accused Kavanaugh on Sunday of sexually assaulting her in 1982 when the two were at a high school party. As a victim of childhood sexual assault himself, Blow urged the Senate Judiciary Committee and the general public to understand why Blasey didn t tell her story for so long.  The first time I told somebody was 17 years later, a stranger. Next time I told somebody was two years after that. Next time I told somebody was eight years after that. It was 37 years before I told everybody in the world in a book,  Blow continued, referring to his 2014 book Fire Shut Up in My Bones. Blasey had initially resisted going public with her story because she believed speaking up about Kavanaugh could ruin her life and have little effect on his confirmation. After attempting to speak anonymously to lawmakers and, later, media leaking her story, she spoke on the record to The Washington Post in a story published Sunday. Charles Blow talks about being assaulted as a child and why he never told anyone for 17 years - and says rushing ford is wrong and that we must take every step to get closer to knowing if kavanaugh is lying because he can not be confirmed if he is pic.twitter.com/sMUFB2zyvVAlthough she remembers the specifics of the alleged assault, Blasey has said she has trouble remembering how she got to the house where she says the assault happened and the exact time frame. Blow said the things Blasey remembers and doesn t remember are understandable.  I understand how if this happened to her and she can remember everything in that room and not the day,  he said. For us, it is a living thing that lives in our bodies. You wrestle with it all the time. I can t say that I thought about [my assault] every day but I thought about it all the time. It was a living memory,  he continued.  It didn t move like other memories in my brain where it starts to fade. You re thinking about it all the time, so all of that minutiae   he stood there, they turned the music on   all of that is alive in you. Blow called for a trauma-informed investigation and backed up Blasey s request for an FBI investigation into her claim. Is this her first time ever going to be in a room with this man if in fact he did what [she said] he did?  he asked.  I just find that all of our discussions around this are all about politics and all about whether or not people are making the moves   and none of it is about whether or not, in fact, this was a childhood sexual abuse. Kavanaugh has agreed to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday, but Blasey has yet to commit to testify. Kavanaugh s hearings before the committee concluded last week, but its vote was postponed to schedule a hearing on Blasey s accusation. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The headline,  What s changed,  suggests that as history repeats with allegations of sexual misconduct, Kavanaugh s Senate confirmation process is happening in a world very different than the one faced by Thomas.TIME s new cover: Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court confirmation is now the ultimate test of political power in 2018 https://t.co/IbFrdpGVxo pic.twitter.com/Ca171TM8ZtThomas, who eventually was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice, was embroiled in controversy when law professor Anita Hill alleged he repeatedly made sexual and romantic advances despite her rebuffs. Some called Hill a liar and said she fabricated the allegations to keep Thomas off the court.Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor who alleges he pinned her down, groped her and tried to take off her clothes when they were in high school. Since the allegation was made public last week, supporters of Kavanaugh and Blasey have come out in full force to take sides. The Time cover is tethered to a piece by Molly Ball titled  Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court Confirmation Is Now the Ultimate Test of Political Power in 2018.  It explores what happened to Blasey back in high school and the fallout of coming forward in the era of Me Too.Me Too, which gained strength last fall in the wake of allegations that toppled Hollywood titan Harvey Weinstein, has since brought down other powerful men who have done horrific things.Ball references this momentum in her Time article: Every week brings new variations on the theme of women, racked with pain and rage, rising up in protest after too many years of trauma and terrified silence. Every week, too, has brought fresh reminders of the extent to which our whole reality is the product of the privilege and prejudices of entitled men. They decided what the story was, who got ahead, what the laws were and to whom they applied.The men handled the disruptions quickly and quietly, with lawyers and payments and handshakes, with the grip of a policeman s fist and a gavel pounded on a desk. Until suddenly there were too many to be contained. Yet, this momentum is greatly flawed. Women still are sometimes not believed, and allegations against some men in power   say, the president   seem to bounce off. Into this storm will step two people, a man and a woman, who were once a boy and a girl, who may or may not have collided on a hot suburban night so many years ago,  writes Ball. What happens next will answer the central question: Decisions have consequences   but for whom? "

In that time, others retweeted the messages and copied them onto Reddit, further disseminating Blasey s contact details. Since coming forward as the woman accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the psychology professor who lives in Northern California has been bombarded with death threats and harassment, and has reportedly gone into hiding with her family.Twitter initially let the troll who posted Blasey s personal information back on its platform after less than a day.  Twitter banned me for 12 hours. I m back lol,  he wrote Monday morning, then continued tweeting the details about the professor. Twitter suspended his account again on Monday evening. Twitter officials declined to answer HuffPost s questions about why he was allowed to continue his doxxing campaign after his initial suspension, or why his offending tweets remained online for so long. We do not proactively look for content that breaks our rules,  a spokesperson said.  The actions we take are not dependent on the number of reports we receive. Doxxing, or posting someone s private details online, is among the most common forms of harassment on Twitter. For trolls, it s a quick and impactful way to abuse   and in some cases, endanger   their targets. Twitter prohibits the practice in its terms of service and acknowledges that it  may pose serious safety and security risks for the person whose information is shared,  but the platform is notoriously bad at addressing the issue when it occurs. Twitter relies on its users to bring abusive behavior to its attention, then it determines if the reported posts should be removed. The platform is often slow to respond even to urgent reports, and regularly allows malicious content to spread and gain traction before it gets removed   if it gets taken off at all. The company spokesperson directed HuffPost to a tweet thread about new anti-abuse measures Twitter rolled out last year.  We ve launched an improved version of the system we use to rank reports for our review,  it reads.  The system is now incorporating new signals to help us more quickly and efficiently identify content that may break our rules. That approach, Twitter claims, should help prioritize reports of abusive behavior  directed at an individual.  Twitter s spokesperson declined to comment on why hundreds of reports about a doxxing campaign targeting an alleged victim of sexual assault were unaddressed for hours under the new system.According to the profile for the doxxer s account, which HuffPost is not naming or linking to so as to not draw more attention to Blasey s personal info, he is a  Conservative, Republican and Trump Supporter  who lives in Philadelphia. HuffPost contacted a pastor by the same name who also lives in Philadelphia, and whose photos on Facebook and LinkedIn appear to match the Twitter user. The pastor confirmed that he owns the email address that was used to create the Twitter account in 2009, but insisted he s never used the platform himself. He suggested someone had stolen his identity.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Dean Heller of Nevada, a Republican facing a tough re-election fight in November, predicted on Wednesday that Brett Kavanaugh will get confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the  hiccup  of the sexual assault allegation made against him by Christine Blasey Ford, a college professor in Northern California. I m really grateful for the White House, for the effort of President (Donald) Trump and what he has done, and the excitement that we have,  Heller said on a conference call with Nevada GOP leaders, according to The Nevada Independent.  We got a little hiccup here with the Kavanaugh nomination; we ll get through this and we ll get off to the races. Few senators have expressed such confidence in Kavanaugh s confirmation proceeding relatively smoothly just days after Blasey went public with the bombshell accusation. Most of his GOP colleagues, even Trump, have struck a more cautious tone, maintaining that Kavanaugh s accuser deserves an opportunity to be heard in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled on Monday. I d have to see what she has to say,  Trump told reporters on Wednesday.The politics surrounding the hearing are extremely risky for Republicans. Appearing insensitive or dismissing a woman s allegation outright could harm their chances of retaining congressional majorities in November s midterm elections.The dismissive treatment of Anita Hill and the sexual misconduct allegations she lodged against Clarence Thomas at his confirmation hearings for a Supreme Court seat in late 1991 is credited, in part, with sparking the  Year of the Women  in the 1992 elections. This year, Democrats have nominated a record number of female House candidates, including in a number of states crucial to control of the chamber.A spokeswoman for Heller s Democratic opponent, Rep. Jacky Rosen, quickly criticized the senator for his  hiccup  comment. I hope Sen. Heller knows that when he shamelessly dismisses allegations of this magnitude against a nominee seeking a lifetime appointment to the nation s highest court, Nevada women are listening,  Molly Forgey said.  Make no mistake, we will hold Sen. Heller accountable at the ballot box. Recent polls have shown Rosen with a slight edge in the race.Some Republicans haven t hesitated to voice skepticism about the allegation by Blasey, who claimed Kavanaugh held her down in a bedroom at a house party when they were both in high school in the Washington area and attempted to force himself on her. This has been a drive-by shooting when it comes to Kavanaugh,  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told The Washington Post  this week.  I ll listen to the lady, but we re going to bring this to a close.  Blasey s lawyers said quotes like the one from Graham, a Judiciary Committee member, as well as from Heller show that many GOP senators have already pre-judged her, necessitating an FBI investigation and the questioning of others about the woman s allegation prior to her testifying before the Senate panel.  The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the committee discovering the truth,  Lisa Banks, Blasey s lawyer, said in a statement on Wednesday.It appears increasingly likely that if Blasey fails to appear before the Senate on Monday, Republicans will push forward with the confirmation process. Centrist GOP senators have said they don t want a vote on Kavanaugh delayed, regardless of whether she testifies.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) is once again not holding back her thoughts on how the Senate Judiciary Committee is dealing with the recent sexual assault accusation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.  I would like us to come together and figure out what is the best way to proceed,  Hirono told ABC News on Wednesday evening. Not this seat-of-the-pants stuff,  she added.  The latest, being a letter from the chairman to the Democrats saying,  We have done everything we can to contact her.  That is such bullshit, I can t hardly stand it. Hirono was referring to a letter from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to Senate Democrats about Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally. In a Washington Post report published Sunday, Blasey publicly accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982 when the two were at a high school party. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation against him. It s montage time!! New video: Senators weigh in on upcoming deadline for Ford testimony on Kavanaugh allegations - @ABC News https://t.co/VRMA66HYZ0Garrett Ventry, a communications adviser to Grassley, responded on Twitter to Hirono s claim, calling her comments  nonsense.    This is such nonsense. The Committee has sent 9 emails and left 2 voicemails,  Ventry tweeted. The committee s hearings on Kavanaugh concluded last week, but its vote on the confirmation was postponed in order to add one more hearing on Blasey s accusation. The Supreme Court candidate has agreed to testify on the issue in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday.Blasey, however, has not committed to testifying, asking that the FBI investigate her claims first.   The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth,  Blasey s attorney Lisa Banks said in a Wednesday statement.  She continues to believe that a full non-partisan investigation of this matter is needed and she is willing to cooperate with the Committee. Since Blasey came forward, she and her family have received death threats, forcing them to move from their home.On Tuesday, Hirono asked men on the Senate Judiciary Committee and around the country to  step up  in the face of the accusation against Kavanaugh.  I expect the men in this country and the men in this committee ... to demand an FBI investigation. But really, guess who s perpetuating all of these kinds of actions? It s the men in this country,  she said, adding later:  I just want to say to the men in this country, just shut up and step up. Do the right thing for a change.

Souza   a fierce critic of the current White House who has his own Trump-trolling photo book out in October   criticized the senators for rushing toward a vote on Kavanaugh s nomination  without an FBI investigation  into the alleged assault because of Trump s assertion it was  not their thing.  The  I  in FBI stands for  investigation,   he noted.

Right now Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court hangs in the balance as he faces an accusation that he sexually assaulted a girl in high school. The professors proffering the advice are themselves well-known. Both Jed Rubenfeld and his wife, Amy Chua, author of the controversial 2011 book The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, told this woman about Kavanaugh s preferences. Then, Kavanaugh was simply known as a prestigious judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.Though neither said the judge did anything untoward regarding the women he worked with, the student found their counsel off-putting.  I had mixed feelings,  said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous due to privacy concerns.  On the one hand, it s a yellow flag; on the other hand, phew, I hadn t heard anything else. Her first inkling that there might be issues with Kavanaugh came from Rubenfeld in a conversation about various judges with whom she might work. Rubenfeld took care to warn her about two judges in particular: First, Alex Kozinski, then a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, was known to sexually harass his clerks, he told her. (Kozinski retired in December amid accusations of harassment.) The other was Kavanaugh. Though the judge was known to hire female clerks who had a  certain look,  Rubenfeld told her, he emphasized that he had heard nothing else untoward. He did not say what the  certain look  was. I did not ask,  the woman said.  It was very clear to me that he was talking about physical appearance, because it was phrased as a warning   and because it came after the warning about Judge Kozinski. On a separate occasion last year, Chua offered more detail, telling a group of students that it s  not an accident  that Kavanaugh s law clerks  look like models,  Chua said, according to an account published in The Guardian on Thursday. The comments echoed those told to a group of Yale students over drinks with Chua last year, three of whom spoke with HuffPost.The woman who was warned a few years ago said that she had already heard rumors about Kozinski and had ruled out a clerkship with him. While she saw the warning about Kozinski as a flashing red signal, the advice on Kavanaugh didn t stop her from deciding to interview with him.That s when Rubenfeld s wife stepped in. At Yale, Chua is less known as the  tiger mom  and more sought after for her ability to help students land prestigious clerkships with federal judges   the sort that can ultimately land a student the ultimate prize, a spot clerking for a Supreme Court justice.Indeed, Kavanaugh was once a clerk for Kozinski before nabbing a spot as Justice Anthony Kennedy s clerk on the Supreme Court. (Kavanaugh has denied knowing about Kozinski s reputation with women.)To the female law student, Chua echoed Rubenfeld s comments. She advised me to be and dress  outgoing,   the former Yale student said.  She strongly urged me to send her pictures of what I was thinking of wearing so she could evaluate. I did not. At the time the student said she didn t know if this sartorial advice was about her own look, Kavanaugh s preferences or Chua s ideas about what Kavanaugh liked. A friend suggested that the student needed the advice because she was  awkward,  according to a transcript of a Gchat conversation that the Yale student had at the time and that was viewed by HuffPost.The woman said she was not sure if Chua was giving this advice to others.  She did, however, say that she offers members of her small group the  opportunity  to send her photos so she can help them figure out what to wear for interviews.  For the more than ten years I ve known him, Judge Kavanaugh s first and only litmus test in hiring has been excellence,  Chua told HuffPost in a response to a request for comment from both professors. The statement was sent from a hospital where Chua has been confined with an undisclosed serious illness. The statement didn t deny the student s account, but it s glowing in its praise of Kavanaugh, echoing a piece Chua recently wrote for The Wall Street Journal,  Kavanaugh Is a Mentor to Women,  in which she boasts of placing 10 clerks with Judge Kavanaugh,  eight of them women.  Their daughter just accepted a clerkship with Kavanaugh, the statement said. As I wrote in the Wall Street Journal, he has also been an exceptional mentor to his female clerks,  she said in the statement.  Among my proudest moments as a parent was the day I learned our daughter would join those ranks. The statement added that Kavanaugh s clerks have been a  diverse  group.Travis Lenkner, who clerked for Kavanaugh in 2007 and 2008, said the idea that Kavanaugh had a certain look in mind for female clerks is absurd. There s only one  look  that is a requirement in Judge Kavanaugh s chambers for men and women,  he said.  And that is that a suit is required every day. It s a formal chambers in a formal courthouse.  Otherwise, the racial, ethnic and ideological diversity of his clerks is unmatched in the entire federal judiciary, including the diversity of his Yale clerks recommended by professor Chua,  Lenkner said.Giving law students advice on what to wear to an interview isn t terribly odd, but the particular warning about Kavanaugh is unusual, said Vivia Chen, a senior columnist at The American Lawyer magazine who writes about gender and the legal profession. Typically the advice would be more general, like wear a nice suit, she said.  It sounds sexist,  Chen said.  If you re going into that kind of detail, it sounds like the judge has a fetish, frankly, and that the law professors are feeding the fetish. Chen, who knows Chua, suspects the professor was just trying to help her student.  I could see her being gossipy and free with her advice. That s not necessarily a bad thing,  Chen said.  In some ways, you want a professor who s helping with your career to help you. In the end, the law student interviewed with Kavanaugh and said nothing unusual happened, but she wound up clerking for another judge. Ashley Feinberg and Paul Blumenthal contributed reporting.

During a 90-minute meeting in July, Blasey alleged that a  stumbling drunk  Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her at a party when they were both in high school in the 1980s. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, also heard about Blasey s allegation, which was made public last week. Blasey came forward as Kavanaugh s accuser in an interview on Sunday.Blasey had initially resisted efforts to go on the record, and Eshoo told The Washington Post on Wednesday that the professor was  really terrified about what could become of her and her family.  Eshoo described Blasey as courageous and said she came away from that meeting believing her. It was more than obvious to me that she bore the scars of what she had been subjected to,  Eshoo told the Post, describing Blasey as  not having a political bone in her body. Eshoo continued:  At the end of the meeting, I told her that I believed her. In telling her story, you know, there were details to it, and I believed her.  She was worried about her family.

But top GOP senators agreed to hear from both Kavanaugh and Blasey on Monday. Democrats, however, have accused their colleagues of rushing into a hearing, calling on the Justice Department to investigate Blasey s allegations before Kavanaugh s nomination proceeds.Blasey s lawyers have also accused Republicans of acting in bad faith. The Committee s stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation; there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding,  Blasey s lawyer Lisa Banks said in a statement to the Post on Wednesday.  The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth. Eshoo told the Post that despite Kavanaugh s  excellent credentials   character matters.  She s a courageous woman, and she has come forward for all the right reasons,  the lawmaker told The Mercury News.

As a result, President Donald Trump has no shortage of potential Supreme Court nominees he could tap to reliably overturn Roe v. Wade, abolish the minimum wage and declare golf the national pastime. Academia and the federal courts are already littered with professional conservatives pre-approved by The Federalist Society and the GOP donor class. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump even released a list of 25 potential candidates for the sole purpose of proving to a skeptical Republican leadership that he was, in fact, one of their own.Of all the names on that list, Brett Kavanaugh is currently the most unreliable vehicle for securing Republican policy victories. Aside from Christine Blasey Ford s accusation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school   an account that at least one of her classmates recalls hearing during their time together at elite Washington prep schools   he appears to have lied to Congress during prior confirmation hearings to the federal appeals court. If Senate Republicans ram through Kavanaugh s nomination, they will sustain heavy political damage   six weeks before an election   for a Supreme Court justice who could well find himself the legitimate subject of impeachment proceedings after entering office. This is the sort of gamble a political strategist suggests only under extreme duress, when there are no better options available. But, of course, there are at least 24 other good options waiting in the wings. With a little procedural ruthlessness, any one of them could be confirmed before Congress returns in January with, as seems likely, more Democratic members.And yet the conservative movement and even self-styled moderate Senate Republicans remain united behind Kavanaugh in the aftermath of Blasey s allegations. They not only want him confirmed, they want him confirmed now. They cannot part with their man for a simple reason: Brett Kavanaugh has become a poster child for the American aristocracy. His confirmation   every bit as much as the cases he might one day decide   has become a test-case for the bounds of elite domination. Conservative intellectuals offer all sorts of theoretical rationales for their policy agenda: Free markets do not leave us vulnerable to financial collapse; they unleash human potential. Opposition to same-sex marriage is not about crass bigotry but the preservation of precious religious liberty. The smash-and-grab nature of the Trump presidency has strained all of these justifications. After losing the popular vote, Trump   elected with the support of a hostile foreign power with which he remains very cozy   has proceeded to cut trillions of dollars in taxes for the super-rich, deregulate the banking industry, launch a campaign of terror against immigrant children and nominate arch-conservatives to the Supreme Court. For a time, political commentators in Washington talked about the Goldman Sachs wing of the Trump White House at war with the populist wing, wondering if the responsible, well-heeled members of the administration would keep the rednecks in line. But the reality of Republican rule has been a unified project exacerbating all existing social inequalities   race, class and gender alike. Conservatism appears to be what its prominent left-wing critics have long maintained: a system of elite domination, imposed at any cost. Kavanaugh attended all the right schools, from Georgetown Prep to Yale Law. His neighbors in Chevy Chase, Maryland, one of the richest neighborhoods in the capital area, eagerly celebrated his nomination when it was announced in July, as a Yale Law professor and the school itself trumpeted his glory. His nomination is now a referendum on that aristocracy   one whose very existence and protection is the primary goal of conservative government.To participate in this aristocracy is to enjoy the comforts of fine living   calm neighborhoods, well-engineered automobiles, intellectually engaging art. But its highest pleasure is the knowledge shared among its members that they live above democratic accountability, that their words and deeds are not constrained by the broader political community the way the words and deeds of mere citizens can be. As Jamelle Bouie observes for Slate, recent crises have extended the scope of this elite immunity   from the invasion of Iraq to the CIA s secret torture program to the financial crash of 2008.If Kavanaugh s path to the Supreme Court cannot even be slowed by a credible sexual assault allegation, it will demonstrate one more dimension in which the American aristocracy is indeed beyond the reach of the rabble.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Kavanaugh s confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court could give the anti-abortion movement a clear path to dismantle Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Professor Christine Blasey Ford s allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were high school students has the potential to jeopardize Kavanaugh s confirmation. But that doesn t mean all abortion rights foes are entirely dismissing her. HuffPost reached out to members of the movement. Here s what they had to say: Jennifer Christie, anti-abortion speaker from Virginia I became pregnant after a brutal sexual assault by a stranger 4Ω years ago. There was not a question of abortion. It didn t occur to [my husband and me]. Everyone s telling you you re crazy, this is a monster s baby. That s not the way it feels. I think there s a lot of concern   at least in the community that I work with    that Judge Kavanaugh won t do anything to overturn Roe v. Wade. I m holding off on judging completely, but I m cynical. I don t think that a woman claiming sexual assault should ever be dismissed. I think Ford needs to be heard. That s the bottom line. And Kavanaugh also needs to have an opportunity for a fair trial. We re always accused of inventing stories or trying to bring people down, so I would never say that about another woman. But also, as the mother of four sons, I worry all it takes is an allegation and their lives are over. Unfortunately, a lot of people are like,  well, why did Ford wait so many years?  I don t think that s a credible argument at all. It s incredibly difficult for a woman to come forward about something like this.  I d like to think, as a movement, we are not jumping to side with Kavanaugh or dismissing a woman s allegation. In my circles, we re just waiting to see. We want justice to be served. Rebecca Kiessling, president of Save The 1I believe that she needs to have an opportunity to be heard but disappointed to hear she won t testify on Monday. [The accuser, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, said through attorneys that she wants the FBI to investigate before testifying.] I was definitely concerned there could have been a potential for blocking a nomination because of an anonymous allegation. That s not our system of justice. I m torn, because I ve always said how important it is to give rape victims the benefit of the doubt. My own dear mother was a rape victim. My biological father was never convicted. But, in my situation, my mother told people right away. She told family members, friends, she went to the police, it s in my adoption records. I know there are situations where women bury it and don t say anything for years .... I know that s really, really common. I feel for women who have held this secret for so many years. It s not easy. We ll see what happens during the committee hearing, whether she ll ultimately be willing to testify. I understand that s going to be difficult, but you can t expect to block a Supreme Court nomination with anonymous allegations.I care about the success of the pro-life movement more than pretty much anything, but I don t think this is the right read on what s happening with Kavanaugh. We just don t know enough to be this completely dismissive of Ford. https://t.co/O2ENlpHjAhCharles Camosy, board member of Democrats for Life, associate professor in the theology department at Fordham University I ve always thought that we ought to act on behalf [of] nonviolence and the most vulnerable in every situation and for every person. I m for universal health care, strong unions and for the Dream Act. I m against torture and the death penalty and drone strikes. All women deserve to have such claims fully honored. I believe Dr. Ford is credible, but I think there should be a hearing for both sides under oath where we can learn more about the specific claims.[If Blasey s allegation is found to be credible], he should withdraw his nomination. Period. And if he doesn t, the White House should. And if they don t, then pro-lifers in the Senate should vote against him ... we cannot be taken seriously on this issue if we ram through someone we think is a pro-life nominee despite having a record of sexual assault ... and then lying about it in order to secure a lifetime seat on the highest court in the land. I think Amy Coney Barrett [a judge on the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals] would have been a much better choice. And not just in hindsight. From the death penalty to abortion, there is no question about her pro-life credentials.Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist DallasSexual assault is a heinous crime, and I feel empathy for all of those who have been victimized by it. I do not know with certainty who is telling the truth, but what I know with absolute certainty is that Democrats don t care about the truth. ...It s time for this desperate ploy of the Democrats to be brought to a swift conclusion. Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should testify on Sept. 24, and the committee and then the Senate should vote swiftly for confirmation after that.Catherine Glenn Foster, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, which has supported Kavanaugh s nominationEvery woman and man in Dr. Ford s situation deserves to be able to share their story and to be heard, and the Senate Judiciary Committee has appropriately determined that it will proceed to do so via the mechanism outlined by the Framers of the Constitution. We are confident that the truth, wherever that may lead, will be brought to light through the process that is being followed . in a matter as important as this or any instance where a woman or man reports misconduct, there should be a serious examination of the facts in a fair, impartial way, and we trust that the Senate Judiciary Committee is committed to exactly that.Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America We want to see the process go forward to vet the current allegations, but, in looking at the way in which the charges were handled (hidden until the hearings were over and handled by those who have been very public about their goal to oppose this nominee no matter what), we still see Judge Kavanaugh as a qualified candidate who is in the political battle of his life because of the abortion lobby s efforts to keep Roe v. Wade the law of the land. Liz Wolfe, editor and anti-abortion feminist in Austin, Texas It makes me genuinely sad that I see so many people on the right dismissing the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh as lacking in substance. I hate the idea of someone who (may have) attempted to rape a woman becoming a champion for pro-life causes. That s...sickening.People should not automatically believe all victims, nor should they disbelieve all victims. Both liberals and conservatives have partisan blinders on and should search for more evidence.There are lots of pro-lifers like myself who believe that female empowerment does not have to come at the expense of stopping the heartbeat of a fetus. I think pro-lifers have the opportunity to have lots of moral high ground and intellectual consistency. People who try to rape other people should not be associated with us because they clearly do not value human dignity, autonomy or safety.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

It could be if he wanted the bureau to look into it. Christine Blasey Ford, a clinical psychology professor living in California who is professionally known as Christine Blasey, says a  stumbling drunk  Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her over her clothes and covered her mouth with his hand at a party in the suburbs of D.C. in the early 1980s, when they were both teenagers. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation, and the Senate Judiciary Committee has proposed a public hearing from both parties on Monday.Blasey, however, has indicated she d like the FBI to investigate first.

They ve also given no indication they ll subpoena Mark Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh s who Blasey said was in the room during the alleged assault, tumbling onto her and Kavanaugh and allowing her to escape.Trump, who himself has been accused of sexual misconduct by a multitude of women over the course of his career as a real estate mogul and television celebrity, has all but dismissed Blasey s allegation, saying it would be  very hard for me to imagine that anything happened. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told Senate Democrats in a letter on Wednesday that they had a  fundamental misunderstanding of the FBI background investigation process,  and that because Blasey s allegations  are in the public arena, there is no longer a need for a confidential FBI investigation.  Grassley said the Senate couldn t  commandeer  the FBI to conduct its investigation and that the Senate s own staff would be adequate. Former executive and legislative branch officials, however, say there s nothing preventing Trump from asking the FBI to go back and investigate further, even though Kavanaugh s confirmation hearing has already happened and Blasey s story is public.The FBI s investigation, of course, wouldn t be a criminal probe that could result in charges, since Blasey s allegation falls outside the agency s jurisdiction. In requesting a background check, the White House would essentially become the FBI s client, meaning it wouldn t be improper for Trump to ask the agency to take a particular course of action. The FBI s report on the matter would not assess the credibility of the allegation, but rather present the information to the White House.It s not unusual for the White House to ask for more information about a part of a particular nominee s background, and it could do so at the request of senators from either political party, said Rudy Mehrbani, a former Obama administration official now with the Brennan Center for Justice.  This notion that the Senate has no power to  commandeer  an executive branch agency, I think, is not accurate, because they do have the power to persuade the president and the president s attorneys to conduct this follow-up,  Mehrbani said.  This kind of work can be done quickly. The FBI could even be able to conduct the investigation by Monday, argued Sarah Baker, a former associate counsel to President Barack Obama who now serves as executive director of We The Action, an organization that connects lawyers to nonprofits.  This is really easy to do. This is a quick process, I don t think this needs to take more than a couple of days,  Baker said.  The only reason you don t ask is if you don t want the answer. The White House acknowledged on Wednesday that the FBI could and would, if Trump asked, look into Ford s allegation as a supplement to the background investigation it had conducted on Kavanaugh as part of the pre-nomination routine. However, it would be unprecedented and inappropriate to do so with the nomination already in the hands of the Senate, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.S.V.

Just as she and Kavanaugh both know that Clarence Thomas sits on the Supreme Court because, in all probability, he lied   and was duly rewarded by the forces of patriarchy and partisan politics. Only one of them has an incentive to lie.That person is not Blasey (who goes by Christine Blasey professionally). Like Anita Hill, who was called  a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty  after she accused Thomas of sexual harassment, she faces an onslaught of opprobrium which will redefine her life. White male Republicans on the judiciary committee will pick apart every gap in memory to cast her as a mendacious partisan bent on destroying Kavanaugh. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who disdainfully called her  mixed up,  will reprise his contemptuous mistreatment of Hill. Conservative talking heads will insist that she must  prove  her charges. Fixated on cementing the high court s activist majority, all will ignore everything we ve learned about the psychological and practical barriers facing a solitary woman subjected to sexual assault.Applying logic to the charges themselves, there is a very good chance that Blasey s appalling account is accurate; virtually no chance that it is utterly fabricated. We know how difficult it is for a teenage girl now   and even more so in the 1980s   to charge a man with sexual assault. The  rewards  of reprising such a trauma include shame, shaming, ostracism and self-blame. Faced with inevitable misery, countless girls and women have chosen to choke down their suffering at whatever internal cost.After paying that psychic price for 30 years, in 2012 Blasey told her husband and her therapist what Kavanaugh had done   a hard thing in any marriage. Her therapist has the notes. It is illogical   indeed inhumane   to imagine that Blasey deviously sought therapeutic help to plant the seeds of Kavanaugh s destruction should he be nominated to the Supreme Court.Her account is the most vivid at its most terrifying   a drunken Kavanaugh covering her mouth to suppress screams, causing her to fear suffocation; placing his weight on top of her; wrenching at her swimsuit. She places a witness in the room, Mark Judge   further rendering her an exceedingly incautious, therefore improbable, liar.Her account of escaping after Judge jumped on top of them is equally vivid. Her assertion that this happened at an unsupervised teenage party in Montgomery County, Maryland, where Kavanaugh lived, creates the possibility of further witnesses with a general memory of the party itself. Her gaps in recollection, such as the owners of the house itself, are consistent with what we know about trauma and memory, not to mention the passage of time.Moreover, there is ample evidence of the social milieu which Blasey describes: that, as teenagers, Kavanaugh and Judge were participants in a drinking culture which combined entitlement with disinhibition. Indeed Judge has written an account of this period, describing himself as a blackout drunk   and referring to a  Bart O  Kavanaugh  vomiting after excessive drinking.However candid Judge chose to be in print, he has become more reticent in the wake of Blasey s charges. He has alternated between denying them and, more persuasively, claiming a lack of memory. He is firm on only one thing: He does not want to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. That should not be his choice.A final curiosity. According to Hatch, Kavanaugh claimed that he did not attend the party in question. How, then, does he know which party Blasey is describing? Did he never attend teenage parties in Montgomery County? Hatch later walked back the statement, but the oddity lingers.Little wonder, then, that Blasey wants the FBI to investigate her charges   and that Kavanaugh, Donald Trump, and Republican senators do not. An FBI inquiry would require Kavanaugh and Judge to give detailed responses. Moreover, it could uncover witnesses who, at least in general, could corroborate the outlines of her story, including both the nature of the party and the drinking culture in which Kavanaugh and Judge were seemingly immersed. For Kavanaugh and his right-wing patrons, nothing good can come of this search for truth.As of now, it seems likely that the Republicans will try to jam Kavanaugh through the Senate without an FBI investigation, engaging his accuser in a high-stakes inquisition without the support of a genuine investigation. For them, nothing has changed from the playbook they used to trash Anita Hill   which, among its many unsavory features, included preventing testimony from other woman who could corroborate Hill s account of Thomas  behavior. This speaks not only to the complete amorality of the confirmation process, but to the glaring power imbalance between Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh.Blasey is a private citizen, a woman very much alone. Kavanaugh is a polished public figure who has been cosseted since prep school, advancing along a path of privilege opened for him by patrons in the Republican party, and especially the Federalist Society, which grooms ambitious conservatives like Kavanaugh to become politically and ideologically reliable judges. In each step of his advancement   from spearheading Kenneth Starr s attack on Bill Clinton for, ironically, lying about sex, to his service in the White House and subsequent appointment to the federal bench   he has been guided by right-wing ideologues who now expect him, as a justice, to pay his debts.In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kavanaugh did just that   obscuring or eliding the truth about his beliefs and actions in critical areas, pretending to dispassion where his patrons know better. This is not a process which rewards high character, or fidelity to truth.Now Kavanaugh faces the Clarence Thomas test. Thomas  accession tells him that he must unequivocally label Blasey a liar, enabling his sponsors to bulldoze wavering senators. Already he has committed himself to the same blanket denials deployed by Thomas.If, contrary to reason, Blasey is the partisan fabulist painted by Kavanaugh supporters, this is just. But if she is not, the course Kavanaugh seems set on is a grievous sin   against her, against the court, and against our political and communal values. The only winners are ideologues for whom truth is not a value, but an impediment to power.So let us stop to imagine another possibility. That Blasey is telling the truth, at least in essence   but that instead of denying her humanity, Kavanaugh apologizes.I bitterly regret this, he could say   I lied for the sake of ambition and I m sickened by the decades of damage I ve done you. Or, perhaps, I don t fully remember what happened, but I don t drink like that anymore. I m a changed person, appalled by the entitlement and callousness of my teenage self.I recognize that I advanced this far by suppressing the reality of my actions, believing that Blasey would continue to stifle her pain without revealing that I was the cause. I think I can atone, if at all, only by finally telling the truth and asking other men to draw lessons from my behavior then and now. As to my nomination, I leave it to others to judge me, and accept whatever judgment they render.Too little too late, one can fervently object. Never worry   Kavanaugh cannot do this. Not simply because it would likely doom his nomination, but because the corrosive process through which young ideologues become judges creates a mountain of psychic debt. Including telling a terrible lie to advance your patrons  goals.Such is the process through which the right elevates judges to our highest court.Richard North Patterson is the New York Times best-selling author of 22 novels, a former chairman of Common Cause, and a member of the Council On Foreign Relations."

The Committee s stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation; there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding,  Banks said.  The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth. While Blasey (the psychology professor uses the name Christine Blasey professionally) has called on the committee to lead an FBI investigation into her claim before she testifies, Republicans have pushed back in the last day. Among them are Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). Blasey s lawyer also stressed that the extraordinary circumstances make it necessary for her client to have more time before she gives her testimony, which is scheduled for Monday. Dr. Ford was reluctantly thrust into the public spotlight only two days ago,  Banks said.  She is currently unable to go home and is receiving ongoing threats to her and her family s safety. Fairness and respect for her situation dictate that she should have time to deal with this. Though the Justice Department has alluded that it won t reopen any background investigations into Kavanaugh, Democrats on the committee continue to sound support for Blasey s request.  I support Dr. Blasey Ford s request for an FBI background investigation before a hearing,  Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said Tuesday on Twitter.  She should not be bullied into participating in a biased process and we should not rush forward before facts are gathered. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

We are many, but we speak with one voice: Believe us, trust us, stand with us,  the letter, written by reproductive rights activist Alison Turkos, reads. The letter, published online Monday night, asks Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and others on the committee to believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally. On Sunday, Blasey publicly accused Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982 at a high school party. In light of Blasey s allegation, the vote to confirm Kavanaugh has been delayed.  Dr. Blasey Ford s story, all too familiar to many of us, is not to be taken lightly. It is not to be dismissed as  boys being boys.  It is not to be swept under the rug or denied,  the letter continues.  You have the power to make sure that doesn t happen. The statement is signed by 141 survivors from 33 different states, including Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, Turkos said. She is inviting survivors of sexual assault to sign the online letter if they want to. A sexual abuser has no business serving on the highest court in the land. The nomination of Brett Kavanaugh is an insult to all of us   to every survivor who has come forward. Our liberty, our dignity, our humanity demand to be heard and validated,  the letter states.  That is impossible with Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court. Turkos, a survivor of multiple rapes herself, told HuffPost that she was inspired to write the letter because she wanted to ensure that victims of sexual violence were centered in the conversations about Kavanaugh.  Survivors are too often left out of the conversation, our voices and stories are reconfigured by men, the media and those in power. I wanted to lift up and center our voices and experiences, ensure they re not being drowned out and ignored,  Turkos said. She added that in the wake of the Me Too movement, the Senate Judiciary Committee s decision on whether or not to elect Kavanaugh is more important than ever.  This is a crucial moment for senators to do something. We want senators to continue to listen, to continue to act upon these allegations. We will hold these senators accountable, we will never forget this moment,  Turkos said.  I want it to show these senators that Dr. Blasey Ford has the full support of a community, and sadly she s not alone.  Kavanaugh s confirmation hearings concluded last week, but the vote was postponed in order to add one more hearing on Blasey s accusations. The Supreme Court candidate has agreed to testify on the issue in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. Blasey, however, has not committed to testifying, asking that the FBI investigate her claims first.   We are survivors and we will not be silenced,  the letter powerfully concluded.  We stand with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and with all survivors. The question is   will you? Need help?

I feel so badly for him that he s going through this, to be honest with you. I feel so badly for him. This is not a man that deserves this,  Trump said at a White House press conference on Tuesday. It s a shame, because this is a great gentleman,  Trump continued.  I just think that he is at a level that we rarely see, not only in government; anywhere in life. And honestly, I feel terribly for him; for his wife, who is an incredible, lovely woman; and for his beautiful young daughters. I feel terribly for them. Trump has continued to voice his support for Kavanaugh since Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, known professionally as Christine Blasey, publicly accused the judge on Sunday of sexually assaulting her in 1982 during a high school party.Kavanaugh called Blasey s allegation  completely false,  saying that the incident she described  never happened.  But as the president continues to wring his hands about Kavanaugh s suffering, here s what Blasey has had to endure in the last few days:Since Blasey publicly identified herself on Sunday, she has been through hell and back. Twitter users posted Blasey s home address online (an attack known as doxing) at least three separate times, with one user reportedly publishing an aerial image of her home. Blasey s attorneys wrote on Tuesday that their client has been the target of  vicious harassment and even death threats,  adding that she s been impersonated online and had her email hacked. Because of this, Blasey, her husband and their two children have had to take extreme safety precautions that include relocating and going into hiding. Blasey and her husband aren t even able to live with their children out of concern for their safety, a close friend of the family told The Washington Post. In addition to the cost of relocating, there are also sizable legal fees that Blasey and her family will have to shoulder alone.Drudge posted this... it was the wrong Christine ford pic.twitter.com/qfUQV0nRg4Just hours after her story was published, politicians, media critics and internet trolls alike have attacked Blasey s reputation, credibility and motivations for coming forward.Some point to the fact that she s a registered Democrat. Others have questioned her timing, suggesting that she came forward when she did to delay Kavanaugh s confirmation until after the midterm elections. (Blasey first approached lawmakers with her allegations in July, long before she went public.)Meanwhile, Blasey is facing a slew of smear campaigns, including bizarre conspiracy theories that tie her to the Russia investigation and a fabricated story that claims she had an old grudge against Kavanaugh s mom. At one point, an online outlet attempted to disparage Blasey s teaching abilities, publishing an article about her alleged low marks from students on a professor-rating website. The article mistook Blasey, a professor at Palo Alto University, for Christine A. Ford, a former professor at California State University at Fullerton. The story s entire premise was wrong, but it quickly went viral.Blasey had initially resisted going public with her story because she believed speaking up about Kavanaugh could ruin her life and have little effect on his confirmation.  Why suffer through the annihilation if it s not going to matter?  she recalled to The Washington Post on Sunday. One of Blasey s close friends, Jim Gensheimer, recently discussed something she said to him in July while debating whether to come forward or not.  I ve been trying to forget this all my life, and now I m supposed to remember every little detail,  Gensheimer recalled Blasey saying in an interview with The Mercury News.  They re going to be all over me. It s now clear that Blasey s concerns were well-founded. Within just four days of identifying herself,  her worst fears have materialized,  Blasey s attorneys wrote in a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Tuesday. Yet through all of this, Trump feels  terribly  for Kavanaugh. So, let s take a look at what Kavanaugh has had to endure.For the last four days, Kavanaugh has been able to remain in the comfort and privacy of his own home alongside his wife and two daughters (possibly eating cupcakes from Sprinkles). As a federal judge, Kavanaugh s also been afforded the security of the U.S. Marshals Service, which is charged with protecting the federal judiciary. And although his future as a Supreme Court judge is still up in the air, Kavanaugh s career presumably won t suffer from Blasey s allegation. If he loses the Supreme Court seat, he would still be a federal judge with a lifetime appointment (there s almost no chance that he ll get impeached).Additionally, it s worth pointing out that any punishment the judge receives based on Blasey s allegation against him will not be in a criminal court. Kavanaugh s success and access to power will likely continue unimpeded, with or without a Supreme Court seat.Kavanaugh s confirmation hearings concluded last week, but the vote was postponed to schedule a hearing on Blasey s accusations. The judge has agreed to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday.Blasey, however, has not committed to testifying, asking that the FBI investigate her claims first.

Susan Collins (R-Maine), a key vote in Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court nomination, on Wednesday urged the woman who accused the appellate court judge of sexual assault to testify before the Senate next week. I think it s not fair for Judge Kavanaugh for her not to come forward and testify. Both of them need to testify under oath next Monday before the Judiciary Committee,  Collins said in a WVOM radio interview.Christine Blasey Ford, the college professor who went public over the weekend with her allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party in high school, on Tuesday called for an FBI investigation into her claim before she testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Blasey said through her lawyers that an investigation should be  the first step  before she is put  on national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident.  Republicans   even those who initially pushed for postponing a vote on Kavanaugh in order for Blasey to be heard   reacted to her statement on Tuesday with disappointment. They dismissed the possibility of an FBI investigation and urged Blasey to tell her story during the committee s scheduled hearing on Monday, either publicly or behind closed doors. Republicans extended a hand in good faith. If we don t hear from both sides on Monday, let s vote,  tweeted Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), one of the GOP senators who pushed for giving Blasey an opportunity to be heard.Collins, a centrist GOP senator whose voice was instrumental in pressuring Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) into postponing last week s committee vote on Kavanaugh s nomination, expressed concern that Blasey s absence at the hearing would leave  very serious  allegations  hanging over the head of a nominee who has emphatically denied them.  That s just not a good way for this to end,  Collins said.  So I think she needs to come forward and we need to provide her with any protection she may ask for, for herself and her family.  Moreover, Collins did not appear to be swayed by the idea of federal investigators looking into the alleged incident, claiming that the FBI usually does not pursue allegations against a nominee that occurred  when the nominee was a minor.  The senator also echoed President Donald Trump and other Republicans in criticizing Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, for how she handled a letter she received from Blasey in July that detailed the alleged incident. I recognize the letter was an anonymous one, but it seems to me the way it was handled is unfair to both the judge and the professor because it cast a cloud of doubt on both of them,  Collins said in the interview.Sen. Kristen Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), an outspoken supporter of the Me Too movement, meanwhile, told CNN that Blasey shouldn t be  bullied  into appearing at Monday s hearing..@SenGillibrand tells @Acosta that Professor Ford shouldn t be  bullied  into Monday s hearing, and that without an FBI investigation or corroborating witnesses,  it s a sham hearing, and I don t think she should participate in it. With a slim 51-49 Republican majority in the Senate, Collins  vote could prove pivotal to determining whether Kavanaugh ends up on the Supreme Court. Her falling in line with GOP leaders over the matter of the timing of Blasey s testimony bodes well for the Senate s chances of confirming him, barring any other unforeseen circumstances.

It s just a shame that a person like Judge Kavanaugh who has a stellar record   that somebody can bring something up that he did when he was a teenager close to 40 years ago,  Franklin Graham said in an interview Tuesday with the Christian Broadcasting Network.  That s not relevant. Graham is a prominent figure in evangelical Christian circles, partly because of his respected lineage. He is the president of the Christian relief organization Samaritan s Purse and of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association   and a staunch longtime defender of President Donald Trump.He was asked on CBN to comment on the sexual assault accusation against Kavanaugh lodged by Christine Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University in California who goes by Christine Blasey professionally. She said that a drunken Kavanaugh pinned her down and groped her when the two were high school students, around 1982. Blasey sent a confidential letter to members of Congress in July containing her claims. She publicly identified herself in The Washington Post on Sunday. Kavanaugh said he  categorically and unequivocally  denies her claims.Graham said the allegations are an attempt by Democrats to throw a wrench in the conservative judge s confirmation proceedings.  They couldn t find anything else in his record and so this is just an attempt to smear him and to smear his name and put a black dot on it,  Graham told CBN News  Heather Sells. When Sells questioned him about the message his views send to sexual abuse victims, he said,  Well, there wasn t a crime that was committed.  Graham then betrayed a lack of knowledge about Blasey s allegation   suggesting that even if the encounter did happen,  she said no and he respected it and walked away. Sells pushed back to clarify that this isn t the story Blasey came forward with. In fact, Blasey said she feared for her life during the alleged assault and was able to escape only when another person interrupted Kavanaugh. In response, Graham suggested it s not fair to hold people accountable for things they did as teenagers.  There s a lot of things that I ve done when I was a teenager that I certainly am ashamed of and not proud of,  he said.  People are up in arms over this like  oh, this is such a disaster.  You re talking about two teenagers 40 years ago. That has nothing to do with what we re talking about today about this man being a judge on the Supreme court.   And they call it sexual assault?  he added.  No, I don t believe it.  Although Graham is a celebrated figure in American evangelicalism, other evangelicals observing the fallout from Blasey s accusations have come to a different conclusion about how to evaluate her claims. Rachael Denhollander, an evangelical Christian, was the first woman to speak out against former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. In a tweet thread on Sunday, she said that part of the reason she waited so long to come forward was that she had watched friends and family members  eviscerate  victims who spoke out against much-loved candidates, pastors, teams or ministries. That showed me what they REALLY thought about abuse and what they REALLY thought about victims,  Denhollander wrote.  I knew it meant if faced with a choice between a survivor and their favorite  whatever,  they d attack the survivor. Amy Smith is an advocate for abuse survivors who runs Watch Keep, a blog that tracks reported incidents of sexual abuse in Christian communities. She called Graham s comments  irresponsible and reckless    and insensitive toward Blasey. The message he is conveying to anyone suffering from sexual abuse is clear: After a number of years, your pain is irrelevant and should be disregarded,  Smith told HuffPost.She said Graham s argument reflects a mentality she has commonly found among pastors   that sexual assault is a sin to be handled quietly among the parties involved rather than a crime that should be reported to law enforcement. It s no longer acceptable for people to wave off abuse allegations as irrelevant, she said, because the criminal nature of a sexual assault doesn t change, no matter how much time has passed.Christa Brown, a clergy sex abuse survivor who blogs about church cover-ups of abuse, said that Graham s dismissive comments send a  dreadful  message to teenage boys and girls.Sexual assault is not some ordinary  teenage  thing, Brown said. And it s not appropriate for anyone to dismiss allegations of violent behavior. Kavanaugh is being considered for a lifetime appointment as one of the highest judicial officers of the land. His character matters, and the people of this country deserve to have full confidence in his character,  she said. These allegations must be fully vetted by people who are experts in dealing with allegations of sexual violence,  Brown added.  To do anything less than that is to be dismissive of sexual assault and sends a terrible message.

Kavanaugh s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, came forward Sunday in a Washington Post story. She said that when they were teenagers, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed during a party and tried to remove her clothes, covering her mouth with his hand to stifle her screams.Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, a witness Blasey named, have denied the accusation. Republicans have said there is nothing to corroborate Blasey s claim.Early on Tuesday, Miranda said on Twitter she heard about the incident shortly after it happened. Christine Blasey Ford was a year or so behind me, I remember her,  Miranda said in a tweet that can still be viewed via the Google cache.  The incident was spoken about for days afterwards in school. Blasey told the Post that she hadn t told anyone about the incident, which she said occurred during a summer party, until 2012.Miranda deleted her tweet, as well as a lengthier version on Facebook under the name Cristina King, in which she wrote  many of us heard about it in school.  She also said in that post that she had had a crush on Judge.Miranda s name is one of the more than 900 on a letter that circulated among alumnae of Holton-Arms   an all-girls private school in Bethesda, Maryland, that Blasey attended   supporting her. The letter s organizers said they verified all the names with a school directory, but a spokesperson for Holton-Arms declined to confirm Miranda had attended.NBC News reported Wednesday afternoon that it confirmed the social media posts had indeed been posted by the Holton-Arms grad.Another member of the class of 1983 who signed the letter told HuffPost she didn t recall hearing about the incident at that time. Members of Blasey s class of 1984 have written a separate letter supporting their former classmate. Miranda declined an interview request from HuffPost. In a follow-up tweet, she said she deleted her previous post  because it served its purpose and I am now dealing with a slew of requests for interviews from The Wash Post, CNN, CBS News. Organizing how I want to proceed. Was not ready for that, not sure I am interested in pursuing.  In another tweet, apparently written before she spoke to NPR, she said she wouldn t do any media interviews.  To clarify: I do not have first hand knowledge of the incident that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford mentions, and I stand by my support for Christine. That s it. I don t have more to say on the subject. Miranda has since deleted her Twitter account entirely. Amanda Terkel contributed reporting. This article has been updated with information from Miranda s NPR interview. "

More than that, why wouldn t Judge, a classmate and friend of Kavanaugh s during his years at Georgetown Prep in Maryland, himself want to help clear his old high school buddy s name?Judge responded after being contacted by reporters by telling The New Yorker on Friday that he had  no recollection  of any such assault. Later that day, he told The Weekly Standard the accusation is  absolutely nuts,  and claimed,  I never saw Brett act that way. Still, Judge wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday in which he stated he had no intention of cooperating with the committee in any way, while reiterating he had  no memory  of the incident Blasey described.Here s Judge s chance to come to the aid of Kavananah, whom he proudly referred to in a Facebook update shortly after his school chum was nominated to the Supreme Court in July (quipping that Kavanaugh has  the same hair as the night I met him  in 1981). But he s completely backing away. Why?That the question has to be asked at all is the reason why Judge, as well as others who were present at the party Blasey described, must be subpoenaed by the Judiciary Committee to testify.Judge may repeat under oath that he has  no memory  of any sexual assault by Kavanaugh. But he can also be asked questions about Kavanaugh s behavior in high school, including his drinking habits and partying (Blasey said both Kavanaugh and Judge were drunk during the alleged assault) and whether he and Kavanaugh drank so much in those days that they might not remember a sexual assault.Judge has written several memoirs, including, Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk, in which he discussed being a blackout drunk in high school and attending wild parties with his classmates. His testimony is critical to understanding what happened back then.Tuesday night, after GOP Senate leaders resisted Democrats  calls for additional witnesses, Blasey announced she ll only testify after the FBI investigates her accusations. Her attorney, Debra Katz, had said on Monday that her client would be eager to testify, but didn t want to be part of a  bloodletting  ritual. She clearly wanted a real investigation, rather than to simply be used as a fig leaf for the GOP. Judiciary Committee Republicans almost immediately responded by saying that if Blasey didn t accept the invitation on Monday, they would proceed with a vote on Kavanaugh s nomination anyway.Regardless of whether there is an FBI investigation, and whether Blasey testifies before the Senate committee, Judge must be subpoenaed. According to Blasey, Judge was part of the assault, laughing  maniacally    an alleged accomplice who watched and even jumped on Kavanaugh and Blasey while Kavanaugh molested her.What seems evident, however, is that Republicans on the committee know that Judge would be a disaster as a character witness for Kavanaugh. Not only would there be much focus on his writings about being highly intoxicated at high school parties, but it would open Kavanaugh to questions about the slew of other offensive things Judge has written. For instance, his piece on how some women dressed in a way that might provoke rape   even though there s  never any excuse for rape. In a 2006 piece called  Gay Sex,  Judge trafficked in the most base anti-gay stereotypes, asking,  Why are they still getting AIDS, the most preventable disease since alcoholism? Why were 90 percent of the priest abuse cases involving priests with teen-age boys? He went on to further compare homosexuality with alcoholism and compulsion, speculating  that along with the genetic or hormonal hardwiring that makes someone gay comes a level of pathological compulsiveness. It s there waiting to explode the way alcoholism is, and requires a constant struggle to tamp down. Were Judge and Kavanaugh friends all through these years since high school, and does Kavanaugh share some of these bigoted views? Those aren t questions Kavanaugh or Republicans want the media to dwell on.But protecting Kavanaugh from tough questions shouldn t be the priority here. If Senate Republicans actually cared about getting to the bottom of what happened, they would want Judge s testimony.The fact that they don t, and their rush to make Blasey testify, speaks volumes.Michelangelo Signorile is an editor-at-large for HuffPost.

Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s allegations that Kavanaugh had attempted to rape her would have no effect, the lawyer insisted. If anything, he went on, it was time for the men of the world to draw a line:  If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried. We can all be accused of something. Give the lawyer credit for this much: At least he did us the favor of saying the thing other men tend to dance around. This was more than a matter of protecting President Donald Trump s nominee or even Trump himself, who after all has admitted to grabbing women by their pussies without their consent. This was tribal. This was about tribal self-preservation.We ve seen this tendency of men   particularly straight, white, powerful men   to close ranks in many of the high-profile cases of men facing allegations of sexual assault, harassment or misconduct in the wake of the Me Too movement. Woody Allen worried about a  witch hunt  in the wake of reporting on Harvey Weinstein. Comedy Cellar club owner Noam Dworman said that  there can t be a permanent life sentence on someone who does something wrong,  with regards to Louis C.K. Even Michael Ian Black opined,  People have to be allowed to serve their time and move on with their lives.  Harper s Magazine publisher John R. MacArthur told CBC Radio, with regards to the decision to run a 7,000-word essay written by the disgraced former NPR host John Hockenberry, that  the Me Too movement has had a tendency to lump together everybody ... and the response in many cases has been disproportionate,  later adding that  we re running into a buzzsaw of illiberalism. As if nothing is worse than men being worried. As if every woman I know, and likely you know, isn t worried about assault and harassment on a near daily basis. As if we ve forgotten who was actually hunting witches in Andover and why. As if women were permitted the luxury of  moving on with their lives  instead of having their thoughts and behaviors and decisions infiltrated by the threat of sexual abuse. As if most women don t possess an internal baseline of rage simply from existing   a  permanent life sentence,  you might call it. As if sexual abuse weren t a  buzzsaw of illiberalism,  too.I was recently listening to an old episode of the  Dear Sugars  podcast, an advice podcast hosted by writers Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond. On this particularly prescient episode, which originally aired in July 2016, a woman writes in with a harrowing conundrum. She describes herself as a survivor of sexual abuse, and says that her long-term male partner has recently disclosed that in high school he got blackout drunk and raped an unconscious girl at a party. She both hates him and loves him, doesn t know how to square the giving partner she knows with the young man who violated a young woman and faced no tangible consequences for it. The episode is wrenching, but what struck me most is a line in the letter where the woman says that her partner would take issue with her when she made comments suggesting that rapists should be punished.  He gets frustrated that everyone gets so dismissive of the argument that young guys who fuck up and make a mistake shouldn t be punished in ways that ruin their whole lives,  the woman wrote. Even a man who has lived with and loved a survivor of sexual assault for years   who has, by her account, helped her find a therapist and taken care of her through her mental health struggles   could not help but prioritize his own desire for easy absolution over the reality that young women s (and men s!) lives are so often  ruined  by the youthful  mistakes  of others.What comes across in all of these cases is an overwhelming fear on the part of men that either they have done something in the past they didn t realize was bad that they will now be made to account for, or that something they know was bad will come back to haunt them. I have empathy for men   I really do! I can imagine how scary this moment must feel for many of them, having spent so much of their lives with the certainty that their behavior was beyond consequence. But instead of grappling with these hard questions, they shut down, insisting that women must not be allowed to run amok with their claims, as if women who share their pain with the public do so for pleasure, delighting in the felling of men s careers. As if those women don t any face consequences of their own   not just of the initial trauma, but of the backlash that inevitably follows these disclosures.Because sexual assault is so ubiquitous, because our sexual scripts are so fundamentally flawed, because rape culture is so all-encompassing, many men see themselves more in the perpetrators of these offenses than in the alleged victims. As Talia Lavin put it in a column for HuffPost,  Those who rush to put themselves in Kavanaugh s shoes may have never attempted the alternative: imagining oneself pinned to a bed, a hand over your mouth, unable to defend your own body. To move forward as a culture requires both empathy and discomfort. These reckonings implicate us all, force us to re-evaluate our histories and recalibrate our futures accordingly. What we are seeing now is powerful men who simply find empathy for accusers to be inconvenient to their personal desires and to their place in the social order, leaving a nation to grapple with a president who has admitted to grabbing unsuspecting women s pussies and a Supreme Court nominee who wants to regulate them."

Look, if she shows up and makes a credible showing, that will be very interesting and we ll have to make a decision,  Trump said as he spoke to reporters gathered outside the White House. I can only say this: He is such an outstanding man,  the president said of Kavanaugh.  Very hard for me to imagine that anything happened.  If Blasey does not show up to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Trump said,  that would be unfortunate. Trump first came to Kavanaugh s defense on Monday, one day after Blasey, who knew Kavanaugh in high school, went public with her allegation that he once sexually assaulted her at a party. The president dismissed the notion that Kavanaugh should offer to withdraw his nomination for the lifetime appointment and called him  one of the finest people that I ve ever known.  On Tuesday, Trump once again offered his support. He told reporters that he feels  so badly for  Kavanaugh and that  this is not a man that deserves this.

According to Blasey, Kavanaugh was drunk. I thought he might inadvertently kill me,  she said.Kavanaugh s hearings with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which initially concluded earlier this month, are set to resume on Monday as the body grapples with the claim. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the committee, has invited both Blasey and Kavanaugh to testify on Monday while rejecting calls for a formal FBI investigation into the matter. On Tuesday, Blasey had asked for such a probe.Since going public, Blasey has needed to relocate herself and her family due to death threats she s received. Nearly 600 alumni of her high school, the Maryland private school Holton-Arms, signed a letter supporting her. Sixty-five women initially signed a letter supporting Kavanaugh after news about the allegation against him surfaced. Yet as more details emerged in the Post, HuffPost found that many who previously signed their name in support of Kavanaugh were reluctant to speak up for him again.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Tuesday in which she asked for an FBI investigation to occur before her testimony. The hearing had been scheduled to take place next Monday.She said the investigation would  ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions. The committee decided Tuesday to postpone its vote on Kavanaugh in light of Blasey s allegation that the nominee sexually assaulted her when they were in high school.But some senators have made it clear that they don t want to see the vote delayed much longer. After learning of the allegation, Chairman Chuck Grassley took immediate action to ensure both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh have the opportunity to be heard, in public or private,  Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) tweeted Tuesday.  Republicans extended a hand in good faith. If we don t hear from both sides on Monday, let s vote. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) chimed in Tuesday as well, imploring Blasey to accept the invitation to testify next week  in a public or private setting.  The committee should hear her voice,  he said. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a key undecided senator, on Wednesday echoed her GOP colleagues and urged Blasey to testify next week.I hope that Dr. Ford will reconsider and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. It is my understanding that the Committee has offered to hold either a public or a private session, whichever would make her more comfortable.Blasey first sent a confidential letter to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) over the summer in which she detailed the alleged assault.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Wednesday argued that the Senate Judiciary Committee should proceed  as soon as possible  with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation, saying that a longer process would be  not about finding the truth, but delaying the process till after the midterm elections. His comments hint at a concern of many Republicans: that they need to confirm Kavanaugh quickly in case the GOP loses its chance if Democrats take back control of the Senate in November s election.Graham tweeted that the committee should not honor the request of Christine Blasey Ford, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, that the FBI investigate her sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh before she testifies.Requiring an FBI investigation of a 36 year old allegation (without specific references to time or location) before Professor Ford will appear before the Judiciary Committee is not about finding the truth, but delaying the process till after the midterm elections.It is imperative the Judiciary committee move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination and a committee vote be taken ASAP.Of course, delaying a Supreme Court nomination until after an election isn t anything new. Just ask Republicans, who in 2016 tabled the confirmation process of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama s Supreme Court pick, arguing that the American people needed to have a say via their presidential vote.Garland never even had a chance. Republicans held the seat open for almost a year   until President Donald Trump took office, after which they quickly confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch.With Kavanaugh s confirmation, Republicans seem poised to proceed as planned, having scheduled a hearing for next Monday.Attorneys for Blasey have said she is willing to testify before the Senate about the incident, in which she alleges Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party when they were in high school. But on Tuesday night, they said she wants the FBI to conduct an investigation before her testimony.Several Republican committee members, all of whom are male, have suggested the investigation is unnecessary. Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is among them. The invitation for Monday still stands,  Grassley said in a statement Tuesday night.  Dr. Ford s testimony would reflect her personal knowledge and memory of events. Nothing the FBI or any other investigator does would have any bearing on what Dr. Ford tells the committee, so there is no reason for any further delay.

Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) has an important message for men in the wake of the recent sexual assault accusation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.  I just want to say to the men in this country, just shut up and step up. Do the right thing for a change,  Hirono said during a press event on Tuesday. Hirono is part of the Senate Judiciary Committee tasked to hear testimony from Kavanaugh and vote on his nomination. She s one of only four women on the committee. The hearings, which began earlier this month, have been scheduled to continue next week after Christine Blasey Ford, who goes by Christine Blasey professionally, publicly accused Kavanaugh in a Sunday news story of sexually assaulting her in 1982 during a high school party.  I expect the men in this country and the men in this committee ... to demand an FBI investigation,  Hirono said earlier in the presser.  But really, guess who s perpetuating all of these kinds of actions? It s the men in this country. Blasey, a Palo Alto University professor, went public with her identity and full story on Sunday in an explosive interview with The Washington Post. She accused a drunken 17-year-old Kavanaugh of pinning her to a bed and grinding on her, while attempting to take her clothes off. Blasey said when she tried to scream he put his hand over her mouth to silence her. Kavanaugh has  categorically and unequivocally  denied Ford s allegation.

Do the right thing for a change,  Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) slams treatment of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s accuser. pic.twitter.com/ApVKqAc5xzSince Blasey came forward, she and her family have received death threats, forcing them to move from their home.  Let s face it, this is so patently unfair to her and what really bothers me and gets me so angry is that the White House is victimizing this person,  Hirono said.  Why don t we get that out there? Why should we participate in a victimization of someone who has the courage to come forward and she is under absolutely no obligation to participate in a smearing of her and her family. President Donald Trump has continued to defend his Supreme Court pick in the face of the accusation, recently adding that he feels  terribly  for Kavanaugh. Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 20 women. It is unclear whether Blasey will testify during Kavanaugh s confirmation hearing next week, but the professor told The Washington Post in Sunday s story:  I feel like my civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and my terror about retaliation.

Although he remains historically unpopular, he doesn t appear to have suffered any further attrition over the course of the past week.In three HuffPost/YouGov surveys   one taken entirely before the scandal broke, one after the revelation that an allegation had been made against him and the third after the accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, publicly stepped forward   opposition to confirming Kavanaugh has ranged between 31 and 34 percent. In the most recent poll, 32 percent support his confirmation, 32 percent oppose it and another 36 percent aren t sure. Among those who disapprove of President Donald Trump s choice of Kavanaugh for the seat, just 46 percent say their opposition stems from an objection to Kavanaugh personally, rather than a lack of confidence in Trump s ability to nominate a suitable candidate. September surveys from other outlets, most of which were conducted prior to the latest news cycle, put Kavanaugh s net support between -1 and +6.Part of the reason for the current stability may be that many people still aren t focused on the story. Fewer than a quarter of respondents to the latest HuffPost/YouGov survey say they re following Kavanaugh s confirmation hearings very closely, basically unchanged from earlier in the month; search engine data suggests Hurricane Florence probably drew a lot more attention. Seventy percent of Americans say they ve heard at least something about Blasey s accusation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both high school students, but just 35 percent that they ve heard a lot about them. Even after hearing about the allegations, however, the public is split 35/36 on whether or not Kavanaugh should withdraw his nomination. Nearly half of Americans say they re not sure if the allegation against Kavanaugh is credible or not   those who do have an opinion one way or another are close to evenly divided. Thirty-nine percent say that the sexual assault allegation, if true, disqualifies Kavanaugh from serving on the Supreme Court, with 18 percent calling it relevant but not disqualifying, and 20 percent finding it not relevant at all.By comparison, in past HuffPost/YouGov polls, a 57 percent majority said the accusations against GOP Senate hopeful Roy Moore were disqualifying if true, and 63 percent said the same of the domestic violence allegations against former White House aide Rob Porter.Initial reactions to Kavanaugh s nomination were already deeply polarized. The responses to the allegations   like sentiments about the Me Too movement more broadly   diverge sharply along those same political lines, leaving opinions as entrenched as they were previously.Sixty-two percent of Hillary Clinton voters, compared to 18 percent of non-voters and just 4 percent of Trump voters, say the allegation is credible; three-quarters of Clinton voters, 34 percent of non-voters and a tenth of Trump voters consider it disqualifying if true. More than 80 percent of Trump voters say they d rather see the president continue to back Kavanaugh than replace him with another conservative nominee.As is often the case, politics is far more of a dividing line than gender, although some differences stand out within each voting bloc. Male and female Trump voters both see the accusation against Kavanaugh as lacking credibility and irrelevant to his nomination, but the men are 23 points and 9 points likelier, respectively, to hold those opinions. Across the aisle, male Clinton voters are more likely than female Clinton voters to view the accusation as credible   the women are no more likely to doubt it, but do more commonly choose not to state an opinion.Gender also influences the personal perspectives different people bring to the controversy. Men say by an 11-point margin that they worry more about being accused of sexual harassment than of facing it, while women say by a 23-point margin that they re more worried they will be harassed. A majority of both men and women say they re not concerned about either possibility, although half of women under 30 report fearing sexual harassment.The current fight over Kavanaugh s nomination draws unavoidable comparisons to 1991, when pollsters were asking similar questions about the accusations against Clarence Thomas. At the time, Thomas was generally popular with the American public, and Anita Hill s testimony did little to change public opinion. In one survey, 62 percent of the public said they believed Hill s charges would have been taken more seriously if there were more than two women serving in the Senate.Today, Americans say by an 8-point margin that Thomas shouldn t have been confirmed, according to the HuffPost/YouGov survey. Just a tenth of those polled say the Senate is doing a better job of handling sexual misconduct allegations today than it did in 1991, with 24 percent saying it s worse and 34 percent that it s about the same.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 17-18 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

The American public really is expecting something more,  the law professor said in an interview on ABC s  Good Morning America.   We are really under the impression that the Senate doesn t take this seriously and doesn t see this as part of their core responsibility. EXCLUSIVE: Anita Hill advises Senate to  push the pause button  on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after sexual assault allegation. https://t.co/mzz6iKmo6Z pic.twitter.com/PuSg2tErD0Attorneys for Blasey said Tuesday night that she will not agree to testify before the Senate, which has planned a hearing next week, until the FBI investigates her claims. All of this is really something that I don t think can be avoided if you really want to get to the truth, if that s the purpose of this hearing,  Hill said Wednesday, after writing a similar New York Times op-ed this week urging lawmakers not to repeat the mistakes they made 27 years ago.In 1991, a Senate panel of all white men, led by then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.), humiliated Hill when she came forward with sexual harassment claims against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. They asked her graphic questions about Thomas  behavior and seemed dismissive of her claims, demonstrating a lack of understanding about the issue. They also declined to hear testimony from other women who accused Thomas of sexual misconduct or could corroborate Hill s claims, and he was later confirmed.On Wednesday, Hill raised the question of whether history could repeat itself with Kavanaugh and Blasey,  whether or not it is going to be anything more than just a sham proceeding so that the senators can say,  We gave her a chance to talk,  and then move on to doing exactly what they were intending to do before she came forward,  she said. Six days is not enough for the senators, who probably know very little about these kind of claims,  she continued.  It s not enough for them to inform themselves, and so that s why it s important to have an investigation. Asked if she had any advice for Blasey, given her own experience in the spotlight, Hill put the onus on the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. My advice is to push the pause button on this hearing, get the information together, bring in the experts and put together a hearing that is fair, that is impartial, that is not biased by politics or by myth, and bring this information to the American public,  she said.Hill s 1991 testimony is widely credited with changing attitudes and rhetoric about sexual misconduct in the workplace. Since the groundswell of the Me Too movement last fall, Hill has chaired a commission formed to improve Hollywood s handling of sexual misconduct and gender inequality.

There wasn t much to talk about before it happened.Just a few days earlier, I had broken my own rule and turned my cell phone on as we reached the summit of an Adirondack mountain during our annual camping outing with longtime friends. As my teenage companions on the trip knew   and no doubt used as motivation to get to the top   this would be one of the only moments we might actually have cell coverage during our trip. So, we all fired up our phones and were momentarily jarred from the pristine wilderness back into the bustle and frenzy of our daily lives in Washington, D.C. Hey, there are demonstrations happening when the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination hearings start on Tuesday,  I told Margot.  Friends are dressing up as a Handmaids with a group called Demand Justice. We d have to be up early and at the meeting spot by 7:30 a.m. Want to come with me?  Sure,  she said.  I guess that means we have to drive all the way home on Monday. Ugh. 10 hours in a car on a holiday weekend. But I ll do it. It wouldn t be the first time we had gone to a demonstration or protest together, but it would be the first time she would be making the decision as an adult, having turned 18 earlier this summer. For me, I was ecstatic to hear of a way for us to plug into the variety of activities planned to challenge the Supreme Court nomination of an anti-woman, anti-environment, anti-health care, anti-immigrant threat to our nation within hours of getting home.As someone who has been working as a nonviolent activist and trainer for over 30 years, I d been brainstorming with others about what to do, when the Kavanaugh nomination was first announced, to creatively, strategically and powerfully support senators to stand up to this outrageous move by President Donald Trump and say NO to this threat to our democracy and rights.I was relieved that Margot didn t miss a beat. Both of us wanted to do something   not sit by while Kavanaugh was considered for such a powerful and influential position, especially when he has shown he doesn t support a woman s right to choose, doesn t believe in birth control, doesn t support the protection of the earth or endangered species and refuses to say whether he believes pre-existing conditions need to be covered by health care, among other disturbing admissions. Not to mention he was nominated by a  president  who is also guilty of these biases   and, I truly believe, is an unindicted co-conspirator to crimes to boot.So, on Tuesday, Sept. 4, both of us, along with 15 others, dressed up as Handmaids on Capitol Hill, sweating buckets under our bonnets and long robes in 100-degree heat as we walked two by two, silently, in character.In case you re not familiar with the now-iconic Handmaid image, it s from a Hulu TV show based on the 1985 dystopian novel The Handmaid s Tale by Margaret Atwood. The red dress and white bonnets the Handmaids are required to wear invoke the specter of a horrific future in which fertility is so low that a religious group has waged a coup and now controls the United States, wherein fertile woman are forced to become human birthing machines and all women s rights are limited.You may think this is an improbable future, but given the recent (and not so recent) attacks on women s access to health care, including birth control, Roe v. Wade and our environment, as well as social conservatives  hostility to women in general, it doesn t feel that unlikely   or that far off   to us and many others.We all know it s not easy to challenge men s sexist behavior or words, and over the past couple of years, it has been powerful to witness my own kid holding her own when coaches, teachers and other students needed to be called out and held accountable.Still, young folks need support from the rest of us   we elders got us into the mess we re in now, and we need to step up and take some responsibility for fixing it. So we came together, young and old, to protest, and we used the Handmaid as the symbol of all of the terrifying things that that could eventually come to pass if someone like Kavanaugh makes it to the Supreme Court.Margot Bloch: I grew up in a community full of activists and good troublemakers, watching my mom put so much on the line to fight for what she thinks is right. Through her creative activism   which, over the years, has included building giant puppets, making signs and marching in the streets   my mom raised me to learn the importance of change and working for what you want.I spent my childhood going to marches and protests about everything from environmental change to immigration to economic policies. In fact, at 6 months old, I was sitting in my stroller at George W. Bush s inauguration with a sign that read  BASTA! Babies Against State Terrorism Anywhere!  As I ve gotten older, I have found my own place and purpose in activism and I ve worked with anti-racism school groups and tried to make change on everything from gun violence to climate change.Wearing a red gown and white bonnet with wings like the ones that the Handmaids wear created a world of limited mobility and vision while hiding almost my entire face and body. At the same time, I felt nowhere near hidden from the public eye, and I could feel every person s neck   and every photographer s camera   turning toward me as we walked by. After all, Handmaids in bright red and white aren t exactly a normal sight in Washington, D.C.  nor should they ever be.Dressing up and acting like a Handmaid was a different experience than other protests I ve been involved in because it was much more of a theatrical political performance and truly a statement piece. The costumes were suffocating, and I was unable to be myself. If we broke character, everyone around us would take notice. I definitely felt controlled. It was really hard to do this for a few hours during a couple of days, and I can t imagine living my life this way.Once our initial protest in our Handmaid costumes was over, my mom and I felt a call to do something more. Since the Kavanaugh confirmation proceedings were still going on and the line to enter the room was short, we decided to join the activists who were intent on disrupting the hearing.Public viewers were only allowed in the hearing room for 15 minutes, but it was painful to listen to what was being discussed for even 10. I don t understand how senators could sit in that room all day and ignore the cries and screams of women, people with disabilities, immigrants and children as if they aren t even worthy of being having their rights   and their lives   protected. I won t pretend that I wasn t nervous, because I was, but honestly, I don t think I could have been in that room and not disrupted what I was witnessing.This was going to be my first time being arrested for my activism (or otherwise), and though it seems a little weird to say this, the thought of it happening didn t seem that intimidating or unusual to me. There have been nights in my past when I came home from school only to find family friends at my house because my mom had been arrested for protesting. So I knew from her experiences what to expect, and though I knew there were times when the police had treated her horribly, she always made it home safely. I believed in what she had done   and what we were now doing together   and being arrested seemed like a small price to pay to make a statement that I knew was important, powerful and necessary.Because we were crammed into the hearing room, my mom and I were separated, but each of us was still positioned near others who were also planning to disrupt the proceedings. I waited for the perfect moment to make my move, and when there was a brief lull in the hearing, I got up on my chair and began yelling,  I m 18! I m here for the youth of this country! You re ruining my future!  as the police grabbed me and lifted me through a door in the side of the room. The cops were rough with me and the other protesters as they dragged us out of the room, but once we were out, they were pretty calm. We were handcuffed, put in police vans and brought to a holding area before we were processed and then released. The whole time though, we were together with our community of activists and had people waiting for us on the other side. We all sang songs of protest and resistance together, and I could feel the support from everyone around me. It s hard to explain what an incredible feeling it is to be surrounded by a community that has your back, and I m especially thankful to organizers and activists from groups like the Center for Popular Democracy and Housing Works for providing action and jail support.Nadine: It was powerful to hear my daughter raise up her own voice in resistance, taking a risk for what she believes in. However, as her mother, I also found myself in an odd position in that moment   both glad she was there and proud of her for what she was doing, but also slightly worried that the police would handle her roughly or inappropriately. Yes, it s a small fear compared to what is at stake for our nation, but nonetheless a real and unshakable one for a parent.This experience at Kavanaugh s hearing reinforced what I know to be true as an activist and trainer: It s invaluable to put yourself in someone else s shoes, even for 90 seconds of role-playing. To stand for hours as a Handmaid in the halls of Congress was excruciating, terrifying, but ultimately extremely motivating to join and represent the resistance in this way. #WeWontGoBack.The reality is that once I found myself in one of those suffocating outfits designed to keep women in their place, the weight of our oppressive system and the fear of what this country could become was suddenly even more tangible for me. It also felt creepy   too close to potential reality. We felt vulnerable.It was good to walk together, not alone. When we raised our heads to peer out at those looking at us, we could see that the Handmaids were jarring to many. I hoped we d be a coherent warning of what could be in our futures, and as an artist, I hoped the use of the Handmaid costumes might get through to those who work in the capital Beltway and halls of Congress in a way that other protests might not. Maybe, I reasoned, this striking image would reach them in their gut and provoke an empathetic and emotional response that could help shift their consciousness and possibly even effect real change.The intensity of the Handmaid roleplay also led us to develop a quick camaraderie across our diverse group of activists, and some of the members are already planning to meet up again. Handmaid Happy Hour, anyone? Sounds contradictory, doesn t it? Someone suggested it might be more appropriate to go with  Bitches in Bonnets,  but, either way, it s all about sisters in resistance!I am encouraged by this intense feeling and will do whatever I can to help stoke it in order to continue making connections and help grow investment in activism however and wherever I can. This is the essence of people power, and I truly believe that without civic engagement where compassion leads to action, we are doomed.Margot: Given what is happening in our country and around the world today, I am more inspired and motivated than ever to be an agent for change. The older I get, the more I realize that we must use our own privilege and be willing to make sacrifices in order to fight for what we truly care about.In the end, this isn t just about blocking Brett Kavanaugh s ascent to the Supreme Court (which, to be clear, is absolutely imperative). We must band together to fix our broken political system and challenge injustice whenever we encounter it. It s only when we work together that we can challenge our unjust systems of racism, patriarchy and economic injustice. In order to win equality and rights for everyone, we will need as many people as possible to pledge their time, energy and resources to the resistance.Do you have a compelling personal story you d like to see published on HuffPost?

Her email has been hacked, they added, and she s been impersonated online. In the 36 hours since her name became public, Dr. Ford has received a stunning amount of support from her community and from fellow citizens across our country,  the lawyers wrote.  At the same time, however, her worst fears have materialized.  Heidi Feldman, a law professor at Georgetown University, started a GoFundMe page on Tuesday to help keep Blasey and her family safe. As of early Wednesday, it had raised more than $53,000. Let s create a fund to cover her security expenses, to do just a bit to make it easier for women in her position to come forward despite great risks,  Feldman said before deciding to pause the fundraiser until she learns more about Blasey s security needs.Feldman said in an email to HuffPost on Wednesday that enthusiasm for helping Blasey has been  extraordinary and heartening.  I started the fundraiser because I was distressed at the prospect of the heavy security expenses faced by Dr. Blasey and a strong desire to assist her in a concrete way, to make it even just a bit safer for her to participate in thorough vetting of a Supreme Court nominee,  Feldman wrote.  Within an hour of posting the fundraiser it was clear that others appreciated the expense Dr. Blasey faces and shared my sense that we have a collective obligation to ensure the safety of those who speak in the public interest. Let s do something concrete for Dr. Ford. Reportedly she is arranging for private security and has had to move out of her house because of threats. We could raise money to pay her security costs. What do others think?Blasey has called for an FBI investigation into her story before she testifies to the Judiciary Committee to  ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions. Grassley on Tuesday downplayed the need for an FBI probe and repeated his invitation for Blasey to testify on Monday. We ve offered Dr. Ford the opportunity to share her story with the committee, as her attorney said yesterday she was willing to do,  Grassley said in a statement.  We offered her a public or a private hearing as well as staff-led interviews, whichever makes her most comfortable. Nothing the FBI or any other investigator does would have any bearing on what Dr. Ford tells the committee, so there is no reason for any further delay. Blasey sent a confidential letter to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) over the summer accusing Kavanaugh of groping her, trying to remove her clothing and clasping his hand over her mouth to silence her when he was 17 and she was 15.Feinstein acknowledged the existence of the document last week, and Blasey came forward in a Washington Post article published on Sunday. She said Monday she was willing to testify.This article has been updated to include Heidi Feldman s comments.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The purpose of a background investigation is to determine whether the nominee could pose a risk to the national security of the United States,  the agency said.  The allegation does not involve any potential federal crime. The FBI s role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers. Democrats have supported Blasey s request, however, accusing the GOP of rushing the process while attempting to put Blasey on the national stage before the allegations can be checked out.

Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) had scheduled Blasey and Kavanaugh to testify in front of the committee on Monday. Blasey, however, said through her lawyers Tuesday that an FBI investigation should be  the first step  before she is put  on national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident. A number of Democrats spoke out in support of Blasey s demand for an impartial FBI probe into the allegations before bringing her before the committee. Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), both on the judiciary committee, released statements on Twitter standing behind Kavanaugh s accuser.  I support Dr. Blasey Ford s request for an FBI background investigation before a hearing,  Harris wrote on Twitter.  She should not be bullied into participating in a biased process and we should not rush forward before facts are gathered. Feinstein, who had kept Blasey s allegations private since July at her request, released a series of tweets calling the rushed process  reminiscent of the treatment of Anita Hill,  referring to the law professor who accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment at his hearing in 1991.  We should honor Dr. Blasey Ford s wishes and delay this hearing,  Feinstein wrote on Twitter.  A proper investigation must be completed, witnesses interviewed, evidence reviewed and all sides spoken to. Only then should the chairman set a hearing date. The decision to come forward or not come forward has always been Christine Blasey Ford s, and that includes her participation in a hearing.  .@SenSchumer:  I strongly support Dr. Ford s call for an FBI investigation before a hearing is held.  pic.twitter.com/PtMhnr2ciQSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a statement Tuesday saying that an investigation was  precedent  and  quite clearly the right thing to do.   Dr. Ford s call for the FBI to investigate also demonstrates her confidence that when all the facts are examined by an impartial investigation, her account will be further corroborated and confirmed,  Schumer s statement said.  Senate Republicans and the White House should drop their inexplicable opposition to an FBI investigation, allow all the facts to come out, and then proceed with a fair process in the Senate.  Blasey has accused Kavanaugh of pinning her to a bed, forcing himself on top of her and attempting to remove her clothes during a high school party in the 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations. She also claimed that the only witness to the event was Kavanaugh s friend Mark Judge.Judge, now a filmmaker, wrote a memoir dedicated to how he spent his high school years  completely annihilated  on alcohol and trying to  hook up  with girls. He said Tuesday that he declined to speak publicly on the matter, writing in a statement to Grassley and Feinstein that he had no memory of the alleged incident. Republicans are working to keep Kavanaugh s confirmation on track before the November midterm elections in case the GOP loses its slim 51-seat majority in the Senate. The party already suffered a setback in delaying a Thursday vote to recommend Kavanaugh to a full Senate hearing after key Republicans said they would be uncomfortable moving forward without Blasey s testimony. Several other Democrats came out in support of an FBI investigation into the matter on Tuesday. Dr. Ford s request for a basic investigation of these allegations before a public hearing is completely reasonable & Senate Rs should honor it. There s no reason to rush this process. The American people deserve to know what federal investigators can find out. https://t.co/Fax8VAJWheThe entire array of the White House s power is behind Judge Kavanaugh. It not only places Dr. Blasey Ford at a disadvantage, it victimizes her. No survivor of sexual assault should be subjected to death threats and concern about the safety of their family. https://t.co/iAgFMo5bPIScheduling a hearing for Monday, a week after Dr. Ford made her accusations public, is a shameful attempt to jam this through without giving anyone the time they need to investigate and put together the questions that need to be asked.https://t.co/Nf9MS0ZafgDr. Blasey Ford has demonstrated extraordinary bravery coming forward and facing an intense spotlight. Her allegations are credible and serious and should be treated as such. The FBI must conduct an independent investigation before a hearing is held.She is absolutely right. Investigation first; then hearing. It s amazing #Republicans think this is even debatable. Her position puts the @senjudiciary Committee hearing scheduled for Monday in doubt.https://t.co/RmJ12xBtfB.@RealDonaldTrump just claimed that re-opening Kavanaugh s official background investigation isn t something the FBI does. FALSE. It s exactly what the FBI does. Until now it s been a standard bipartisan process to have the FBI investigate new information raised about a nominee.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also voiced her support for an FBI investigation before Blasey is called to testify. In an interview Tuesday with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, the former presidential candidate said there  should be due process for everyone involved. Hillary Clinton to @MSNBC: In asking the FBI to investigate before a public hearing, she is asking for the courtesy of having the facts laid out before the hearing.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

That testimony was expected to take place next Monday. There s no reason that we should have a public hearing on Monday ... this is being rushed through, and it s too important to be rushed through. It s not a game, this is a serious situation.  Lisa Banks, attorney for Christine Blasey Ford https://t.co/un750fFvzN pic.twitter.com/zkeykaBqJIBut on Tuesday, Blasey, a psychology professor in Northern California, said through her lawyers that an investigation should be  the first step  before she is put  on national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident. Blasey s lawyers released a letter to committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), CNN reported, calling for an investigation to  ensure the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner and that the committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decision. Speaking with CNN s Anderson Cooper on Tuesday, attorney Lisa Banks reiterated that Blasey, her client, was  prepared to cooperate with the committee and with any law enforcement investigation.  Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) tweeted her support for Blasey s decision on Tuesday, saying,  She should not be bullied into participating in a biased process.  I support Dr. Blasey Ford s request for an FBI background investigation before a hearing. She should not be bullied into participating in a biased process and we should not rush forward before facts are gathered.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who was first to acknowledge the existence of a letter containing the allegations against Kavanaugh last week, also issued a statement of support for Blasey s decision. I agree with her 100 percent that the rushed process to hold a hearing on Monday has been unfair and is reminiscent of the treatment of Anita Hill,  Feinstein said in the statement, referencing the law professor s 1991 allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.  I also agree that we need the facts before senators   not staff or lawyers   speak to witnesses. We should honor Dr. Blasey Ford s wishes and delay this hearing.  Blasey has good reason to be concerned. Every Republican senator on the committee is male, and lawmakers are known to employ aggressive questioning during hearings. For that reason, HuffPost learned Tuesday, Republicans on the committee were considering having their female aides or lawyers question Blasey and Kavanaugh should she testify about her allegation.Blasey alleges a drunken 17-year-old Kavanaugh attempted to remove her clothing at a gathering in suburban Maryland when they were both in high school. She says Kavanaugh covered her mouth to silence her when she attempted to scream and that she was able to escape after a friend of Kavanaugh s jumped on top of both of them.Blasey sent a confidential letter to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Feinstein after Kavanaugh s nomination this summer to share her concerns about him.A number of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said in the wake of the allegations that the Senate Judiciary Committee should delay its vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation, which was scheduled to take place on Thursday.Grassley subsequently said Kavanaugh and Blasey would have the opportunity to publicly testify the following Monday.But Banks called that timeframe  premature. Blasey  just came forward with these allegations 48 hours ago, and since that time she has been dealing with hate mail, harassment [and] death threats,  the professor s attorney said.  So she s been spending her time trying to figure out how to put her life back together, how to protect herself and her family. Grassley s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this article.This article has been updated to include details about Blasey s accusations and the timeframe for the Senate hearings.

Republican lawmakers and conservative media figures, who have largely lined up in support of Kavanaugh, have already begun trying to poke holes in her story and question her credibility.  The problem is, Dr. Ford can t remember when it was, where it was, or how it came to be,  said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the Senate majority whip and a member of the Judiciary Committee.  There are some gaps there that need to be filled.  There s some question whether she s mixed up,  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), another Judiciary Committee member, said this Monday.  I think there are lots of reasons not to believe it, but on the other hand, you can t ignore and cast the issue aside. Republicans fear that the spectacle of male senators aggressively questioning Blasey would alienate female voters, who already favor Democrats by a wide margin in polling. College-educated women are considered key to Democratic hopes of taking back the House. GOP operatives worry that a replay of the Anita Hill hearings   when an all-male panel of senators aggressively questioned the integrity of another woman accusing a Supreme Court nominee of sexual misconduct   could provide those voters in particular with yet another reason to support Democrats in November.One GOP strategist, granted anonymity to discuss his party s position in this fracas, was blunt:  The optics could not be much worse. It s not what we need right now.  Let s see,  a second Republican strategist wrote in an email.  Eleven old white guys questioning a woman about teenage sex, what could go wrong? Hopefully someone will suggest hiring a female prosecutor to handle the questioning, it s really our only hope of coming out of this thing alive. Indeed, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are considering using female staffers to question Blasey. A CNN/SSRS poll conducted earlier this month found Democrats with an edge of 52 percent to 42 percent over Republicans on the generic ballot for Congress. That edge comes entirely from female voters, who back Democrats by a margin of 60 percent to 36 percent. Men support Republicans, 49 percent to 44 percent.The Hill hearings are credited, in part, with sparking the  Year of the Women  election back in 1992. This year, Democrats have recruited and nominated a record number of female House candidates, including in a number of states crucial to control of the Senate. A third GOP strategist was hopeful that any electoral damage could be limited to the House, where many battleground districts are filled with college-educated women. In crucial Senate states   which are mostly in territory friendly to President Donald Trump   the fight could actually help Republicans by drawing attention to the Supreme Court and firing up the party s base, he argued.  The worst thing for House Republicans is a conversation about anything other than the economy,  the strategist said.  Even though House Republicans have less than zero to do with Supreme Court confirmations, they re going to bear the brunt.  Others suggested that Trump has already throughly damaged the party s brand with suburban women, so next Monday s proposed hearing couldn t do much additional damage.One strategist was hopeful the GOP could survive the hearing, provided senators avoided direct confrontations with Blasey and simply allowed her to testify.  I don t think they have to question her at all,  the strategist said.  I don t think there s anything to gain by interrogating her like a criminal detective. The strategist thought the committee s Republican senators   a roster including Cornyn, Hatch, Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Ted Cruz (Texas) and Chuck Grassley (Iowa)   were likely to behave themselves.  If this was in the House, I d have no confidence,  the strategist added. Cornyn appeared to share that sentiment about his colleagues.  No problem,  he said when reporters asked if he was confident the hearing wouldn t go off the rails.Other senators seemed more eager to go after Blasey. She ll be challenged,  Graham said Tuesday night on Fox News.  You don t have to be smart to know that there s something going on here.

That s been a good thing for all of us  pic.twitter.com/pIOztUx7Zs We had a good saying that we ve held firm to to this day, as the dean was reminding me before the talk,  Kavanaugh said during a 2015 speech at the Catholic University of America s Columbus School of Law in Washington, D.C.  Which is what happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep. That s been a good thing for all of us. It was while he was attending that high school, said Christine Blasey Ford   now a professor at Palo Alto University in California who goes by Christine Blasey professionally   that he tried to force himself on her when the two were teenagers. I thought he might inadvertently kill me,  she told The Washington Post on Sunday.She said that she was 15 and the then-17-year-old Kavanaugh was drunk when he held her down, covering her mouth with his hand as he attempted to take off her clothes.Blasey said Kavanaugh and a friend of his, Mark Judge, turned up music to drown out her screams.Kavanaugh has flatly denied the claim, and he and Blasey could have a chance next week to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the alleged episode. As Mother Jones points out, a book by Judge mentions Kavanaugh and his apparent love of binge-drinking while at the school. And in an April 2014 speech to the Yale Law School Federalist Society, Kavanaugh relayed his drinking adventures with friends. Of course, many young people drink before they re 21. But sexual aggression is not a rite of passage for boys, and the allegations against Kavanaugh are far more disturbing than simply a young person who drank alcohol during high school.

If they use their aides, they would be able to rely on female staffers. (The Democratic side is more diverse, with women and people of color on the committee.)Three Democratic sources familiar with the committee s planning told HuffPost that this proposal was under consideration, although so far it s not clear whether Blasey and Kavanaugh will testify. The office of Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the judiciary panel, did not return a request for comment. We ve discussed various options, including hiring outside lawyers and supplementing that with senators asking questions,  said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the committee.  So, any senator who wants to ask questions remains free to do so. But I don t want want to get in front of the chairman. Another option under consideration is allowing Blasey s attorney to question Kavanaugh and Kavanaugh s attorney to question Blasey, an idea that Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she would support. Collins is not on the judiciary committee.Republicans are no doubt eager to avoid some of the mistakes of 1991, when law professor Anita Hill testified about her sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas, who was eventually confirmed to the Supreme Court anyway. Hill, a black woman, had to testify in front of a Senate Judiciary Committee that was composed entirely of white men. The optics were not lost on anyone, and in the 1992 elections, women across the country were inspired to run to change the representation in Congress. Republicans have agreed to hear testimony from Blasey on Monday, but they re resisting calls from Democrats to bring in additional witnesses. One person Democrats want to call is Mark Judge, the classmate who allegedly joined Kavanaugh in locking Blasey in a room at a party when they were all in high school. Blasey claims that Kavanaugh pinned her down and tried to remove her clothes, holding his hand over her mouth so that she wouldn t scream. She was able to get away. Judge has said he does not remember the incident she describes, but his reliability as a character witness is not strong, since he has written extensively about the hard partying he did growing up. And on Tuesday afternoon, Judge said he did not want to testify.Grassley said that Blasey has not yet agreed to attend on Monday, and her lawyer didn t return a request for comment from HuffPost. Democrats also want more time to consider Kavanaugh s nomination in light of the new allegations, which just came out last week. They say that hearing from only Blasey and Kavanaugh and then quickly voting on his nomination would undermine the serious nature of the allegations.Igor Bobic contributed reporting.

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) was already under pressure from Alaska Natives to oppose Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.It just got more serious.The Alaska Federation of Natives   a massive statewide Native-American organization that represents more than 20 percent of the state s entire population   went from taking no official stance on Kavanaugh to announcing its opposition on Sept. 12. The questions and colloquies that came out of Judge Brett Kavanaugh s Senate Judiciary hearings last week have necessitated us taking a position,  the group said in a recent statement.  AFN joins our colleagues and friends across Indian country in strongly opposing Judge Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court because of, among other things, his views on the rights of Native peoples. On top of that, the Alaska House Bush Caucus, a group of state legislators focused on tribal and rural representation, wrote to Murkowski and Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) urging them to vote no. It has become clear that his confirmation would threaten Alaskans  access to healthcare, women s reproductive rights, and the United States  special trust relationship with federally recognized tribes,  said the Alaska lawmakers.Here s their letter:   Alaska House Bush Caucus letter by jen_bendery on ScribdJulie Kitka, the president of AFN, told HuffPost she s been meeting with Murkowski one-on-one throughout Kavanaugh s confirmation process, providing the senator with detailed information on why tribal communities are so concerned. She expects they will continue their private meetings all the way up until Kavanaugh s final vote. Our opposition is significant because the issues that we raise are not just small issues that Congress can fix,  Kitka said.  Our concerns go right to the heart of what authority Congress has and the Supreme Court s interpretation of that authority with regard to Native Americans. In its statement, AFN raises red flags with Kavanaugh s  erroneous  position on the Indian Commerce Clause in the Constitution. The clause gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with nations, states and Indian tribes, but AFN says Kavanaugh has challenged the clause s application to affairs beyond trade. The group also calls Kavanaugh s view of the federal government s special trust responsibility with tribes  misguided. Heather Kendall-Miller, an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund, told HuffPost last week that tribal communities are also extremely concerned about Kavanaugh s record on climate change, voting rights and his views on states  versus federal rights.Alaska Natives  voices carry a lot of weight with Murkowski, who is currently undecided on how she ll vote on Kavanaugh. She owes her re-election to them.The GOP senator unexpectedly lost her primary in 2010 to a tea party challenger. She responded by running as an independent, launching a write-in campaign and winning the race against all odds. Whose support didn t she have? The Republican Party. Whose support did she have? Alaska Natives, who turned out for her and helped fuel her victory.Murkowski spokeswoman Karina Borger said Tuesday that the senator is still vetting Kavanaugh s background. She will review additional committee documents related to the concerns identified by Alaskans as she continues to exercise her due diligence,  said Borger.Sullivan has already said that Kavanaugh has his support. Advocates for Alaska Natives have been flooding Murkowski s office in recent weeks, presenting her with as much information as possible to help her back up a potential opposition to Kavanaugh. One Alaska Native attorney involved in these conversations acknowledged the personal cost that Murkowski could face if she votes against President Donald Trump s court pick. She s going to be out there alone, out in front taking these positions and facing repercussions from her party,  said the attorney, who requested anonymity to speak freely.  This is going to take active courage.  I think she will do the right thing,  the attorney added. UPDATE: Sept. 20   Alaska Gov. Bill Walker (I) and Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott (D) announced Thursday they they oppose Kavanaugh s confirmation, adding yet another layer of pressure on Murkowski to vote no.In a joint statement, Walker and Mallott raise concerns with the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh and say there needs to be a thorough investigation into those claims before he gets a confirmation vote. They also say his record suggests he would weaken tribal protections, noting that that Alaska is home to 227 tribes   nearly half of all tribes in the country. Mr. Kavanaugh s appointment could ... jeopardize the Indian Child Welfare Act, Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and other laws that enable tribal self-determination due to his overly narrow view of the relationship between federal and tribal governments,  they said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Democrats had called for Judge to testify before the committee. But in a statement to committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Judge claimed he had no memory of the incident and declined to speak publicly about the allegation. I did not ask to be involved in this matter nor did anyone ask me to be involved,  Judge said in a letter signed by his lawyer on Tuesday.  The only reason I am involved is because Dr. Christine Blasey Ford remembers me as the other person in the room during the alleged assault.  In fact, I have no memory of this alleged incident,  he added.  Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school but I do not recall the party described in Ford s letter. More to the point, I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes. Judge added:  I have no more information to offer the Committee and I do not wish to speak publicly regarding the incidents described in Dr. Ford s letter. Senate Republicans have agreed to allow Blasey, a psychology professor, and Kavanaugh to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next Monday. But Grassley said they would be the only two witnesses at the hearing, leaving out Judge.Kavanaugh has agreed to appear at the Monday hearing. Blasey s lawyer Lisa Banks said on Tuesday that an FBI investigation into the accusation should be  the first step.   There s no reason that we should have a public hearing on Monday ... this is being rushed through, and it s too important to be rushed through. It s not a game, this is a serious situation.  Lisa Banks, attorney for Christine Blasey Ford https://t.co/un750fFvzN pic.twitter.com/zkeykaBqJIIn a Washington Post interview published Sunday, Blasey publicly identified herself as the author of a confidential letter detailing alleged sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh that was sent to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and then Feinstein in late July.Blasey told the Post that Kavanaugh, who appeared to be drunk, pinned her down and groped her as Judge, also apparently drunk, watched during a party in suburban Maryland while they were all in high school, around 1982.Blasey said she tried to scream, but Kavanaugh covered her mouth. She was able to escape after Judge jumped on top of them both, according to the Post.Kavanaugh and Judge have both denied Blasey s allegation. Judge called the accusation  just absolutely nuts  in an interview with The Weekly Standard published before Blasey s identity was revealed.After news of Blasey s letter came out, Judge, who attended Georgetown Preparatory School in Maryland with Kavanaugh, told The New York Times that students raised in Catholic homes would not tolerate the type of behavior described in the letter.  Something like that would stick out, which is why I don t think it would happen,  he told the Times.But in 1997, Judge published a memoir that detailed a culture of binge drinking and partying during his high school years.In Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk, Judge told stories of himself and other students drinking heavily and trying to  hook up  with girls.In his 1997 memoir,  Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk,  Mark Judge explained the meaning of  100 Kegs Or Bust,  a reference he and classmate Kavanaugh made on their Georgetown Prep yearbook pages 14 years earlier. pic.twitter.com/sWyZjOQ5T3He said that his  immersion  into alcohol began at the end of his sophomore year during an annual  beach week,  a time when Catholic high school students went to the shore after school was out. Now I had an opportunity to make some headway [with girls],  Judge wrote.  Most of the time everyone, including the girls, was drunk. If you could breathe and walk at the same time, you could hook up. In the book, Judge changed the name of his school to  Loyola Prep.  He does not specifically mention Kavanaugh s name, but he did briefly mention a character named  Bart O Kavanaugh  who  puked in someone s car  and  passed out on his way back from a party. He also refers to the name again when listing off Irish surnames from his elementary school, including,  O Neal, Murphy, Kavanaugh. Judge has also written of  uncontrollable male passion  in a 2015 review of the publisher Hard Case Crimes:Of course, a man must be able to read a woman s signals, and it s a good thing that feminism is teaching young men that no means no and yes means yes. But there s also that ambiguous middle ground, where the woman seems interested and indicates, whether verbally or not, that the man needs to prove himself to her. And if that man is any kind of man, he ll allow himself to feel the awesome power, the wonderful beauty, of uncontrollable male passion.Democrats have called on the Senate Judiciary Committee to force Judge to testify with a subpoena. Committee rules allow the panel to issue a subpoena as long as the chairman, Grassley, and the ranking Democrat, Feinstein, agree to it, or by a committee vote.  I think this committee ought to subpoena Mark Judge to come forward,  Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) told CNN s Jim Acosta on Tuesday. You can count on the fact that that letter, his response, is going to be entered in the record by someone, and that needs to be tested as well,  Jones, who is not on the judiciary committee, said.  And I just think this committee, if he doesn t want to do it and they re going to go forward with a hearing, they need to subpoena him, let him say that and let some senators or someone cross-examine him. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who is a member of the committee, said Tuesday that Judge  and other witnesses  should testify before the committee to  provide insight  into Blasey s accusations.

He has denied the allegation and is expected to testify as well.Meanwhile, Congress still hasn t finalized legislation aimed at harassment committed by its own members and staff, even though the House passed a bill in February and the Senate passed a measure of its own in May. The long-overdue reforms originated as a systemic response to the Me Too movement, which also led to the resignations of several lawmakers earlier this year.The monthslong delay could mean that Congress fails to come to a deal before the end of the session, forcing them to start over next year   or perhaps drop the matter completely.Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who helped negotiate the Senate version of the bill alongside Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), said that attempts to resolve differences between the two measures will  probably  have to wait until after the November midterm elections. Blunt, who is the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, also expressed confidence that members of the Judiciary Committee will appropriately handle Monday s hearing with Kavanaugh and his accuser. There s never been a senator involved in a settlement,  Blunt told HuffPost on Tuesday, when asked whether the Kavanaugh allegation is putting new pressure on lawmakers to finish the sexual harassment legislation. (There have been House members who reached settlements over harassment claims.)Blunt added that it was important senators have a  continued awareness [that] the behavior does matter and there are long-term consequences for that. The House and Senate bills both aim to crack down on sexual harassment and abuse in Congress. In a 2016 CQ Roll Call survey, 1 in 6 female staffers said they had been sexually harassed, while 4 in 10 said they believed it was a problem on Capitol Hill. Multiple lawmakers have stepped down over sexual harassment allegations in the last year, including Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Reps. Blake Farenthold, John Conyers (D-Mich.), Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.) and Trent Franks (R-Ariz.).The current law allows members of Congress to use taxpayer funds, rather than their own money, to pay settlements to staffers who allege harassment or discrimination. It also has a series of hoops that staffers must jump through before they can go to court over such allegations, including mandatory counseling, arbitration and a 30-day  cooling off  period.The House and Senate proposed reforms differ in key ways. The Senate bill would not require lawmakers  settlements to be disclosed in all circumstances; the House bill would. The Senate legislation would launch investigations under the Senate ethics committee that might lead to settlements in individual cases, whereas the House bill would create a third-party process. Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill would not require lawmakers to pay for any sexual harassment or discrimination settlements from their own funds in all cases.House staffers involved in negotiations expressed frustration in July with the fact that some female Democratic senators supported the Senate s weaker bill, arguing that the senators  position weakened House lawmakers  hand and made it harder to keep strong language in a final bill.Republicans said Tuesday that Ford s attorney had not yet responded to multiple inquiries as to whether she will attend Monday s Judiciary Committee hearing. The lawyer, Debra Katz, said last week that Ford would be willing to testify before the panel, however. I don t really see it related to what s going to happen on Monday, but I just feel like workplace standards need to be clear and they re not clear yet here,  Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who was involved in drafting the Senate bill, said Tuesday.Democrats, meanwhile, said that Monday s scheduled hearing with Kavanaugh and his accuser highlighted the need to update Congress  own policies on sexual harassment. But when asked why lawmakers of both houses have struggled to reach agreement on the matter, they suggested approaching members of the opposite party. You ll have to ask Republicans. They re the ones in charge,  said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.).Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

It s a shame, because this is a great gentleman,  he said of Kavanaugh at a White House press conference alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda.  I just think that he is at a level that we rarely see, not only in government, anywhere in life,  Trump added.

He also expressed his frustration with Senate Democrats for not bringing up Ford s accusations earlier. The Senate Judiciary Committee s leading Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), received a letter from Ford detailing the alleged sexual assault shortly after Kavanaugh was nominated in July.  They knew what they were doing,  Trump said.

She said that at one point, he and a friend of his locked her in a room and turned up the music so her protests wouldn t be heard. She said Kavanaugh, drunk, climbed on top of her and attempted to remove her clothes. She has taken a polygraph test administered by a former FBI agent and told a therapist about the incident in 2012, although she didn t name Kavanaugh at the time. Ford and Kavanaugh may testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week, although it s not clear whether they can agree to the terms for it to happen. But in the meantime, since Ford s story became public, Republicans have attempted to cast doubt on it. Some of their attempts to argue that Ford s story isn t valid: After the Ford allegations became public   but before Ford revealed her identity   the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee released a letter signed by 65 women who said they knew Kavanaugh in high school and could vouch for his  decency.  Two women who said they dated Kavanaugh also released statements Monday saying that they knew him as a good guy.Bringing out women who didn t experience any sexual misconduct to vouch for the character of a man is a common tactic. It happened during Clarence Thomas  Supreme Court confirmation hearing and when thenñFox News Chairman Roger Ailes was under fire. But just because a man didn t mistreat all women doesn t mean he didn t mistreat one woman.If it could happen to him, Joe from your office could be next. Maybe Ray, the friendly guy who bags your groceries. Or even you.  If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried. We can all be accused of something,  said a lawyer close to the White House.But it hasn t happened to every man. Neal Gorsuch made it onto the Supreme Court bench just fine. So did John Roberts and Samuel Alito. Former Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.) tweeted a similar concern. And remember this: If stupid, bad, or drunken behavior as a minor back in high school were the standard, every male politician in Washington, DC would fail. Every single one. Hypocrites.Alexandra Petri at The Washington Post has a solid response to this worry.The conservative Drudge Report ran with a story from Grabien News on Monday that purported to have uncovered negative reviews of Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University, by her students and posted on RateMyProfessor.com. This attack would seemingly undermine Ford because a bad professor can t also be a victim of sexual assault, or something?But they messed with the wrong woman. No, really. The story was literally about the wrong woman. The reviews were about Christine A. Ford, a social worker who taught at California State University at Fullerton. Although Grabien News posted a retraction, Drudge deleted the tweet and pretended nothing ever happened. Ari Fleischer, who served as President George W. Bush s press secretary during the run-up to the Iraq War, said he wasn t sure Kavanaugh should be held responsible for something he did in high school.  How much in society should any of us be held liable today when we lived a good life, an upstanding life by all accounts, and then something that maybe is an arguable issue took place in high school?  Fleischer said on Fox News.  Should that deny us chances later in life? Even for a Supreme Court job, a presidency of the United States or you name it. How accountable are we for high school actions, when this is clearly a disputable high school action? That s a tough issue. Donald Trump Jr. put up an Instagram post implying that they were just kids back then and it was just like when a boy asks a girl out on a date with a handwritten note. A post shared by Donald Trump Jr. (@donaldjtrumpjr) on Sep 15, 2018 at 12:30pm PDTFord, meanwhile, said that the incident with Kavanaugh  derailed me substantially for four or five years,  leading her to struggle academically and socially. She also had trouble forming relationships with men.  According to The Wall Street Journal s editorial board, because the alleged assault happened so long ago, just ignore it:  Yet there is no way to confirm her story after 36 years, and to let it stop Mr. Kavanaugh s confirmation would ratify what has all the earmarks of a calculated political ambush. Carrie Severino, the chief counsel at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, attempted to defend Kavanaugh on Tuesday by characterizing the behavior described by Ford as  rough horseplay. Kavanaugh spokesperson/activist says it s not clear that the incident was attempted rape as opposed to just  rough horseplay . pic.twitter.com/cANvVNjFKX Her allegations cover a whole range of conduct from boorishness to rough horseplay to actual attempted rape. If you go to rape, yes, that s a very serious allegation,  she said. When the CNN anchor pointed out that Ford never once described what Kavanaugh did as horseplay, Severino replied,  She s certainly implying that it s attempted rape, but you have to look at   there are 35 years of memory that we re trying to play with here. I m saying that the behavior she described here could be a whole range of things. I know her perception of it was one way. Yes, that s what high school students do all the time. Just men and women, horsing around, with one trying to remove the other s clothes. Lance Morrow, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal comparing Kavanaugh to women who had been accused of being witches. He said that  hysterical fantasies had real consequences,  resulting in the death of women believed to be witches.Morrow goes after Ford for first not identifying herself and points out that because there was no police report, no witnesses and the other guy in the room at the time (whose reliability as a character witness is questionable) denies that the incident took place.  The thing happened   if it happened   an awfully long time ago,  he added,  back in Ronald Reagan s time, when the actors in the drama were minors and (the boys, anyway) under the blurring influence of alcohol and adolescent hormones. The Liberty Counsel, a conservative group supporting Kavanaugh, sent out a press release with at least seven reasons the public should not trust Ford. One of them seemed new and different: Ford has a brother, Ralph Blasey, who worked for Baker Hostetler, a law firm that retained Fusion GPS, the infamous DC company that produced the unverified Steele dossier on President Donald Trump and Russia, sparking the Russia investigation.It s ridiculous to think that because Ford s brother works at a law firm that had some tie to the Russia investigation, she is in on some grand conspiracy to bring down Kavanaugh and Trump. But Blasey worked at the firm from 1989 to 2004   long before Trump was president or even considering running for president. Right-wing websites started running with a theory about why Ford is coming out against Kavanaugh (other than that he allegedly assaulted her): His mother, formerly a Maryland district judge, ruled against Ford s parents in a foreclosure case.  Isn t it kind of amazing that all the media reports today didn t mention this little conflict of interest for Blasey-Ford?  wrote the site Pacific Pundit.They didn t mention this story because it s not true, as Snopes points out. Kavanaugh s mom did preside in a foreclosure case involving Ford s parents, but the outcome of the case was actually favorable for them.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But no matter how these conversations start, they all seem to end in the same place.  But ... he was a kid,  my nearest and dearest say.  He was just being young and stupid. Are we really going to hold him accountable for something that allegedly happened when he was so young?  Many add the obligatory,  Obviously, if what this woman is saying is true, it s horrible and wrong.  As if emphasizing the  wrong-ness  of it negates the fact that they don t believe there should be concrete consequences for said wrong.The short answer is: Yes. Actions have consequences. And the actions that Ford says Kavanaugh took in 1982 are alarming. She says a drunken Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her, ground his body against her and attempted to take off her clothes, all while one of his friends looked on. When Ford attempted to scream, she says Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth to silence her   something she believed might  inadvertently kill  her. Ford says she was able to escape when the friend jumped on top of her and Kavanaugh. (Kavanaugh has  categorically and unequivocally  denied Ford s allegation.) To say that an allegation such as this might be disqualifying for a lifetime appointment to our nation s highest office feels quite reasonable. The longer answer is: I get it. I believe in giving people the opportunity to change and redeem themselves from past wrongs. I really do. But as someone who has written about sexual violence nearly every day for the past four years, I take issue with people writing off an accusation of sexual assault because a boy was being a boy young and stupid. I knew a ton of young and stupid boys when I, too, was young and stupid. They may have stolen candy from Rite Aid or smoked weed or, come to think of it, sold weed. (Crimes for which  young and stupid  boys who are not powerful, rich, white men regularly bear long-term consequences for in this country.) But, as far as I know, none of my young and stupid friends held down a girl and tried to force himself on her.As Rebecca Traister so aptly put it on Twitter:  Much of [the] defensive reaction I m seeing around Kavanaugh (and not just from the right) suggests that lots of people think a regular part of male development is the stage where boys drunkenly pin down young women and try to assault them. We need to stop chalking up sexually aggressive behavior as just part of the male experience. Because when we do, we become comfortably apathetic to the fact that enduring sexual violence is part of the female one.When I brought this up during my conversations yesterday, a few people pushed back:  Well, if Kavanaugh lived an exemplary life without any other missteps after the alleged assault,  they argued,  should we penalize him for one wrong? To this, I can t help but think of the research that shows that people who perpetrate sexual violence are often repeat offenders, and, usually, they learn this behavior from a young age. I believe that if Kavanaugh did actually force himself on Ford, he should be barred from sitting on the highest court in the land. (If you think about it, that s not really much of a penalty.) I d prefer a Supreme Court nominee who hasn t been accused of sexual assault, even if the next appointee still wants to gut Roe v. Wade. So, why am I being told I m asking for too much? Why are we still focusing on a man s redemption story instead of a woman s trauma?Ford told The Washington Post that after the alleged assault, she suffered dramatically in all parts of her life. She struggled academically, socially and in her relationships with men.  I think it derailed me substantially for four or five years,  she said. Now 51, Ford says she still deals with anxiety and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder due to the alleged incident.The impact and trauma from sexual violence is lifelong. But, somehow, we re still focused on the perpetrators. We always seem to be focused on the perpetrators. If Kavanaugh s access to power   one of the most powerful jobs in the country   is the most important talking point in this conversation, what does that say about how we value Ford? What does that say about how we value women and survivors?The conversations with my friends (who, it s worth noting, are progressive, well-educated people) points to the most disturbing piece of this controversy: Even after the Me Too movement and all of the social strides we ve made, we re still valuing the perpetrator   his opportunities, his success, his access to power   over survivors.If Kavanaugh did what Ford says he did, it doesn t matter if he was being young and stupid. It doesn t matter if he was drunk. It doesn t matter if he s never again attempted to rape anyone. His alleged behavior forced Ford to endure decades of lasting trauma. Is that not enough evidence to bar a powerful man from getting even more power?"

Christine Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University in California, said that Kavanaugh tried to force himself on her while the two were teenagers in high school. I thought he might inadvertently kill me,  Ford told The Washington Post on Sunday.Kavanaugh has denied the accusation, and prominent Republicans immediately came to his defense. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Judiciary Committee, released a letter in support of Kavanaugh signed by more than 60 women who have known him. The sheer volume of signatures led many to wonder whether Grassley s office knew of the accusation before reports surfaced in the press.On Monday, The Wall Street Journal published three separate opinion pieces, including an editorial in the paper s institutional voice, defending Kavanaugh and casting doubt on his accuser.The Journal s editorial board called the accusation a  political ambush.  The timing and details of how Ms. Ford came forward, and how her name was coaxed into public view, should also raise red flags about the partisan motives at play,  the editors wrote.  The Post says Ms. Ford contacted the paper via a tip line in July but wanted to remain anonymous. She then brought her story to a Democratic official while still hoping to stay anonymous. Ford has said she was 15 when she encountered a 17-year-old Kavanaugh, whom she knew as a  friendly acquaintance,  at a party in suburban Maryland. She said Kavanaugh held her down and tried to remove her clothes, and that Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge, shut the door and turned up music so no one could hear her protests. At one point, Ford said, Kavanaugh put his hand on her mouth to stop her screams. I think it derailed me substantially for four or five years,  Ford told the Post.In another opinion piece published by the Journal on Monday, writer Lance Morrow offered a comparison between the accusation against Kavanaugh and the Salem witch trials.  The thing happened   if it happened   an awfully long time ago, back in Ronald Reagan s time, when the actors in the drama were minors and (the boys, anyway) under the blurring influence of alcohol and adolescent hormones,  Morrow wrote.  No clothes were removed, and no sexual penetration occurred. He called the alleged assault  ugly, and stupid more than evil.  The truth is, no one knows what went on in that Maryland bedroom at that party   or if Mr. Kavanaugh was even there,  William McGurn wrote in yet another opinion piece published in the Journal on Monday.  Absent corroborating testimony, even the Federal Bureau of Investigation would have no way to reveal much more. It s estimated that only between 2 and 10 percent of all rape reports are false (and even that number is complicated, as it applies to more than just instances of fabrication). Conversely, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, more than two-thirds of assaults are never reported at all. And the kind of backlash Ford has experienced in the past few days offers a hint as to why so many survivors choose not to come forward.Need help?

Every teenage girl has been treated like prey, whether by some handsy boy at a party, misogynistic classmates on Instagram or an inappropriate science teacher who stares at her chest in class.So how do we help girls keep from being prey? It can feel like a hopeless battle with no solution. But there s one change that could make a big difference: reforming sexual education curriculums.By the time most young people start sexually experimenting, they have not been taught about consent, a concept often missing from sex ed curriculums. The majority of programs in the U.S. don t discuss the issue, and students enter high school thinking that snapping someone s bra without asking is acceptable behavior. If states would adopt progressive sex ed programs that discuss respect, body language and affirmative consent, they could minimize the type of criminal behavior Kavanaugh is being accused of. If [young people] are not learning these lessons earlier on, we are then steeped in a culture essentially where men have access to women s bodies without any consequence,  said Chitra Panjabi, the president of the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States.  That really is harmful.   Teenagers are prime targets are for sexual violence. Citing a 2017 study by the National Women s Law Center and Lake Research Partners, Glamour said that 21 percent of girls age 14 to 18  reported being sexually assaulted   defined by NWLC as being kissed or touched without their consent.  According to the Rape Abuse & Incest National Network, an American is assaulted every two and a half minutes, and about 44 percent of sexual assaults happen before a victim turns 18. Yet sex ed is mandatory in just 29 states and the District of Columbia, and of those states, only California and Maryland specify that consent must be part of the curriculum. Though curriculums vary from state to state and, in many cases, from school district to school district, teachers generally focus on the biological nuts and bolts rather than power dynamics and consent. In fact, only 14 percent of middle schools cover all the topics that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers  critical sexual health information.  Most people, when they hear of sex ed, think of the very typical condom on the banana demonstration, said Brittany McBride, the senior program manager of sexuality education at the nonprofit Advocates for Youth.  A lot of kids don t even get that bare minimum.  Lauren Atkins said she was raped by a male classmate after drinking too much at a high school party last year. After the alleged incident, which she spoke about in Rolling Stone and Babe.net, she helped write a bill called Lauren s Law, which would give high school teachers in Oklahoma the training and resources to teach students about consent. (It has yet to pass the state Senate.) Atkins, who is now 18 and a freshman at the University of Oklahoma, said her middle and high school sex education consisted of basic lessons in anatomy. While she said a lack of education does not excuse her alleged perpetrator s behavior, she wishes he had known more about consent.  I was too drunk to say no. I was too drunk to move,  she said.  I wish he knew that just because I wasn t saying no doesn t mean I was saying yes.  Ideally, sex educators think, discussions about consent should begin in kindergarten. No, that doesn t mean 5-year-olds would be learning about sex. But they could start thinking about how to respectfully borrow a toy from someone and learn that they don t have to kiss or hug a relative if they don t want to. McBride said it s important to have these kinds of conversations with kids as soon as possible so that when they start middle school or high school, they have a solid grasp of the basics.  [By that point] we are talking about drugs being involved and [asking]  Can a person give consent?   she said.  I can t go into deep, detailed conversations on consent if we never got that first lesson on what does consent actually mean and what does it look like.  Panjabit said sex ed curriculums for teenagers need to go beyond explanations of biology, safe sex and diseases. According to her, schools need to implement holistic programs that include LGBTQ students and discussions about how harmful gender stereotypes, power dynamics and unhealthy relationships all contribute to high rates of sexual harassment and abuse. She said one of the biggest issues is that many teenagers still think consent amounts to  No means no.   Enthusiastic consent needs to be the standard,  she said.  And [people] need to understand the role alcohol can play [and] understand how consent can t be given.   While experts want to see consent-based sex education programs mandated at the federal level, passing that kind of law is a hard sell. Rather than focus on the importance of consent, politicians have framed sex ed as a moral referendum on whether young people should be having sex. Abstinence-only programs that peddle false science are often supported by conservative legislators and religious groups, especially in Southern states. Experts say abstinence-only backers hold the false belief that sex ed programs encourage children to have sex, when in reality, they give young people the information to make healthy choices.  We are not encouraging young people to go out and have sex,  said Oronde Cruger, the program coordinator for Speak About It, a nonprofit that promotes sexual education.  We re encouraging them, when they are making decisions about intimacy in whatever form that takes, to be responsible and to be respectful, both of their own emotions and of the people they are interacting with.   Until these discussions evolve past a standstill on the morality of sex, sex ed curriculums throughout the country will not evolve past basic biology. And teenage girls will continue to have traumatic sexual experiences that haunt their adult lives.  We are having a national conversation about sexual assault and consent, but we are not following with a national curriculum about sexual education and consent,  said Catherine Buxton, the communications and marketing coordinator at Speak About It.  In our eyes, sex education isn t comprehensive until it includes affirmative consent.

I don t know Kavanaugh the judge. But Kavanaugh the carpool dad is one great guy,  read the headline for one Washington Post op-ed by Julie O Brien, a woman who knows Kavanaugh through their daughters  school. Lisa Blatt, a self-described  liberal Democrat and feminist,  wrote a piece in Politico telling the Supreme Court to confirm Kavanaugh and even introduced him at his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, giving him a boost of bipartisan credibility. And then there were the letters. Eighty students who had Kavanaugh as a professor at Harvard Law School signed a letter saying he was an  inspiring professor.  Thirty-four of his former clerks said he  has been a role model to us personally as well as professionally.  And Yale University, where he went to undergraduate and law school, issued a glowing press release with five distinguished professors and faculty members congratulating him and extolling his intellectual talent. All of that came before there were allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted a woman when they were both in high school. The day after those allegations came out, 65 women who knew Kavanaugh in high school were still willing to issue a letter attesting to his character and his treatment of women. But that, too, was before Christine Blasey Ford publicly identified herself and fully told her story, alleging that Kavanaugh, then 17, locked her in a room and attempted to remove her clothes while putting his hand over her mouth so she couldn t scream. She was 15 at the time. HuffPost contacted all the aforementioned supporters of Kavanaugh when contact information was available. The vast majority of people didn t reply, which could mean any number of things (e.g. they don t want to publicly stand by him anymore, they didn t see the comment request, etc.).Former Harvard Law students: Eighteen still support Kavanaugh, three do not. Nine requested anonymity.Former clerks: Twelve still support Kavanaugh. Four requested anonymity.Yale faculty: Two responded saying they were not endorsing Kavanaugh for confirmation.Women who knew Kavanaugh in high school: Eight still support Kavanaugh.The couple dozen who did respond all stood by Kavanaugh, except for three of Kavanaugh s former Harvard Law students   one of whom requested anonymity   who seemed more uneasy with the allegations. I signed the initial letter from Harvard Law alums based on what I knew of Judge Kavanaugh s character at the time of the request,  said Elizabeth Knox, Harvard Law School  16.  I could not support any nominee who acted in the ways described in this allegation. I would urge the Senate to refrain from holding a confirmation vote until more information is known.  We know one of two scenarios is true: either 1) the allegations are true and the Judge lied, in which case his lie alone should automatically disqualify him from consideration; or 2) the allegations are false, but there will always be a cloud of doubt surrounding him were he to be confirmed to the court. Given that reality, no, I don t still support his confirmation, and I think the White House should withdraw his nomination and put someone else forward,  said Esther Mulder, Harvard Law School  14.Two Yale professors who were featured in the university s press release on Kavanaugh s nomination wanted to make clear that they were not endorsing him. Indeed, at the bottom of the fawning press release, there was a disclaimer that it was not an endorsement. But it sounded like one.Yale Law Professor William Eskridge said his comments were only about Kavanaugh s  excellence as a legal intellect and thinker,  and Professor Abbe Gluck said that her  personal views about Judge Kavanaugh were separate from [her] views regarding confirmation on the merits, and that those depended on a full and thorough hearing of the Judge s record.  She added that she believes the allegations require a full airing before any vote should occur.Another former Harvard Law student, Renee Gerber Burbank  09, didn t respond to HuffPost but did tweet that she was appalled by the allegations. She also criticized Republicans for using these letters as weapons against Ford. Until this weekend, I told ppl that even if I disagreed with Kavanaugh, I thought he was a good man. That *should* be part of the analysis. I am gutted that may not be true   heartbroken for Ms. Ford, & mad that politics & ambition will probably trump doing the right thingAlso, fuck you Judiciary Cmtee Republicans for weaponizing statements, which largely were NOT made as a defense against these allegations, to imply that these people don t believe her. Just because people in good faith said nice things doesn t mean they don t #believewomenInterestingly, of the 42 responses HuffPost received, 12 said they stood by Kavanaugh but did not want their name published   despite the fact that they already attached their name to a public letter saying they supported him.  I d prefer not to be named in any piece on this issue,  said a former Harvard Law student,  but will reiterate that Judge Kavanaugh s character did impress me and ... these allegations strike me as very out of character.  Of the people who were willing to go on the record, they said they stood firmly by the man they knew. Justin Walker, Harvard Law School  09, said he believes Kavanaugh because  the Judge I know would rather lose a job than tell a lie.  Hagan Scotten, a former Kavanaugh clerk, said he is  a man and a judge of unimpeachable character.  And Daniel McEntee, Harvard Law School  12, called Kavanaugh  one of, if not the best, instructors I ve ever had in all my years of primary and secondary education.  He s seriously a Ned Flanders type personality,  McEntee added.  I can t say that I knew the teenage Brett Kavanaugh, but the alleged incident is so unlike the Brett Kavanaugh I know that I have a difficult time believing it.  Without a doubt I would still sign the letter supporting Brett,  added Paula Duke Ebel, one of the women who knew Kavanaugh in high school.  He is a man of outstanding character and would never assault anyone. Neither Blatt, the feminist law professor, nor O Brien, the carpool friend, returned requests for comment.After Ford went public with her allegations, hundreds of women who went to her high school   including actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus   signed a letter supporting her.This piece will continue to be updated as more responses come in.Matt Ferner, Hayley Miller, Lydia O Connor, Molly Redden and Jessica Schulberg contributed reporting.

But there is still one big showdown between two Democrats left at the ballot box.In California, which has a nonpartisan, top-two primary system, former state Senate Leader Kevin de LeÛn (D) is challenging the more moderate U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) in November.De LeÛn, who stepped down from his leadership post in March, released a biographical video advertisement on Tuesday made by the same political production team, WIN, that was responsible for Wisconsin Democrat Randy Bryce s viral announcement ad last year.The nearly three-minute spot,  Our Time,  shares the cinematic features of other ads released by progressive insurgents this election cycle. But it s likely to make the biggest waves for the tough shots it takes at Feinstein.The ad, which the campaign is paying to promote on the internet, begins with de LeÛn narrating his personal story. As a boy, he would accompany his mother, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala, on house-cleaning jobs in the San Diego area. We see actors portraying a young de LeÛn and his mother.Halfway through the ad, de LeÛn discusses his revulsion at President Donald Trump s hard-line immigration policies, including the separation of undocumented parents from their children at the border.  How would my life change if they had taken her away from me? Who would I be today?  he says, as we see Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents take away de LeÛn s  mother.   And where did all this horror begin? It began, the video implies, with politicians like Feinstein, who denounced undocumented immigrants in harsh terms decades before Trump ran for president using much cruder rhetoric.Rather than have de LeÛn make this point himself, the ad simply shows two clips of Feinstein in 1994 and 1993, making hard-line denunciations of  illegal immigrants.  The illegal immigrants who come here and commit felonies   that s not what this nation is,  the video shows Feinstein saying in 1994. I say return them to their own country, wherever that country may be,  the video next shows her saying in 1993.The ad then cuts to footage of Trump s June 2015 campaign announcement, where he calls undocumented immigrants  rapists.  We deserve better leadership,  de LeÛn concludes.  There s too much at risk. Feinstein is far from the most conservative member of the Senate Democratic Caucus, but her record is indeed more centrist than California s progressive reputation might suggest. On immigration, Feinstein tried to outflank Republican Michael Huffington, a congressman who challenged her in the Senate in 1994. Feinstein ran an ad against Huffington blasting him for failing to fund  new border guards,  even as Feinstein  led the fight against illegal immigration.  Huffington had voted against a massive appropriations bill passed by the then-Democratic House, which financed the hiring of 700 new guards, but voted for other bills beefing up border security. (Huffington was married to Arianna Huffington, the founder and former editor-in-chief of HuffPost.)Of course, even then, Feinstein was navigating tricky terrain. At the time, she was also publicly opposing Proposition 187, an ultimately successful ballot initiative that barred undocumented immigrants from receiving state benefits. Huffington supported the ballot initiative.And as mayor of San Francisco in 1985, Feinstein had made the city a sanctuary city for asylum seekers from Guatemala and El Salvador.Feinstein has since become an advocate for comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for the country s 11 million undocumented immigrants. She voted for the 2013 bipartisan immigration reform bill that did just that, and against a 2015 bill that would have leveraged federal funds to penalize  sanctuary cities  that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities.But in an interview with HuffPost, de LeÛn noted that as recently as September 2017, Feinstein agreed with an interviewer s assessment that former President Barack Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was on  shaky legal ground.  A spokesperson for her office subsequently clarified that she meant that the executive branch policy was under legal attack, and thus that legislation codifying it was urgent.De LeÛn also slammed Feinstein s 2006 vote for the Secure Fence Act, which allotted funding for at  least 2 layers of reinforced fencing  and  the installation of additional physical barriers  at the U.S.-Mexico border. Feinstein was one of 26 Democrats to vote for the act. Sixteen Democrats, one Democratic-affiliated independent and one Republican voted against it. The ad is an accurate contrast   a juxtaposition between our actions and what we do in a position of power to improve the human condition for millions of hard-working folks who deserve to become full-fledged Americans,  de LeÛn said.He wants to remind Californians of Feinstein s record of centrist positions not only on immigration, but also on taxes and foreign policy, which he believes show she is out of touch with California voters. Feinstein voted for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and for former President George W. Bush s income and estate tax cuts, and until recently, she supported the death penalty, de LeÛn noted. (By 2007, Feinstein expressed regret for her vote to authorize the Iraq War.)Referring to her 2006 vote for the Secure Fence Act, de LeÛn said that Feinstein  voted for a wall before Donald Trump ever started speaking about the wall.  That s not a critique, those are her votes,  de LeÛn said.  It s an opportunity to introduce myself to the voters of California and allow them to make the choice. The attack resembles the Trump administration s defense of its proposal to build a border wall, a claim Politifact rated  half true.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton voted for the measure, which created fencing, rather than a wall, at the border.De LeÛn is also critical of Feinstein s leadership as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He focused on her apology to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for protesters  disruptions of his confirmation hearing. It was another demonstration of disconnection from the fears that many families have if this confirmation is successful,  de LeÛn said.De LeÛn said he is concerned about Kavanaugh s opposition to abortion rights and other civil liberties, and his unwillingness to state whether he would allow Trump to pardon himself for any alleged crimes he has committed.Given what de LeÛn believes is the  constitutional threat  to the country posed by Kavanaugh s confirmation and past Republican obstruction of Merrick Garland s nomination, he said he would consider joining acts of civil disobedience against Kavanaugh.He even favors expanding the number of justices on the Supreme Court, so that Democrats would not need to wait for a justice s retirement or death to influence the court s makeup. Would I be supportive of expanding the U.S. Supreme Court? Under the current conditions, the answer is,  Absolutely, yes,   he said.Reached for comment, Feinstein s campaign defended the senator and accused de LeÛn of  desperately trying to change the subject.  Senator Feinstein has been a leader in protecting California s immigrant community,  said Feinstein campaign spokesman Bill Carrick.Feinstein s campaign referred HuffPost to several pieces of legislation Feinstein has championed that would protect undocumented immigrants, including a bill providing a path to citizenship for agricultural workers. The campaign also emphasized her authorship of the Keep Families Together Act explicitly prohibiting Trump s family separation policy. In a Spanish-language ad, Feinstein touts these stances as well as her on-air demand that Trump sign a  clean  DACA bill, making the policy permanent without preconditions. State Sen. de LeÛn is desperately trying to change the subject after his appalling attacks against Senator Feinstein for honoring Dr. [Christine Blasey] Ford s request for confidentiality until she decided to share her story,  Carrick said.De LeÛn has criticized Feinstein for not releasing Ford s accusation of sexual assault against Kavanaugh sooner. But Feinstein said she was honoring Ford s request for privacy. Ford s lawyer Debra Katz has since confirmed that Ford did not want to come forward until it became clear that the media had learned of the story and was poised to report on it.De LeÛn, 51, has represented parts of Los Angeles in the state legislature since 2006, first in the Assembly, and since 2010 in the state Senate. He became president pro tempore of the state Senate   the highest-ranking legislator in the chamber, and the first Latino in California s history to hold that position   in 2014, before stepping down as leader in March. Prior to his career as a lawmaker, de LeÛn worked as an immigrant rights advocate and an organizer for a teachers union.With neither the youth and viral stardom of progressive newcomers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, nor the backing of the Golden State s most powerful Democrats, de LeÛn has struggled to break through in the polls. Public surveys, the most recent of which was conducted in mid-July, consistently show him trailing Feinstein by about 20 percentage points. However, a poll conducted earlier this month by the generally pro-GOP Probolsky Research firm found de LeÛn trailing by just 8 points.Feinstein, 85, has served in the U.S. Senate since 1992, when she won a special election to fill a seat vacated by then-Republican Sen. Pete Wilson.  Able to draw on both a massive personal fortune and the largesse of corporations and wealthy donors, the senior California senator has far outspent de LeÛn. Thanks in part to $9.75 million that Feinstein has lent her campaign, she has raised nearly $15 million and still has $3.8 million on hand. Her largest corporate donor is the San Francisco-area biotech firm Genentech, which has contributed $20,000 to her campaign through a political action committee.De LeÛn, by contrast, has raised $1.3 million and has just under $426,000 left in the bank. His top contributors are labor unions.Nearly every prominent Democrat in the state has rallied behind Feinstein, including Sen. Kamala Harris and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is poised to cruise to victory in his own race for governor. Some progressive activists had hoped Newsom would face a Democrat in the general election, forcing both him and, likely, Feinstein to work harder for progressive support.Hoping for an easier general election, Newsom buttressed Republican businessman John Cox in the primary.  Now, with Cox at the top of the ballot, state Republicans are more likely to show up to the polls. Some of those same Republicans may also vote for Feinstein in order to avoid electing the more left-leaning de LeÛn.For his part, de LeÛn worked hard to secure the endorsement of the California Democratic Party, where activists have a significant voice. He also has the backing of progressive Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna (Calif.), Jimmy Gomez (Calif.), Lou Correa (Calif.), Filemon Vela (Texas) and Ra˙l Grijalva (Ariz.), as well as the California-based liberal billionaire Tom Steyer. Steyer contributed $2,700 to de LeÛn s primary bid, but has yet to invest major sums on de LeÛn s behalf through his outside political groups.Progressive primary challengers have had far more success against incumbents in down-ballot races this election cycle. Insurgents have unseated just two incumbent Democratic members of Congress: Rep. Joseph Crowley in New York, and Rep. Michael Capuano in Massachusetts.The results of the state-level New York Democratic primary last Thursday were typical. The establishment candidates at the top of the ticket, led by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, romped to victory, while progressives enjoyed unexpected success in competitive state Senate races.However, de LeÛn benefits from the kind of deep governing experience that someone like Cynthia Nixon, Cuomo s progressive challenger, lacked.In fact, he has a record of progressive accomplishments in the legislature that would be the envy of many congressional veterans. He was the author of California s sanctuary state bill, which became law in October. More recently, de LeÛn shepherded the passage of a climate change bill that requires California to run on 100 percent renewable energy by 2045. I m no stranger to crafting complex, arcane policies like 100 percent clean energy. That s not an easy feat in the fifth largest economy in the world,  de LeÛn said. I m not being aspirational,  he added.  I want to get shit done. This story has been updated with comments from Feinstein s campaign.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

That s simply inadequate, unfair, wrong, and a desire not to get at the whole truth and nothing but the truth,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor. Even the plan to hear from just Kavanaugh and Ford seems to be in flux. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said Tuesday that Ford hasn t confirmed she would attend the Monday hearing. Ford s attorney s office did not respond to a request for comment. Ford s attorney has previously said her client would testify. Democrats said people should cut Ford some slack on her response time, noting that she came forward on Sunday and that Grassley quickly scheduled a hearing without consulting her.  To be treated fairly, she should have at least been asked if she was available that day,  Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said. Schumer said the FBI, which conducts background checks of judicial nominees, should investigate Ford s claim that Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her when they were both high school students in the early 1980s. He said the committee should also hear from Mark Judge, a Kavanaugh classmate Ford said was in the room during the alleged incident. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and one of the lawmakers whom Ford first notified of the allegations, similarly condemned the lack of witnesses.  What about other witnesses like Kavanaugh s friend Mark Judge? What about individuals who were previously told about this incident? What about experts who can speak to the effects of this kind of trauma on a victim?  she said in a statement.  This is another attempt by Republicans to rush this nomination and not fully vet Judge Kavanaugh. Republicans have been largely supportive of having only two witnesses: Ford and Kavanaugh. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.) said the public has  heard from  Judge already in his statement denying the allegations.  I just don t think we need to draw it out,  she told reporters. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said,  Hearing from the accuser and the accused is the appropriate way to do it. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a key undecided senator on Kavanaugh s nomination, on Tuesday called on the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow outside counsel to question both witnesses.President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he wanted to hear from both sides but also  get this done as quickly as possible.  But Democrats seemed to have coalesced around the message that more time will likely be necessary. Schumer said having only two witnesses, and then quickly holding a committee vote on the nominee, would repeat the mistake the Judiciary Committee made when it declined to hear testimony from additional witnesses who could corroborate Anita Hill s accusations of sexual harassment by then-nominee Clarence Thomas, who now serves in the Supreme Court. We must not repeat the mistake of the Anita Hill hearings,  he said on the Senate floor.  They were rushed and were a debacle. Hill urged the Senate not to  rush these hearings  in an op-ed published Tuesday by The New York Times. Doing so would not only signal that sexual assault accusations are not important   hastily appraising this situation would very likely lead to facts being overlooked that are necessary for the Senate and the public to evaluate,  she wrote.  That the committee plans to hold a hearing this coming Monday is discouraging. Simply put, a week s preparation is not enough time for meaningful inquiry into very serious charges.

To recap, Kavanaugh is the federal appeals court judge who is accused of drunkenly sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl when he was 17, allegedly pinning her down on a bed with his body weight, groping her, attempting to rip off her clothes and stifling her screams with his hand to the point where she says she couldn t breathe. Christine Blasey Ford is the psychology professor at Palo Alto University who reluctantly came forward to share what she said was a violent, terrifying attack that altered the trajectory of her life   knowing that speaking out would expose her to a barrage of harassment. I thought he might inadvertently kill me,  Ford said of the alleged assault.They will both publicly testify on Monday. Kavanaugh flatly denies the allegations. Listening to Kavanaugh s defenders, one gets the impression it is his life that is being annihilated. He is in danger of being  brought down  by accusations, according to a lawyer close to the White House. Democrats want to  destroy the life of a distinguished public servant for the sake of appeasing their base,  the conservative Judicial Crisis Network said. He was just a teenager, Minnesota state Sen. Scott Newman (R) wrote on Twitter. Even if Ford s allegations are credible, he should be judged by his character now, said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). He is a  really good man,  Hatch added.Yes, we have arrived at the stage where people are hyperbolically lamenting the apparent destruction of a powerful man s life, while ignoring the potential consequences of the alleged assault on the victim herself. To be clear, Kavanaugh is not facing criminal charges or prison time. No one is saying he should disappear from public life. At most, some are wondering if a person who may have tried to rape a young girl should not get the privilege of a lifetime appointment to one of the country s most powerful institutions. He is not entitled to a Supreme Court seat; this is, in essence, a job interview.But you know what can be completely life-changing? Experiencing sexual assault as a teen.  The research is very clear,  said David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire.  It is one of the most predictive variables in looking at later life adversities   things like alcohol and drug abuse, subsequent victimization, domestic violence, depression, anxiety disorders.  Besides associating sex with fear during a formative phase of one s life, one of the most insidious ways sexual violence affects teen victims is by making them feel powerless, Finkelhor said.  Adolescence is an important period in formulating your view about how and whether to plan for a future, based on a sense of how able you will be to control what happens,  he said.  When bad and unexpected things blindside you, it can disrupt your sense of your ability to control, and create pessimism and apathy. In other words, victims can lose faith in their ability to create a positive future for themselves. If terrible things are going to happen anyway, why bother? By Ford s account, her life was dramatically altered by the alleged assault. She told The Washington Post that she struggled academically and socially afterward. She experienced post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. And it interfered with her relationships with men.  I think it derailed me substantially for four or five years,  Ford said. Ford has come forward, with full knowledge that she is likely to experience threats, smears, the usual gamut done to women who speak out against men in power. Kavanaugh might   maybe   just lose a job. So, wait, who is the victim here?Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Biden, then-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, presided over Thomas  confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court that year and faced widespread criticism for allowing   and some said abetting   an all-white and all-male committee to badger Hill with probing and skeptical questions.Speaking to reporters Monday at an event at the residence of the U.S. ambassador to Ireland, Biden again expressed regret for how Hill was treated and insisted he d believed her allegations against Thomas from the very start. I thought she was telling the truth at the beginning,  Biden said, according to the Post.  I really did. Biden added that any woman s public allegation of sexual assault should generally be presumed to be true. For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she s talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it s been made worse or better over time,  Biden said.  But nobody fails to understand that this is like jumping into a cauldron. According to the Post s Philip Rucker, there was one question about Kavanaugh s alleged assault that Biden appeared unwilling to answer.Rucker described the exchange:Biden seemed to enjoy answering questions tonight with a few reporters at Irish ambassador s home   until he was asked whether it mattered that Kavanaugh was 17 https://t.co/las4sws81H pic.twitter.com/BgZb7CQYqhEarlier Monday, Biden said through a spokesperson that he believed Kavanaugh s nomination should be postponed until Christine Blasey Ford, the clinical psychology professor who s accused the judge of physical and sexual assault, has an opportunity to tell her story. Vice President Biden believes Professor Ford deserves a fair and respectful hearing of her allegations, and that the committee should undertake a thorough and nonpartisan effort to get to the truth, wherever it leads,  the spokesperson said, according to CNN.  He believes the vote should be postponed to allow this to happen appropriately, because this is an appointment for life to the nation s highest court, and getting the decision right is more important than getting it done on a rushed timeline. A spokesperson for Joe Biden says the former VP believes Kavanaugh votes should be postponed and Christine Blasey Ford  deserves a fair and respectful hearing of her allegations  Full statement from spox   pic.twitter.com/Z57fzN5T4MIn the years since Thomas  confirmation hearings, Biden has repeatedly come under scrutiny for how Hill was treated during her testimony. He has since publicly apologized to Hill, saying last year that he was  so sorry that she had to go through what she went through.  I m confident he did what she asserted. I believed in Anita. I voted against Clarence Thomas,  he said during the 2017 Glamour Women of the Year Summit.A few days later, Hill told the Post that while she accepted  part  of Biden s apology, she did not believe the former vice president has taken sufficient  ownership of his role in what happened.  He also doesn t understand that it wasn t just that I felt it was not fair. It was that women were looking to the Senate Judiciary Committee and his leadership to really open the way to have these kinds of hearings,  Hill said.

After the accusation became public last week, 65 women signed a letter saying the nominee was  a good person  who  has always treated women with decency and respect.   You know what s a little incriminating? If you get accused of sexual assault and you just happen to have on hand a list of other women you didn t sexually assault,  Meyers said.

Sarah Sophie Flicker, whose husband, Jesse Peretz, directed episodes of the Netflix series  Glow,  made an equally bold statement on the red carpet.In a reference to Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, she wore the words  Stop Kavanaugh  on her arm alongside the number for the U.S. Capitol switchboard, (202) 224-3121<U+202C>. For the Senate Judiciary Committee to move forward with a vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh this week, without pausing for a thorough investigation of the allegations of sexual violence, would be a gross injustice and an insult to women,  she wrote on Instagram alongside a photo.  Stop the vote. Other celebrities   like Adam Scott   wore pink Time s Up buttons that said  We believe Christine Blasey Ford  and  We still believe Anita Hill. Ford, a professor in California, recently came forward with allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her as a teenager.According to Los Angeles Times  Amy Kaufman, the pink buttons resembled similar ones  created in 1991 in support of Anita Hill following her sexual harassment allegations against Justice C.

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) has a brother who went to the same high school as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the 1980s, giving her a deeper insight into the atmosphere and culture of the elite private school world in Washington, D.C., as Kavanaugh faces an allegation of sexual assault from his teenage years.Brian Murkowski, the senator s younger brother, was three years behind Kavanaugh at Georgetown Prep. A person who was in Brian s class described him as a  big-time partier  and noted that the school seemed to really get serious and crack down on partying in 1986. It s not clear if Murkowski was there for all of high school, but he attended at least in his sophomore year. It s not clear how much Lisa Murkowski has talked to her brother, who stays out of the public eye. But she s evidently consulted him at least briefly, because Karina Borger, Murkowski s spokeswoman, said that  Senator Murkowski s brother didn t know Kavanaugh. Still, the connection is one that gives Murkowski more to consider as she weighs the nomination. The senator is considered one of the most likely Republican  no  votes on Kavanaugh, but so far, she s been quiet about how she s leaning on confirming him. She is facing significant pressure to vote against Kavanaugh from activists on women s rights, health care and Alaska Natives.Christine Blasey Ford, a professor in California, has accused Kavanaugh of attempting to sexually assault her while they were at a high school party in the 1980s. At the time, she was 15 and a student at Holton-Arms, an all-girls private school in Bethesda, Maryland, and Kavanaugh was 17.Ford alleges that Kavanaugh and his friend locked her in a room and that Kavanaugh, who was drunk, held her down and tried to remove her clothes. She said that at one point he held his hand on her mouth to stifle her screams, but that she managed to escape.Lisa Murkowski went to high school in Alaska, but in 1980, her father, Frank, was elected to the U.S. Senate. That meant her family was spending more time in Washington, D.C., and that when it was time for her younger brother to attend high school, he went to Georgetown Prep.

For the Trump administration and the Republican leaders who enable it, truth is no longer a cherished value. To them, lying seems to be part of the strategy, a cynical weapon to be used against their opponents.This week, we are witnessing the full depth of that cynicism, as the White House and its supporters smear a woman who makes credible, significant accusations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. At the same time, another fact has become clear: Kavanaugh himself has a casual relationship with the truth   and in that, he fits right in with the way President Donald Trump and his party behave.At the White House event announcing Kavanaugh s nomination, the appellate judge offered a remark that seemed odd. Praising Trump, he said,  No president has ever consulted more widely, or talked with more people from more backgrounds, to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.  I personally found this hard to believe. How would Kavanaugh know that? Why would he be so sure and definitive about it? I did what we all do these days with the overwhelming list of lies coming out of this White House   I figured that Republicans were all  in on it,  that this comment would stand as just another obviously false spin in the process of getting another illegitimate seat on the Supreme Court for a conservative judge. But it turns out this was only a glimpse into the nominee s disturbing willingness to avoid the truth.In fact, there s clear evidence showing that Kavanaugh lied under oath during the 2006 confirmation hearing for his spot on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. I should know: I was one of the senators on the Judiciary Committee who questioned him.I asked Kavanaugh about his involvement as White House staff secretary in the highly controversial 2001 nomination of Charles Pickering Sr. to the 5th Circuit. Many of us were concerned about a 1994 hate crimes case in which Pickering decided that a 25-year-old, who had participated with two others in a cross burning, was deserving of a reduced sentence. During the Senate s consideration of Pickering s nomination, we had also learned that the federal trial judge solicited and collected letters of support from lawyers who had appeared in his courtroom, some of whom had cases still pending before him. This was a clear breach of judicial ethics, so I asked Kavanaugh about it: Sen. Russ Feingold: My first question is this. Did you know that Judge Pickering planned to solicit letters of support in this manner before he did so? And if not, when did you become aware that Judge Pickering had solicited these letters of support?Brett Kavanaugh: The answer to the first question, Senator, is no. This was not one of the judicial nominees that I was primarily handling.But newly released emails show that Kavanaugh appeared to be the primary person handling Pickering s nomination, at least by 2003, and was heavily involved in pushing for his confirmation as early as March 2002. There are emails showing that Kavanaugh coordinated meetings with and about Pickering; that he drafted remarks, letters to people on the Hill and at least one op-ed for then-White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales about Pickering; that he advised Gonzales on Pickering strategy; and much more.One Department of Justice official even asked for Kavanaugh s  blessings and instructions  before calling the nominee.Others may have been involved, but Kavanaugh played a decisive leadership role in managing Pickering s nomination and then lied to me about it.In another example, Kavanaugh had worked to advance multiple controversial judicial nominations from President George W. Bush during a time when a Republican Senate staffer named Manuel Miranda accessed and downloaded thousands of computer files belonging to Democratic senators. Because Kavanaugh could have been in receipt of the stolen documents, he was grilled by senators of both parties on the matter at his first confirmation hearing in 2004 and he denied any involvement.But emails released this year show that Kavanaugh received material from numerous emails, draft letters and memos laying out the legal arguments Democrats were going to make regarding Bush s judicial nominees, including talking points written by a staffer to Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). One email even had the subject line  Spying  on it. Kavanaugh not only received that message, which mentioned a  mole,  but forwarded it to Gonzales. Leahy asked Kavanaugh about this regrettable episode in the 2004 confirmation hearing, and Kavanaugh s responses were both unsatisfying and evasive.Taking all his testimony together, we see a clear pattern emerge: Brett Kavanaugh has never appeared under oath before the U.S. Senate without lying.As a onetime member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I considered the truthfulness of judicial nominees as a non-negotiable quality. Lying under oath cannot and must not be rewarded with a seat on the nation s highest court, and lies cannot remain unchallenged.So as an illegitimate administration goes to work attacking the credibility of a brave woman recounting her assault, let s recognize the enormously cynical hypocrisy: The nominee they re desperate to protect is a calculated liar who uses dishonesty to advance his own career. And any denial of these accusations by Kavanaugh before the committee must be viewed in the context of his multiple earlier lies under oath to that same committee.This nomination can and must be withdrawn. Nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court must be held to a higher standard, and it is the job of determined senators to do just that.Russ Feingold served as a United States senator from Wisconsin from 1993 to 2011 and is the founder of @LegitAction."

A Senate with a razor-thin Republican margin. Women voters already rejecting the party, with midterms only seven weeks away.In a summer of stumbles for President Donald Trump s party heading into the coming midterm elections, now add a suddenly troubled nomination to the Supreme Court.What not long ago was believed would be a boost to Republicans has instead become the latest anchor threatening to sink the party, with neither the White House nor the GOP-led Senate sure of a safe path forward after the accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that high court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh once tried to rape her.Monday evening, Republicans chose to let Ford, now a psychology professor in California, testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and to bring back Kavanaugh to hear his side   a risky idea at best. Apart from the prospect of a dais packed with male Republican senators like Texas  Ted Cruz grilling Ford (there are no female GOP senators on the committee) is the possibility that average Americans will find her believable. If she gets up there and is credible, it s a real problem for them,  one Republican close to the White House said Monday on condition of anonymity.  And how he does is as determinative as how well she does. Perhaps to avoid that, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell previously endorsed a plan by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the Judiciary Committee s chairman, of conducting bipartisan interviews with Ford and Kavanaugh   but not taking public testimony. Within hours, though, with several Republican senators speaking as if a public hearing were a given, one was scheduled for next Monday.White House spokesman Raj Shah, who has been shepherding the nominee s movement through the confirmation process, said Kavanaugh welcomed the opportunity to answer the accusation.  Judge Kavanaugh looks forward to a hearing where he can clear his name of this false allegation. He stands ready to testify tomorrow if the Senate is ready to hear him,  Shah said.Trump, in a Monday afternoon photo opportunity, said he had not spoken to Kavanaugh recently but continued to support him. Asked if Kavanaugh had offered to withdraw his nomination, Trump answered,  What a ridiculous question.  If it takes a little delay, it ll take a little delay,  he said, adding that he wants  a full process   and hear everybody out. Kavanaugh earlier Monday released a statement through the White House denying that the encounter as Ford described it ever took place. This is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes   to her or to anyone,  he said.  Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. That denial aligns with the approach Trump allies have taken when accused of sexual misconduct or spousal abuse in the past two years   from Roy Moore facing an accusation of child sex abuse as he ran for Senate in Alabama to thenñRepublican National Committee finance chairman Steve Wynn after he was accused of sexual harassment by female employees to former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who failed to receive a full security clearance because of domestic abuse allegations.In all those cases, Trump sided with the men, arguing that he believed their denials of the allegations.That approach fits with Trump s handling of the many credible sexual misconduct allegations against him over the years   an approach he reportedly explained in detail to a friend.  You ve got to deny, deny, deny and push back on these women,  he said, according to journalist Bob Woodward s new book,  Fear,  about the Trump White House.  You ve got to push back hard. You ve got to deny anything that s said about you. Never admit. That tactic, if it ends with Republicans ramming Kavanaugh through despite Ford s accusations, could wind up harming the party even further in the coming midterms.Pollsters across the political spectrum are finding a yawning gender gap, with female voters favoring Democratic candidates by as much as 25 percentage points. While men are favoring Republicans by single digits, women make up a larger percentage of the electorate. There are enough Republican and independent women who may just pause and say,  This is too much,   said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster.  Remember, a decision not to vote by some GOP women can be as critical as voting for the Democratic candidates. Kavanaugh, a judge on the powerful Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, spent much of Monday huddled at the White House. As late as last week, his confirmation to retired Justice Anthony Kennedy s seat seemed all but certain.That began to come apart after reports that the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, California Sen. Diane Feinstein, was in possession of a letter from a woman alleging that Kavanaugh and a friend assaulted her decades earlier at a high school party. Previously not publicly identified, Ford put a name to the allegation and filled in details in an interview published Sunday in The Washington Post.Kavanaugh s new travails reopen the question of why he was added to Trump s list of potential nominees in the first place.Trump, who had never shown much interest in who was or was not on the Supreme Court, essentially guaranteed nominations acceptable to Christian conservatives if they supported his campaign in May 2016, when he produced a list of 11 names given to him by the conservative Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation. Four months later, Trump added 10 names to the list and then said in a statement,  This list is definitive and I will choose only from it in picking future justices of the United States Supreme Court. But Trump broke that promise last November. After choosing Neil Gorsuch from the pre-election list, Trump added five names to it, including Kavanaugh s.Kavanaugh, like Gorsuch, had clerked for Kennedy, and some speculation centered on the theory that Kennedy would retire only if he was guaranteed that Kavanaugh would replace him. Also, Kavanaugh in 2009 wrote a law review article stating that sitting presidents should not be prosecuted   and some speculated that he was chosen because of Trump s legal danger from special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation.The White House on Monday did not respond to queries about why Kavanaugh and the four others were added to the list of possible nominees despite Trump s promise.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Anyone who comes forward as Dr. Ford has done deserves to be heard,  Grassley said in a statement, promising to give the psychology professor s allegations a  full airing  in a hearing scheduled next Monday.The extraordinary move effectively postponed Thursday s planned committee vote on the nomination, as Democrats had been demanding since Ford first spoke out publicly over the weekend. Moreover, Grassley s statement appeared to be a result of tremendous pressure from other members of the GOP Senate conference, who were increasingly wary about the prospect of an all-male Republican committee majority denying Ford an opportunity to speak just weeks before the midterm elections.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, told reporters on Monday that he informed leadership he could not support the judge s bid to the high court without first giving Ford a chance to be heard. He said  overwhelming  resistance among GOP members of the committee contributed to the scheduling of a public hearing.The White House seemed to endorse the decision, with spokesman Raj Shah releasing a complementary statement Monday evening. Judge Kavanaugh looks forward to a hearing where he can clear his name of this false allegation,  Shah said.  He stands ready to testify tomorrow if the Senate is ready to hear him. Ford identified herself on Sunday as the author of a confidential letter sent in late July to two members of Congress in which she accuses Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in high school in the 1980s. Her lawyer said Monday she would be willing to testify about the alleged incident. There are an awful lot of questions, inconsistencies, gaps, and that s why, to be fair to both, we need to know what happened,  Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters Monday on Capitol Hill, several hours before Grassley s announcement.Collins, a key uncommitted senator on Kavanaugh s nomination, said she doesn t know enough yet to say whether she believes Ford s allegations but that having the opportunity to question her will help her make a determination. Obviously if Judge Kavanaugh has lied about what happened, that would be disqualifying,  Collins added, noting the judge had  emphatically  denied the accusation in a phone call with the senator on Friday.GOP leaders initially appeared reluctant about delaying the vote on the Kavanaugh nomination, however. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, threw cold water over the prospect of a public hearing earlier Monday during an interview with CNN s Manu Raju:Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn throws cold water on a public hearing for Brett Kavanaugh. What Senate Democrats want to do is  create a show trial,  and  I think it would be a mistake to reward bad behavior,  he told usSenators and Judiciary Committee staff also squabbled over how best to proceed on the nomination throughout the day prior to the scheduling of Monday s hearing. Grassley issued a statement earlier in the day that said he was committed to hearing from Ford in an  an appropriate, precedented and respectful manner.  The statement did not, however, address the possibility of inviting either Kavanaugh or Ford to testify in a public setting.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) seemed to endorse Grassley s approach on the Senate floor earlier Monday, but he, too, did not raise the prospect of public testimony.Democrats welcomed the news of a public hearing but insisted that the FBI ought to be able to investigate the allegation first. I do think there needs to be some investigation first, and I m not sure this allows for that,  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters on Monday evening about Grassley s announcement.A Department of Justice spokesperson, however, said in a statement that the allegation  does not involve any potential federal crime,  suggesting the FBI will not conduct any further investigation of Kavanaugh s record.Next week s hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. EDT Monday, and both Kavanaugh and Ford are expected to answer questions. Senators will be looking closely at how both address the alleged incident. This is the best route forward,  Flake said of the hearing.  Obviously, these are serious charges, and, if they are true, I think they are disqualifying. The Arizona Republican added that he wasn t sure whether senators will be able to determine the veracity of the allegation in such a setting. I don t know how you can ever be sure, but it s the best process we have. It s the process   it s the only process,  he said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) were added to the committee in January after two men were taken down by sexual misconduct allegations. Former Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) announced his resignation in December after eight women claimed Franken inappropriately touched them or forcibly kissed them. His departure left an open seat on the committee.Days later, Republican Roy Moore lost his bid for Jeff Sessions  open Senate seat in Alabama after multiple women accused Moore of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers and Moore was in his 30s. Democrat Doug Jones  special election win over Moore added another Democratic seat to the committee.Before California professor Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were high schoolers, Booker and Harris were arguably the toughest questioners during Kavanaugh s committee hearing.Harris was relentless in her line of questioning about whether the judge had conversations regarding special counsel Robert Mueller s Russia investigation with anyone employed at the law firm of President Donald Trump s personal attorney Marc Kasowitz.When Kavanaugh said he couldn t be sure, Harris told the nominee,  I think you re thinking of someone, and you don t want to tell us.

In 2011, she became the first biracial woman to serve as California attorney general. Harris was elected to the Senate before she could complete her second term as the state s attorney general. Booker, the former mayor of Newark, New Jersey, graduated with a juris doctorate in 1997 from Yale Law School. The Rhodes Scholar helped to run a nonprofit legal clinic for low-income families during his time at Yale and worked as a staff attorney for the Urban Justice League after law school.

Christine Ford is the worst educator I have experienced,  one former student wrote in a review on RateMyProfessor.com.  Avoid taking her class and avoid any interaction with this person. But Grabien News  sloppy sleuthing led them to the wrong Christine Ford. Christine A. Ford, the subject of the harsh reviews, is a licensed social worker who taught at California State University Fullerton.Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh s accuser, teaches at Palo Alto University. She says Kavanaugh pinned her down and groped her at a gathering in suburban Maryland around 1982.Drudge gets VERY EXCITED about a report on  grabien dot com  about Christine Ford s student reviewsIt was the wrong Christine Ford pic.twitter.com/WygdA378jSGrabien News eventually retracted the story and published an editor s note in the entry to  apologize for the error.  We ve since learned there are two Christine Fords working in clinical psychology in California and we wrote this report about the wrong Christine Ford,  according to Grabien s note in the retracted article.  We regret not going to greater lengths to ensure this was indeed the same Christine Ford. Please do not share this article with anyone (and if you have, delete it/withdraw it); we are only leaving the page up so you can see this important update. Drudge Report later deleted the tweet linking to Grabien s botched reporting, though the site neither informed its more than 1.4 million followers about the retraction nor apologized for the error.Matt Drudge, founder and editor of Drudge Report, did not immediately respond to HuffPost s request for comment.Despite Drudge s apparent attempt to sweep its promotion of the failed hit piece under the rug, Twitter users were quick to drag him for it. Even if Kavanaugh s accuser had been the subject of negative student reviews, some people wondered, how would that be relevant to her allegations, anyway?These are reviews for Christine A. Ford, a licensed social worker who holds an MSW from Cal State Long Beach & taught at Cal State Fullerton. https://t.co/RHEFgLdHvSKavanaugh s accuser is Christine B. Ford, who holds a PhD from USC and teaches at Palo Alto University. https://t.co/gCwf2KVi5TThis a.m., Drudge linked to negative student reviews about  Prof. Christine Ford . It was NOT the Christine Ford who has accused Kavanaugh of assaulting her in the early 1980 s. Drudge has now deleted the item--God knows how many times this item was echoed through social media.Drudge can t even smear the right Christine Ford. Sad. https://t.co/zj6h5a4uMaDrudge posted this... it was the wrong Christine ford pic.twitter.com/qfUQV0nRg4This story is about an entirely different woman with the same name as Kavanaugh s accuser. Drudge just linked to it.But it has no discernible byline, so there s nobody to specifically tell that the entire premise of the story is wrong. Neat trick!https://t.co/8F5rOsJ2AVIn fact, @DRUDGE_REPORT has  savaged  the wrong Christine Ford... and this tweet is still circulating 2 hours later. Will a correction and apology be forthcoming? https://t.co/yD2YQh8Wxg #Kavanaugh pic.twitter.com/NeMEuO1utQEven if it was the same Christine Ford, how would her performance as a teacher matter even a little bit in Kavanaugh s fitness to serve on the supreme court? Is rape only bad if the victim grows up to be a good professor?Wrong Christine Ford. Textbook fake news."

On Monday, the day after clinical psychology Professor Christine Blasey Ford went public in The Washington Post with details about Kavanaugh and his friend allegedly attempting to rape her in high school, NARAL Pro-Choice America, a major national abortion rights group, released two new ads in Maine and Nevada highlighting the bombshell story. The ads target Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who are each facing serious threats from the left in their re-election efforts. Heller, who s up this November, is currently running neck and neck with his Democratic challenger, Rep. Jacky Rosen (Nev.). NARAL s digital ad features disturbing excerpts from the Washington Post story in which Ford, now a professor at Palo Alto University, says Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, tried to pull off her clothes, put his hand over her mouth to cover her screams and made her fear for her life. The ad notes that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and some of his Democratic colleagues have called for delaying the vote in light of the allegations. What more do you need?  the ad asks Heller and Collins, before directing voters to call their Senate offices.The ad marks a pivot for NARAL, which has thus far focused all of its anti-Kavanaugh spending on emphasizing his history of opposition to abortion rights. A spokesperson for the group said its members were already outraged by the threat Kavanaugh poses to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court s landmark 1973 abortion rights decision. The sexual assault allegations, they said, have only intensified that anger. We re asking every single senator to not just ask for delay, but to do what s required in putting our country over partisan politics and support withdrawing this nominee,  said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL.  Women will not stand for the mistreatment of Dr. Ford. We will be watching.  We Demand Justice, another major anti-Kavanaugh group, is also planning a $700,000 digital and cable ad buy in Maine, Nevada, Alaska and Colorado, targeting Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) in addition to Collins and Heller. Before now, the majority of the political pressure to oppose Kavanaugh had been aimed at Murkowski and Collins, but Ford s accusation is bringing the heat to the pair of GOP men as well.  Dean Heller should answer for why he would support a sexual abuser.Cory Gardner should answer for why he would support a sexual abuser.This is not just about Collins and Murkowski anymore.https://t.co/G42xeihebkConservative groups, meanwhile, are jumping to Kavanaugh s defense. The Washington Post s Bob Costa reports that the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group, has purchased a $1.5 million ad blitz featuring a close friend of Kavanaugh. Republicans have a razor-thin majority in the Senate, so just one defector could sink Kavanaugh s prospects. So far, none of the four vulnerable senators have indicated whether the allegations would sway their vote on Kavanaugh. Collins, who has said she did not vote for President Donald Trump because of the multiple sexual assault allegations against him, said only that she is  surprised  by Ford s story and thinks both Kavanaugh and his accuser should testify before the Senate.Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee.Need help?

Wade, former first daughter Chelsea Clinton said it would be  un-Christian  to take away women s access to safe, legal abortions. When I think about all of the statistics that are painful, of what women are confronting today in our country and what even more women confronted pre-Roe, and how many women died and how many more women were maimed because of unsafe abortion practices   we just can t go back to that,  Clinton said on the show Thursday.  That s unconscionable to me.  And also, and I m sure that this will unleash another wave of hate in my direction,  she said,  but as a deeply religious person, it s also un-Christian to me. Clinton made the comments while appearing as a guest on  Signal Boost,  a progressive Sirius XM radio show.The 1973 Roe v. Wade decision helped establish a constitutional right to abortion. Abortion rights advocates fear that President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, represents a grave threat to this right, since his confirmation would create a conservative majority on the nation s top court that could restrict abortion access.Clinton said she s faced heated pushback from conservatives for her stance on reproductive rights. After an abortion rights event in August, Clinton faced fierce backlash for arguing that women s reproductive rights are intrinsically linked to their agency and economic rights. On  Signal Boost,  she said she s been  compared to slave owners and Nazis  for that statement.  [It s] because I ve had the temerity... to point out that our ability to participate fully in our society, including economically, hinges on our ability to be able to make choices for our bodies and our families,  she said. Since her  Signal Boost  appearance last week, Clinton has been ridiculed by conservative sites for connecting Christianity to the abortion rights movement. The Babylon Bee, a satirical evangelical Christian website, mocked Clinton s faith in a parody article. On social media, she s been called a Satanist.Clinton responded to the criticism via Twitter on Friday, affirming that it is possible for someone to be a faithful Christian and to believe in abortion rights.  Hi Matt - I am a Methodist, thank you for asking. Returning to a pre-#Roe America would be awful for women s health & rights and for some women, deadly. Knowingly going back to that is anathema to me as an American, a person, a mom & a Christian. Wishing you & yours a good night. https://t.co/sO7ZIBIgYPHi <U+0001F1FA><U+0001F1F8>? - I am very grateful to be in the world. Yes, as an American, a woman, a mother & a Christian, I believe going back to a pre-#Roe America would be immoral because we know it would be terrible for women s health & rights & for some women, deadly. Blessings to you & yours. https://t.co/v3d94T2aOZClinton was raised in the United Methodist Church, a denomination with which she still identifies. The UMC is America s third largest religious denomination, after the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention   two denominations that are decidedly anti-abortion.The UMC is more reluctant to take a definitive stance on the issue   affirming the  sanctity of unborn human life  on the one hand, while also acknowledging that there are some circumstances where  the needs of the woman may justify abortion. Clinton s statement   and the ensuing backlash   illustrates that while conservative Christians are often the loudest and most politically influential voices in the abortion debate, they don t speak for all American Christians.In fact, clergy have been active in the abortion rights movement since before Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. Leaders from many religious traditions have spoken about how their faith compels them to stand up in support of women s right to choose.Rev. Dr. Cari Jackson, a leader with the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, told HuffPost that she agrees with Clinton that denying women access to affordable reproductive health care is  un-Christian.  To deny women this right is to leave them susceptible to higher levels of poverty, greater stress, lower educational attainment and other factors, said Jackson, an ordained United Church of Christ minister. Supporting a system that fosters this kind of treatment for women, she said, is  nothing short of unchristian.  The undergirding of the Christian faith is love,  Jackson wrote in an email.  Love includes regarding the quality of life for women and their children. Love includes honoring others in the decisions they make for the best interest of themselves and their families. Love includes recognizing and honoring the moral agency of others as much as I recognize my own. In addition, Jackson said, it s  unchristian, unconstitutional and unconscionable  to force everyone in society to live according to the moral principles of some Christians.The pushback against Clinton is proof to her that in every era, there are some religious and political leaders who use the Bible to oppress marginalized groups. Only when women and all persons are fully valued as moral agents and nurtured to make self-determining choices can the society best thrive,  Jackson said. "

Never even had a little blemish on his record,  Trump said.  He is somebody very special. He added:  I wish the Democrats could have done this a lot sooner ... but with all of that being said, we want to go through the process. The president acknowledged there might be a  delay  in confirming Kavanaugh, but said:  I m sure it will work out very well. TRUMP asked if KAVANAUGH offered to withdraw: What a ridiculous question.  pic.twitter.com/xxahlC2UNeTrump s comments came a day after Kavanaugh s accuser publicly identified herself as Christine Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University in California, in an interview with The Washington Post. I thought he might inadvertently kill me,  Ford, 51, said of the alleged assault in the early 1980s.  He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing. Ford alleges another teenager watched as a drunken Kavanaugh attempted to remove her clothing at a gathering in suburban Maryland. She told the Post that she tried to scream, but that Kavanaugh covered her mouth to silence her. She said she escaped after Kavanaugh s friend entered the room and jumped on top of both of them.Ford sent a confidential letter to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) after Kavanaugh s nomination this summer to share her concerns about him.Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will decide whether to advance Kavanaugh s nomination to the full Senate, confirmed the existence of the letter last week. She also said she referred the matter to the FBI.Kavanaugh has  categorically and unequivocally  denied the allegation.Ford told the Post she hadn t wanted to come forward publicly, but after details of her letter began to leak, she decided she wanted to be the one to tell her story.The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation on Thursday, but all 10 Democrats on the committee have said the panel should wait to vote until the FBI has conducted its review into the matter.Several Republicans lawmakers, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, have also urged committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to delay the proceedings.Grassley s office said Sunday that the vote had not been rescheduled, but that the committee was working to set up a time for a staff call with Ford.In a statement on Monday, Grassley said he is  working diligently to get to the bottom of these claims  as well as to find a way to hear from Ford in  an appropriate, precedented and respectful manner. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) suggested in a tweet on Monday that Ford be allowed to testify before the Judiciary Committee.Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee.The White House also issued a fresh statement from Kavanaugh on Monday, in which the nominee said he would be willing to talk to the committee  in any way  it deems appropriate to  defend my integrity.  Trump s sympathetic take on the allegation against Kavanaugh comes as no surprise. The president faces accusations of sexual misconduct from 21 women; he s denied them all.This story has been updated with details of Ford s allegations, reactions from several lawmakers, and a new statement from Kavanaugh.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The Me Too movement is in full swing. Many powerful men have been brought down in the face of credible accusations of sexual misconduct.  Women are being believed, for the first time ever,  Gloria Steinem told HuffPost earlier this year. Are they? Steinem added a huge caveat back then   one that is painfully relevant at this moment, as the Senate weighs the allegations against Kavanaugh: It typically takes more than one woman for an accusation to stick.In campus sexual assault cases, for example, Steinem said,  It takes four or five women accusing the same guy before it s believed.  Indeed, in almost all the most high-profile Me Too cases   Harvey Weinstein, Les Moonves, Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer   it took more than one woman to bring down a single man, no matter how credible the accusation. In other words, yes, women are being believed   but it s not entirely clear that a woman will be found credible. Particularly when she s going up against the pinnacle of American male power   a prep school and Ivy League-educated lawyer with immense political connections.One woman, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, has accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault. The incident took place decades ago, when they were in high school. She was 15 and he was 17. She may testify about the incident before the Senate Judiciary Committee, a disturbing echo of what happened to Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas hearings in 1991.Back then, an all-male Senate panel questioned Hill, and her accusations ultimately didn t matter. Thomas has been sitting on the Supreme Court, signing on to rulings hostile to women s rights, ever since.   It was a travesty,  said Nan Aron, the president for Alliance for Justice, a progressive group, on a conference call on Monday.Progressive women s groups are urging the Senate to slow down the nomination process and at least give a full hearing to Ford s allegation, or to withdraw Kavanaugh s nomination entirely.It s important to note that no one is arguing that Kavanaugh should be criminally punished for his behavior long ago when he was still a minor   just that a woman s accusations be given a full hearing, not diminished or swept under the rug. The fallout for the judge would, at most, be that he doesn t get to serve on the high court.It s not clear yet what will happen. Pressure is mounting on Senate Republicans to postpone a vote on Kavanaugh scheduled for Thursday. President Donald Trump acknowledged on Monday that there might be a  delay  in confirming Kavanaugh.  We want to go through the process,  he said, according to a pool report. Trump also called Kavanaugh  one of the finest people.  Kavanaugh s supporters were out in full force on Monday attacking Blasey Ford s credibility, just as Hill was attacked decades ago.  Thomas  ascension to the court triggered a wave of women running for office. Just as pussy-grabber-in-chief Trump s election spurred women s marches, inspired more women to run for office and, arguably, galvanized the Me Too movement. And yet, for all that, we re somehow back to a 1990s-style moment. What happens next will be a test to see how far we ve come   have women gained real credibility? Will the Senate treat Christine Blasey Ford with the respect it never gave to Anita Hill? Or are women still, for all our efforts, just a little less equal?This story has been updated with comment from Donald Trump."

The president s guidance?  Deny, deny, deny. Of course, this came from experience. Trump was caught on tape saying,  When you re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything ... grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.  Separately, well over a dozen women have accused Trump of varying forms of sexual misconduct. Trump denied them all. Republicans stood by Trump anyway, and elected him president of the United States.Last year, multiple women came forward and shared stories of sexual harassment and misconduct by Alabama Republican senatorial candidate Roy Moore, including his courtship of a 14-year old girl. Roy denied all of the allegations, and the Republican National Committee stood by Moore and continued to help fund his campaign.Now, with an explosive allegation of sexual assault threatening to derail Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court, Republicans are deploying the Trump playbook once again.On Friday, a day after it was revealed that Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) had referred  information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court  to federal investigators, Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), released a letter of support for Kavanaugh signed by 65 women who  knew him while he attended high school between 1979-1983. The Grassley letter read,  Brett has stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity. In particular, he has always treated women with decency and respect   Many of us are not lawyers, but we know Brett Kavanaugh as a person. And he has always been a good person. As if someone who had committed an act of sexual aggression would broadcast that to all the girls he knows in high school. Grassley is clinging to some absurd fiction that sexual harassers are identifiable on sight by everyone who knows them, or that survivors of assault would gleefully share their trauma with their high school classmates.But that was just the opening salvo.Next came the Republican attacks on the accuser s motivations for coming forward. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) was quoted saying,  The claims are wholly unverifiable, and come at the tail-end of a process that was already marred by ugly innuendo, dishonesty, and the nastiest form of politics. So, basically, Hatch s argument is that because the timing is politically inconvenient for Senate Republicans, the accusations must be politically motivated and therefore untrue. Never mind the fact that the only reason Hatch and his fellow Senate Republicans are rushing this confirmation is because they are afraid of losing their Senate majority in November.Turns out it s not at all hard to imagine why any woman would think twice about coming forward about her experiences with sexual harassment and misconduct.Nevertheless, on Sunday, the accusations were given a name and a face when Christine Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Also University, told her story to The Washington Post. She recounted the night when a  stumbling drunk  Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while his friend watched.On Monday morning, an attorney for Ford told NBC s  Today  show that Ford was willing to testify about these allegations before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Kavanaugh, perhaps heeding Trump s advice, issued yet another stern denial, saying,  I have never done anything like what the accuser describes   to her or to anyone.  Shortly after, he was seen arriving at the White House.As of Monday afternoon, Senate Republicans showed no real signs of slowing down Kavanaugh s confirmation process, and planned to move forward with a Judiciary Committee vote on Thursday. Ironic that the so-called greatest deliberative body in the world doesn t want to spend more than a few days deliberating the veracity of such a heinous assault.This cowardly conduct is now another chapter in the longstanding war against women. Republicans   you know, the ones always talking about God, family values and morality   have become the party that enables sexual harassment and protects accused sexual predators. Once again, they are following Trump s lead, choosing to put political expediency ahead of fundamental decency and respect for women.Kurt Bardella is a HuffPost columnist and the former spokesperson for Breitbart News, and Reps.

Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), a red-state Democrat who is facing a tough re-election fight this year, also said the committee should hold off on voting until it can review what he called  serious  allegations leveled against Kavanaugh, an appellate court judge.The fresh calls on Monday followed similar statements over the weekend from key Republicans like Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, exerting more pressure on Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to delay the proceedings.Grassley said in a statement on Monday that he is  working diligently to get to the bottom of these claims  as well as to find a way to hear from Kavanaugh s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, in  an appropriate, precedented and respectful manner.  The chairman did not, however, address the possibility of inviting either Kavanaugh or Ford to testify in a public setting.Grassley s spokesperson Taylor Foy said Sunday that the vote had not been rescheduled, according to Washington Post reporter Seung Min Kim.Ford identified herself in a Washington Post interview published Sunday as the author of a confidential letter, sent in late July to two members of Congress, in which she accuses Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in high school in the 1980s. She is willing to tell her story publicly, her lawyer, Debra Katz, said Monday on NBC s  Today  show. The White House issued a fresh statement from Kavanaugh shortly afterward, again denying what he called a  completely false  allegation. He said he would be willing to talk to the committee  in any way  it deems appropriate to  defend my integrity.   Grassley s office had said Sunday that the committee was working to set up a time for a staff call with Ford. But Democrats say that staff calls   normally routine for most Supreme Court nominees   aren t the appropriate way to handle the matter. Rushing this through is not treating someone fairly,  Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told CNN on Monday.  Doing this in a conference call, as opposed to her offer to come forward and say things publicly is certainly not fair. We need to postpone the scheduled vote until we get to the bottom of this. Sen.

We believe Dr. Blasey Ford and are grateful that she came forward to tell her story,  says a draft letter from alumnae of Holton-Arms, a private girls school in Bethesda, Maryland.  It demands a thorough and independent investigation before the Senate can reasonably vote on Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to a lifetime seat on the nation s highest court. The women also say that what Ford is alleging  is all too consistent with stories we heard and lived while attending Holton. Many of us are survivors ourselves. The letter is a boost of support for Ford, who has been thrust into the political spotlight and had her credibility questioned by going up against Kavanaugh and the White House. The signatories span decades at the school   before, during and after Ford attended.More than 200 women had signed the letter as of late Monday morning, said Sarah Burgess, a member of the class of 2005. (One notable signature: Julia Louis-Dreyfus, class of 1979, who said Monday afternoon that she had added her name to the letter. ) Burgess said she and some of her schoolmates wrote the letter because hearing Ford s story felt  personal.  I know that in the coming days, her story will be scrutinized, and she will be accused of lying,  Burgess said in an email.  However, I grew up hearing stories like hers, and believe her completely. Susanna Jones, the Holton-Arms head of school, put out a statement Sunday night in support of Ford.  In these cases, it is imperative that all voices are heard,  Jones said.  As a school that empowers women to use their voices, we are proud of this alumna for using hers. Ford went public with her accusations against Kavanaugh on Sunday in an interview with The Washington Post. She said she was 15 when she attended a party where she encountered Kavanaugh, who was 17 at the time. She said Kavanaugh and his friend shut her in a room and turned up the music to hide her protests. Kavanaugh, who was drunk, held her down and tried to remove her clothes. She said that at one point he held his hand on her mouth to stifle her screams. She managed to escape. Ford had contacted Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) with a letter about Kavanaugh in July. Rumors of that letter were circling Capitol Hill in recent weeks, with Senate Judiciary Committee members pressing Feinstein to share details. Media reports last week revealed the letter and the details but did not name Ford. Last week, Republicans attempted to push back on the growing crisis and show as much support for Kavanaugh as possible. Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans released a letter from 65 women who said they knew the nominee in high school and vouched for his character, saying he always treated women with  decency and respect.  Politico attempted to contact all the women on the letter to see if they still stood behind Kavanaugh in light of Ford s allegations; several have said they do but most didn t respond. Although a few GOP senators have come out and said they d like to hear Ford testify, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee put out a statement Sunday reiterating the support Kavanaugh has publicly received and casting Ford s allegations as part of a political tactic by Democrats. Kavanaugh is still scheduled to receive a committee vote on Thursday.

If my alleged abuser was named Kavanaugh, not Nassar, what would you have said to me?  Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State team doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse, tweeted on Monday morning. Since 2016, Denhollander had led the accusations against Nassar, encouraging hundreds of other survivors to tell their stories of abuse at the hands of the former doctor, who s now serving a life sentence on child sexual abuse charges. Now, she s questioning Republicans  response to the sexual assault accusation that has surfaced against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.  For years I watched family and friends eviscerate sexual assault victims who spoke up against a candidate, team, pastor, ministry or local friend they liked, and I got the message loud and clear,  Denhollander wrote in a Sunday tweet thread explaining why she waited more than a decade to come forward with her allegations against Nassar. And that showed me what they REALLY thought about abuse and what they REALLY thought about victims, when sexual abuse wasn t an easy thing to condemn. I knew it meant if faced with a choice between a survivor and their favorite  whatever,  they d attack the survivor,  she wrote, adding that she watched friends and family  denigrate  the survivor s character just to  value some political, sport or ministry goal more than the truth.  1  Why d you wait so long?  Here s a big part of why:Because for years I watched family and friends eviscerate sexual assault victims who spoke up against a candidate, team, pastor, ministry or local friend they liked, and I got the message loud and clear.2 And that showed me what they REALLY thought about abuse and what they REALLY thought about victims, when sexual abuse wasn t an easy thing to condemn. I knew it meant if faced with a choice between a survivor and their favorite  whatever , they d attack the survivor.It  felt like a knife wound  every time someone close to her attempted to smear a victim s story, Denhollander wrote. Now, Denhollander said, she feels as though the same story is unfolding. I m watching it again. Conservatives, you are yelling from the rooftops that you don t care what the truth is, and you aren t safe, and you ll attack a victim any time it would cost you to care. And that s shameful,  she wrote.  You can, and should, do better. 4. And I m watching it again.

Then start by taking claims of sexual assault seriously instead of using poor logic, straw men and ad hominems to avoid the issue. Otherwise, you are part of the cultural problem.Denhollander, who identifies as a conservative evangelical herself, has been very outspoken about the allegations of rampant sexual abuse in the Catholic church.  Conservatives, you want to be the party of family values? You want to be pro-woman and pro-child? Then start by taking claims of sexual assault seriously instead of using poor logic, straw men and ad hominems to avoid the issue. Otherwise, you are part of the cultural problem,  Denhollander tweeted. Christine Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University in California, came forward in an interview published in The Washington Post accusing Kavanaugh of pinning her down and groping her around 1982 when the two were in high school. Ford revealed her story in a confidential letter to members of Congress in July, but didn t publicly identify herself until the Post article on Sunday.Kavanaugh  categorically and unequivocally  denied Ford s allegations. The White House and many Republicans continue to support Kavanaugh, despite the accusation. On Thursday, the Judiciary Committee is set to vote on whether to advance Kavanaugh s nomination to the full Senate. Democratic members of the committee are calling for a delay until the FBI investigates Ford s story.  Denhollander added in a separate tweet that politicians  reaction to Kavanaugh s accuser will send a powerful message.  I know what [their reaction] is doing to the abused little girls who are watching, and the women who are, inside, still those little girls. Survivors are always asking  am I safe?  she wrote.  Right now, conservatives, you are telling them  NO.  Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Ford is willing to speak under oath about the incident, her attorney, Debra Katz, said Monday. Let me be very clear on behalf of the president, with whom I ve spoken at length about this,  Conway told reporters at the White House when asked if Ford should testify.  She should not be ignored or insulted. She should be heard. .@KellyannePolls: Woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault  should not be insulted, and she should not be ignored  pic.twitter.com/5o49tWkQQKBut this isn t a sentiment that Conway seems to share about the more than 20 women who have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against her boss, President Donald Trump.In February, when Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) proposed congressional hearings into the allegations, Conway said Trump s accusers  have had their day  and  were trotted out again  in the wake of the Me Too movement.Trump has repeatedly denigrated the women, including mocking their physical appearance. He also has attacked and tried to diminish the credibility of other women who have spoken about sexual assault claims against prominent men, including some who accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (R) of molestation and forced kissing.Conway said in November that the White House was very concerned about the allegations. Whatever the facts end up being, the premise, of course, the principle, the incontrovertible principle, is that there is no Senate seat worth more than a child,  Conway said of the accusations against Moore, which included that he molested teenage girls when he was in his 30s.  I have three daughters and a son, frankly, and we all are watching this. But the White House later stood by Moore s candidacy, and Trump endorsed him.Conway also said Monday in a  Fox and Friends  interview that Ford s testimony  should not unduly delay the vote on Judge Kavanaugh.  The Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to vote on Kavanaugh s nomination Thursday.Through statements from the White House, Kavanaugh has denied Ford s allegations. The White House reiterated those denials on Monday.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

But Mark Judge, now a writer and filmmaker, wrote in his memoir two decades ago that he spent some of his high school years  completely annihilated  on alcohol and trying to  hook up  with girls.Judge, a classmate of Kavanaugh s at the all-male Georgetown Prep the time of the alleged assault, tells stories in his 1997 memoir, Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk, of getting drunk his first time at age 14, binge drinking at teen parties and a struggle with alcoholism.His  immersion  into alcohol began the end of his sophomore year during a typical annual  beach week,  when Catholic high school students headed to the shore after school was out.  Now I had an opportunity to make some headway [with girls]. Most of the time everyone, including the girls, was drunk. If you could breathe and walk at the same time, you could hook up,  he wrote.His drinking became so extreme that he had blackout episodes, and woke up on the floor of a restaurant bathroom with no memory of how he got there. Once  I had the first beer, I found it impossible to stop until I was completely annihilated,  he wrote. Judge said last week he had no memory of the incident described by Kavanaugh s accuser.  I never saw Brett act that way,  Judge told The Weekly Standard before the identity of the accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, had been revealed.Judge restated his denial on Sunday, after Ford came forward in a Washington Post interview.  I repeat my earlier statement that I have no recollection of any of the events described in today s Post article or attributed to her letter,  he said.Ford told the Post of a high school gathering in which Kavanaugh and Judge, both drunk, shoved her into a bedroom. She said that Kavanaugh locked the door, pushed her onto a bed, fumbled with her clothing, held her down and attempted to force himself on her. Ford said she managed to escape when Judge jumped on top of both of them. Kavanaugh  categorically  denied the accusation. Kavanaugh is not specifically mentioned in Judge s book. The name Kavanaugh surfaces in passing, when Judge recites some Irish Catholic surnames at his elementary school    O Neal, Murphy, Kavanaugh. Judge s book changes the name of his high school to  Loyola Prep,  and makes a glancing reference at a character he calls  Bart O Kavanaugh. A girl at a party, wrote Judge, asked him:  Do you know Bart O Kavanaugh? I heard he puked in someone s car the other night.  Judge responds:  Yeah he passed out on his way back from a party.  In his 2005 book God and Man at Georgetown Prep, Judge slammed his high school and the  insane liberalism  of Catholicism in the 1960s. He said the school was  overrun  by gay priests   part of the church s  lavender mafia,  he later wrote in The Daily Caller   and was infused with alcohol.  Only a person in denial still claims that something did not go terribly wrong in the Church after the 1960s, and that more often than not that thing was homosexual priests molesting teenage boys, Judge wrote in the The Daily Caller in 2011.  My own take is that it had less to do with homosexuality than with the feverish libertinism of the 60s. Liberals have no interest in connecting the dots from liberalism to sexual abuse. Judge also noted in his essay:  I m guilty as well, at least of the bouts of dehumanizing lust that is part of the fallen world and being human ... we all have that monster to some extent.

Judge Kavanaugh s sexual assault letter found by Dems,  reads the caption at the top of an image, which features a crayon letter in what looks like a child s handwriting. The letter s scrawl reads:  Will you be my girlfriend  alongside boxes marked with  yes  and  no.  The Dems and their usual nonsense games really have him on the ropes now,  the president s eldest son wrote in apparent sarcasm in his caption.  Finestein had the letter in July and saved it for the eve of his vote ... honorable as always. I believe this is a copy for full transparency.  A post shared by Donald Trump Jr. (@donaldjtrumpjr) on Sep 15, 2018 at 12:30pm PDT Finestein  appears to be a reference to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She said she reported the accuser s letter to the FBI last week. Trump appears to have made the Instagram post on Saturday. A day later, Christine Blasey Ford stepped forward in a Washington Post interview as the author of the confidential letter sent in late July to Feinstein. Ford told the Post in the article published on Sunday that Kavanaugh pinned her down and groped her while another male teenager watched when she was 15 in suburban Maryland around 1982. Ford, now 51, also said she  thought he might inadvertently kill me.  Kavanaugh, in a statement issued by the White House, denied the incident took place. Kavanaugh s classmate, Mark Judge, said in a statement to The Weekly Standard that he has  no recollection of any of the events described in today s Post article or attributed to her letter.  Ford would agree to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, her lawyer, Debra Katz, said Monday on the  Today  show. Trump Jr. s Instagram post drew a comment from Lynne Patton, who heads the Department of Housing and Urban Development s New York and New Jersey regional office for the Trump administration. She posted emojis of a laughing face and hands raised in agreement.Trump Jr. took a further swipe at the sexual assault allegation in a response to a person who commented on his Instagram post, writing:  you joke about it, but it s important to find the truth regardless of the outcome. Replied Trump:  An anonymous letter from an anonymous source that a senator sat on for over 2 months that s talks about a very public figure who has been scrutinized for decades that the FBI refused to even look at conveniently appears right as he s finishing confirmation?

Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), specifically asked Kavanaugh about whether he had ever engaged in sexual misconduct   although she limited her question to when he was a  legal adult,  which would not have applied to the situation with Ford.HIRONO: Judge Kavanaugh, Chief Justice John Roberts has recognized that, quote,  The judicial branch is not immune,  end quote, from the widespread problem of sexual harassment and assault and has taken steps to address this issue.As part of my responsibility, as a member of this committee, to ensure the fitness of nominees for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench, I ask each nominee two questions.First question for you, since you became a legal adult, have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature?KAVANAUGH: No.HIRONO: Have you ever faced discipline or entered into a settlement related to this kind of conduct?KAVANAUGH: No.HIRONO: I started asking these questions about sexual harassment because it s so hard to hold lifetime appointees to the federal bench accountable and because I did not want the Me Too movement to be swept under the rug. As I said during the hearing, this is why the #MeToo movement is so important, because often in these situations, there is an environment where people see nothing, hear nothing, and say nothing. That is what we have to change,  Hirono said in a statement Sunday.Kavanaugh was also a clerk for Alex Kozinski, who resigned as a federal appeals court judge over allegations of sexually harassing and mistreating law clerks. Kavanaugh has said he never remembered witnessing Kozinski sexually harass anyone. In a written response to a follow-up question from Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) after the hearings, Kavanaugh said he supported ensuring that workplaces were free from such behavior. 35. Should judges who engage in the kind of sexually harassing behavior that Judge Kozinski allegedly engaged in resign?RESPONSE: Following the allegations against Judge Kozinski, he resigned from the bench. I fully support Chief Justice Roberts  call for  a careful evaluation of whether [the federal judiciary s] standards of conduct and its procedures for investigating and correcting inappropriate behavior are adequate to ensure an exemplary workplace for every judge and every court employee.  Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University, first approached lawmakers and The Washington Post in July, when it looked like Kavanaugh could get a Supreme Court nomination. She decided not to go public when it seemed that speaking out about Kavanaugh, whom President Donald Trump nominated on July 9, could ruin her life and not affect whether he was confirmed. But rumors of a letter from a woman who was harassed by Kavanaugh started circulating on Capitol Hill in recent weeks. Last week, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)   under pressure from the media and her fellow Democrats   acknowledged receipt of a letter and said she had kept it confidential at the request of the author. She had forwarded it to the FBI, who added it to Kavanaugh s background file   but said it had no plans to investigate the allegation further.Ford had been contacted by at least one reporter since the news started to come out, and she said she wanted to fully tell her story rather than see it leak out in pieces. She said she now feels like her  civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation.  Last week, Republicans said they still planned to move forward with the scheduled Sept. 20 vote on whether to advance Kavanaugh s confirmation.Committee Republicans also released a statement Sunday dismissing the new revelations as  uncorroborated allegations from more than 35 years ago. NEW: Statement from Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans pic.twitter.com/pwWsGdDsBuIn a statement Sunday after Ford went public, Feinstein said she supports Ford s decision to share her story and wants the FBI to conduct an investigation before the Senate moves forward. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) also said that at a minimum, the vote should be postponed until Ford s claims are investigated. Ford took a polygraph test administered by a former FBI agent in early August. She also told a therapist in 2012 about a  rape attempt  when she was in her teens, although she didn t name Kavanaugh. I think it derailed me substantially for four or five years,  she told The Washington Post, saying she struggled academically and socially.  I was very ill-equipped to forge those kinds of relationships. Republicans have attempted to quickly get Kavanaugh confirmed, before the start of the new court term and the midterm elections. Democrats have objected to the timeline, noting that the National Archives has not been able to complete a full review of the documents from his time serving in President George W. Bush s White House. John Dean, the Watergate whistleblower, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the final day of the Kavanaugh hearings. He said such a rushed process could lead to a situation such as what happened with Clarence Thomas, who was confirmed to the bench despite sexual harassment allegations from Anita Hill. Thomas  truthfulness vis-a-vis Professor Anita Hill s claims of sexual harassment have never been fully resolved, nor has the controversy ever ended. ...This controversy has received renewed attention with the Me Too movement, which is growing stronger and it s not going to disappear. In fact, Justice Thomas  truthfulness is an issue in this year s midterm election. A Democratic candidate in Massachusetts has made impeachment of Thomas for his false claims during his confirmation one of the planks of her campaign. In closing, Judge Kavanaugh s nomination has raised issues about the truthfulness of his confirmation to become a judge on the D.C. Circuit.His answers to this committee have not resolved the issue. Frankly, I m surprised that Judge Kavanaugh is not demanding that every document that he s ever handled be reviewed by this committee. Unless of course there s something to hide.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Chuck Schumer s title.

She tried to scream, but Kavanaugh covered her mouth to silence her, she told the Post. She said she escaped after Kavanaugh s friend entered the room and jumped on top of both of them. I think it derailed me substantially for four or five years,  Ford told the Post of the alleged assault. She described the incident as a  rape attempt  during a therapy session in 2012, according to her therapist s notes obtained by the Post.Kavanaugh, 53, has denied any wrongdoing. I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,  Kavanaugh said in a statement last week when news of the letter first surfaced.  I did not do this back in high school or at any time. Ford had been requesting anonymity, but she decided to identify herself in the Post article published early Sunday afternoon.Ford sent the letter to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) during the summer, after Kavanaugh was nominated for the high court vacancy by President Donald Trump, to share her concerns about him.After weeks of media speculation, Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that will decide whether to advance Kavanaugh s nomination to the full Senate, confirmed the existence of the letter on Thursday. She also said she referred the matter to the FBI.Ford told the Post she hadn t wanted to identify herself publicly, but after details of her letter began to leak, she decided she wanted to be the one to tell her story.The Judiciary Committee vote on Kavanaugh is scheduled for Thursday, but Feinstein said the panel should wait to vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation until the FBI has conducted its review into the matter. I support Mrs. Ford s decision to share her story, and now that she has, it is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation,  Feinstein said in a statement Sunday.  This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nominee.  Taylor Foy, a spokeswoman for Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), on Sunday termed  disturbing  the timing of  uncorroborated allegations from more than 35 years ago, during high school. Foy said that if Feinstein and other committee Democrats  took this claim seriously, they should have brought it to the full committee s attention much earlier.  She also called on Feinstein to release the letter she received from Ford in July  so that everyone can know what she s known for weeks. Several other Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), on Sunday echoed Feinstein s call for a delayed vote on Kavanaugh.Grassley  must postpone the vote until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated,  Schumer said in a statement.The White House reiterated its support for Kavanaugh, a federal appellate court judge, in the wake of the latest development.

John Kennedy (R-La.) said Sunday there s  nothing we can do  about an allegation of attempted sexual assault that a woman made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.The Louisiana Republican, who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is tasked with evaluating Supreme Court nominees, claimed that he and colleagues are unable to properly investigate the allegation because the woman requested anonymity and declined to press the matter further. I don t know what our Democratic friends expect us to do,  Kennedy said on  Fox News Sunday.   We got a letter, it s secret. We don t know who wrote it. Who are we going to cross-examine? [California Sen. Dianne] Feinstein? I mean give me a break. However, soon after Kennedy made that statement, Christine Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University in California, came forward as the accuser in an interview with The Washington Post.Feinstein, the senior Democrat on the committee, said Thursday she had received a letter from the then-unnamed woman detailing her concerns about Kavanaugh after President Donald Trump initially nominated him to the post in July. The woman alleged that he forced himself on her at a party while they were both in high school. Kavanaugh issued a statement  categorically  denying the allegation last week.Feinstein said she referred the letter to the FBI. The bureau issued a statement Thursday confirming it had received Feinstein s referral and included it in Judge Kavanaugh s background file, which every senator is able to view. Sources close to Feinstein told HuffPost on Friday that the senator was acting out of concern for the privacy of the woman when she referred the matter to federal investigators. The New Yorker also reported that the California Democrat  conveyed to other Democratic members  offices that the incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion, and that Feinstein had  taken care of it.   The bombshell revelation comes just days before the Supreme Court nominee is set to receive a vote before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Republicans maintain a 11-10 majority. Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said that the vote would proceed as scheduled on Thursday.In a separate interview on Sunday, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), another member of the committee, said he would review the contents of the woman s letter. The North Carolina Republican questioned, however, why it never came up during the open or closed portion of Kavanaugh s confirmation hearing earlier this month. It really raises a question in my mind about   if this was material to the confirmation process, why on earth over the past four to six weeks hasn t it been discussed among the committee members?  Tillis said on CBS   Face the Nation.  Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, meanwhile, tweeted that the Me Too movement has  taught us  to  respect and listen to survivors of sexual assault, regardless of the age of those involved or when the alleged attack took place.

If so, both she and Kavanaugh should be interviewed by the FBI and then by the Judiciary Committee, Marcus wrote.  Speed is not of the essence for a lifetime appointment this consequential.

On Friday, Hill spoke out again in the wake of accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Hill, now a professor at Brandeis University, called for the Senate Judiciary Committee to investigate the sexual assault claims in a  fair and neutral way.  The reluctance of someone to come forward demonstrates that even in the #MeToo era, it remains incredibly difficult to report harassment, abuse or assault by people in power,  Hill said in a statement.NEW: Anita Hill statement on sexual allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, Given the seriousness of these allegations, the government needs to find a fair and neutral way for complaints to be investigated...I have seen firsthand what happens when such a process is weaponized...  pic.twitter.com/7poVRPtWFbThe New Yorker on Friday reported the bombshell allegation of a woman who said that Kavanaugh held her down and  attempted to force himself on her  in the presence of a classmate of his while at a party in high school.The woman s identity was not released to the public and Kavanaugh has denied the accusation. The classmate told The New Yorker he has  no recollection  of the incident. The Senate Judiciary Committee should put in place a process that enables anyone with a complaint of this nature to be heard,  Hill said in her statement.  I have seen firsthand what happens when such a process is weaponized against an accuser, and no one should have to endure that again. When Hill testified against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991   accusing him of making unwanted advances and talking to her about sex and pornography   she launched a movement that for the first time highlighted the kind of harassment and abuse women regularly faced in the workplace.A lot changed for women in the decades that followed, with a crescendo in the recent Me Too movement, which toppled some of the most powerful men accused of harassment or abuse across industries, including entertainment, media and politics.And while, as Hill recently said, there has been  a tremendous amount of change  in the treatment of women, a lot has stayed the same   especially with the way accusations are handled. As HuffPost s Amanda Terkel pointed out, Feinstein knew of the accusations against Kavanaugh in July, and rumors about their existence swirled on Capitol Hill, but Feinstein didn t publicly acknowledge them until August. She was reluctant to bring the issue up because she thought Democrats would be better off focusing on  legal, rather than personal, issues in their questioning of Kavanaugh,  sources told The New Yorker.Feinstein said Thursday that she received a letter with the accusations and forwarded it to the FBI.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) made history by becoming the first woman to serve as ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In a statement on the milestone, she tipped her hat to the influence of Anita Hill, who launched a movement when she testified about Clarence Thomas  sexual harassment in 1991.  I became a senator in 1992 the Year of the Woman and became the first woman to serve on the Judiciary Committee in the wake of the Anita Hill hearings. So it s a special honor to be the first woman to become ranking member of this committee, not to mention the first Californian,  Feinstein said. Feinstein was one of four women elected to the Senate in 1992. A record number of women joined the House. Many of them were spurred to change the representation of the overwhelmingly male Congress after Hill s electrifying testimony.Sexual harassment was still mostly talked about among women, privately. But Hill brought it out into the open. And the imagery couldn t have been starker: A young black woman testifying before a committee composed completely of white men.The men on the Senate Judiciary Committee either couldn t understand or simply didn t care about what Hill was talking about. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) may have summed up senators  reaction to Hill s allegations best when he reportedly declared,  If that s sexual harassment, half the senators on Capitol Hill could be accused. At the time, Joe Biden was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and could have been Hill s biggest advocate. But, as she has made clear in her memoir and comments since then, he let her down. He seemed to go out of his way to appear fair to Thomas and never brought forward women who could have lent credence to Hill s accusations. The country has moved significantly on the issue of sexual misconduct. Powerful men like Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer have lost their jobs when women spoke out in the #MeToo era. But in many other ways, very little has changed   even with a woman heading the Judiciary Committee. Twenty-seven years after Thomas, another man up for a position on the Supreme Court is facing a sexual misconduct allegation and appears set for confirmation. A woman, who remains anonymous, has accused Brett Kavanaugh of attempting to sexually assault her when they were both in high school. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation.Feinstein has known about the woman s story since July, and rumors have been swirling on Capitol Hill among senators, aides and reporters for some time. But only on Thursday, after a report in The Intercept about the letter, did Feinstein finally acknowledge publicly that she had received a letter and forwarded the matter to the FBI. Sources close to Feinstein told The New Yorker that she has been quiet about the letter to protect the privacy of the woman, who wants her identity to remain confidential. But other Democrats say that Feinstein also seemed reluctant to even bring up the issue. According to The New Yorker: A source familiar with the committee s activities said that Feinstein s staff initially conveyed to other Democratic members  offices that the incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion, and that Feinstein had  taken care of it.  ... Feinstein also acted out of a sense that Democrats would be better off focusing on legal, rather than personal, issues in their questioning of Kavanaugh. Sources who worked for other members of the Judiciary Committee said that they respected the need to protect the woman s privacy, but that they didn t understand why Feinstein had resisted answering legitimate questions about the allegation.  We couldn t understand what their rationale is for not briefing members on this. This is all very weird,  one of the congressional sources said. Another added,  She s had the letter since late July. And we all just found out about it. Feinstein was no doubt aware of the risks of mishandling a sexual misconduct complaint after what happened with Biden. But her hesitation is a reminder that there is still a significant amount that s the same as in 1991.In a statement on Friday, Hill called on the Senate Judiciary Committee to put in place a fair and neutral process to deal with these types of complaints. And she, too, noted how it remains difficult for women to come forward.NEW: Anita Hill statement on sexual allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, Given the seriousness of these allegations, the government needs to find a fair and neutral way for complaints to be investigated...I have seen firsthand what happens when such a process is weaponized...  pic.twitter.com/7poVRPtWFbAccording to The New Yorker, Kavanaugh s accuser approached members of Congress   Feinstein and Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.)   in July about her experience with Kavanaugh. His nomination revived the pain of the incident, which happened in the 1980s, and she struggled with whether to come forward. After speaking with Eshoo and Feinstein   and watching Kavanaugh march toward what seemed like inevitable confirmation   she decided not to go public. Hill, too, was initially reluctant to speak out. She had told only a limited number of people about what had happened to her, but as with the Kavanaugh accuser, rumors started to spread in Washington and eventually, Senate aides began reaching out to her in early September, just a couple weeks before the committee would vote on Thomas. Hill was willing to share her story, believing she had a public duty to give investigators all the information she had. But she didn t want a public hearing, she didn t want the press to know, she wanted to make sure that there would be a robust investigation, and she wanted an indication of whether there were other accusers. Hill eventually heard from Biden s office. But as she wrote in her memoir, she quickly became frustrated that they weren t taking her seriously and wouldn t keep her updated on their process as she had requested. The FBI interviewed her, and she wrote a statement that she wanted to accompany any report the agents put together. Biden s staff circulated her statement to committee members without her knowledge. On Sept. 28, about three weeks after Hill first heard from a Senate staffer, the committee voted to approve Thomas. On Oct. 3, Hill received a call from NPR s Nina Totenberg, and the following day, she heard from Newsday reporter Tim Phelps, who both eventually published stories publicly identifying Hill. After those stories, her life was never the same.It was only then that senators seemed to realize Hill s story was serious. And even after the public outrage, many senators didn t seem to know what to do   or thought they couldn t stop the nomination from moving forward to the full Senate on Oct. 8.Hill faced a significant amount of skepticism. Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) said that a woman who is sexually harassed  ought to get mad about it, and you ought to do something about it and you ought to complain, instead of hanging around a long time.  In other words, Hill was probably lying because she wasn t acting like he believed a victim should.Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) warned that if Hill testified, she d be  injured and destroyed and belittled and hounded and harassed, real harassment, different from the sexual kind. Hill faced her harshest treatment during her testimony from Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who was designated to be the Republican attack dog in defending Thomas. But she received very little support from Democrats. The true defenders of Hill were the female members of Congress. Barbara Mikulski was the only female Democratic senator at the time. But on the day of Thomas  scheduled confirmation vote before the full Senate, seven female House members marched across the Capitol and demanded to speak to the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell (D-Maine). They eventually convinced him to delay the vote. Biden was under pressure from Republicans as well   primarily, Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.), Thomas  chief sponsor. Biden initially wanted a two-week delay, but Danforth convinced him that fairness demanded the proceedings to move faster. Biden scheduled Hill s testimony for Oct. 11 and agreed that the Judiciary Committee would not take another vote before sending Thomas to the full Senate on Oct. 15. He also said he would keep questions about Thomas  general sexual conduct   such as his interest in pornography   out of the hearings. Joe bent over too far to accommodate the Republicans, who were going to get Thomas on the court come hell or high water,  Metzenbaum later told Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, who wrote a history of the Thomas fight. Biden also handed a major victory to Republicans in agreeing to let Thomas testify both before and after Hill   most crucially, scheduling his response to her allegations for 9 p.m. on a Friday, when millions of people were tuned in for their primetime broadcast.  In her 1997 memoir, Hill said she felt Biden betrayed her in doing so. She wrote that three days earlier, Biden had told her over the phone that she had the  option to testify whenever I wish   first and last. Biden had originally planned to have Hill close out the hearings. But he gave in to pressure from Thomas  handlers, who threatened that the Supreme Court nominee would hold a press conference saying he had been denied the opportunity to defend himself. I must start off with a presumption of giving the person accused the benefit of the doubt,  Biden told The New York Times two days before Hill was set to testify.  I must seek the truth and I must ask straightforward and tough questions, and in my heart I know if that woman is telling the truth it will be almost unfair to her. On the other hand, if I don t ask legitimate questions, then I am doing a great injustice to someone who might be totally innocent. It s a horrible dilemma because you have two lives at stake here.  Biden s most divisive and perhaps most significant decision was not calling the three other women who could have strengthened Hill s allegations against Thomas to testify. While the women s interviews with committee staff were entered into the record, that did not have the same impact as public testimony.Biden has maintained that no one was more eager to hear from the women than he was. But one of his top aides told Mayer and Abramson that wasn t true   Biden, like the other senators, simply wanted the hearings to be over.While Biden saw himself as Hill s ally   albeit one in a tough spot   Hill does not see it that way. There were three women who were ready and waiting and subpoenaed to be giving testimony about similar behavior that they had experienced or witnessed. He failed to call them,  she told HuffPost Live in an interview two years ago.  There also were experts who could have given real information as opposed to the misinformation that the Senate was giving ... and helped the public understand sexual harassment. He failed to call them.  When Kavanaugh was first nominated, there were plenty of stories about his character. He was a nice  carpool dad.  A regular guy who liked to drink beer and play basketball. Democrats largely stayed away from so-called character issues during his confirmation hearings last week. They focused on his views on abortion, health care, executive power and why Republicans weren t allowing them to see all the documents from his time working in President George W. Bush s White House. But since those hearings, the focus has shifted. In follow-up questions, senators asked whether he had a gambling problem or what he was talking about in an email exchange with friends after a guys  outing. Kavanaugh opponents say they understand Feinstein s reluctance to go public when the woman accusing him wants to remain confidential. But they re baffled that she would consider an incident of attempted sexual assault to have happened too long ago to be relevant or to be too off-topic for the hearings. Dianne Feinstein, What in the Hell Were You Thinking?  is the headline in a Daily Beast column by liberal writer Michael Tomasky. He faulted the senator for sitting on the allegation for months, noting she could have shared the claims with her colleagues without revealing the woman s identity.DiFi. Joe Biden. Different nominations. Same disappointing behavior There was clearly no 11th hour strategy to leak the letter s existence because there has been no strategy at all,  said a Democratic activist who requested anonymity to speak candidly.  She has let down the victim, the Senate, and the entire country who may now have a 2nd #MeToo Justice on the Supreme Court unless other Democrats step up to lead. Kevin DeLeon, a Democrat challenging Feinstein in November, said the senator s actions were  a failure of leadership.  The American people deserve to know why the Ranking Member on the Senate Judiciary Committee waited nearly three months to hand this disqualifying document over to the federal authorities, and why Sen. Feinstein politely pantomimed her way through last week s hearing without a single question about the content of Kavanaugh s character,  DeLeon said. Senator Feinstein was given information about Judge Kavanaugh through a third party,  said a Feinstein spokesman.  The Senator took these allegations seriously and believed they should be public. However, the woman in question made it clear she did not want this information to be public. It is critical in matters of sexual misconduct to protect the identity of the victim when they wish to remain anonymous, and the senator did so in this case. Although the woman is still anonymous, she s facing similar skepticism from some of the same quarters as Hill. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) retweeted a tweet that made light of the allegation as just another game of telephone.

Similarly, in 1991, the committee allowed women to testify in support of Thomas and his character, saying they never saw him harass Hill and they didn t believe her anyway.It s still not clear what effect the latest Kavanaugh revelation will have. Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), the Republican senators considered most likely to vote against Kavanaugh, have not yet commented on the assault allegation. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) used the fact that Democrats didn t reveal the letter until now as a reason to be skeptical of it.  I do not intend to allow Judge Kavanaugh s confirmation to be stalled because of an 11th-hour accusation that Democrats did not see fit to raise for over a month,  he said.  The Senator in the best position to determine the credibility of these accusations made the conscious decision not to take action on them, and the authorities to whom the accusations have been referred have decided not to take action either.

From that publication:The allegation dates back to the early nineteen-eighties, when Kavanaugh was a high-school student at Georgetown Preparatory School, in Bethesda, Maryland, and the woman attended a nearby high school. In the letter, the woman alleged that, during an encounter at a party, Kavanaugh held her down, and that he attempted to force himself on her. She claimed in the letter that Kavanaugh and a classmate of his, both of whom had been drinking, turned up music that was playing in the room to conceal the sound of her protests, and that Kavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand. She was able to free herself. Although the alleged incident took place decades ago and the three individuals involved were minors, the woman said that the memory had been a source of ongoing distress for her, and that she had sought psychological treatment as a result. I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,  Kavanaugh said in a statement to The New Yorker.  I did not do this back in high school or at any time. On Thursday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, acknowledged she had received a letter from the accuser and shared it with the FBI. Top Republican lawmakers are already jumping to Kavanaugh s defense. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, released a letter signed by more than 60 women who have known the nominee. We are women who have known Brett Kavanaugh for more than 35 years and knew him while he attended high school between 1979 and 1983,  the letter said.  For the entire time we have known Brett Kavanaugh, he has behaved honorably and treated women with respect. We strongly believe it is important to convey this information to the Committee at this time. The women describe the young Kavanaugh as an  outstanding student and athlete with a wide circle of friends. As the Me Too movement has repeatedly pointed out, treating some people well does not mean an individual did not sexually abuse another.The sheer number of signatures also led some observers to question whether Grassley s office had known of the accusation before reports about the letter to Feinstein surfaced. Grassley s office denied this, and one of the women who signed the letter tweeted on Friday that she only found out about it the night before.This is absurd.  I signed the letter. I learned of it last night. https://t.co/hTnxOvYNU6Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) defended Kavanaugh while admonishing Democrats for bringing up the allegation. He also mentioned that 65 women have come to the judge s defense. I do not intend to allow Judge Kavanaugh s confirmation to be stalled because of an 11th hour accusation that Democrats did not see fit to raise for over a month,  Hatch said in a statement.  The Senator in the best position to determine the credibility of these accusations made the conscious decision not to take action on them, and the authorities to whom the accusations have been referred have decided not to take action either. Judge Kavanaugh has denied these accusations categorically, the only other potential witness has no recollection of the alleged event, and now 65 women who knew Brett in high school have come forward as witnesses of his strong character.

Kavanaugh, in a statement to The New Yorker, which broke the details of the encounter, denied the claim. I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,  he said.  I did not do this back in high school or at any time. The woman, whose identity is still not public, sent Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) a letter in the summer, after Kavanaugh was nominated, sharing her concerns about him.From The New Yorker: The allegation dates back to the early nineteen-eighties, when Kavanaugh was a high-school student at Georgetown Preparatory School, in Bethesda, Maryland, and the woman attended a nearby high school.

Although the alleged incident took place decades ago and the three individuals involved were minors, the woman said that the memory had been a source of ongoing distress for her, and that she had sought psychological treatment as a result.The classmate who was reportedly with Kavanaugh said he has  no recollection  of the incident. CNN also reported that Kavanaugh allegedly tried to remove the woman s clothes and that she later sought medical treatment: Both men were drunk, she said, and Kavanaugh attempted to remove her clothes.At one point, Kavanaugh was on top of her laughing as the other male in the room periodically jumped onto Kavanaugh.Kavanaugh held his hand over her mouth at one point, and she said she felt her life was inadvertently in danger.She said she was able to leave the room and go into a hallway bathroom. After Kavanaugh and the other male began talking to others in the house, she went home.There is no indication the woman reported the incident to law enforcement at the time, but she said she has received medical treatment regarding the alleged assault. Rumors of this letter and sexual misconduct allegations have been swirling for weeks on Capitol Hill, with reporters and other Democratic senators pressing Feinstein, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, to share the information. On Thursday, Feinstein finally acknowledged she had received a letter but did not want to give more details because the subject did not want to go public. She said she referred the matter to the FBI. Sources close to Feinstein say she was acting out of concern for the privacy of the woman. But The New Yorker reports that Feinstein  conveyed to other Democratic members  offices that the incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion, and that Feinstein had  taken care of it.   She also thought Democrats should focus on legal issues with Kavanaugh, rather than personal ones. Republicans dismissed the revelation about the letter on Thursday. And on Friday, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) retweeted someone who was mocking it as a game of telephone.

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) during his confirmation hearing isn t sitting right with the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. In a statement exclusive to HuffPost, Rep. Judy Chu said that Kavanaugh s inability to answer Harris  question regarding the Chinese Exclusion Act, which was passed in 1882 and put a 10-year moratorium on Chinese labor immigration, is  alarming. Harris had asked the nominee last week whether the 1889 case that had upheld the law was correctly decided. The decision has yet to be overturned.  This case has never been explicitly overruled,  Harris said during the hearing.  Was the United States Supreme Court correct in upholding that Chinese people could be banned from entering our country.  While Kavanaugh admitted that the decision reflected  discriminatory attitudes  of the time, he declined to say whether the case was incorrectly decided when Harris pressed him a second time.  Senator, I don t want to opine on a case without looking at it and studying the discrimination,  he said. And when asked if he believed that, under the Constitution,  Congress or the President can ban entry under the basis of race,  the nominee once again sidestepped the question, saying that this is an issue  that was just in litigation  and wouldn t answer as a  matter of independence and precedent.   Not condemning policy based on prejudice indicates an openness to other disgraceful policies, like the Muslim travel ban proposed by Donald Trump, who also nominated Kavanaugh to this position,  Chu mentioned in her statement. She added that his inability to answer the question also shows that Kavanaugh is an ill fit for a spot on the Supreme Court, considering the judicial branch has the power to determine the outcome of cases that impact immigrants and communities of color.  We need to know that we have an impartial justice who will do what is best for our country, rather than simply propagate the same xenophobic views that led to shameful chapters in our nation s history like the Chinese Exclusion Act,  she said in the statement. The law, the first major legislation that explicitly banned a group of people from entering the U.S. based on ethnicity, had been passed during a time of rampant anti-Chinese sentiment. In the years ahead of the law s passage, Chinese laborers took jobs on the transcontinental railroad, laying down tracks for half of the massive line, along with several other railroads in the West. Despite their hard work, the immigrants were ridiculed and emasculated, frequently described as  monkeys  or  midgets,  with their contributions often ignored. As the wave of immigrants increased, so did hostility toward the Chinese, who were willing to work for lower wages and longer hours,  Gay Yuen, board president of Los Angeles  Chinese American Museum, previously said to HuffPost. Chinese laborers were seen as threats and job stealers. And, as the Chinese population grew in the U.S., harmful stereotypes around the group as being unscrupulous also spread. Tensions eventually led to the passage of the act.  The Chinese were originally seen as racially unassimilable,  Beth Lew-Williams, an assistant professor at Princeton specializing in Asian-American history, previously told HuffPost.  They could not become Americanized. They were simultaneously racially inferior, backwards, savage heathen   and in some dangerous ways   superior. Chu pointed out in her statement that the law reduced Chinese-Americans to second-class citizens. The 1889 case, Chae Chan Ping v. United States, essentially underscored the government s absolute power to restrict immigration, claiming  the power of exclusion of foreigners being an incident of sovereignty belonging to the government of the United States.   This law left permanent scars on the Chinese-American community, denying them the ability to become naturalized citizens and forcing them to carry papers on them at all times or else be deported,  Chu said.  Judge Kavanaugh s inability to say that discrimination on the basis of race alone is unlawful is just one of a litany of reasons that I am opposing his confirmation to the Supreme Court.  While Kavanaugh is likely to get confirmed as he s expected to get a favorable vote from all 11 Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the vote has been delayed until next week. "

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) acknowledged Thursday that she has a document concerning Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh that she has so far refused to share, despite behind-the-scenes requests to do so from her fellow Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee. I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,  Feinstein said in a statement.  That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities. The California Democrat, who is the senior minority member on the committee, had thus far refused to answer questions about the document, which was first reported by The Intercept.Multiple sources have told HuffPost that the document in question is a letter sent to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) that concerns potential sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh and a woman when they were both in high school. Eshoo s office has also declined to comment, saying the letter was considered casework   and thus wouldn t be made public   since it came from a constituent.The White House took issue with Feinstein s announcement Thursday, saying that she never brought up this matter when she met with him or at his hearings.  Not until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new  information  about him,  White House spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, blaming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for an  11th hour attempt to delay  Kavanaugh s confirmation. Throughout 25 years of public service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has thoroughly and repeatedly vetted Judge Kavanaugh, dating back to 1993, for some of the most highly sensitive roles,  Kupec said.  He has served in the Office of Independent Counsel, the White House, and on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, all before his nomination earlier this year to serve as Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the judiciary committee, said Thursday he was aware of the matter, but declined to comment because he had not seen the document in question. All I know is what I read, and I wouldn t make any judgment of it until I get more information,  Grassley told reporters outside a Senate judiciary committee hearing concerning Kavanaugh s nomination.Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is considered one of the few GOP members who may vote against Kavanaugh, refused to comment on the new revelations because she hasn t seen the letter in question. Collins is also scheduled to speak with Kavanaugh on the phone Friday to follow up on other, unrelated questions.Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told BuzzFeed Thursday that the matter had been referred to the FBI. An FBI official acknowledged that it has the document, saying the bureau received the information on Sept. 12 and  included it as part of Judge Kavanaugh s background file, as per the standard process. That indicates there s no plan for further investigation as part of the background check process, which likely would have happened if the FBI had received the information earlier on. Kavanaugh s background file is available for the White House to review.A lawyer who is reportedly representing the woman was spotted leaving the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday evening shortly after the Intercept report was published. The lawyer, Debra Katz, has not responded to HuffPost s requests for comment. The document is only the latest to create controversy amid the battle over Kavanaugh s nomination, which is expected to receive a favorable vote in committee on Sept. 20. Republicans on Thursday voted down several attempts by Democrats to subpoena hundreds of thousands of documents that have been deemed privileged and unavailable to the public, including those related to Kavanaugh s work as a key administration official for former President George W. Bush.This story has been updated with additional information.Ryan Reilly contributed reporting.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

According to a HuffPost source, Collins allegedly green lit Trump s nominee before the president even chose Kavanaugh, though she strenuously denies this. The senator now faces activists who have so far raised $1.3 million and counting via crowdfunding for any opponent to run against her in 2020.A rattled Collins has resorted to calling this  bribery  in an  exclusive statement  to right-wing website Newsmax, which tells us exactly which audience she s attempting to shore up and gain sympathy from.This claim is just plain silly since no one is planning on actually paying her the money. She should look up Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission for a definition of bribery, a ruling handed down by several justices for whom she voted, and a ruling which she s benefited from in the form of corporate donations.Collins has also complained about  vulgar  phone calls to her office from people opposed to Kavanaugh, the least popular Supreme Court nominee in decades, who, in opinion polls, is doing slightly worse or even with the ill-fated Harriet Miers and Robert Bork. (Of course, for a definition of  vulgar,  Collins really should just look up  Donald Trump. )Perhaps Collins, who seems to have lived in that cocoon in which senators who ve been in office for decades often find themselves, is suddenly realizing that we re in a different time and that she s sealed her fate. Who knows what Trump may have promised Collins or what she s afraid he might do to her if she were now to go back on any assurances she may have given on Kavanaugh. Perhaps Collins is worried about a primary challenge from the right in 2020. I would be.Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), meanwhile, is begging for help from the same GOP leaders he s attacked in the past (like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whom Cruz called a  liar  a few years back) as he tries to fend off a serious challenge from Democratic Congressman Beto O Rourke, who is galvanizing support across Texas and coming up even with Cruz in polls. It appears grassroots fundraising has slowed for Cruz and exploded for O Rourke.Ironically, Cruz is also turning to the same man who helped turn the GOP radioactive: Trump, who announced he s heading to Texas to stump for Cruz next month. The same Cruz whom Trump called  Lyin  Ted.  The same Trump whom Cruz called a  sniveling coward  and  serial philanderer. And now McConnell is openly fretting about losing Republican control of the Senate.While the House has been in play for Democrats for months, their chances only grow by the day to take control of the chamber, as new polls show further momentum. But control of the Senate, seen as a long shot just weeks ago, is also now a realistic, less-daunting possibility. McConnell even told reporters this week,  I hope when the smoke clears, we ll still have a majority. GOP leaders mused in the recent past about taking seats from Democrats in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan   all states Trump won. But those efforts have largely evaporated. Now McConnell and GOP leaders are diverting precious time and money to states where McConnell sees a  knife fight in an alley  to retain or take seats: Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee, Montana, North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia and Florida.Fighting to keep Senate seats in Texas and Tennessee was never in the GOP s game plan (nor in anyone else s wildest imagination).Republicans can only blame themselves for this state of affairs. After first occasionally standing up to Trump post-election, they ve completely thrown their lot in with him, fearful of their shrinking party s Trump-loving base. (The GOP now represents only about one-fourth of voters, according to recent surveys, declining since the 2016 election.)Now, Trump is all they ve got. Their tax law, benefiting the wealthy and corporations, went nowhere in galvanizing voters for the midterms (many having likely seen it for the scam that it is). According to a recent Fox News poll, it s now more unpopular (40 percent) than Obamacare (51 percent). Vicious anti-immigrant rhetoric, always a desperate last resort, only hurt the GOP in Virginia s 2017 gubernatorial and legislative races and in special elections across the country.But that hasn t stopped Republicans from deploying racist attacks this election season in full force. As Frank Sharry of the immigration group America s Voice notes, we can expect  an ugly midterm election strategy: smear immigrants as criminals and attack Democrats for defending them. For McConnell and GOP Senate candidates, at least, the plan, from a while back, has been to grab onto Trump and back all of his ugly, racist rhetoric, hoping he ll keep them afloat.But Trump s approval is quite suddenly sinking into the mid-30s in a slew of new polls   tanking among independents and in the Midwest   while, in that same recent Fox News poll, special counsel Robert Mueller, leading the Russia investigation, has a soaring 59 percent approval rating.There are now few states to which the GOP can send Trump   who, on his own, is deciding where he wants to go anyway   because even if he may help in a statewide race, he will hurt GOP House candidates in suburban districts in that same state who are running as far away from him as they can. As has been said many times, anything Trump touches, he destroys. None of this, of course, is certain, underscoring why progressives must double down their energy. With voter suppression, possible Russian electorial interference and the usual GOP arsenal of dirty tricks, Republicans may be able to cling to power in both chambers. Gerrymandering has helped to rig the system, too.And even if Republicans are hurt by embracing Trump, much of it is cold comfort for progressives and all who care about the future of America. Collins may pay a price in 2020 for voting to confirm Kavanaugh, but we ll still be stuck with Kavanaugh and a radical shift of the Supreme Court for decades. The country will experience profound change, from the gutting of Roe v. Wade and threatening LGBTQ rights to an expansion of presidential power and further assaults on the environment.A lot of the damage that Trump has caused unilaterally or with the help of the GOP Congress will be difficult or even impossible to undo, even if Democrats were to take both the Senate and the House, keep control of each chamber for several years, and even win the presidency in 2020.But we must start somewhere at turning things around as we face the most devastating and harrowing political reality of our lifetimes. That s only going to happen when the GOP hits rock bottom as progressive momentum surges. And it s appearing that may happen this November.Michelangelo Signorile is an editor-at-large for HuffPost.

That was the position of the plaintiffs in that case, and I was accurately describing the plaintiffs  position,  Kavanaugh wrote in response to a follow-up question from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) released Wednesday.  At the hearing, I was not expressing an opinion on whether particular drugs induce abortion,  Kavanaugh continued.  I used that phrase only when recount the plaintiffs  own assertions.  On the third day of Kavanaugh s confirmation hearing last week, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) asked Kavanaugh about his 2015 dissent in the Priests for Life v. HHS case. Kavanaugh sided with the religious organization. Priests for Life, a Catholic group that opposes abortion rights and didn t want to provide employees with insurance coverage for contraceptives. It was a technical matter of filling out a form, in that case with   that   they said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were -ñ as a religious matter, objected to,  Kavanaugh said in response to Cruz s question. His comments sparked a wave of criticism from Democrats and members of pro-women groups, who argued that the phrase revealed Kavanaugh s true opinion on abortion. Since President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh, there has been heated discussion about whether the judge would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that made abortion legal. Later in the written follow-up questions, Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) pressed Kavanaugh on his response to Cruz, asking the judge if he believes  that birth control or contraceptives are  abortion-inducing drugs.  Kavanaugh responded with the same answer he gave Grassley. Kavanaugh s confirmation hearing, which began Sept. 4, has featured activists loudly protesting the judge s views on abortion, gun control and the Affordable Care Act, among other issues.Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and 2016 presidential nominee, criticized Kavanaugh s use of the phrase  abortion-inducing drugs  in a series of tweets Wednesday, writing that it  set off a lot of alarm bells.  Kavanaugh didn t use that term because he misunderstands the basic science of birth control   the fact that birth control prevents fertilization of eggs in the first place. He used that term because it s a dog whistle to the extreme right,  Clinton tweeted.  When Kavanaugh called birth control  abortion-inducing drugs,  he made it clear that safe and legal abortion isn t the only fundamental reproductive right at grave risk if he is confirmed,  Clinton continued.  Access to birth control is, too. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The way it was was right. The way it is is wrong,  Ginsburg said.During Kavanaugh s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrats have pushed back hard against President Donald Trump s nominee in an attempt to stop the Supreme Court from leaning even further to the conservative right. Democrats are worried about how Kavanaugh, who would replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, would rule on issues relating to the investigation into Trump s campaign and Russian interference in the U.S. election. Also a point of contention: Democrats warn that Kavanaugh may threaten the Roe v. Wade ruling that established the right to abortion.Adding to the drama surrounding the hearing, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) released Kavanaugh s previously confidential emails on the third day, giving Democrats even more fuel to scrutinize the judge.Ginsburg said Wednesday that the  atmosphere  surrounding Supreme Court hearings were  truly bipartisan  when she was nominated in 1993, noting that she won the votes of nearly all the Republican senators despite her work with the American Civil Liberties Union.Ginsburg also pointed out that all the Democrats in the Senate in 1986 voted to confirm Justice Antonin Scalia, who was famous for his conservatism.  Think of Justice Scalia, who s certainly a known character. The vote was unanimous,  Ginsburg said.  That s the way it should be, instead of what it s become, which is a highly partisan show. The Republicans move in lockstep, and so do the Democrats. I wish I could wave a magic wand and have it go back. This isn t the first time Ginsburg has criticized divisiveness in politics.In April, the Justice, again noting her 96-3 Senate confirmation vote, said that members of Congress are lacking camaraderie. You don t see that kind of friendship existing in Congress anymore,  she said at a Duke University event.  You might recall that when I was nominated by President Clinton, the vote was 96-3. It s not that way anymore. Ginsburg, who reportedly is committed to a serious workout regimen, also took some time Wednesday to flex a little muscle on her fellow Supreme Court justices.Asked who on the court could do more pushups than her, Ginsburg replied,  Maybe Justice Neil Gorsuch,  her 51-year-old colleague, who she said rides his bike to work every day.Ginsburg also added Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, 63, to the list:  I think our chief is also a possibility,  she said.Watch Ginsburg s entire talk at George Washington University here.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?
