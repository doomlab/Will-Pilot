          The fifth day of the government shutdown began Wednesday as budget negotiations between lawmakers and President Trump supposedly were to resume after the Christmas break. However, White House officials expect the shutdown to extend into the new year as Trump refuses to sign any spending bill that does not include billions in funding for a border wall, while Democrats continue to argue that a physical barrier would be wasteful and ineffective.  I can t tell you when the government s going to be open. I can tell you it s not going to be open until we have a wall or fence, whatever they d like to call it,  Trump said on Tuesday. House Democrats, soon to be in the majority, are reportedly planning to introduce a bill to re-open the government on Jan. 3.
        
          Around 800,000 government employees are now furloughed or expected to work without pay. Federal agencies have been attempting to continue operating as usual, though funding and staffing lapses have hit some harder than others. The Department of Agriculture expects 61 percent of its employees to work during the first week of the shutdown. The department s Food and Nutrition Services office, which oversees food assistance services like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, will have its staffing cut by 95 percent by the end of the day. Households eligible for SNAP will still receive benefits in January, but other programs like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) may not be able to provide assistance if resources run low.
        
          Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee project that around 96 percent of NASA employees, 86 percent of Department of Commerce employees, and 95 percent of Housing and Urban Development employees will not be returning to work this week unless the shutdown ends. The Small Business Administration announced that it will remain  inactive  until further notice, which means that millions of businesses will be unable to secure loans.
        
          The Department of Health and Human Services will continue to track illness outbreaks and high-risk recalls with around 75 percent of its staff remaining. Most federal law enforcement personnel will continue to work without pay, though they are expected to be compensated once the shutdown ends.
        
          Many departments have stated that more employees may be furloughed, and services suspended, as the shutdown progresses and reserve funds become depleted.
        
          Government workers have reported financial difficulties as a result of the furloughs. A labor organization representing U.S. Treasury employees said on Monday that its members have had to alter holiday plans and reduce their spending. Hundreds of people have taken to Twitter to talk about the personal consequences of the shutdown under the hashtag #ShutdownStories.
        
          Trump has claimed, without providing any specifics, that many federal workers have encouraged him to stand his ground.  These federal workers want the wall,  he said.

          On the 12th day of the partial government shutdown, stopgap measures meant to keep federal agencies running, employees paid, and countless government operations holding on through the holidays are starting to run out.
        
          On Wednesday, the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, free attractions popular among tourists visiting D.C., closed to the public. (In Washington, as BuzzFeed reporter Zoe Tillman pointed out on Twitter, the Marriage Bureau at the D.C. Superior Court, funded by federal appropriations, is also closed, meaning no one can get a marriage license in the district.)
        
          Elsewhere in the country, the effects of the shutdown on recreation will likely extend beyond the shutdown. In national parks, where employees have closed facilities but not barred entry, the accumulation of human waste around now-abandoned toilets and on paths has created a health hazard that has driven some residents living near the parks to volunteer their time cleaning bathrooms and collecting garbage, according to the Washington Post. Yosemite National Park has closed off two campgrounds and a popular redwood grove for public safety, as visitors have been using the side of the road to relieve themselves, the Los Angeles Times reported.
        
          Facilities aren t the only problem for some people looking to take a holiday vacation. Some essential personnel canceled trips to be able to hold things together during the shutdown. And for thousands of other federal employees, finances became a sudden concern. There are an estimated 800,000 workers feeling the impact of the shutdown, according to ABC News. About 420,000 of those workers are working under the promise of being paid retroactively, but the remaining have been furloughed.
        
          Those affected work for nine federal departments and dozens of other, smaller agencies that had to close. While most of the military remains funded, the Coast Guard, which falls under the Department of Homeland Security, is not. The Coast Guard announced on Friday it could provide emergency payments on Monday to its 42,000 active-duty service members for work in December, but it could not guarantee a paycheck in January.
        
          And the shutdown doesn t just worry federal employees. The Interior Department s Indian Affairs bureau provides funding for federal employees to assist with basic services, including health clinics, food pantries, law enforcement, road maintenance, and education. With the shutdown, tribes are losing out on hundreds of thousands of dollars per day. The New York Times reported that on the Navajo Nation, unplowed roads have trapped people in their homes and left them unable to make the trip to buy water, groceries, or medicine.
        
          Less troubling on the individual level but still of concern in the long term are the regulatory efforts that could become hampered by the shutdown. The Federal Trade Commission ran out of funding on Friday, meaning all of its investigations not related to mergers will be suspended. That s of note because it includes the FTC s monthslong investigation of Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. As former FTC officials told the Post, the delays could place the FTC in a weaker position as it faces off against Facebook. Lawmakers are already criticizing the FTC for moving too slowly in its investigation.
        
          Next to go is the Federal Communications Commission, which is set to end most of its operations on Thursday. It will no longer be able to operate licensing services for broadcast companies, enforce consumer-protection measures, test and approve new devices, and respond to consumer complaints. More than 80 percent of its workers will be furloughed. Given that President Trump said on Wednesday that the shutdown will last  as long as it takes,  Americans should prepare for things to get worse.

          In February 1974, the Symbionese Liberation Army, a left-wing radical group, kidnapped the 19-year-old daughter of media mogul William Randolph Hearst. The SLA claimed to represent  all oppressed people,   self-determination,  and  human and constitutional rights.  It  requested  that Hearst show  good faith  by providing hundreds of millions of dollars in food aid to the poor.  The people are awaiting your gesture,  an SLA leader told Hearst.  We will accept a sincere effort on your part. 
        
          The Hearst case, like other abductions, was violent and far removed from the genteel halls of Congress. But if you want to understand the behavior of Republicans in the current government shutdown, you have to understand kidnapping. The tactics of President Donald Trump and his congressional allies taking hostages, using them as messengers, and blaming their suffering on the people who could ransom them echo the tactics of criminal captors like the SLA.
        
          In the shutdown, the hostages are public employees, veterans, and everyone else who depends on federal payments. The ransom is $5 billion. Like other ideologues, the Republicans claim to have a good cause: a wall on the Mexican border. But morally, the bottom line is the same: You can t hold people hostage, even if you think your cause is worthy. The question at stake isn t border security. It s whether the government will shut down and stay closed every time extremists demand money for a pet cause.
        
          Trump forced this debacle. On Dec. 11, he said,  If we don t get what we want   I will shut down the government.  On Jan. 2, two weeks into the shutdown, he thanked Vice President Mike Pence for congratulating him on taking  a strong stand to shut down the government until we secure the funding to build a wall.  But now Trump is trying to hold congressional Democrats, from whom he has demanded ransom, responsible for dragging their feet.  Look, this shutdown could end tomorrow, [or] it could also go on for a long time,  Trump told reporters on Saturday.  It s really dependent on the Democrats.  On Sunday, Trump s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, disputed suggestions that the president was responsible. On the contrary, Mulvaney proposed,  It s the Democrats  refusal to give the necessary money for border security that is the cause of the shutdown. 
        
          Republicans are trying to recast their extortion as ordinary negotiation.  We re asking for $5.6 billion. They re offering us zero,  Mulvaney told CNN. He complained that in a meeting with Trump on Friday, Democrats  said they were not interested in having any further discussions until   the government was open.  Trump and Mulvaney dismiss that position as absurd. The least Democrats can do, according to the White House, is  come to the middle. 
        
          Some abductors try to use their hostages as messengers. That s what the White House is doing to federal employees caught in the shutdown. On Monday, a reporter asked Mercedes Schlapp, the White House director of strategic communications,  What s the White House message to the federal workers who are on track to miss their first paycheck?  Schlapp urged these furloughed workers to  call the Democrats and basically tell the Democrats,  Stop the delay tactics, let s negotiate.   
        
          When ransom isn t paid, kidnappers escalate their threats, making it look as though the people withholding the money are at fault. The fate of the hostage, they insinuate, is up to her family. That s how Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, talks about Trump s hostages. Democrats should cut a deal with the president  before we get to the point where federal employees do not get paid,  McCarthy warned his colleagues on Tuesday.
        
          On Tuesday night, Trump read a prepared statement on prime-time TV. Officially, it was a presidential address. In reality, it was a message from the kidnappers.  The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security,  said Trump.  The only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell repeated Trump s demand on Wednesday morning. By refusing to pay for the wall, said McConnell, Democrats were  prolonging  the shutdown. He urged them to  negotiate a fair solution with the president to secure our nation and reopen all of the federal government. 
        
          This is a charade. Democrats have already passed bills to reopen the government. The reason those bills haven t become law is that McConnell refuses to let the Senate vote on them, and Trump refuses to sign them. When Republicans are asked why they re sitting on these bills, they say it s impossible to reopen the government before resolving the wall debate. On Tuesday, White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said opening the government first wasn t  practical.  Steve Scalise, the House Republican whip, said of the reopening and the wall,  You can t have one without the other.  Neither Conway nor Scalise could explain the connection, because there isn t one. The Republicans just don t want to give up their hostages.
        
          On Wednesday afternoon, Democrats went to the White House to discuss reopening the government. Trump walked out of the meeting. Pence, McCarthy, and Scalise blamed the meltdown on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  The president called the question in the meeting,  Pence told reporters afterward.  He asked Speaker Pelosi   if he reopened the government quickly, would she agree to funding for a wall or a barrier on the southern border? And when she said no, the president said,  Goodbye.   
        
          There s a case to be made for a border wall, just as there s a case to be made for feeding the poor. Congress is free to debate these issues anytime. But that s not the question before us. The question before us is whether it s acceptable and whether it will become normal to shut down the government as a bargaining tactic. If you pay ransom for hostages, you ll get more hostage-takers. That s true of kidnappings. It s true of shutdowns, too.

          One of the quirks of American politics is that conservatives and libertarians can use regular shutdowns as evidence that the federal government was never really that necessary in the first place.
        
          But 420,000 federal workers are still working, without pay, holding off a short-term disaster. At the Food and Drug Administration, for example, semi-annual factory inspections are on hold. But Department of Agriculture meat plant supervisors are still working.
        
          In the bracket of workers whose absence would constitute a national crisis, top seed must surely go to the 51,000 employees of the Transportation Security Administration. The TSA may practice intrusive security theater, but in its absence, commercial air travel in the United States would grind to a halt, creating global transportation chaos.
        
          Like other federal workers, TSA agents missed their first paycheck on Friday. More and more agents are calling out sick, either in protest or to make up for lost wages.
        
          On Saturday, 5.6 percent of officers called in sick up from 3.3 percent a year ago. TSA head David Pekoske announced $500 bonuses. Over the weekend, airports in Houston and Miami shut down terminal checkpoints in an effort to better distribute shrinking staffs.
        
          On Monday, 7.1 percent called in sick up from 3.1 percent a year ago, according to the agency. Wait times at the main checkpoint at Atlanta s Hartsfield-Jackson, the nation s busiest airport, were over an hour long on Monday morning.
        
          The American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represents the 44,000 TSA screeners, has sued the federal government on their behalf. The attrition caused by the shutdown, the TSA union rep said last week,  will create a massive security risk for American travelers.  The median TSA screener makes $40,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the starting salary is $15 an hour.
        
          In the New York Times, Barbara Ehrenreich and Gary Stevenson make the case that it s time for TSA workers to strike. That would be illegal, but the situation they find themselves in working without pay for weeks at a time is without precedent.
        
          Other quieter consequences of the shutdown are no less devastating. But a meltdown at the airports would put a new level of pressure on Republicans to reopen the government. Fewer than one in four American adults fly more than twice each year, according to research by Ipsos. But those who do tend to be wealthy and influential, and closing the nation s airports would make federal workers  misery their own.

          Despite what you may have heard, there will be no government shutdown at the end of this week. The death of President George H.W. Bush on Friday prompted the House of Representatives, in its grieving, to take the whole week off. Instead of arguing about funding for physical barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border at Bush s state funeral on Wednesday, congressional leaders have agreed to punt the deadline for a partial government shutdown two weeks. The new date, Dec. 21, is, not coincidentally, just four days ahead of Christmas, when lawmakers traditionally abandon their firm ideological principles and just vote for whatever they have to in order to make their flights home.
        
          The two weeks of additional brainstorming are unlikely to produce a new way to bridge the gap between $5 billion and $1.6 billion: That first figure is what President Donald Trump is requesting in  wall money  and the second what Senate Democrats are willing to give him in  fencing money.  The spending deal, which would lump together all seven incomplete appropriations bills, is just about entirely resolved except for that gulf. Expect Trump to cave.
        
          Trump loves to brag about how excited he is to shut down the government. He openly mused about shutting it down at the last spending deadline, in September, but congressional Republican leaders pleaded with him to kick the fight to December. They got their wish, and the president is once again blabbing publicly about how it s a  good time  for a shutdown. But just as in September, there s no clear shutdown endgame for the president in sight. And he s in an even worse spot now, since his most loyal friends in Washington House Republicans will be out of power in the very near future.
        
          The Democratic takeover of the House makes it more pressing for Trump that he get the wall money he wants right now and less likely that he gets it. His chances of constructing the wall of his dreams will be shot once Democrats take control of the chamber. But if there s a protracted government shutdown that carries through the holidays, it will be resolved by that new House Democratic majority anyway and after the already unpopular president has taken a hit by shutting down the government over the unpopular issue of a border wall.
        
          In other words, congressional Republicans will be spending these next several weeks finding the president an out.
        
          Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has offered the president a couple. In a floor speech last week, Schumer suggested that Senate Democrats would go along with either another continuing resolution to fund the rest of the government at previously authorized levels through the remainder of the fiscal year, or the bipartisan deal that the Senate Appropriations Committee struck earlier this year. That one would have included $1.6 billion  for approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing in the Rio Grande Valley. 
        
          Senate Democrats are already facing a lot of heat for offering that much. When Schumer announced last week that Democrats stood by their $1.6 billion position, he didn t seem to recognize that most people weren t aware Democrats had already agreed to that figure over the summer. Schumer has taken incoming from both the Democratic base and House Democrats, who enjoy blaming their Senate counterparts for screwing everything up.
        
          House Republicans could try, first, to pin the blame for a shutdown on Schumer by passing a spending bill with the $5 billion in wall funding that would have no chance of passing in the Senate. There are a couple of problems with this strategy, though. The first is that, well, Trump would still probably get blamed because his insistence on the unpopular policy is at the source of the logjam. The second is that House Republicans might not have enough votes to pass such a bill on their own: A good number of the suburban Republicans who won t be returning are thinking about running again, and they ll be less inclined this time to go along with all of Trump s whims.
        
          So here s an endgame: Trump accepts the $1.6 billion with an immaterial tweak or two ahead of the Dec. 21 deadline, says that s what he wanted in the first place and that he ll come back for more in the new year, perhaps through an immigration deal with Democrats (that never happens). Everyone goes off and enjoys the holidays, and by the time the new Congress convenes in January, nobody remembers any of this. And Trump, without enough money for his precious wall, still gets to run on building it.

          President Donald Trump likes to boast about his achievements. Biggest, best, smartest are all words he regularly trots out to describe himself and his administration. He now has another one to add to the list: longest. As of Saturday, the partial government shutdown entered its 22nd day and officially broke the record as the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. The previous record took place during Bill Clinton s administration, when an impasse with the Republican-led Congress and then-Speaker Newt Gingrich sparked a shutdown that began on Dec. 15, 1995 and lasted into the first few days of 1996.
        
          There is still no end in sight to this shutdown. That means the estimated 800,000 federal workers who have been affected will continue to either have to work without pay or be furloughed. Trump has made it clear he won t end the shutdown without funding for his border wall, or barrier as he has taken to calling it lately, while Democratic congressional leaders say they won t discuss border security until the government is reopened. And, regardless, the wall is off the table for them. While the Democratic-led House of Representatives has passed bills to temporarily fund the government and get it reopened, the GOP-led Senate has refused to take them on. Congress did manage to pass a bill Friday to guarantee that federal workers will get back pay, which Trump has vowed to sign.
        
          Trump has raised the possibility of declaring a national emergency to build the wall, but he seemed to back off that threat Friday, at least for a bit.  What we re not looking to do right now is national emergency,  Trump said Friday.  I m not going to do it so fast.  Although Trump insists he has the right to act unilaterally through an emergency declaration, he says lawmakers need to get the government reopened. But, of course, Trump isn t exactly known for sticking by his declarations so it s  unclear whether his stance Friday would hold or for how long,  as the Washington Post puts it.
        
          On Saturday, Trump took to Twitter to tell Democrats to  come back to Washington and work to end the Shutdown.  The president said he was  in the White House waiting for you!  He then urged supporters to give him a hand.  Democrats could solve the Shutdown in 15 minutes! Call your Dem Senator or Congresswoman/man,  Trump wrote.  Tell them to get it done! Humanitarian Crisis.

          As the government shutdown heads into its third week, rapper Snoop Dogg has issued a public statement voicing his concerns with the current administration s handling of the crisis. In an Instagram post on Saturday, Snoop Dogg directly addressed furloughed federal employees, urging them not to support President Trump in the 2020 presidential election. If they do, he warned, they will have shown themselves to be  stupid motherfuckers. 
        
          While language like Snoop Dogg s clearly has no place in the noble and solemn public discourse surrounding the noble and solemn office of our noble and solemn president, it is difficult to argue with the substance of his remarks.

SLATE,https://slate.com/culture/2019/01/government-shutdown-jimmy-kimmel-trump.html,"
          Earlier this week, Jimmy Kimmel made a futile appeal to Donald Trump to end the government shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history.  I know it doesn t mean much to Donald Trump that a bunch of Americans are being forced to work without paychecks,  he said.  Or that vital services like food inspection and TSA, anti-terrorism efforts are being compromised.  Instead, Kimmel framed the shutdown as something that affects the president personally: Once it s over, he can get back to playing golf. That appeal hasn t magically solved the problem, of course. But Kimmel wasn t really asking the president for anything, anyway. He was taunting him.
        
          For more than a week now, Kimmel has been inviting workers impacted by the shutdown on Jimmy Kimmel Live to perform odd jobs. It started with a federal prison guard playing tambourine as part of the show s house band, but Kimmel has stuck with it, and his guests have since included an air traffic controller working as a bartender in the greenroom and a NASA engineer pressing the button for the show s  Applause  sign. Some of the resulting segments are simply silly, as when Kimmel stuck a fake mustache on a fire captain for the U.S. Forest Service as a stand-in for Kimmel regular Guillermo Rodriguez. Others capitalize on a worker s particular talents, like TSA agent Fatina Amina McIntosh guessing which pedestrians on Hollywood Blvd are high on marijuana.
        
          This isn t just Kimmel goofing around. With each guest, he makes a pointed statement about how essential their role is for the country to function. When USDA Safety Inspector Sandy Cross comes on the show as a meteorologist, it s more than a gag about how rare rain is in Los Angeles, it s an opportunity for Kimmel to highlight what she s supposed to be doing instead of standing around in a yellow windbreaker.  Is it safe to say that without you, we cannot trust our bacon or our eggs?  he asks, and she agrees. Without Cross not the nameless, faceless employees of the Food and Drug Administration, but this particular inspector, Sandy Cross our meat and poultry may not be safe to eat.
        
          That s the other advantage of Kimmel s stunt: It humanizes the people who are impacted by the shutdown, hundreds of thousands of whom are now working without a paycheck. McIntosh tells a funny story about travelers who don t speak English stripping in front of her as Kimmel reminds us that she s working with no paycheck. Nathan Steinhubel, the air traffic controller, laughs at a joke about wanting to keep the people in the tower happy and by the way, he s receiving no paycheck. Mark Munoz, who fought the devastating wildfires that tore through southern California, has seven daughters and still no paycheck.
        
          Whether Trump is watching or not, Kimmel is hitting him where it hurts: his so-called populist appeal. The shutdown is already costing Trump the support of his strongest supporters, white Americans without college degrees, and Kimmel is taking advantage by deploying his own everyman persona, using common sense, basic compassion, and a let s-grab-a-beer ease to transcend political ideology, as he s done in the past with health care. He s deploying it now to remind us on a nightly basis that ordinary Americans are stuck working without pay because of Trump s tantrum, and in the process, he s making the president look like exactly what he is: an out-of-touch millionaire who doesn t care about the little guy. As long as the shutdown continues and Kimmel keeps it up, no amount of fast food can change that.

          Amid a partial government shutdown that has left hundreds of thousands of federal employees working without pay or furloughed, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that freezes their pay for next year. The move follows through on an earlier promise to nix a planned 2.1 percent pay raise that was to take effect in January. The freeze doesn t affect military personnel, who are scheduled to receive a 2.6 percent raise in 2019.
        
           This is just pouring salt into the wound,  Tony Reardon, who is president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said in a statement.  It is shocking that federal employees are taking yet another financial hit. As if missed paychecks and working without pay were not enough, now they have been told that they don t even deserve a modest pay increase. 
        
          In a letter to congressional leaders in August, Trump characterized the planned pay raises as  inappropriate,  saying that  Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases.  Despite Trump s statement though there is still a possibility federal workers will get a pay raise next year, notes the Washington Post. Sen. Chris Van Hollen has said that the issue of pay raises  should be the first order of business  when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3.
        
          As the shutdown entered an eighth day Saturday, Trump made it clear he is no closer to reaching a deal with Democrats.  I am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security,  Trump tweeted Saturday morning.

SLATE,https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/fda-government-shutdown-routine-food-inspections.html,"
          The Food and Drug Administration, which oversees 80 percent of the U.S. s food supply, has ceased all routine inspections of domestic food-processing facilities as hundreds of food inspectors are furloughed because of the government shutdown.
        
          The FDA normally conducts about 160 routine inspections per week, but FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told the Washington Post that a legal guidance from the 2013 shutdown precludes the FDA from conducting regular inspections during budget shortfalls.  We are doing what we can to mitigate any risk to consumers through the shutdown,  he said.
        
          So what exact safeguards are we losing and how much do they matter?
        
          The suspension of routine inspections will most directly impact the FDA s preventative functions like evaluating the need for recalls. Its outbreak-detection and drug-testing operations should continue unaffected.
        
          Routine inspections typically involve an FDA official visiting a facility and checking for visual indicators of unsanitary conditions, such as animal feces, and general disorder. Inspectors will also interview employees and managers and take environmental swabs and product samples.
        
           Depending on the level of infraction or problem that s detected, you could potentially trigger a recall,  says Patrick Baur, a postdoctoral fellow at UCñBerkeley s Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management.  Recalls of that nature are preventative and hopefully happen before anybody gets sick. 
        
          FDA food inspectors responded to a number of high-profile food contamination emergencies last year, including two multi-state E. coli outbreaks linked to tainted romaine lettuce and a large-scale salmonella outbreak linked to cage-free eggs.
        
          As long as the shutdown persists, America s food supply chain will generally be less equipped to prevent these types of outbreaks. Gottlieb has said that he is attempting to bring back food inspectors by next week to visit facilities that process high-risk foodstuffs like seafood, soft cheeses, and vegetables.
        
          One of the main problems with this stopgap measure is that the FDA has not publicly enumerated everything it considers high-risk.  [The FDA] was supposed to have issued regulations for how they determined and dealt with high-risk facilities,  says Jaydee Hanson, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety.  They didn t get that done,  as is required under the Food Safety Modernization Act. Without clear high-risk determinations, it s unclear whether the FDA will bring inspectors to check on foods like melons, which have a history of listeria contamination.
        
          Baur additionally suggested that consigning inspectors to do their work without pay may pose a morale issue with a job that is already taxing. Indeed, inspectors are often not well paid, incur many out-of-pocket expenses, and have to be on the road for long stretches of time.  The human toll of requiring inspectors to work without getting paid raises real public safety questions,  says Baur.  How long are they going to be able to do their jobs well under those pretty horrendous working conditions? 
        
          For the time being, average food consumers can only really sit back and hope that the shutdown ends soon. Hanson says that he isn t telling anyone to take steps like avoiding salads at this time, but adds that he s personally decided to abstain due to the food inspection suspension.
        
          Baur argues that it s difficult for people to try to determine what is and isn t safe to eat given the current lack of inspections.  The safety of the nation s food supply is something that has to be handled at a systemic level,  he says.  It s just completely unpractical and frankly impossible to expect individuals to manage that on their own.  He is also concerned that ceasing routine inspections may erode public faith in food safety systems.  The more pernicious effect of this shutdown is to add to the natural anxiety about whether or not we can trust our food.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/government-shutdown-border-wall-republicans-congress-trump.html,"
          President Donald Trump has shut down much of the federal government to make Congress pay for a border wall. His position is foolish, because a wall won t work. It s dishonest, because he promised that Mexico would pay for the wall. It s destructive, because he has taken government employees hostage. And it s unpopular.
        
          Trump s standoff has put congressional Republicans in a box. So they re pretending there s nothing they can do about it. The president is dug in, they say, and Democrats have to deal with him. But that s not true. Republicans in Congress could reopen the government tomorrow. They re ducking their duty and hiding their cowardice.
        
          On Thursday, Democrats were sworn in as the new majority in the House of Representatives. They passed bills to reopen the government without addressing the wall. But Republicans didn t join them. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, said the Democratic bills were pointless because Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, wouldn t let his colleagues vote on them.  Leader McConnell has said he s not bringing anything up that s not going to become law,  said McCarthy. Rep. Liz Cheney, the chair of the House Republican Conference, dismissed the Democrats  legislation as a stunt because  it won t get taken up in the Senate. 
        
          Why won t McConnell take up these bills? Because Trump won t sign them.  The Senate will not waste its time  on any bill that  the president will not sign,  McConnell decreed on Wednesday. Two days later, McConnell stipulated,  Any viable compromise will need to carry the endorsement of the president before it receives a vote in either house of Congress.  The Democrats  legislation to reopen government was just  time-wasting,  said McConnell, because the administration had already said Trump would veto it.
        
          So McCarthy has passed the buck to McConnell, and McConnell has passed the buck to Trump. McConnell says the matter is out of his hands, because you can t enact laws without the president s consent. On Friday, McConnell lectured Democrats in civics.  Making laws takes a presidential signature,  he told them.  We all learned that in grade school.  Other Republican senators agree. Unless  the president agrees to sign a bill,  says Sen. Susan Collins, it  won t become law. 
        
          That s not true. Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution says bills passed by the House and Senate must go to the president. At that point, they can become law in either of two ways. One is that the president signs them. The other is that he vetoes them, but they re  repassed by two thirds  of each chamber.
        
          The Senate has already proved it has enough votes to override a veto. On Dec. 19, McConnell brought up legislation to fund the government through February, with no money for the wall. Senators passed that bill by voice vote and without dissent. Then Trump made a stink about the wall, and the House at that point still controlled by Republicans added wall money to the bill. Senate Democrats refused to support the wall money, and that produced the current standoff. When House Democrats took over and brought up legislation similar to what the Senate had passed money to fund the government but not the wall 234 Democrats voted yes. To produce a two-thirds majority, House Republicans only need to supply 56 more votes. That s less than 30 percent of their caucus.
        
          Republicans know they should do this. They know that a wall, even if you believe in it, isn t the kind of thing for which you should shut down the government. You can always open the government and then fight for the wall, as you would for any other appropriation. But they don t have the guts to defy Trump. So they re hiding behind the pretense that they understand the ways of the world  making laws takes a presidential signature  and that Democrats are naÔve. Last week on the Senate floor, McConnell said five times that bills opposed by Trump wouldn t be considered, since, by definition, they weren t  serious.  He called them  show votes,   posturing,  and  political theater. 
        
          Republicans are also hiding behind Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. On Dec. 22, during a debate about funding the government, Schumer said  the president must publicly support and say he will sign an agreement before it gets a vote in either chamber.  McConnell and McCarthy claim that this statement supports their refusal to consider legislation opposed by Trump. They re lying. In his speech, Schumer explained that he was advocating a constraint on the president, not on Congress.  Repeatedly, the president has privately agreed to a deal with congressional leaders, only to reverse himself when criticized by the far right,  said Schumer.  We can t have another situation when the president signals support at first but then reverses himself. 
        
          If Republican leaders agreed with Trump s position, you d expect them to defend it on the merits. But they don t, because it s so nonsensical that even Trump can t defend it. On Friday, a reporter asked him why departments that had nothing to do with border security should stay closed while Congress debated the wall. Trump couldn t think of a reason. He said he just didn t feel like it:  We want to do it all at one time. We don t want to take it in pieces. We just don t want to do that.  Another reporter asked Trump why he wasn t building the wall with money from Mexico, as he had promised, instead of demanding money from taxpayers.  Because I didn t have to,  the president replied.
        
          Republicans also know Trump s position is a loser. In polls, Americans blame him for the shutdown, oppose a  spending bill that includes funding for a wall on the southern US border,  and oppose  shutting down the federal government until Congress approves funding for the US-Mexico border wall.  Kellyanne Conway, Trump s counselor and polling adviser, is trying to dump the word wall, which she knows has become unpopular, and Trump s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, complains that Democrats are playing hardball  because they think the president is paying a price politically.  House and Senate Republicans don t want to pay the same price. So they feign helplessness.
        
          Trump plans to make his case in a prime-time TV address on Tuesday. But he, too, claims to be a prisoner of events. On Sunday, referring to the wall, he pleaded:  We have to have it. Gotta have it. We have no choice.   You think I like doing this? I don t like doing this. But we have no choice. 
        
          Wrong. We do have a choice. So do McConnell, McCarthy, and all their Republican members. They can reopen the government, with or without Trump s consent. If they don t, that s on them.

          As the partial government shutdown stretches into its third week, the National Mall in Washington, D.C., now resembles a ghost town. The Mall is home to a host of government-funded Smithsonian museums that normally make it a bustling public space. Though some of the museums managed to stay open over the holidays with funding reserves, all 21 of the Smithsonian facilities ultimately had to close last week. Pretty much the only souls roaming the Mall as of Monday were disappointed tourists.
        
          While the shutdown is no doubt affecting government workers and food stamp recipients far more acutely, it s also hampering the tourism industry in D.C., which has had to find workarounds for many in-demand attractions that are now inaccessible.
        
          Over the course of a brisk and overcast morning, I staked out the entrances of the Museum of National History and the Air and Space Museum to speak with tourists who were apparently unaware of the closures. I saw roughly two dozen people try and fail to enter the buildings.
        
          Most of these would-be visitors followed the same routine. First, they d ascend the stairs and come face-to-face with the white placards announcing the museums  closures. Their bodies would deflate, and some would cuss under their breaths, while others would let out a short wail. Then, in the off chance that the sign had been placed there in error, they d try opening the door. When that didn t work, they d peer through the darkened glass to check for signs of activity or, perhaps, Night at the Museumñtype shenanigans. Finally, since they d already made the trip, they d take a picture of the shuttered building. A couple people even posed with the  We apologize for the inconvenience  sign.
        
          In order to better understand my subjects, I tried this routine myself. I ve got to say, it really does bruise the spirit. There s nothing quite like having your hopes dashed upon tugging on a locked door.
        
          The people I spoke to expressed varying levels of disappointment. Daniel told me that he had traveled from Argentina just to see the museums. When asked what he planned to do for the rest of his vacation, he responded, morosely,  Probably stay in my hotel.  He plans to come back every day before he leaves in the event that one opens. When I told him that the government would need to re-open for that to happen, he said,  I don t know. I ll still try. 
        
          Bak, from Georgia, said he and his family had tried to visit the museum on Sunday. He came back thinking that the museum might just have been closed because it was the weekend.  We re disappointed because, so far, we ve only been able to see the Bureau of Engraving,  he said, adding that they were leaving for home later Monday.
        
          Most of the people I spoke to didn t have strong opinions one way or the other on the shutdown, and some didn t even seem aware that it was going on. Asked for his thoughts on the current political impasse, Nick from Pennsylvania said,  I just want this museum to open up honestly.  Ron, visiting from New Jersey, said,  It just seems kind of silly to me   like a made-up problem. 
        
          Angie, who came to the Air and Space Museum with a bus full of Chinese tourists, told me that they now plan to spend most of their time at the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials. The Washington Post reports that tour groups have been frequenting privately owned museums like the Newseum and Madame Tussauds, while local businesses have been putting on events to try to increase foot traffic.
        
          Outside the National History Museum, I saw a woman begin the long, involved process of transferring her two toddlers from their car seats to a stroller. As she was swaddling them for warmth, I considered approaching her to say that she d be unable to enter, but I decided that it might be too presumptuous. In retrospect, I should have said something because the woman, Janelle, later told me that she had driven 50 minutes from Virginia just to see the museum and had already paid for two hours of parking.
        
           I feel so bad that I didn t check the website,  she said.  I should have known that the government shutdown closes everything. 
        
          She said that one of her tenants is a government employee and had asked for a rent extension, because a paycheck wouldn t be arriving for the foreseeable future.  I can t say no,  she said.
        
          Janelle asked to use my phone to get directions to the International Spy Museum. When she found out that it was closed for the month, she threw up her hands and yelled,  OK, babies, let s go home.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/senate-shutdown-bills-votes-fail-border-wall.html,"
          The Senate voted Thursday on its first two bills to end the government shutdown. They both  failed,  in the sense that neither earned the 60 votes they needed to advance. These failures don t, however, mean that progress wasn t made. It took a month, but Congress has finally reached the offer-and-counteroffer stage of the process, even if those offers and counteroffers are still walls apart.
        
          The vote counts on the two failed bills one drawn up by the Trump administration and the other already passed by the House brought unfortunate news for the White House, which apparently didn t know which measure would get more support. Surprise! It was not the White House s bill.
        
          That White House bill would have granted temporary protections to existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals beneficiaries and Temporary Protected Status holders in exchange for $5.7 billion in wall money and further restrictions on asylum claims. It earned 50 yeas to 47 nays. One Democrat, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, supported it, while two Republicans, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and Utah Sen. Mike Lee, opposed it. The Democrats  preferred option was a clean extension of government funding through Feb. 8, and it only  failed  52 to 44. Six Republicans Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Georgia Sen. Jonny Isakson, and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney crossed the aisle to support that, with no Democratic defections.
        
          The disparity in support between the two measures shows that Democrats are holding their line more successfully than Republicans are holding theirs. Other evidence of that: Republican senators sniping at Vice President Mike Pence, during the lunch immediately preceding the votes, to end this mess.
        
          There was almost a sense of relief among senators after the votes. The process of tossing out a couple of options at least killed off some lingering talking points, and could provide space for the  real  discussions to end the shutdown. If it wasn t clear enough, the votes proved that Democrats will not give Trump his full $5.7 billion for the border wall in exchange for some tepid concessions. And Democrats  insistence that if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell just put a clean funding bill on the floor, it would get a veto-proof majority? That also proved to be off by 15 votes.
        
          So what now?
        
          South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said the failed votes were useful in that senators have  both seen what the original positions are; we both know where the votes are at.  Reopening the government is now a matter of  the leaders getting together and coming up with something they can present to the president. 
        
          That, Rounds said, would probably be a stop-gap bill similar to previous continuing resolutions, but at least it could be open to amendments for border security. Trump has rejected ideas like this in the past, though, since amendment votes don t guarantee him any money for the wall. Why would he change his mind now?
        
           Well, so far, he s the only one of the two  the other being House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  who s made a step forward. So if he makes one more step forward, he actually becomes viewed more as the adult in the room between those two. And if Speaker Pelosi refuses to do it at all, I think public opinion starts to turn it against her,  Rounds said. Pelosi, who s pretty good with numbers, doesn t see it that way.
        
          South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham also believes a short-term bill is the way out, and he has for several weeks. After the votes, he spoke to the president to pitch his idea for the umpteenth time.
        
          White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders seemed to be on board with the idea, though she did add that the down payment for the wall would have to be  large.  In other words, the White House is still in denial. But at least it s recognizing the need to negotiate down from $5.7 billion.
        
          Meanwhile, Sens. Richard Shelby and Pat Leahy the chair and vice chair of the Appropriations Committee told reporters that if they  were designated   by our respective caucuses to work this out, I bet we d do it before 6 o clock.  They did, after all, already work out a border security agreement within their committee last summer.
        
          But Shelby and Leahy enjoy no such designation. Instead, they, Rounds, Graham, and every other senator in the building were waiting on a meeting between McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, which took place in McConnell s office immediately after the votes, to decide next steps.
        
          Schumer left after about 30 minutes. He was grinning either because McConnell had moved in his direction, or because he was excited to blow off a pack of reporters.
        
          Did they make any progress?
        
           We re talking. 
        
          Do they have a deal?
        
           We re talking. 
        
          It went on like this for another half-dozen or so questions.
        
          They re talking.
        
          Progress.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/prevent-government-shutdowns.html,"
          As we enter the 20th day of federal workers being unable to go to their jobs, contractors being unable to get paid, and those reliant on federal services being unable to access them, all because the president is unyielding in his demand that a physical barrier be constructed on the southern border, it is worth considering: Isn t there a better way?
        
          Of course there is. Various options exist for eliminating government shutdowns permanently, some of which have been kicked around for years. But there are reasons why our government has not adopted a more hostage-proof protocol for itself.
        
          This government shutdown marks the third, and by far the lengthiest, funding gap of the past year. The shortest occurred in February, when Sen. Rand Paul had a conniption fit on the Senate floor during a funding deadline, albeit one that was over by the time most federal workers woke up. Let s forget that one. The  weekend shutdown  that preceded came when Democrats refused to support a funding bill without a path forward to protect Dreamers from deportation. The previous gap before that came in 2013, when a hard-right faction in Congress sought to eliminate funding for the Affordable Care Act.
        
          In the cases of the current shutdown, the  weekend shutdown,  and the 2013 shutdown, the pattern has been the same: An actor or bloc of actors has made a promise to its base that it cannot obtain. As a show of theatrics, it resists funding the government in order to show the base that it is willing to  fight.  And throughout all of these shutdowns, the group left feeling the pain is the millions of people employed by, on contract with, or reliant on the federal government. Shutdowns are disruptive to the economy, and the very mechanics of shutting down and reopening the government can run into the billions of dollars.
        
          If you look at the events that led to the current shutdown, it s quite clear who s at fault. When the White House and congressional leaders couldn t reach a full spending agreement before the deadline, congressional leaders did what they were supposed to do: punt through a short-term continuing resolution that would fund the government at existing levels and give them six weeks or so to reach an agreement. The Senate passed the continuing resolution, and the House was prepared to as well, until Trump changed his mind and said he wouldn t sign it. He broke off in order to show he would  fight. 
        
          One remedy for ending government shutdowns, then, would be to effectively remove the hostage-taking power from any one party. This would happen through what s called an automatic continuing resolution.
        
          Such proposals, numerous versions of which have been introduced and debated over the years, essentially say that if Congress doesn t pass a spending bill by deadline, the government automatically enters into a continuing resolution. Under a system like this, it wouldn t have mattered that the House Freedom Caucus, Rush Limbaugh, and Ann Coulter convinced the president overnight to oppose the stopgap bill and  fight  for the wall. The federal government would have automatically kept running at previously agreed-upon levels until negotiators came up with something better.
        
          The fear about entering a state of automatic funding, though, is that Congress might never get out of it. If members know that there s an easier path than voting on difficult, deeply compromised budget agreements, they will take the easier path. And operating under CRs in the long term is a terrible form of governance, as spending bills written one year wouldn t meet the spending needs of the next year or the next year, or the next year.
        
          Even worse would be a scenario where the automatic CR legislation is written in a way that gives one party in particular a reason to prefer it over passing a budget. This is why recent automatic CR proposals, mostly introduced by Republicans, have turned off Democrats. In 2013, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman and thenñOklahoma Rep. James Lankford introduced automatic CR legislation that would enact cuts the longer the automatic CR was in place. This would have incentivized some Republicans to never lift a finger and watch as government spending whittled down.
        
          More than five years later, Lankford, now a senator, is still pushing for some version of an automatic CR. He conceded in a brief interview on Tuesday that his past proposals have made the issue more  complicated  than it needs to be and that he understood Democratic objections to versions involving cuts. His most recent proposal, then, which he introduced as a member of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform, wouldn t include the cuts. It would be neutral. And in order to ensure that it wouldn t replace budgeting forever, it would state that  Congress members cannot travel, Cabinet members cannot travel, while there s a continuing resolution. No one can travel until this is resolved. 
        
          When I spoke with Democratic members, they emphasized that the goal of the committee was to move away from CRs altogether and toward completing full budgets and appropriations bills on time. The automatic CR proposals, House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth told me, seemed like  the easy way out.  They dropped the idea.
        
           The feeling was that we should try to develop procedures that prevented a CR, that a CR was an outcome to be avoided rather than to be sought,  Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse told me.  Of course, now that one s in a shutdown, one has a different perspective about a CR. 
        
          The Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform threw its hands up and disbanded in late November, unable to agree on any reforms.
        
          Another way to eliminate shutdowns, though, would be to look directly at the specific law that requires them.
        
          The era of shutdowns didn t begin until the early 1980s. There had been funding gaps before, with many during the late 1970s, but the government still stayed up and running. People went to work. That a funding deadline had passed, for example, wasn t Congress expressing its opinion that the whole government should cease operations.
        
          The  inventor  of the shutdown was President Jimmy Carter s attorney general, Benjamin Civiletti. He issued an opinion in 1980 strictly applying the Antideficiency Act a series of laws dating back to 1870 that generally forbids federal officials from spending money that hasn t been appropriated to funding gaps. In a funding gap, Civiletti s memo stated, agencies and departments would need to suspend all operations except those where there is  some reasonable and articulable connection between the function to be performed and the safety of human life or the protection of property. 
        
          Civiletti s opinion was shocking in its rigidity.
        
           The opinion of the attorney general, at the time, was quite surprising,  Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore Law School and former House deputy general counsel, told me.  No one thought that agencies had to close down just because there was a short gap between appropriations. Civiletti himself had to eat some of his words because he had gone so far in disrupting agency operations. 
        
          Indeed, Civiletti issued another opinion in 1981 that offered some additional flexibility and exception categories for  essential  personnel. Although the Antideficiency Act and Civiletti s opinion have been tweaked over the years, that 1981 opinion that nonessential personnel must be furloughed and nonessential operations shut down is still the basis of government shutdowns.
        
          Tiefer, though, believes that Civiletti s own effort to  eat his words,  and allow for more exceptions to the Antideficiency Act, shows that there s plenty of space for either Congress or the Justice Department to amend it further.
        
           I think that the shutdown was largely born from the attorney general opinion, and that it could either be amended or there could be a different opinion by a current attorney general,  Tiefer said.  His backing off is an example, or an illustration, of what we could do now. 
        
          So why isn t it done now? Why does Congress, when it has multiple available options to eliminate the threat of a shutdown, not do so?
        
          Because Congress, in its Congress-y way, likes the threat of a shutdown, and likes the way things have worked since the Civiletti opinions.
        
          The threat of the ever- looming  shutdown raises the stakes of inaction and serves as a forcing mechanism for parties to come to agreement. Individual members can defend votes on vast, sometimes ugly spending legislation as  necessary to prevent a shutdown.  It creates  must-pass  vehicles for legislation that leaders and members can lard up with extraneous bills that couldn t pass on their own. This threat, typically, works, and funding gaps were much less frequent and shorter in duration in the years after the Civiletti memo. When a group did try to weaponize a shutdown, as Speaker Newt Gingrich did in the mid-1990s, the experience was so painful that there wasn t another one for 17 years.
        
          But with frequent shutdowns returning, and leaders seemingly more willing to bear the consequences of a shutdown than they used to be, could we soon be nearing the time for shutdown reform?
        
           I think this shutdown is a powerful call for reform,  Tiefer said.  On the other hand, that depends on what conclusion the public draws. If the president s supporters end up still agreeing that it was right to shut down the government, then you could see big shutdowns again in the not-too-distant future. 
        
           It s possible that there might be more appetite for doing something to make it harder for the government to shut down,  Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told me.  But at the same time, when you think about a kind of coalition that would be needed to pass such a reform, in the current political environment, I m not sure I see how Democrats and Republicans would come together to do that. 
        
          If the current shutdown continues much longer, the crisis could be useful, at least, to determine how long a shutdown needs to last before members decide it s time to eliminate them.

As a national parks scholar, I rely on almost daily Google alerts to draw my attention to the local or park-specific media outlets most often reporting wildlife sightings, wildfires, and top five, 10, or 25 lists of the best or worst or most iconic parks in the nation. But in the past 25 days, I ve not needed alerts.

Four are believed to have died by suicide, while three more have been lost due to accidents, including a 14-year-old girl who fell from an overlook at Horseshoe Bend in Arizona s Glenn Canyon Recreation Area on Christmas Eve. In response, Rep. Raul Grijalva, a Democrat and the chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, declared that  [a]ny National Park Service unit where a staffing or funding shortfall has endangered public safety or put natural, cultural, or historic resources at risk should be closed for the duration of this shutdown. 
        
          Grijalva was careful and correct to note something that is easy to miss in all the coverage: that it s unclear whether any of these deaths were caused directly by the impacts of the shutdown. Mike Litterst, the National Park Service s acting chief spokesperson and chief of public affairs, reports that the NPS sees an average of six deaths per week, including accidents and medical incidents. The ripples of the shutdown may have played a role, but seven reported deaths between Dec. 24 and Jan. 5 are not statistically out of the ordinary for national parks. Government shutdown or not, visitors to parks always face the potentially dangerous realities of wilderness exposure when they engage in backpacking, hiking, mountaineering, and other recreational activities that can pose serious risks like falling, drowning, or wildlife encounters. But it s worth noting that you re more likely to experience a car accident or a heart attack in a park than to have a deadly encounter with a grizzly bear. (Since Yellowstone was created in 1872, there have only been eight recorded fatalities from grizzly bear attacks.) And overall, not counting suicides, your chances of dying in a national park sit around 1 in 2 million.
        
          Although not statistically unusual, these deaths should call our attention to the dangers park visitors can encounter, as well as the threats visitors pose to park resources each heightened by the absence of park personnel. By keeping parks open, the Trump administration has risked the safety of people and parks. Perhaps it sought to avoid the negative press that occurred throughout the 2013 government shutdown during which President Obama ordered all parks closed, barring visitors from entry. Instead, Trump s Department of the Interior has raised our awareness to just how complicated it is to run parks and the park system. Beyond the park service s famous park rangers, there are public safety enforcement officers, facilities and janitorial staff, wildlife specialists, educators, and administrators. Without them, the parks are less safe, less clean, less educational, and less protected from crowds. Until the government can develop a plan to fully fund the return of these indispensable public servants, the parks should remain closed for the protection of our parks and the people who love them.
        
          In December, the Department of the Interior released a contingency plan (later replaced by this January version) stating that parks would remain accessible to visitors. Even so,  parks may not use the presence of visitors in the park to justify higher staffing numbers than approved during previous shutdowns.  Some states have intervened, providing funds for various park functions in places like Grand Canyon, Arches, Bryce Canyon, and Zion national parks. But in general, visitors are crowding into parks without the oversight of park officials. Though tragedy is still rare, the shutdown may have stunted parks  ability to respond to visitor emergencies. During one of my research-related park visits, I witnessed the swift and careful response typical of national park officials in the occurrence of a death: Public safety personnel act calmly and decisively to investigate and mitigate any remaining threats, while park leadership respectfully report the tragedy. But that response isn t possible if adequate staff aren t present. For example, in late December, rangers responded to a 911 call from a man who later died from his head injury. Several days later, the death had still not been reported by park authorities. Andrew MuÒoz, a public affairs officer for the National Park Service, told Outside that the shutdown was to blame:  The incident remains under investigation, which is taking longer than usual because of the shutdown. 
        
          Though the shutdown s effect on public safety in national parks isn t clear, it s impossible to deny that park visitors are leaving waste and ruin in their stead damage that the parks are helpless to address with more than 21,000 furloughed employees. The growing heaps of trash have inspired some volunteer groups to clean up Yellowstone, Everglades, and Joshua Tree national parks, among others. Shining spotlight on such efforts, Democratic Reps. Jackie Speier and Jared Huffman, both from California, volunteered to clean the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. They later hauled their trash bags to the White House to illustrate the overflowing restrooms and trashed campgrounds plaguing parks.
        
          To cope with the maintenance and sanitation nightmare, the superintendent of Joshua Tree National Park decided to temporarily close the park s gates. Shortly after the Jan. 8 announcement, however, the acting secretary of the Department of the Interior, David Bernhardt, authorized the use of entrance fee money to fund park maintenance crews. The move has been controversial. In a public statement, Theresa Pierno, president and CEO of the National Parks Conservation Association, equated the use of park fees to robbery. Park fees are meant to be used for visitor services as opposed to operations and maintenance, and thus the NPCA has recently demanded an investigation into the acting secretary s decision. Regardless of this recent use of fee funds, precious park resources have already been irreversibly destroyed at the hands of reckless visitors. In Joshua Tree National Park, several of the park s namesake trees have been vandalized. In some instances, trees have been chopped down to make way for illegal and damaging off-roading into the desert landscape.
        
          In a 1953 Harper s essay,  Let s Close the National Parks,  American historian Bernard DeVoto argued that the public shouldn t be allowed in the parks until Congress could adequately restore parks after wartime neglect and underfunding:
        
          Now, for its own protection, let us close Joshua Tree and all of its kin. In 2019, political divisiveness and government shutdown have prompted parks  problems, but the need is the same. As in DeVoto s imagination, park closure may cause local communities to feel the painful loss of tourism dollars, while families will bemoan canceled holidays. But these temporary losses must be held in balance with the long-term health and protection of parks, as well as the safety of park visitors. Until Congress can take responsibility and restore funds, let us close the national parks.

          In the midst of a federal government shutdown, it s easy to get caught up in the short-term consequences: the federal workers going without pay, the long lines at airport security, the overflowing toilets at national parks. But the long-term effects may be even more devastating, at least when it comes to cybersecurity and the problems could affect more than just the government.
        
          At the moment, many of the Department of Homeland Security employees responsible for civilian cybersecurity efforts, including threat analysis and sharing information with private industry, have been furloughed. But even if the shutdown ends soon, it may scare talented people away from taking government cybersecurity jobs which are already a struggle to fill. According to a report published on Dec. 31 by Duo Security s newsletter Decipher, the shutdown could affect more than just the government s own online security posture. It could, and perhaps already has, weaken private enterprise security as well, argues report author Fahmida Rashid. Rashid points out that nearly 85 percent of the National Institute of Standards and Technology s staff members are furloughed during the shutdown, a terrifying number given the central importance of NIST security and privacy standards for not just government agencies but also many private companies.
        
          NIST develops, publishes, and updates several important documents that give guidelines for securing computer systems. Most are available through its Computer Security Resource Center, which is currently offline (though, interestingly, it is still possible to access their cybersecurity framework). NIST standards cover everything from what kind of encryption you should use to how you should authenticate user accounts, store sensitive data, monitor network intrusions, and respond to security incidents. By law, only federal agencies are required to follow the security guidelines issued by NIST, but many other organizations also rely on them as reputable, comprehensive, and well-vetted recommendations for best practices in computer security.
        
          Several of those standards can still be located on other websites that have published PDFs of the popular documents, but some of them aren t up to date. (Also, with the NIST website down, it can be tough to remember which versions are actually the most recent ones.) And while the website outages are (hopefully!) temporary, for organizations making decisions about security or encryption during this shutdown, not having access to NIST standards could have long-lasting consequences.
        
          Meanwhile, over at the Department of Homeland Security the branch of government responsible for governing all civilian cybersecurity efforts 45 percent of employees at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are furloughed, as are 45 percent of DHS s analysis and operations staff, Rashid reports. That s a blow to companies that rely on DHS for threat intelligence and information sharing, but it s also a problem for the department, which has worked hard to try to build relationships with industry and persuade the private sector that it is a useful and knowledgeable partner when it comes to cybersecurity. That was a hard sell even before DHS was forced to put a large portion of its cyber operations and analysis teams on furlough the shutdown will just reinforce many firms  sense that DHS is too slow, bureaucratic, and inept to be an effective resource when it comes to cybersecurity.
        
          Depressingly, the shutdown probably will make the federal government less effective when it comes to securing its own networks and helping others secure theirs not just because skilled workers are home on furlough right now but also because many of those workers are probably (understandably) looking for other jobs. And, as Joseph Marks points out in the Washington Post, they will probably find other jobs. There s no shortage of openings for cybersecurity workers in the private sector, and those jobs often come with better pay, more flexibility, and more perks (unlimited vacation time! free snacks! in-house laundry! ping-pong tables in the office!) than federal government jobs.
        
          It s already a challenge for the U.S. government to recruit cybersecurity talent. In February, the Government Accountability Office published a report titled  Cybersecurity Workforce: Urgent Need for DHS to Take Actions to Identify Its Position and Critical Skill Requirements  that revealed that DHS had not even identified all of its vacant cybersecurity positions, much less filled them.
        
          How much worse could the situation get after an extended shutdown? At the very best, the federal government will almost certainly lose some of its most talented and experienced workers in this area, many of whom were only working for the government in the first place because they believed that the work they were doing there was important and worthwhile. Once they are forced to stop doing that work, why stay? At worst, the shutdown will deter younger professionals and students finishing school from looking at entry-level positions in the federal government for fear of dysfunction and instability and it will be years and years before government agencies are able to recruit highly skilled teams of cybersecurity professionals.
        
          Stability and the opportunity to do work that really matters have always been the strongest draws of federal cybersecurity jobs for people who could find more highly paid work in the private sector. The shutdown undermines both of those appeals and discourages those people who are in government primarily because of their sense of national loyalty and desire to make a difference.
        
          Less than a year ago, DHS and the Department of Commerce presented a report to President Donald Trump on the cybersecurity workforce shortage (a report I can t link you to at the moment because it was hosted you guessed it on the NIST website) per his 2017 executive order on cybersecurity. The report highlighted the shortage of cybersecurity workers in the country and especially cautioned that the government would face challenges recruiting talent in this area due to its pay scale, arguing,  The seriousness of the Nation s cybersecurity workforce gaps merits a high-level initiative to raise awareness and create a sense of urgency about the importance of growing and sustaining a world-class cybersecurity workforce.  But so far, at least, the government seems determined to make its problem worse, not better.

          President Donald Trump s incoming acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is not holding his breath for a quick resolution that could lead the government to reopen quickly.  It s very possible that the shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,  Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday during the second day of the shutdown that so far has no end in sight. Although there had been a bit of negotiation and back-and-forth over the past few days,  I don t think things are going to move very quickly here the next couple of days,  Mulvaney said.
        
          In an interview with ABC s This Week, Mulvaney made sure to emphasize that Trump remained determined to obtain wall funding from Congress.  The president s not going to not accept money for a border wall. Now, what one people call a wall and another person might call a fence,  he said. But Mulvaney did note Trump is willing to accept less than his initial demand for $5 billion. The latest White House offer was $2.5 billion for border security, including new fencing, a Democratic aide told the Washington Post.
        
          In one portion of the interview, Mulvaney seemed to try to downplay the importance of the wall, only to have Trump contradict him quickly on Twitter.  The president has made it very clear, however, that he is willing to discuss a larger immigration solution,  Mulvaney said.  The wall does not solve all of our problems. A border fence does not solve all of our problems, because so many of our laws are broken.  Trump, however, took to Twitter to tout the importance of having  a Wall or Barrier  at the border.  Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!  Trump wrote.
        
          Democrats for now appear to be holding strong on opposing the president s demands with Sen. Chris Coons saying on CBS that the president simply won t get the $5 billion for a wall that he is demanding.  There is frankly no path towards his getting five billion dollars in American taxpayer money to meet his campaign promise of a big, beautiful wall with Mexico,  the senator from Delaware said.  There is a path towards our responsibly appropriating about $1.3 billion for border security.

          Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has become the latest wealthy member of Trump s cabinet to express confusion over the concept of financial hardship.
        
          In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Ross was asked about the economic and financial effects of the government shutdown on furloughed and unpaid workers. He insisted the effects weren t that bad. When asked about federal employees who have flocked to food pantries after missing a paycheck, Ross expressed skepticism.
        
          He emphasized that because the government guaranteed workers they would eventually get paid, banks and credit unions would make credit available to them.  So there really is not a good excuse why there really should be a liquidity crisis,  he said.
        
          Some banks and credit unions have been offering low- or no-interest payroll advances and loans for federal workers, and a fair number federal employees have likely seen this as a useful option for mitigating the financial stress of the shutdown. But getting a loan can be a long and difficult process, particularly for those who have little experience with financial institutions or those without strong credit ratings (who may instead feel forced to turn to more predatory or high-interest lenders). Many Americans are also reluctant to take on debt if they can avoid it. And, as Ross acknowledged, some might not find the idea of paying interest ideal. Ross, whose net worth is estimated at $700 million, did not see these reasons as real:  [T]he idea that it s paycheck or zero is not a really valid idea,  he said.
        
          Democrats seized the opportunity to remind the public of the administration s inability to relate to middle- and working-class concerns.  Is this the  Let them eat cake  kind of attitude?  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said later in response.  Or call your father for money? 
        
          Sen. Chuck Schumer also criticized Ross, saying his comments  reveal the administration s callous indifference toward the federal workers it is treating as pawns.  He added:  Secretary Ross, they just can t call their stock broker and ask them to sell some of their shares. 
        
          Ross was not alone Thursday in missing the mark on the shutdown s effects on workers. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters that federal workers were  volunteering  by coming to work without pay. When a reporter challenged Kudlow, he responded with frustration:  You know what, I m not even going to go there. You know what I m saying. It s very clear  .  He continued:
        
          The comments echo to some degree the baseless claims made by Trump (who also said he could  relate  to federal workers who couldn t pay their bills) that he had heard widespread support from furloughed employees, who said they would happily delay their paychecks for the sake of the border wall funding. Others have made similarly tactless statements: White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said two weeks ago that furloughed employees might be  better off  because they are taking what he described as essentially a vacation. Lara Trump, the president s daughter-in-law and former campaign aide, said this week in a message to furloughed workers to  stay strong  and that their financial hardship was  for the future of our country.  She reassured them,  It s not fair to you, and we all get that, but this is so much bigger than any one person. 
        
          Roughly 800,000 federal employees are furloughed or working without pay during the shutdown, and hundreds of thousands of government contractors are likely to never receive any retroactive pay. Many federal employees are set to soon miss their second paycheck of the shutdown, which is now on its 34th day.
        
          As for Ross: His Commerce department currently lacks funding, and most of the more than 45,000 employees who work for him are facing down another paycheck of $0.00. But Thursday, he wanted to make it clear that talk of damage to the national economy and harm to the workers themselves was exaggerated.  Remember this,  he said on CNBC.  They are eventually going to be paid.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/government-shutdown-furloughed-workers-crowdfund-reddit-advice.html,"
          The current partial government shutdown is set to become the longest in history on Saturday when it reaches 22 days. As the shutdown continues, more than 800,000 federal employees have been furloughed or expected to work without pay. As a group, these employees are missing out on approximately $1.4 billion in salary per week. People currently working are likely to be compensated when the shutdown ends, but furloughed workers will probably never have the chance to make up the lost wages.
        
          A bevy of reports have come out over the last three weeks documenting the toll the impasse in Washington has had on government workers  personal finances and the contingency measures they ve had to resort to. This week, the Washington Post reported that the Coast Guard Support Program was advising employees in a tip sheet to  consider holding a garage sale, babysitting, dog-walking or serving as a  mystery shopper.    The program also suggested that furloughed workers talk to creditors and look into tutoring on the side. The Coast Guard revoked the tip sheet after the Post s report, commenting that it does not  reflect the Coast Guard s current efforts to support our workforce during this lapse in appropriations. 
        
          Workers have become increasingly desperate in making ends meet, especially those who are living paycheck to paycheck. The Guardian reports that there are now approximately 1,000 GoFundMe fundraisers to help government employees with basic expenses like rent, food, insurance, and utilities.  Never in a million years would I have ever dreamed that I d be turning to GoFundMe asking for help, because in all honesty, I ve always felt there was probably someone else who could use the help more than my family,  one GoFundMe user wrote.  The truth is that even without the presence of a shutdown, my family still struggles, but I m usually able to make things work out, because that s what single moms do, we make things work out.  While this particular user has raised more than $5,000, the Guardian reports that the fundraisers have generally managed to raise an average of $100 each, or about $100,000 in total.
        
          Another online resource that furloughed workers have been tapping is Reddit. The subreddit r/personalfinance is now host to a  2018-19 U.S. Federal Government Shutdown Megathread  in order to consolidate the numerous entries on the topic that have been posted in the last three weeks. Users have been advising furloughed employees on how to deal with certain banks, take out loans, find temporary gig economy jobs, and ask for extensions on payments. The forum has been particularly helpful for people who face somewhat unusual conundrums in the face of the shutdown, for which general advice may not be applicable. For example, one government employee posted that the shutdown came right as he was set to make an offer on his first house. Another user said her father is a government employee who lives with her but is unable to pay rent while but still has to attend to his job. An employee at a mortgage servicer informed Redditors that the company is willing to prolong a loan, but only if a customer asks.
        
          The most upvoted post on the megathread as of Friday afternoon reads,  And if you are dealing with a federal employee (say, a park ranger during your vacation or an IRS phone support person) remember that person might not have seen a paycheck for awhile and has no clue when one will show up. Please be kind.

          You couldn t write a better ending to the House Republican majority. In the party s swan song before Democrats take control, a bloc of far-right conservatives has persuaded President Trump to threaten a veto of leadership s plan to punt the border wall debate into next year, insisting that the president  fight  now to get his $5 billion  steel slat  project.
        
          There is no plan. Dozens of members and senators have already flown home. Democrats aren t going to give Trump the wall. There is no plan.
        
          There is no plan.
        
          You ve got to give the conservatives credit. They know how to convince Trump that a path exists beyond the dead end. Wednesday, once it became clear that the continuing resolution funding the government until Feb. 8 was leadership s play, conservatives started warning Trump about the effect this would have on his base the only constituency he is capable of caring about.
        
          North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, chairman of the Freedom Caucus, warned that the  fallout  from Trump signing the CR would  start Saturday  and do  major damage  to his 2020 re-election bid. (Or everyone would just forget about it five minutes later?) The Freedom Caucus held the floor for 30 minutes Wednesday evening with a dozen members giving speeches insisting that the president resist any deal without wall funding.
        
           Mr. President, we re going to back you up,  Meadows said.  If you veto this bill, we ll be there. But more importantly the American people will be there. They ll be there to support you. Let s build the wall and make sure that we do our job in Congress. 
        
          The right-wing mediasphere, meanwhile, applied the requisite pressure from the outside. Rush Limbaugh said Trump got  less than nothing  in the bill, while Breitbart called it a  cave  on the president s part. Ann Coulter called the president  gutless  and said she wouldn t vote for him in 2020 without a wall. (Trump appeared to unfollow her on Twitter after some of these remarks.)
        
          All of this began to get to the president.
        
          And in the GOP caucus meeting Thursday, Freedom Caucus leaders and a good number of rank-and-file members objected to voting for a bill with no wall funding if they were unsure the president would sign it. They had good reason not to believe he would. Despite Vice President Mike Pence telling Senate Republicans during their Wednesday lunch that the president would sign it prompting the Senate to pass the bill Wednesday night by voice vote Mike Pence is not the president. Donald Trump is.
        
          House Speaker Paul Ryan, who really wants to get out of town, got a call from the president during the Thursday morning caucus meeting. He was later summoned to the White House alongside the rest of the House GOP leadership, as well as Meadows and fellow Freedom Caucus member Rep. Jim Jordan. When the group came out, Ryan delivered the news: Trump would not sign the CR and wants his wall money now.
        
          The president also personally informed other vital stakeholders, like Rush Limbaugh, of his position.
        
          So what now?
        
          House Republicans will likely try to pass a spending bill that does include the president s request for wall funding (as well as some disaster relief funds that some Southern members have been agitating for). This would be the bill that Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly Republicans don t have the votes for. We ll find out soon enough, but Republicans  ranks have been depleted by dozens of retiring members who haven t shown up for work this week.
        
          If that fails, Republicans could say they tried, then pass the  clean  funding bill and send it to the president s desk. If, however, the revised bill passes, it would go nowhere in the Senate. The best option for averting a shutdown, at this point, might be overriding a veto, but it s hard to imagine that many Republicans openly defying the president.
        
          Barring an overridden veto, a shutdown would last as long as Trump maintains his position that he won t sign a bill without his desired wall funding. That could be a couple of days, or it could be a couple of weeks. If it s a couple of weeks, then Nancy Pelosi will be in charge of the House, and Trump really, really won t get any wall money.
        
          There is no plan.
        
          But at least Trump has made Rush Limbaugh happy, for a little while.

          If you thought the government shutdown was only affecting Washington bureaucrats and the tone of your nightly news, try this one on for size: the FDA has significantly reduced, and in some cases stopped altogether, food inspections due to the shutdown. Might want to rethink that Chipotle burrito with extra romaine tomorrow. This bit of queasy news comes as the Food and Drug Administration has furloughed many of its 5,000 food inspectors because of the shutdown; the agency is charged with oversight of 80 percent of the country s food supply.
        
          If the idea of unchaperoned food stuffs pouring out of American food plants doesn t seem that sweet to you, fear not, the head of the FDA told the Washington Post that while, sure, he s had to suspend all routine inspections of domestic food-processing facilities, he s totally  working on a plan to bring inspectors back as early as next week to inspect facilities considered high-risk because they handle sensitive items such as seafood, soft cheese and vegetables, or have a history of problems.  Next week! What could possibly go wrong in a week? Yes, 48 million Americans get sick each year from foodborne illnesses while the FDA is on duty doing its job, but it s probably fine, right?
        
           The FDA [-] typically conducts about 160 routine food inspections a week in the United States, with about a third involving high-risk processing facilities,  FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told the Post.  The agency s inspectors look for problems such as unsanitary conditions, insect infestations, and salmonella and E. coli contamination as it did, for instance, in the recent investigations of romaine lettuce.

          It s Day 34 of the government shutdown, with no clear end in sight. The president confirmed Wednesday that the shutdown, triggered by the ongoing dispute over funds for his proposed southern border wall,  will go on for a while.  According to USA Today, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney delivered another signal that the administration is preparing for an indefinite shutdown when he asked agencies to  provide lists of programs that will be endangered if the shutdown lasts for weeks and even months more. 
        
          Hanging in the balance are such minor things as the functioning of our government and the lives of an estimated 800,000 federal workers who are about to miss their second paycheck since the shutdown started in December. While over 300,000 are completely furloughed, over half of those affected are working without pay, according to CNBC. The ongoing stalemate has wreaked havoc on these workers  household budgets, with many seeking side jobs or applying for unemployment and other forms of assistance. Here are the stories of five federal employees and contractors about how they re managing financially and whether they think the shutdown was worth the politics behind it.
        
          Interviews have been lightly edited for length and clarity.
        
          I work for NASA as a lead systems engineer, and I live in Huntsville, Alabama. I ve been furloughed since the shutdown started, since Dec. 26. I did get a full paycheck the first week of January because it was initialized before the shutdown, and they had enough funds to cover it, but we haven t gotten paid since then. My position is kind of a promotion and I just got that in December. We have a new program that we were supposed to be standing up this month, but that s obviously not essential or accepted and so that s not happening right now.
        
          I currently have three side gigs going. Gig economy, right? I m hand-writing note cards for a realtor friend, and this week I should start copy-editing a lawyer friend s book that she s almost done writing. I m also working for my mother. We were about to the point where we were going to have to hire somebody to help her at home anyway, so while the furlough lasts, she s just paying me to help her instead.
        
          In terms of bills and stuff, I ve actually been really lucky. I have my mortgage and my car payment through a local credit union that serves DOD and NASA and other federal employees. They said that they ll essentially do a skip-and-pay arrangement for 90 days, and after that they can do reduced payments. So that s helping a lot, but I ve cut out most non-essential expenses: I don t eat out, I don t go places, I don t buy anything that I don t absolutely have to have. I think it s kind of silly that this [border wall] discussion is happening while all of us are out of work. This isn t a simple discussion. They haven t been able to solve it for the last two years and so the idea of trying to solve such a complex problem in a couple of weeks doesn t make real good sense.
        
          I ve worked at the Environmental Protection Agency for about 12 years. My laboratory focuses on water distribution, waste water, and drinking water treatment practices. This is the first long shutdown I ve experienced because I was out of the country for the one in 2013. EPA s furlough started after the first week of the shutdown, and the last time I was paid was the second week of January. It was half [my usual] paycheck.
        
          I looked at the balance in my bank accounts a few days ago just to see how things were going, and I was shocked to see that I wasn t going to have a nervous breakdown, but I m definitely not going out as much. I haven t picked up a side gig yet, but I have been eyeing some moonlighting jobs, so I think I may look into taking something up next week if the shutdown continues. They would be doing some landscape design work, residential landscape design, so definitely different from what I do day in and day out, but something that I studied back in college.
        
          I haven t had to [explain the situation to bill collectors] as of yet. I think having worked for about 12 years I m in a fortunate spot to have a few months of disposable income, but that definitely wasn t meant to be used in this manner. If anything came up that would be a big expenditure, I would definitely put it to the side until the shutdown was over.
        
          I know some people or colleagues [who have been called in to work without pay], but I personally have not been. I was listening to NPR yesterday afternoon and there was a special during the lunch hour on the Chesapeake Bay program that the EPA runs, and that s part of what I work on, and it was talking about a lot of problems with the Chesapeake Bay. I don t anticipate being called to work without pay, but the more you see stuff like that in the news, I could see potentially some folks being called in.
        
          I think it was worth it, to a certain extent, having different opinions being thrown out there with different types of border security, but I think as I read the news or listen to the news every day I personally start to question [the value]. I m starting to question it a lot more given that there are a lot of people struggling, more each day.
        
          I was scheduled for vacation at the end of the year, but I ended up getting furloughed. [My last paycheck] was a month ago, it was literally the last check of the year and was a full paycheck. I m a hustler by nature, I m originally from New York and I ve actually already been driving Uber and Lyft part-time. It was an extremely side gig, I was doing it maybe on the weekends. So I kicked it up to full-time and through the grace of God, I m doing good. Tired as hell, but I m doing good.
        
          I m married, so my wife and I, we sat down, and we ve had student loans, she s had her student loans, we ve got a forbearance with that. I m taking advantage of what the creditors are offering as far as my car note and everything like that. Everyone s been notified. The bank has helped me out, the next car note s not due until April, so we re doing [financial] things that we wouldn t normally ordinarily do.
        
          The humbling part is when I first called my credit cards to tell them that I m furloughed, a couple of them wanted to close my account and put me in a program. It s frustrating because there s nothing I ve done to cause this. It s taken me a long time to get to where I am and to establish the credit that I ve established, so that was the first punch in the stomach. Waking up every day and listening to this mess on the news, it s a slap in the face. But that s the resiliency of being a black man, it s nothing that I m not used to.
        
          The thing is this is supposed to be a secure job. What s more secure than working for the federal government? Yet here we are going on three days from not being paid in over a month. It just goes to show that this administration is using us as pawns. That s the frustrating part, just sitting here and being helpless and being pawns in all of this. That s just the general consensus [with my colleagues].
        
          I was called in [to work without pay] two weeks ago, Jan. 11 I went in. And I was supposed to go in this coming Friday but it s not happening, I m not going. I don t think [the shutdown was worth it]. Nobody in their right damned mind who s not getting paid, who hasn t gotten paid in over a month, is standing in agreement with this crap.
        
          I ve been with the agency for almost eight and a half years now. They were able to keep us open for a week after the official shutdown, so we ve been on shutdown since Dec. 28. The last time I was paid was Jan. 11; it was a partial check.
        
          I m a budget analyst so I m pretty smart with my money, but that s not going to last forever. I have not had to ask for help, but I have a very strong and very supportive network which has offered me help my friends have just been PayPal-ing me out of nowhere. My family has done the same. My network of moms, specifically the Mom Squad with the Momference, they were able to connect me with an organization that wanted to provide a grant to a single black mother affected by the shutdown, so I was able to receive a very nice piece of change for support. I am going to use it to pay my mortgage for February.
        
          My credit union and all of my banks have contacted me, saying that if you re affected by the shutdown, give us a call, we can help. They are offering to put a forbearance on current loans. There is support out there. Child care is a concern, but fortunately my daughter s in kindergarten and she normally goes to after-care while I m at work, but I ve pulled her out of after-care for now.
        
          I keep saying I won t have to pick up a side gig, that this is the last week, but I ve been playing around with driving for Uber or Lyft. I used to do freelance makeup, so I might dust off my brushes again. I ve been thinking of other things, like teaching English online. I think I can stay afloat for another month, and if that doesn t work then I will consider filing for unemployment and picking up a side gig.
        
          It s not just federal workers that are affected, especially living in D.C. It s the entire region, it s trickling down to small businesses and other people that rely on federal workers. I have a rental unit in my home, and my tenant cleans houses and her clients are canceling, so not only is it my paycheck but my other source of income that s being affected right now because my tenant can t pay her rent.
        
          I ve been a federal contractor for 25 years, and I ve worked with just about every agency in the government. My particular firm today works with the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Education, the Department of Transportation. We work with most agencies.
        
          We ve had shutdowns before and the first weeks are relatively easy, people can take paid time off that they haven t used up. After two weeks, you have to start doing unnatural things. You have to start getting bank loans, people are out of not only PTO but any amount of PTO that you could ve loaned them, and people are also coming up on their own personal savings.
        
          It just gets to a point where, as a contractor, you are paying people to do nothing. Many, not all, but many federal employees will recuperate the money that they lost. Federal contactors don t. In the last shutdown that was just two and a half weeks, I knew two service-disabled veterans  firms that went bankrupt because they could never recover.
        
          We have a contract with USDA that includes Beltsville, Maryland; St. Louis, and Kansas City. I had to let 11 people go yesterday, nine of them were their [families ] primary breadwinners. It s funny, in Missouri, in Kansas City and St. Louis, most of them supported President Trump during the election. It was hard, in one particular case where the guy is just a lovely, Christian guy, and he s got five kids and his wife doesn t work. He s a senior leader on the project, and we especially tried to do everything we could to keep him on and we just couldn t any longer. That was a heartbreaking call to make.
        
          If this thing doesn t end really and I mean really, really soon, if this thing goes into February, it ll be bloody awful. There will be 80, 100 people laid off? The impact will be massive, just within our little firm. As a business, we ve had to take out some unnatural loans which could at some point put our business in peril. The management team across the board has taken increasingly significant cuts personally, but that s just the right thing to do, that s not me being a hero, that s just the right thing to do. If it stops tomorrow, it would still be painful, but we d get by.
        
          Again, if it goes another 10 days, I don t know. We ll have to take out more loans, we ll have to cut more people including overhead staff and at some point, the whole thing becomes unsustainable. Our bank has been great, but we re going to get sheltered at some point with a half-million loan that we should never have to had taken out. And now we ll be stuck with that for years, all for what?
        
          Give him the wall, don t give him the wall, it s 1/1000 of the federal budget. It s like shutting down your house because you re complaining about ATM fees. I get that he feels like he s stuck with this base and he has to do this, and I get where the Democrats are saying, well if we give into this now.   At this point, I m beyond caring. Will the wall work? Maybe. Will it hurt us? Not really. For $5 billion you re getting what? A 30-mile wall. Build it, don t build it, I don t care. This whole thing is absolutely pointless.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/government-shutdown-shenandoah-national-park.html,"
          This week, as the government s partial shutdown drags toward what will soon be the longest in history, we ve started hearing harrowing stories about those who are suffering because of President Donald Trump s decision to close the government over funding of a new border wall. Federal workers cannot afford to pay their rent, food will go uninspected, battered women may not be able to access services, and everyone faces long lines at airports as federal workers call in sick or quit rather than work without pay. With a stormy weekend ahead, it s clear that the real victims of the protracted shutdown are largely innocent people just trying to go about their daily lives in a country that once provided certain services in the name of democracy. One of the heartbreaking revelations of the past week was that Joshua Tree National Park had several irreplaceable Joshua trees hacked down by park visitors seeking to make new roads destroying national treasures while the rangers are away. Not every park in the National Park System has been witness to such displays, but as the shutdown drags on, parks that have remained open with furloughed workers are feeling the hurt. Susan Sherman serves as executive director for the Shenandoah National Park Trust, a nonprofit organization established to support the park s work. I reached out to ask how the shutdown is affecting Shenandoah National Park, which winds along the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. Our conversation has been lightly edited for clarity below.
        
          Slate: Why are the national parks getting so much attention during this shutdown? 
        
          Sherman: Partly because national parks provide immediate visuals of the shutdown. Pictures of human waste and trash heaps in beautiful places get people fired up.
        
          What are the shutdown s impacts to national parks that I d notice if I went to Shenandoah National Park this weekend?
        
          This past November, central Virginia had a series of storms that felled a massive amount of trees across Skyline Drive, the 105-mile road through the park. The entire South District of Skyline Drive about 30 miles was closed to the public while park crews worked to clear the road. The shutdown hit, and that work came to a screeching halt, so that section of the drive is still closed.
        
          You d also see vandalism, like graffiti, and you might notice some missing items like the iconic National Park Service arrowhead that was stolen from one of the entrance stations. You d see people camping where they shouldn t be. You d see toilets bolted shut because they became human health hazards and you d see trash. However, you won t see a lot of trash, because so many locals who love this park have come out to pick up trash as they hike. We re so thankful for these  trail angels. 
        
          And, finally, you d see signs posted on 10 port-a-potties at Old Rag and Whiteoak Canyon, two of the most heavily used trails in the park. The signs would alert you that the toilets were being cleaned and maintained thanks to the Shenandoah National Park Trust (my organization) thanks to emergency funds we are currently raising.
        
          What impacts would I not notice but are happening, nonetheless?
        
          There s a huge amount of environmental-protection work and scientific monitoring and scientific study that has just stopped in its tracks. For instance, my organization funds a research grant stipend every year. This year, we awarded it to a group of Smithsonian scientists who are investigating an invasive insect called the emerald ash borer that may kill 1 million ash trees in our park. Well, guess who s not working during the shutdown? National Park staff and Smithsonian researchers.
        
          You also wouldn t notice the impacts on National Park staff morale. Can you imagine choosing to devote your life to public service and then to be told you re  nonessential? 
        
          By and large, people go into the National Park Service because they love these lands. You don t get rich working for parks. The other day, the news was plastered with articles noting that 4 out of 5 federal employees live paycheck to paycheck. Maybe about 10 days ago, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memo to federal employees suggesting they barter services if they found themselves unable to pay rent. Is that really what we ve come to? We re giving the middle finger to our public servants and that s inexcusable.
        
          What might be the lasting impacts to parks, even after the government is up and running?
        
          Certainly, there is all sorts of damage to the natural landscape in parks all over the country. Joshua Tree National Park is serving as the poster child right now for the ugliness of the shutdown. What s the long-term impact to parks where rare or endangered plants have been destroyed or historical assets have been stolen or human waste has seeped into streams? Time will tell.
        
          One last thing? In Shenandoah, I think about impacts to wildlife. We have one of the highest densities of black bears in North America. When our bear-proof trash cans start to overflow with trash, they re no longer bear-proof. And once bears start getting used to easy lunch at the waste bins, they ll keep returning. That s when we start to have bear-human conflicts. Park rangers then have to go to great lengths to secure the bear and move it to the remote backcountry. There s no guarantee the bear won t return. If she does, sometimes more dire actions have to be taken.
        
          Getting back to your Joshua tree reference, does the ugliness of that act get you down? I have to say that was a gut punch.
        
          Yeah, I had the same reaction. First I was sad, then I was hopping mad. I don t think you have to be a  tree hugger  to appreciate the value of these remarkable places and what we all lose when they are desecrated.
        
          The truth is, people do bad and stupid things in national parks even when there s not a government shutdown. But not to this extent. Most people who visit national parks in  normal  times have a sense of respect and stewardship for these places. What we re seeing now is sort of a free-for-all in parks. Some folks who wouldn t normally come for whatever reason are taking advantage of no entrance fees and light law enforcement and they re acting like looters when there s a blackout. But, again, we re also seeing a remarkable level of volunteerism from the general public.  How can I help?  is being heard loud and clear by those of us who work with parks, and we are grateful and humbled.
        
          Should national parks be closed during the shutdown? 
        
          I believe they should. The 2013 government shutdown was a total shutdown. The entrance gates at national parks were locked, and signs were posted on them explaining the closure. But the Park Service got a black eye during that shutdown because many Americans were outraged that they couldn t visit these places that are, after all, public lands. As former National Park Service Director Jon Jarvis said recently, keeping parks open but not fully staffed is like throwing the doors to the Smithsonian open and sending home the security guards.
        
          This partial shutdown is also challenging for organizations like ours. My board members and I had a robust debate on whether or not we should provide some emergency funding during the shutdown to keep those toilets operating. Some of my board members rightly so felt that we should not be making it easier for the administration to keep parks in this limbo state. In the end, though, the majority of my board felt that carving out this one area of support was the right thing for the park s philanthropic partner to do.
        
          What s the ripple effect of this shutdown? In other words, what other cohorts that are connected to national parks are affected by the shutdown?
        
          National parks are huge economic drivers. People who go to Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, for example, probably fly into Jackson and spend money in Jackson. They eat in restaurants, buy souvenirs, maybe stay in a hotel for a week. They re pumping money into the local economy and supporting jobs. Last year, visitors to national parks spent over $15 billion in gateway communities around the country. Wintertime is prime season for a lot of national parks, especially parks in warmer climates. Will families who d been planning their trips to the Everglades with their kids for the past year still come to the Everglades, knowing the situation in these parks? If they cancel, there s one less family supporting the local communities around the Everglades.
        
          The state of Arizona is financially supporting Grand Canyon National Park, this being prime season to visit Arizona. It s a confusing landscape to figure out who s paying for what and what s open and what s closed.
        
          Government contractors are also not working their contracts with parks during the shutdown. And while federal employees may get back pay when this whole ordeal is over, contractors sure won t.
        
          Other than weep for the Joshua trees and the black bears, are there things folks can do?
        
          Well, they can choose not to visit national parks for the time being. But if they do go, they should tread lightly and abide by the Park Service s  Leave No Trace  policy. They can look for opportunities to volunteer in parks on cleanup patrols; many national parks have nonprofit partner organizations and those are good places to start. They can also choose to make a donation to these organizations. Many people are donating the amount equivalent to what they would have paid in entrance fees. And they can contact their elected officials to urge them to demand an end to the shutdown. And finally, we are suggesting to our friends and supporters that they consider writing a note of gratitude to our park staff and mailing it to the park so that they are waiting for our colleagues when they finally return to work.

          The partial government shutdown, now in its 35th day, will soon be over. Whether a new one will begin in 21 days, however, remains a possibility.
        
          President Trump on Friday announced from the White House that he and congressional leaders had reached a deal to reopen the government. He pledged to sign a three-week continuing resolution that, importantly, does not include additional funding for Trump s beloved border wall. As part of the agreement, however, lawmakers will use the time to try to hash out a larger deal on immigration and border security. That, of course, is easier said than done; they ll have just weeks to come to a comprehensive agreement that has eluded Washington for years.
        
          Trump suggested that if lawmakers fail to come up with a long-term deal that includes significant funding for  a wall, physical barrier, strong fence, whatever you want to call it,  he will then either force another shutdown or use a national emergency declaration to build the wall without congressional approval.  No border security plan can ever work without a physical barrier it just doesn t happen,  the president said at the White House. Any border-related national emergency declaration would almost certainly be challenged in federal court.
        
          Trump tried to spin this deal as a victory during his Rose Garden speech at least when he wasn t going off-script to fearmonger about crimes committed with the aid of duct tape but he was unable to cite anything he gained by keeping parts of the government shuttered for five weeks. This is, in short, a cave by Trump. He had previously been steadfast in his demand that any funding deal, short-term or not, include significant funding for the wall. In fact, this stop-gap funding bill is pretty much the same deal Democratic leaders have been pushing for weeks Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were adamant that they would not negotiate while Trump held the federal government hostage and is more or less the same one Trump and Republicans had agreed to prior to the shutdown, before he changed his mind under pressure from the Ann Coulters of the world.
        
          What changed Trump s mind this time? Take your pick: Mounting pressure over delays at airports and sickouts at the IRS; an American public who increasingly blamed him for the shutdown; major cracks in his support from Senate Republicans; his desire to give a primetime State of the Union; and/or a need to change the subject from the indictment of his long-time political adviser Roger Stone, the latest person from his campaign to be caught up in Robert Mueller s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
        "

          At long last, we have movement to end the government shutdown.
        
          Per a deal reached between Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer, the Senate will vote on two bills to fund the government on Thursday. One will be the immigration proposal the president unveiled Saturday. It s a complete non-starter for Democrats, especially now that its many poison pills have been revealed. The other, though, would be a clean continuing resolution reopening the government until Feb. 8 that the House had already passed. That one would very much be a starter for Democrats, and it would ensure that federal workers wouldn t miss another payday. It would need 60 votes to advance.
        
          This is either the breakthrough that ends the shutdown at least for a couple of weeks or this week s iteration of What s New in Shutdown Messaging.
        
          If enough Republicans join Democrats to pass the short-term bill, President Donald Trump would find on his desk a bill to fund the government without any wall money. That would be a defeat for him, and it would be a sign that Senate Republicans had finally decided their position was untenable. It would be a cave.
        
          If the president comes out against the proposal, though, and scares off Senate Republicans from voting for it, it would allow Senate Republican leaders to argue that it s futile passing legislation that doesn t address the border. And the shutdown would continue.
        
          In either case, we are starting to see this week what we hadn t seen in the past month of the shutdown: movement. It was McConnell who asked the president to develop  compromise  legislation in the first place, because he needed something to put on the floor. And centrist Democrats in the House, many of them representing red or purple districts, drafted a letter on Tuesday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urging her at least to promise the president a vote on his homeland security request, including border wall funding, after the government reopened.
        
          The Senate might not be able to end the shutdown on Thursday. But the machinery that will end the shutdown eventually pressure from anxious Senate Republicans and anxious House Democrats is starting to operate.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/government-shutdown-trump-administration-raises.html,"
          Because of a pay freeze that is set to expire during the government shutdown, Cabinet secretaries, deputy secretaries, high-ranking administrators, and Vice President Mike Pence are all scheduled to receive raises of $10,000 or more on Saturday, according to the Office of Personnel Management.
        
          Now in the 14th day of the government shutdown, with no end in sight, many federal employees are growing increasingly concerned about finances and budgeting carefully many are even filing for unemployment benefits to tide them over as they approach their first missed paycheck. Nearly 800,000 workers have gone without pay since the shutdown: About 380,000 have been furloughed, and others have continued to work through the shutdown and will be paid when it ends. And while many will be paid later, custodians, security officers, and other hourly workers paid by private contractors care are not eligible for back pay.
        
          According to the the Washington Post, which first reported on the raises on Friday, officials are worried about the appearance of granting raises to high-paid officials while lower-level federal workers struggle with finances. Pence, for example, will see his pay bump up from more than $230,000 to about $243,000, as indicated by documents from the Office of Personnel Management (Pence told reporters on Friday that he would turn down the raise for as long as the shutdown lasted). Cabinet secretaries will go from more than $199,000 to over $210,000.
        
          When Congress failed to pass a bill funding the federal government in December, the 2013 law capping pay for top officials was not renewed, as it had been each year before. If no emergency action is taken by Saturday, the raises will kick in. But it s not clear what should be done. The House Democrats have included a continuation of the freeze in their funding bill that passed Thursday, but that bill is not expected to go any further. Congress could also pass a stand-alone measure to retain the freeze, and at least one legislator has suggested the president could issue an executive order canceling the raise. According to a CNN correspondent, the president said he  might  consider killing the raise, but he did not commit to it.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/government-shutdown-at-least-three-people-have-died-in-national-parks-since-shutdown-began.html,"
          Calls to close the country s national parks are increasing amid reports that three people have died since the start of the government shutdown, reports the Washington Post. Among the dead is a 14-year-old girl who fell 700 feet down a canyon in Arizona. A man also died at Yosemite National Park on Christmas, and two days later a woman was killed by a falling tree at Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Although deaths and national parks are hardly uncommon an average of six die each week in the park system, according to a spokesman the series of deaths does shine a spotlight on the decision by the Trump administration to keep them open even as staffing has been kept to a bare minimum, if there is any at all.
        
          The move to keep the parks open differentiates this shutdown from most in the past. In 1995 and 2013, for example, the parks were shut. And while the parks did stay open last year, that shutdown only lasted three days. Now the shutdown has entered its third week and many are saying it s time to close the parks. Trash is piling up, sure, but many experts also say the safety of visitors is compromised with fewer staff members present.  I think we all know that not having bathrooms is a nuisance. What I think people forget is, not having adequate sewage treatment can be dangerous,  Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, said.  When you bring people together, running these parks is like running a small city. 
        
          Ryan Zinke, who recently stepped down as the secretary of the Interior Department, says everyone needs to pitch in to keep the parks clean. But it s clear many visitors are also not being the most thoughtful when it comes to visiting parks during the shutdown.  At Joshua Tree and Yosemite, impacts from human waste is a concern, which includes people relieving themselves in public places, such as behind buildings [and] on roadsides,  said Andrew MuÒoz, a park service spokesperson.
        
          Volunteers are teaming up with nonprofits and state governments across the country to try to keep parks safe and clean, but some are warning that these makeshift operations were not set up to last more than a few days. Trump said on Friday the shutdown could last  months or even years.  Even some who have long advocated to keep parks open say enough is enough.  It s really an awful situation to be in, but our primary job is to protect park resources and the safety of the public,  said Phil Francis, the chairman of the Coalition to Protect America s National Parks.  I hate it.

          Update at 5:11 p.m.: Washington appeared to be getting ready for a long shutdown Saturday as there was no end in sight to the impasse over President Donald Trump s demand for money to fund a border wall with Mexico. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell adjourned the Senate until Thursday as even a temporary measure to keep the government open seemed to be out of the question for now. The White House for now is saying that Trump is sticking to his demand for border wall funding. Although no one would discount the possibility of a last minute agreement, it seemed increasingly unlikely as Saturday dragged on with no compromise in sight.
        
          Original post at 7:45 a.m.: The government partially shut down Saturday morning as furious last-minute negotiations were unable to break the logjam over President Donald Trump s demand for $5.7 billion to fund a border wall with Mexico. It marked the third shutdown in two years, a time when Republicans had majorities in both chambers of Congress and control of the White House. Unlike previous ones though, this current shutdown affects about one-quarter of the federal bureaucracy considering the majority of government programs are funded through Sept. 30. The  lapse in appropriations  covers areas within the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department, the State Department, the Interior Department, the Departure of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, among others.
        
          Overall, the funding could lead to more than 380,000 federal employees being furloughed during Christmas week while 420,000 would work without pay. For now though, lawmakers have some time to reach a compromise without the shutdown really affecting many people considering it is now the weekend and both Monday and Tuesday are federal holidays. But some are suggesting the shutdown could continue at least until the new Congress takes over on Jan. 3.
        
          Although President Trump had previously said he d be  proud  to take the blame for any shutdown, on Friday night he clearly pointed the finger at Democrats in a video he posted on Twitter.  We re going to have a shutdown,  Trump said in the video.  There s nothing we can do about that because we need the Democrats to give us their votes.  Trump also told reporters that  we are totally prepared for a very long shutdown. 
        
          Democratic leaders, meanwhile, didn t act surprised at the shutdown, saying that it really marked the fulfillment of Trump s plan all along.  President Trump has said more than 25 times that he wanted a shutdown and now he has gotten what he wanted,  Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a joint statement issued after the deadline to fund the government had passed.Negotiations are expected to continue Saturday although it isn t clear how any talks would progress. Some evidently frustrated Republicans noted that part of the problem is that they don t know what the president is willing to compromise on.  The biggest problem is, we just don t know what the president will sign,  said Republican Sen. Jeff Flake.
        
          Republicans seemed particularly frustrated that Trump had seemed to change his mind on reaching a compromise to avoid a shutdown after he received criticism in conservative circles. This is tyranny of talk radio hosts, right? And so, how do you deal with that?  said Republican Sen. Bob Corker.  You have two talk radio hosts who completely flipped the president. And so, do we succumb to tyranny of talk radio hosts? 
        
          As of Saturday morning there were no votes scheduled and House Republican leaders said members would get notified 24 hours in advance before any vote.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/end-government-shutdown-trump-wall-deal.html,"
          We regret to inform you that President Trump is having one of his ideas again. He s considering, or says he s considering, declaring a national emergency and directing the military to construct a  wall  on the southern border. His crack legal team has been looking into the feasibility of this for weeks, and a White House official told CNN over the weekend that the president was  inclined  to do it. Trump, on Sunday, said that the decision was  dependent on what s going to happen over the next few days. 
        
          As is often the case, what the president considers a projection of strength is actually a projection of weakness. He needs a way out of this shutdown, and a  national emergency  to build the wall, whether it materializes or not, has the stunt-ish sheen he s looking for.
        
          Because  what s going to happen over the next few days  is likely the same as what s happened over the first 17 days of the partial government shutdown: nothing. There aren t offers flying back-and-forth, only competing statements of resolve. The only unifying factor is a commitment to busywork so that each side can argue that it s rolled up its sleeves to try to find a solution.
        
          But even these photo-ops are laughable. The only product of the most recent meeting between congressional leaders and the president at the White House on Friday was the formation of a  working group  to negotiate through the weekend. At least that s how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell generously described a bunch of Hill staffers having to waste their weekend sitting around with Vice President Mike Pence for a few hours each day. (When asked who precisely would comprise the  working group,  McConnell spokesman David Popp responded,  In the unlikely event I have any details to share I ll be sure to forward.  The details never arrived.) No progress was made at these meetings. They might have just been watching the NFL playoffs.
        
          If there s been any movement since the shutdown began, it s been the two sides moving further apart. Senate Democrats had, in mid-2018, reached an appropriations deal with Republicans for $1.6 billion in border security. They ve since reduced that offer to $1.3 billion in nonwall border security. The White House s request has gone from $5 billion to $5.6 billion to, in the most recent dispatch to congressional appropriators, $5.7 billion and for a  steel barrier.  (Concrete was very 2018.) Democrats, now, are refusing to negotiate until Trump agrees to  reopen the government. 
        
          Democrats are comfortable in this position. In a shutdown, the side that s making the big policy ask relative to the status quo typically gets the blame. All the other side has to do is watch their rivals squirm. Republicans caved after a couple of weeks of the 2013 shutdown, when Sen. Ted Cruz and hard-right members of the House wanted to defund Obamacare. Speaker John Boehner decided he d had enough when the government was a day away from a debt default. Senate Democrats, in early 2018, blocked a funding bill when they couldn t secure protections for Dreamers. They only lasted a weekend before hyperventilating that they d gone too far, and quickly agreed to McConnell s offer of floor time to debate immigration a few weeks later. (That time was not used productively.)
        
          Congressional Republicans haven t revolted yet, but they certainly are squirming. A handful of House Republicans joined every Democrat last week in passing a clean extension of funding for the Homeland Security Department; limiting the number of GOP defectors took a fair share of lobbying from Pence himself. In the Senate, the two Republican senators up for re-election in states that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 are cracking. Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, the most endangered Republican in 2020, wants to fund the government, wall or not. Maine Sen. Susan Collins too would like to see the Senate vote on the funding bills the House passed last week.
        
          Trump doesn t care if anything he does hurts congressional Republicans, which is why we re in a shutdown. But he might recognize that he s at least made enough noise to show that he  fought  for the wall and is ready to shift lanes toward some sort of off-ramp.  In a private meeting with aides at Camp David on Sunday,  the Wall Street Journal reports,  Mr. Trump said he wanted them to come up with a resolution to the shutdown fight that would reopen the government without him appearing to have capitulated to Democrats, a person familiar with the meeting said. 
        
          So what kind of fig leaf could Trump accept? Don t expect any larger immigration deal, like the DACA-for-wall trade that Trump rejected last year. Both sides have taken that off the table, at least until the Supreme Court rules on DACA s future. The face-saving offer could, instead, be a little more funding for border security, structured in a convoluted way to allow Trump to say it s for  the wall  when it s really not. It could be the classic punt of establishing a Commission for Further Study of Wall Building. Or it could be something more creative that hasn t yet dawned on Washington s top strategic minds. This may sound like vague theorizing, but that s as advanced as congressional discussions have gotten, too.
        
          Trump will give a prime-time address about the shutdown Tuesday night, and later in the week he plans to visit the border. Perhaps this could be the rollout for declaring the wall a  national emergency.  If he does choose that as his escape hatch, then there s a term for that, too: punting it to the courts.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/12/trump-border-wall-government-shutdown.html,"
          President Trump thinks he ll win a fight with Democrats over paying for a wall on the Mexican border.  If we don t get what we want   I will shut down the government,  Trump told Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speakerñdesignate Nancy Pelosi in a televised Oval Office meeting on Tuesday.  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don t want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. 
        
          When Trump talks about  the people of this country,  he s saying that he ll win because polls are on his side. He s also confident because nearly a year ago, Democrats caved under fire after a three-day shutdown over DACA, a program that protected undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country as kids.  The last time you shut [the government] down, you got killed,  Trump told Schumer and Pelosi in Tuesday s meeting. But Trump is misreading history and the polls. If he ends up in a shutdown over a wall, he ll lose.
        
          Trump lives in a partisan bubble. In the White House, he surrounds himself with sycophants. In Congress, he works only with Republicans. When he goes out, he speaks at rallies full of worshipful followers. When he watches TV, it s Fox News. So when he sees polls, he focuses on his base. By that measure, building a wall looks like a winner. In surveys taken during last winter s shutdown fight, the percentage of Republicans who supported a wall ranged from 65 to 75. This summer, it was even higher, between 73 and 87 percent.
        
          But step outside the Republican bubble, and you soon discover that enthusiasm for the wall is shaky even among Trump s strongest constituencies. Consider whites without a college degree, two-thirds of whom voted for Trump in 2016. In a CNN poll taken in January, non-college whites opposed a wall, 51 percent to 46 percent. In Quinnipiac surveys, non-college whites support a wall, but just barely, with majorities in the low 50s. When they re told that the cost is $25 billion, they oppose it by a narrow plurality.
        
          Venture further from the bubble, and the numbers get worse. A year ago, Public Policy Polling found that 65 percent of Republicans supported building a wall if  taxpayers have to pay  for it. (Trump originally promised that Mexico would pay for it.) But whites as a whole rejected a wall on those terms, 51 percent to 42 percent. In the CNN poll, whites opposed a wall, 57 percent to 41 percent. In a CBS/YouGov poll taken in June, 63 percent of Republicans said a wall was  a good idea that can probably be completed.  Only 37 percent of whites agreed. In Quinnipiac surveys, most whites opposed building a wall.
        
          Trump s second mistake is that he thinks Democrats will lose a shutdown fight over a wall because they lost the shutdown fight over DACA. He doesn t understand that the current fight is different in two ways. This time, Trump is the one making demands. And popular support for a wall is much weaker than popular support for DACA. In every survey that has asked about both issues CBS, CNN, Gallup, Quinnipiac, and the Washington Post only about 35 to 40 percent of Americans have supported a wall, while more than 80 percent have supported  allowing young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children to remain in the country if they meet certain requirements. 
        
          These two gaps between DACA and a wall, and between Republicans and the rest of the country show up vividly in surveys that ask specifically about shutting down the government. If you focus on Republicans, as Trump does, a shutdown over a wall looks winnable. In a Politico/Morning Consult poll taken in January, Republicans said by a 4-point margin that a wall was worth a shutdown. When Politico repeated the question last month, the margin among Republicans was 15 points. In a PBS/NPR/Marist survey that ended last week (the survey dates were Nov. 28 to Dec. 4), 65 percent of Republicans said Trump  should not compromise on the border wall even if it means a government shutdown.  Only 29 percent said Trump  should compromise on the border wall to prevent gridlock. 
        
          But outside the bubble, a shutdown over a wall is deeply unpopular, even among whites. In the January Politico poll, whites said by a 2ñ1 ratio, 60 percent to 28 percent, that funding a wall wasn t worth a shutdown. In the November Politico poll, whites expressed the same view, 54 percent to 32 percent. In the Marist survey, 55 percent of whites said Trump should compromise on the wall to avoid a shutdown; only 39 percent said he should stand his ground. Even among supporters of a wall, the January CBS poll found that a plurality, 50 percent to 44 percent, said it wasn t  worth risking a shutdown. 
        
          Politically, a shutdown over a wall would be far more disastrous than a shutdown over DACA. In the January Politico survey, voters were evenly split on whether legislation to protect  young people who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children  was  important enough to prompt a government shutdown.  But on a wall, they were clear: 59 percent said a wall wasn t worth a shutdown; only 27 percent said it was. When Politico repeated those questions last month, it got almost the same results.
        
          Trump has lied about the wall all along, and the bill for his lies is coming due. He said Mexico would pay for it, but Mexico refused. Then he demanded that Congress pay for it on his terms, but Congress refused. If the wall gets funded, you know who will end up paying for it: you. But if it doesn t, and if we end up in a shutdown, I ll tell you who will pay politically: Donald Trump.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/shutdown-update-border-wall-congress.html,"
          On Day 25 of the longest government shutdown in United States history, Congress was no closer to resolving the impasse than it was on Day One. Since President Donald Trump rejected the easiest path out of the shutdown declaring a national emergency and punting the issue of a border wall to the courts over the weekend, the Capitol has seen its fair share of commotion. But none of that should be confused with movement toward resolution.
        
          So what is this commotion-but-not-movement? Democrats continue to pressure Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell into voting on House-passed bills to reopen the government, while Republicans insist that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi needs to budge from her refusal to negotiate over border wall money. But neither McConnell nor Pelosi, the two strongest congressional leaders of the 21st century, is known for budging. When they commit to their strategic positions, they commit, and their caucuses follow them in lockstep.
        
          There is, however, theoretically a moment when either side s vulnerable members House Democrats representing swing districts, and swing state Senate Republicans up for re-election suffer enough that these leaders recognize the shutdown could endanger their majorities. A leader budges, and a deal gets cut. The commotion this week, then, has been about testing each side s pressure points. But so far, no one seems close to caving.
        
          Several vulnerable Senate Republicans have gone on the record calling for reopening the government even without wall funding. Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, the Republicans  most vulnerable senator in 2020, said shortly after New Year s Day that  we should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open.  Maine Sen. Susan Collins, another top target for the Democrats, has called for the Senate to at least pass the other, nonñHomeland Security appropriations bills that have come out of the House, which would reopen most parts of the government.  Building the wall  is an unpopular policy in both of their states, just as it is nationally even though it s growing in popularity among Republicans. And Trump and Republicans are taking most of the blame for the shutdown, as poll after poll after poll in recent days has shown.
        
          But a couple of senators feeling uncomfortable does not add up to a rebellion, does not hurt Mitch McConnell s feelings, and will not persuade him to change course. As Texas Sen. John Cornyn no longer a member of leadership himself, but still tuned in to leadership s thinking said Monday according to Politico, those senators calling to reopen government are  going to do what they need to do.  But, he added,  I don t think that should be confused with what Sen. McConnell s calculus is, which is: not to go through this effort of passing something the president won t sign and then going through a potential veto override and all the conflict that would cause. 
        
          That s why Gardner, Collins, and others feeling heartburn over the shutdown aren t more forceful about pressuring McConnell to change course: The alternative defying Trump, and  all the conflict that would cause  remains the more politically troubling course. Though Quinnipiac s most recent shutdown poll showed only 43 percent public support for building the wall overall, 88 percent of Republicans agreed with it, and 74 percent of Republicans blamed Democrats in Congress for the shutdown. For Senate Republicans to pass a House Democratic bill that the president would veto, and then to override the president s veto, would be viewed as treason by the Republican base. So long as the danger of defying Trump is more palpable than the danger of biding their time, vulnerable Senate Republicans are going to twiddle their thumbs and go along with McConnell s strategy. It could be a while.
        
          And if the Trump administration thinks it can peel vulnerable House Democrats away from Pelosi, it may be waiting even longer. The bad public polling for Trump has allowed Pelosi to take the firm position that she won t support Trump s wall now, in a month, or ever. But that doesn t mean all House Democrats are perfectly at ease with the uncompromising stance. Many freshman members, especially, won longtime Republican districts and will be on precarious re-election grounds in 2020. Some of these members would like the messaging to emphasize that they re open to compromise and that they take border security seriously. The Trump administration, in its desperation, is trying to create a wedge between these anxious House Democrats and their leader. That s why the White House sent invitations to some centrist Democrats for a Tuesday lunch.
        
          The invitations, though, turned into an opportunity for House Democrats to demonstrate their unity. Not a single Democrat accepted the invitation, so Trump was left to dine with a group of powerless House Republicans. (These Democrats apparently didn t need to be pressured into declining the invitations, either: Pelosi said she didn t care if they accepted them.  They can see what we ve been dealing with,  she told her leadership team.  And they ll want to make a citizen s arrest. )
        
          Later Tuesday afternoon, a group of Democratic freshmen held a press conference to emphasize their unity, and to pressure you guessed it McConnell into holding votes to reopen the government. One reporter asked if they all stood by Pelosi s position that they wouldn t fund more than one dollar s worth of the border wall.
        
           A border wall is off the table,  California Rep. Katie Hill said. No dissent was voiced.
        
          Donald Trump will not pick off a meaningful number of House Democrats, if any, from Nancy Pelosi s clutch. Democrats do not want to reward Trump s hostage-taking, they don t feel that they need to make the first move when Republicans are taking the blame for the shutdown, they trust Pelosi s skill set, and the border wall is still unpopular. And Republicans aren t moving because they are scared of Trump s Twitter feed.
        
          No one is breaking at either of these pressure points right now. Vulnerable House Democrats are sticking by Pelosi, and vulnerable Senate Republicans are sticking by McConnell, who is sticking by Trump. They re all stuck.

          As the government shutdown stretches on with no end in sight, President Trump is facing increasingly vocal opposition from his political opponents. In a fiery Instagram address Wednesday, rapper Cardi B expressed sympathy with furloughed government employees and excoriated the president for his role in the government shutdown. Cardi B s address follows similar remarks from Snoop Dogg earlier in the month, and will doubtless be seen by political analysts as yet another data point strongly suggesting that the entire country has realized that the current president is, in political science terms, an  incompetent white supremacist toddler :
        
          Cardi B pointed to the president s decision Tuesday to call nearly 50,000 furloughed employees back to work without pay as an egregious example of the president s willingness to make other people suffer to get what he wants, but took in the macro view as well, observing that  our country is in a hellhole right now, all for a fucking wall.  As for conservative water-carriers offering specious comparisons between Trump and Obama on the basis of the 2013 government shutdown, Cardi B has a simple message: the conservative intelligentsia can t fuck with her if they wanted to:
        
          It s depressing that mainstream news so rarely asks the question,  Are you trying to accomplish something good or bad with this policy?  but at least someone is. The 24-hour news cycle has brought us endless sophisticated analyses of everything Trump does, nuance on top of nuance, as very smart people struggle to make sense of our very dumb president. Cardi B s statement, like Snoop Dogg s before her, is a refreshing reminder that not everything is complicated. It really shouldn t take more than a minute or two of Instagram video to expose Trump s ideas as self-serving bullshit.

          It s day 33 of the government shutdown, and while some departments have gone back to work, many federal employees are still not being paid and others remain out of work completely.  Hundreds of thousands of government workers aren t being paid the money they were counting on to feed their families and buy their medicine,  Full Frontal host Samantha Bee noted on Wednesday night.  But there are some people who think the shutdown is no big deal. 
        
          Television personality John Stossel is one of those people, insisting on Fox Business that  some of the workers they call essential probably aren t  and  most people don t notice  the shutdown, even though it s been going on for more than a month. As has become a major part of the job for late night hosts lately, Bee used her show to give federal employees a voice, sending correspondent Allana Harkin to Washington D.C. to talk to some of those  non-essential workers. 
        
          To allow employees to speak without compromising their careers, Harkin created a spoof of  my new favorite hallucination and tv show, The Masked Singer.  We were disappointed to hear that the music from this spoof of the Fox reality competition is fake, but Harkin assured viewers  the voices of the people you ll hear are from interviews we conducted with actual furloughed government workers with jobs vital to a functioning society. 
        
          As the competition began, the outlandish outfits and cheesy songs were quickly overshadowed by the reminder of just how essential government workers are to the country.  I am concerned that preparation for hurricane season is not being done and will have an adverse effect on the American public,  said a worker for FEMA. A worker from the Bureau of Land Management similarly warned,  this is time that we have to prepare for fire season. Fire season s right around the corner. We re running out of time at this point and I can t stress how scary that is. 
        
          Ryan Baugh of the Department of Homeland Security was willing to reveal his identity and was quick to point out that the shutdown is impacting the checks and balances that keep government functioning:  What keeps me up at night is knowing that some of the oversight bodies of the government who help make sure the government operates safely and in accordance of the law, those offices are largely in hibernation right now. 
        
          Still, the government shutdown shows no signs of ending, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blaming the other party.  Clearly the Democrats  priorities are way out of whack here, way out of whack,  he has said. Get that guy some lettuce, stat.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/shutdown-automatic-continuing-resolution-fund-government-budget.html,"
          How long must a government shutdown go on before Congress decides it can t risk another one? We may soon find out if 35 days was long enough.
        
          The longest government shutdown in history just concluded with the instigator, President Trump, suffering the same fate as instigators past: humiliating himself for all to see, enraging elements of his base by caving, and failing to secure even a dime of the policy for which he had been holding out. Shutdowns are lousy leverage. Ideally, this lesson would have been learned and re-learned enough by this point that no one would try to take the government hostage again. Trump, however, doesn t learn lessons. But maybe, finally, Congress has: The needless pain to federal workers, contractors, those reliant on the federal government, and the economy over the last five weeks might finally be enough to prompt Congress to eliminate the practice from consideration.
        
          In the last few days, three of four congressional leaders have come out in favor of a so-called  automatic continuing resolution  legislation that would keep the government up and running if Congress doesn t meet a funding deadline. While there are several different proposals floating around, all of the bills  proponents want to move quickly while the shutdown s misery is still fresh. They re hoping to include the change in the final spending agreement that Congress has given itself until Feb. 15 to reach.
        
          House Democrats don t have any specific bill ready to go just yet. But the idea of an automatically continuing resolution does have the all-important nod of approval from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In a roundtable with reporters on Friday, Pelosi said that she would support legislation to keep the government funded at existing spending levels until a budget deal is reached. She referenced an old proposal by former Michigan Rep. Dale Kildee that could serve as a model, and appropriately enough, Rep. Dan Kildee Dale s nephew, who succeeded his uncle in 2013 and fellow Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin are working on bills.
        
          House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, speaking on Meet the Press on Sunday, also said that he would support an automatic continuing resolution, and added that he would  go further  by offering an amendment to  not pay the members of Congress and Senate  if they can t reach a budget deal.
        
          Sure enough, there s already legislation from Senate Democrats to do just that. Earlier this month, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner introduced the Stop STUPIDITY Act. Though the acronym  Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage In the coming Years Act  is a cheat (Where s the  T ? Who hid the  c ?), the idea itself could work. It would automatically fund the government at existing levels if a deal isn t reached except for the legislative branch and the executive office of the president.
        
          As I wrote earlier this month, the trick in writing an effective automatic CR is ensuring that it doesn t give Congress an incentive to stay stuck in continuing-resolution limbo forever, and taking pay away until budget agreements are reached could be such an incentive. That doesn t mean the bill is perfect. It s a little much to threaten the incomes of low-paid staffers instead of the members, senators, and president exclusively. And even then, the policy would spare independently wealthy politicians from the pain it s designed to inflict. But it s a viable starting point, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer offered his support for it over the weekend.
        
          Many Senate Republicans, though, have their own preferred bill. Ohio Sen. Rob Portman recently introduced the End Government Shutdowns Act, a bill he has put forward to every Congress since his 2010 election, which would create an automatic CR that cuts spending by modest increments the longer it takes Congress to pass proper spending bills. The knock Democrats have on this bill is that conservatives might be happy to live with the automatic CR forever, since  forever  would mean  bigger and bigger cuts. 
        
          The bill s defenders counter that most Republicans wouldn t want to live with automatic cuts to defense spending, so that would bring them to the table. They have a point last year s major budget deal happened when Republicans traded Democrats a significant boost to domestic spending in exchange for defense money. But most Democrats still won t want to support anything that puts undesirable spending cuts in the offing and would actually want the spending levels to increase with inflation. When I asked Portman s spokesperson if the senator would be willing to concede on the cuts in order to reach a deal with Democrats, he said,  Sen. Portman is certainly willing to sit down, have the discussion, and try to come up with a resolution. 
        
          Both Warner and Portman have said they ll push hard to include an automatic CR into the final spending bill in the next few weeks. With the 35-day shutdown fresh in everyone s minds, and support from leaders and other influential voices like Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, they have a decent shot. But first, they ll need to reach a bipartisan, bicameral deal on which bill to include. It s very easy very easy to see them reaching an impasse and dropping the issue. They could persuade themselves that after the horrors of this past shutdown, it would be a long time before anyone was stupid enough to try shutting down the government again. The rest of us might not be so easily convinced.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/trump-shutdown-targets-democratic-workers-illegal.html,"
          Since the government shutdown began, President Donald Trump has suggested multiple times that the furloughed and unpaid workers are mostly just Democrats.  Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?  he tweeted on Dec. 27, just days after the shutdown began. Trump repeated the claim a little more than a week later, tweeting that he didn t  care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats  and wanted to reopen the government anyway. The not-so-subtle hint here is that Democratic Partyñsupporting federal employees are the main ones harmed by the shutdown, so he doesn t have that much reason to care if they re furloughed or working without pay, or at least he doesn t have as much reason to care as Democrats.
        
          He suggests that congressional Democrats should give into his wall demand because their constituents are being disproportionately harmed. If this is Trump s strategy, then he has a bigger problem than its ineffectiveness. Taking Democratic federal workers hostage because they are Democrats would violate their constitutional rights and their rights under the civil service laws.
        
          First, some background. A recent analysis by the Washington Post suggests that in the 2018 election, federal employees did make significantly more donations to Democratic candidates than Republicans: Between 60 and 80 percent of donations went to Democrats. This may reflect a relatively small number of highly motivated Democrats making a large number of individual contributions, thanks to online donation systems like ActBlue, but it does suggest a Democratic lean in federal workers  political activity. On the other hand, a 2010 Gallup survey (the most recent available) shows the two parties to be close in membership of the federal government: About 27 percent of federal workers in unions are Republican, and 39.5 percent are Democrats. But 32.5 percent of nonunion federal workers are Republican, and about 29 percent are Democrats. (Union membership accounts for only about one quarter of the federal workforce). So Trump is almost certainly correct that his shutdown disproportionately affects Democrats, though perhaps less than he might believe. (Congressional representation of federal workers, for example, is evenly split between the parties.)
        
          The bigger issue here is the law. Since the Pendleton Act of 1883, America s federal workers have been protected from the political patronage systems familiar under President Andrew Jackson and in urban political machines, where political victors would dole out the jobs of the loser s party members to their own supporters. Meanwhile, the landmark Supreme Court case of Elrod v. Burns (1976), which challenged the Chicago political machines, established that patronage practices infringe on the First Amendment rights of all public employees to engage in speech and private political activity without fear of reprisal. As the court recognized, allowing politics to determine who works for the public (outside top-level policy positions) harms both employees and the public.
        
          Public employee legal protections now extend beyond hiring and firing, to any form of  discrimination  based on political affiliation. Under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978,  all employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management without regard to political affiliation   and with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights.  When the president, the chief executive of federal agencies, denies employees pay and forces them to work because of their party, he is engaging in unfair and inequitable personnel management. Note that a harmful act for the purposes of the law can constitute discrimination against members of a group even if it also affects some nonmembers, and it need not be motivated by a direct purpose of harming that group. Intentionally harming members of a protected group with the motive to extract concessions from someone else is also illegal discrimination.
        
          There will be some lawyers  quibbles for instance, that the president has not actually  acted  so as to directly cause harm to the employees (he has, instead, told Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he will not sign any budget unless his wall is funded) or that since the employees are likely to get back pay, they have not been harmed by a management action. But these are flimsy defenses: Trump expressly declared that he personally would  own  the shutdown as his choice of negotiating strategy. And the incremental decisions to recall more and more personnel to work without pay, evidently to minimize damage to the president s base, certainly constitute employment actions. The more important barrier comes from the Supreme Court s decision in Trump v. Hawaii (2018), the  Muslim ban  case, where the court ignored a number of tweets and statements by Trump indicating an anti-Muslim bias. The court said, instead, it would accept the justifications for the immigration restrictions set out later by the Department of Homeland Security. With the Trump shutdown, however, there so far has been no careful elaboration of a legal justification. We have only the president s tweets and statements. A lawsuit challenging the shutdown on discrimination grounds may be able to find further evidence showing that workers  party identity was a central reason Trump chose this strategy.
        
          So far, other constitutional attacks on the shutdown, based in the 13th Amendment s protection against forced labor, have failed. Enterprising state attorneys general and employee lawyers should try the First Amendment and the Civil Service Reform Act instead. The integrity of our civil service depends on it.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/trump-shutdown-inauguration-speech-compare-americas.html,"
          Two years ago this week, Donald Trump was sworn into office. His inaugural address on Jan. 21, 2017, painted a picture of America that was darker and more sinister than many of us had imagined. America, according to Trump that day, suffered from seething corruption in government, rampant criminality in the streets, and hopeless mistrust between its citizens.For many of us, his description was an America we didn t really recognize, a cesspool of greed and fear and hate. He also positioned himself as the man who would fix it.
        
          Two years later, we are padlocked inside the longest shutdown in American history, with 800,000 federal workers who rely upon Trump s government about to miss a second paycheck. Emergency food resources and domestic violence shelters are stretched beyond capacity. Air traffic controllers and pilots warn of horrifying risk for imminent crises. Members of the U.S. Coast Guard are now forced to get food from food pantries. Hundreds of federal workers protested Wednesday in the Senate, culminating in 12 arrests. Considering all of this, I decided to revisit the president s speech to understand whether we re closer or further from the apocalyptic vision he put forth in 2017.
        
          We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.
        
          January 2019: The federal government has been partially shutdown for 34 days because Senate Republicans and Donald Trump will not negotiate its re-opening until he is given $5.7 billion for a border wall.
        
          What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20th 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now.
        
          January 2019: On the 34th day of the government shutdown, polling conducted by CBS News, finds that 71 percent of Americans  don t think the issue of a border wall is worth a government shutdown, which they say is now having a negative impact on the country. 
        
          Today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American People. For too long, a small group in our nation s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
        
          January 2019: As the shutdown grinds on, Trump s daughter Ivanka (a senior adviser to the president) has received five new trademarks from the Chinese government for child care centers, sunglasses, and wedding dresses. Meanwhile, President Trump is himself the subject of multiple ethics and corruption probes that focus on his use of his position to enrich himself and his brand, as are multiple current and former members of his administration and his family.
        
          At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
        
          January 2019: Nine out of 15 federal departments are closed, as well as dozens of agencies. The FDA is not doing routine inspections of seafood, fruits, vegetables, and other foods at high risk of contamination. Federal funding for food assistance programs for women, children, and infants, and those living on Native American reservations has been suspended. Workers at the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Prisons, Customs and Border Protection, the Coast Guard, and the Secret Service are working without pay, while warning of the acute danger of doing so.
        
          The Violence Against Women Act, which supports resources for survivors of domestic violence expired last month. The 19 Smithsonian museums, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, are closed and losing $1 million per week. The National Zoo is closed. Some national parks have closed, and some of the parks that remain open have suffered irreparable damage to wildlife and trees. Immigration courts have closed, forcing judges to postpone already backlogged hearings that had been scheduled months in advance. The Environmental Protection Agency has halted inspections of chemical factories, power plants, oil refineries, water treatment plants, and thousands of other industrial sites.
        
          This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.
        
          January 2019: Billionaire Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross claims he doesn t understand why furloughed federal workers have to go to food banks to feed their families. Lara Trump says federal workers should tolerate  a little bit of pain, but it s going to be for the future of our country.  White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said furloughed federal workers who are not getting paid during the partial government shutdown are  better off  because they didn t have to use up their vacation days.
        
          At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us,  How good and pleasant it is when God s people live together in unity. 
        
          January 2019: Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican, defended the morality of a border wall by saying,  Look, I have four walls around my house and they keep bad people out and critters out.  Hate crimes have increased by 17 percent in the past year, and according to the Anti-Defamation League s latest  Murder and Extremism  report right-wing extremist murders in the U.S. hit a record high for the first time since 1995. Over 10,000 immigrant children have been held in custody at shelters across the nation, to deter migrants from entering the country. (Four lawsuits are proceeding against the Trump administration on their behalf.)
        
          It was a pretty remarkable speech. But two short years later, Donald Trump hasn t solved America s problems. Today we live in a country in which government workers are forced to work without pay, then called  volunteers,  while others are sent home as non-essential. The economy is slowing down as a result of the shutdown, while Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin declines to testify about its economic impact. The government that should be caring for our most vulnerable and protecting us all has been shuttered to punish the opposing party for governance. He s just made our problems more tangible and real.

          There are no longer any meaningful negotiations, or even conversations, taking place on Capitol Hill about how to end the partial government shutdown, now entering its fourth week. And yet despite this complete absence of progress, all players involved are starting to believe that the end is in sight, because there s only one possible end: Trump declaring a national emergency on the border and directing the military to construct  the wall.

That egregious illegality is key to the maneuver s growing bipartisan appeal. Trump, the consensus belief goes, could save face with his base by declaring the emergency and reopening the government. The shutdown would be over, loyalist Republicans in Congress could salute Trump s boldness (and exhale), and Democrats could celebrate that they never wavered from their anti-wall posture. And if (or when) the courts rejected Trump s plan, Democrats could celebrate the administration s legal failure, and Trump could throw up his hands and whine about judicial activism.
        
          Some might call this scenario just more cynical blame-shifting insanity from a craven Congress. But one Democratic aide described it to the Washington Post as an  elegant way out of this mess.  In any event, no one has a better idea. No one.
        
          It s not that progress toward a solution was ever being made during this shutdown. But now even the performative photo-ops giving the appearance of good-faith discussion have ceased. Those ended on Wednesday, when President Trump said  bye-bye  to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and walked out of a meeting. That meeting, like previous meetings, followed this rough script: Trump asked Pelosi if there was any way he could convince her to provide wall money, or if she would be more amenable to negotiating wall money if he first reopened the government. Pelosi said no and no.
        
          Some Republican senators, led by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, tried to occupy the void of ideas earlier this week by reviving discussions about going  big : trying to offer Democrats some sort of protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or Temporary Protected Status beneficiaries in exchange for $5.7 billion in wall money. Democrats, though, believe (with good reason) that Trump would back out of any tentative agreement to trade  amnesty  the minute Ann Coulter and the Republican base threatened revolt. And Trump believes he ll have a stronger hand in DACA negotiations if the Supreme Court decides to take the case and rules that he has the right to terminate the program. So he s not inclined to tie DACA to the wall right now anyway.
        
          By Thursday, Graham s big idea had been whittled down to a procedural play. The Senate Appropriations Committee would take up Trump s $5.7 billion request, open it to amendment, and send the finished product to the floor, all while Trump signed bills to reopen the government. And then once the government was open   that part s unclear. The inability of this plan to secure any wall money was so obvious that even Trump could immediately recognize it. As Politico reported, he nixed the plan when Vice President Mike Pence and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney presented it to him.
        
          With his small idea rejected, Graham arrived at the conclusion that most of Congress had already come around to:  I think we re stuck,  Graham told reporters.  I just don t see a pathway forward. I don t see a way forward. 
        
           I have never been more depressed about moving forward than I am right now,  he added.
        
          By Friday afternoon, Graham was fully on team #declaretheemergency.
        
          Indeed, Democrats will not negotiate on building the wall, and certainly won t do so in response to the president taking government workers hostage. They might be able to negotiate on further non-wall border security, but Trump is single-minded in his pursuit of a physical barrier.
        
          Barring some stroke of legislative genius this weekend that manages to reconcile irreconcilable, dug-in positions wall vs. no wall and doesn t settle for face-saving procedural gimmicks about setting up Senate debates that go nowhere, the legislative options for resolving this shutdown are exhausted. Trump, as of Friday afternoon, was still holding out some hope that Congress might reach a deal, saying that he was  not going to [declare the emergency] so fast.  But all Congress is doing is waiting for the president to declare the national emergency and the stimulus package for constitutional lawyers that comes with it. The case could be tied up in courts for years. But at least the government would be open again.
        
          That would have been a great last line of this story, but North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, chairman of the Freedom Caucus and one of Trump s closest congressional allies, told reporters Thursday that Trump may wait to reopen the government while he awaits the outcome in court.
        
           Declaring a national emergency and funding the government are two separate decisions,  Meadows said.
        
          It s hard to imagine Trump would keep the government shut down indefinitely as the legal system works its will, and it might be enough for Congress to start thinking about overriding the presidential veto. But crazier things have happened in a national emergency.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/trump-shutdown-wall-talking-points.html,"
          To: Congressional RepublicansFrom: The White HouseRe: Talking points on the shutdown
        
          Over the past two weeks, we ve noticed that many of you are having trouble articulating where our party stands in the present impasse. You seem confused about whether we support or oppose the shutdown, what we re waiting for, and what we re trying to accomplish. We encourage you, as always, to follow the president s lead. Here are the points he has emphasized since Dec. 11, when he met with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in front of TV cameras.
        
          1. The president opposes the shutdown. During the Dec. 11 meeting, he made his position clear:  I d like not to see a government closing, a shutdown.  On Dec. 13, he repeated,  Let s not do a shutdown, Democrats.  To prove his sincerity, the president stayed in the White House over Christmas. On Wednesday, he pleaded,  Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people this is the first and most important duty of government. 
        
          2. Democrats forced the shutdown. During the Dec. 11 meeting, the president warned against a  Pelosi shutdown.  On Dec. 21, he said it would be a  Democrat shutdown.  After Republicans voted to fund a border wall, he announced,  The Democrats now own the shutdown!  On Sunday, he called it the  #SchumerShutdown. 
        
          3. Democrats feared the shutdown. On Dec. 11, the president told Schumer,  You don t want to shut down the government, Chuck. Because the last time you shut it down, you got killed.  Later, as the cameras continued to record him, the president repeated this message. This is a complex point that must be carefully explained in all media opportunities: Although congressional Democrats will stop at nothing to force a shutdown, they are also cowards who dread another government closure.
        
          4. The president forced the shutdown.  If we don t get what we want,  he told Schumer on Dec. 11,  I will shut down the government.   I will be the one to shut it down. I m not going to blame you for it.   I will take the mantle of shutting down.  On Wednesday, at a televised Cabinet meeting, the vice president praised the president for taking  a strong stand to shut down the government until we secure the funding to build a wall.  The president responded,  That s right, Mike. Thank you very much. It s true.  The shutdown is regrettable and took the president by surprise. However, he is a strong leader who takes responsibility for making the decision to close the government.
        
          5. The president saw the shutdown as a leverage opportunity. On Dec. 21, just before the government closed, the president declared that Republicans were  totally prepared for a very long shutdown. And this is our only chance that we ll ever have   to get great border security.  On Saturday, he explained that he had tried at other times to get Senate Democrats to support his border-security agenda, but  now we have to do it the hard way, with a Shutdown.  So although the president regrets that Democrats caused the shutdown, he has been planning for some time to force this confrontation and exploit it.
        
          6. The president will decide when to end the shutdown. On Dec. 25, he stipulated that  until we have a wall   we re just not opening.  At the Wednesday Cabinet meeting, a reporter asked about the $5 billion we have requested for the wall:  How long are you willing to keep the government shut down, then, in order to get that $5.6 billion?  The president replied,  As long as it takes.  So let s be clear: The president is firmly in control. It is the Democrats, however, who went on vacation and are responsible for dragging out the shutdown.
        
          7. The shutdown is just one of many threats the president plans to use. On Dec. 20, he warned Democrats,  I will not sign any of their legislation, including infrastructure, unless it has perfect Border Security.  On Dec. 28, he also threatened to  close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall.  So the shutdown was destructive and unnecessary, and the president wants to get back to work. But in case his demands aren t met, he has identified other legislation and business he can disrupt.
        
          8. The people hurt by the shutdown are Democrats. On Dec. 27, the president asked,  Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?  His point was clear: Pelosi and Schumer should fund the wall because otherwise their furloughed supporters will continue to suffer. Remember to remind the public, however, that the president loves all Americans regardless of party, cares about the furloughed workers, and in no way staged the shutdown with the intent to use them as expendable hostages.
        
          9. The wall is being built anyway.  Tremendous amounts of wall have already been built,  the president observed on Dec. 11.  And we will continue that.  On Dec. 25, he added,  So while we re fighting over funding, we re also building.  In remarks during the shutdown, he has repeatedly described hundreds of miles of wall construction that are underway regardless of the current budget dispute. This does not, however, support the argument by Pelosi and Schumer that closing the government to fund the wall was unnecessary.
        
          10. The wall has already secured the border. As the president pointed out on Dec. 11,  Despite the large Caravans that WERE forming and heading to our Country, people have not been able to get through our newly built Walls, makeshift Walls & Fences.   Our Southern Border is now Secure and will remain that way.  By reinforcing this message, you can reassure Americans who might be alarmed by recent suggestions that the government had to be shut down because the border was not secure.
        
          11. Mexico is paying for the wall. On Dec. 13, the president tweeted,  I often stated,  One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.  This has never changed.  On Dec. 19, he explained the revenue stream:  Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA!  On Monday and Wednesday, he again emphasized,  Mexico is paying for the Wall.  This assurance should comfort anyone who worries that without the U.S. government funds we are demanding, the wall won t be built.
        
          12. The military will build the wall. Although the wall has been built and paid for by Mexico, and although we urgently need new U.S. government funds to complete it, the president has arranged to finish it using current military resources.  If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall,  he announced on Dec. 11. On Dec. 19, he repeated that  the United States Military will build the Wall!  On Wednesday, he thanked the armed forces for working  really hard over the last, actually, four or five weeks  to facilitate wall construction covering  a tremendous amount of miles. 
        
          This, in sum, is our message to the public: The border is secure. The wall has been funded and is well underway. The military, with existing resources, is building it. Mexico is paying for it. Everything was going well until Democrats, traumatized by the last shutdown, decided to stage another one. The president tried to avert this crisis, but he is a strong leader. He knows that our border is being overrun and must be sealed. That s why he has prepared for months to close the government in order to force Congress to pay for the wall. It s up to Democrats to end the shutdown. But the president won t reopen the government till his demands are met.
        
          We hope these talking points are helpful as you plan for your public remarks and media opportunities. Follow the president, and Americans will always know where you stand.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/mick-mulvaney-says-trump-ready-to-shut-down-government-again-over-wall.html,"
          A mere two days after the longest government shutdown in U.S. history ended, the White House is making clear that President Donald Trump is ready to do it all over again if he doesn t get funding for a border wall.  Yeah, actually I think he is,  acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on CBS  Face the Nation when he was asked if the president is willing to shut the government down again.  He is willing to do whatever it takes to secure the border. He does take this very seriously. This is a serious humanitarian and security crisis.  Mulvaney did say that Trump  doesn t want to shut the government down  and expressed optimism that the  negotiations are far from over. 
        
          Trump himself appeared to try to lay some pressure on Democrats by sending a series of tweets that pushed the need for a border wall.  BUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL!  he tweeted. Trump also retweeted a portion of an interview with counselor Kellyanne Conway that mentions the threat of heroin coming through the southern border.
        
          Trump also tried to make an economic argument for combating illegal immigration.  We are not even into February and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168. Cost Friday was $603,331,392. There are at least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not the 11,000,000 that have been reported for years, in our Country. So ridiculous! DHS,  Trump wrote. Although he signs off the tweet with  Department of Homeland Security,  he didn t cite a source for the numbers. Analysts have characterized Trump s estimates of the cost of undocumented immigrants as absurd.
        
          Mulvaney acknowledged he didn t know where the president got the figures, but emphasized that what is important is the overall message.  I m not exactly sure where the president got that number this morning, but I think what you see him trying to do is point out how silly this debate is,  Mulvaney said.  This is not that much money in the greater scheme of things.  He also defended the president s claim that that the number of undocumented immigrants in the country is larger than 11 million.  We know that it s going up because we know, for example, that 60,000 new illegals are coming across each month for the last three months. Again, a number that is not made up,  Mulvaney said.  That is a real number. So we know the number has to be larger than 11 million. I ve seen ranges as high, I think, of 30 or 40 million.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/another-shutdown-looms-border-security-negotiations.html,"
          Looks like we re back at impasse as new questions are emerging over whether congressional negotiators will be able to seal a deal to prevent another government shutdown by the Friday deadline. There was optimism that negotiations on border security would make progress over the weekend to finalize a deal by Monday so lawmakers could vote and prevent yet another government shutdown. But Democrats and Republicans appear to be at an impasse and now aides on both sides are debating whether they need to be considering backstop alternatives to at least temporarily avert a shutdown. Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby didn t sound too optimistic Sunday as he acknowledged talks had stalled.  I ll say 50/50 we ll get a deal,  Shelby said on Fox News Sunday. Shelby said that while  we re hoping we can get there,  he was  not confident  a deal could be reached through the weekend.
        
          Shelby pointed the finger at Democrats for the stalled talks, saying they wanted to put a cap on the number of beds at immigration detention centers. Although negotiators appear to have come close to agreeing on the amount of funding for a border wall, Democrats are reportedly saying they will only agree to more money for the barrier if there is a cap on beds, which Republicans are resisting.  Time is ticking away but we got some problems with the Democrats dealing with ICE,  he said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
        
          Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat who is one of the key negotiators, sounded a bit more optimistic, saying that while a deal can t be announced yet,  negotiations are still going on.  Tester told Fox News Sunday that he has  confidence that hopefully we will get something done very soon.  Meanwhile, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney made sure to emphasize that a shutdown was still most definitely a possibility.  The government shutdown is technically still on the table,  Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.  We do not want it to come to that but that option is still open to the president and will remain so.  Speaking on NBC s Meet the Press, Mulvaney said President Donald Trump may not have a choice.  Let s say the hardcore, left wing of the Democrat Party prevails in this negotiation and they put a bill on the president s desk with, say, zero money for the wall, or $800 million, an absurdly low number. How does he sign that?  Mulvaney said.
        
          President Donald Trump weighed in on the stalled negotiations Sunday, sending out a pair of tweets in which he unsurprisingly pointed the finger at Democrats, who are  offering very little money  for the wall. Trump blamed the Democratic leadership, saying that they were making it difficult for negotiators to make a deal. The president speculated that Democrats may want to shut down the government to take attention away from other issues.  It was a very bad week for the Democrats, with the GREAT economic numbers, The Virginia disaster and the State of the Union address  Trump wrote.  Now, with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee, I actually believe they want a Shutdown. They want a new subject! 
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/americans-blame-trump-gop-for-shutdown-as-support-for-wall-increases.html,"
          Before the partial government shutdown began, President Donald Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with Democratic leaders that he would be  proud to shut down the government for border security.  And now it seems Americans have picked up on that message and hold him, along with congressional Republicans, largely responsible for what is  the longest government shutdown in history, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll. And it isn t even close. More than half 53 percent of Americans blame Trump and Republicans in Congress for the shutdown, while only 29 percent say Democrat are at fault and 13 percent say both are to blame. That is in line with a CNN poll that showed 55 percent say Trump is to blame for the shutdown, while 32 percent point the finger mostly at Democrats.
        
          As could be expected, there is a clear partisan split in the blame with 85 percent of Democrats putting responsibility on Trump and Republicans and 68 percent of Republicans saying Democrats are at fault. Independents are the tie breakers as 53 percent say they blame Trump and Republicans rather than Democrats (23 percent), according to the Washington Post/ABC News poll.
        
          Even as Americans blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, support for the border wall has reached an all-time high. Those who support a wall has increased to 42 percent, up from 34 percent in January of last year. A slight majority of Americans 54 percent oppose the wall, a number that has decreased from a year ago when it was at 63 percent. That change is largely due to an increase in support among Republicans. Support for the wall among Republicans has soared 16 percentage points to 87 percent. But that doesn t mean Americans think there is a crisis at the border. Only 24 percent see it that way, and even among those who support the wall, only 46 percent say the situation has reached a crisis.
        
          For the vast majority of Americans, the effects of the government shutdown continue to be largely abstract. While 18 percent of Americans say they have been inconvenienced by the shutdown, only 7 percent say it has been a major problem. Still, that shouldn t be seen as a sign that the shutdown can last indefinitely. Seventy-nine percent of Americans said the shutdown would be a serious problem or crisis if it continues for months.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/trump-wall-budget-shutdown-ice-detention-beds-border.html,"
          With another potential shutdown looming this week, congressional negotiators say they have come to a tentative agreement that would avoid another bruising government stoppage but would not meet President Trump s demands for a border wall. Negotiators from both sides sounded optimistic about the deal Monday that would fund a border barrier to the tune of $1.375 billion, including 55 miles of new fencing, according to the Washington Post. This, of course, falls far short of Trump s proposed $5-plus billion boondoggle to build 200 miles of an arbitrary wall, an ultimatum that was issued via monthlong temper tantrum.
        
          Republicans had largely abandoned the $5 billion number following the 35-day shutdown that took a toll on the party s support. With the temporary funding measure that temporarily reopened the government set to expire Friday,  Democrats backed down from their demand on tight limits on detention beds that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement could use to detain undocumented immigrants, pulling away from a push that that led to a breakdown in talks over the weekend,  according to the Post.  Negotiators felt the deal would prove sufficient to fund all government operations through the end of the September, potentially removing any more shutdown threats for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
        
          Whether Trump will sign off on the deal without something he can spin as a wall is another matter altogether. The White House has floated other means to build its version of a wall, including declaring a national emergency and using executive power to direct funds from the federal budget toward wall construction.  We can call it anything. We ll call it barriers, we ll call it whatever they want,  Trump said Monday before shifting focus to the ICE detention issue.  But now it turns out not only don t they want to give us money for a wall, they don t want to give us the space to detain murderers, criminals, drug dealers, human smugglers. 
        
          So will this notoriously thin-skinned president sign off on the deal? Perhaps ask Ann Coulter or Rush Limbaugh or the Fox and Friends gang. Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he believes the White House will back the agreement.  We believe from our dealings with them and the latitude they ve given us, they will support it,  Selby said.  We certainly hope so.

          With Democrats now in charge of the House of Representatives, and the country nearing a fifth week of the disastrous Trump shutdown, progressives are beginning to feel new momentum. But while Democrats may be poised to win the short-term political argument over the shutdown, the pain and suffering it has inflicted are part of a long-term right-wing strategy that s older and broader than many people realize. That strategy involved a decades-long campaign to turn everything from the courts to the Congress to the country s overall cultural character sharply rightward by stigmatizing forms of collective action government, unions, even voting that history shows are necessary counterweights to the greed of the powerful.
        
          This long-game effort calls for an equal and opposite strategy: something that will bolster the promising, if disparate, elements of the resistance mass protests, diverse candidates, grass-roots door-knocking, bold policy ideas by offering a sustained, deep story about the positive role government plays in American life. To change the narrative effectively, progressives should launch a long-term persuasion campaign designed to restore belief in government.
        
          This campaign should draw lessons from the right-wing playbook and should also take elements from the last great successful progressive persuasion push: the movement to shift public opinion on LGBTQ equality. As with that transformation, which involved rejecting shame and timidity to insist that  gay is good,  this campaign should reinvigorate the understanding that  government is good,  and integrate a values-driven narrative alongside organizing, legislating, and other methods of change.
        
          The right s campaign to demonize government took root in 1971, when future Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell penned a revolutionary memo calling for a corporate counterinsurgency against efforts to use government to humanize the free market. His proposal was not simply to fill the courts with corporate-friendly judges, but to marshal  the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business   against  liberal foes.
        
          Alongside a pro-corporate lobbying and litigation campaign, Powell urged full-scale information warfare in which no tool of communication would go unleveraged: infiltration of media networks, monitoring of textbooks, a speakers bureau, student groups, and think tanks all would be used  over an indefinite period of years  to valorize markets and corporations, cripple labor unions, and vilify liberals and government. In the rise of Trumpism, this 50-year effort is showering its patrons with dividends while pummeling democracy in the process.
        
          Surprisingly, the left has no comparable infrastructure dedicated to driving a consistent narrative about what progressives want to accomplish and why. Despite consensus on the left around broad goals greater economic and racial equality, a democracy less corrupted by powerful interests, a sustainable environment, and protection of the most vulnerable too many Americans seem unclear what progressives stand for beyond horror at Trump and the GOP.
        
          We propose this unifying thread: Government is essential to making our country better and preserving democracy against oligarchy. Our vision of  government is good  will have crossover appeal to millions of people who don t identify as left of center. Some 58 percent of Americans believe the government should do more to solve our country s problems. Even among Republicans, 28 percent favor a more active government, more than double the number that did in 2010. A solid majority of Americans even favor the once-radical idea of a federal jobs guarantee. Americans from both parties are also quite happy, in their real lives, to rely on government. The average American has used 4.5 government programs, and the share of her income that comes from federal transfers jumped from 7 percent in 1969 to 17 percent in 2014.
        
          Polls also show that between three-fifths and three-quarters of Americans support the progressive policy agenda: single-payer health insurance; strong labor unions; campaign finance limits; robust action on climate change, gun control, and criminal justice reform; the right to abortion and the freedom to marry; a higher minimum wage; legalized marijuana; and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. These figures help explain how Democrats made unprecedented gains on Election Day largely on a platform of activist government. Further, voters in three solidly red states Utah, Nebraska and Idaho voted to expand Medicaid.
        
          Americans  support for these proposals and candidates seems at odds with their low levels of trust in government, a gap dubbed the  government-citizen disconnect  by Cornell professor Suzanne Mettler. Here, again, is where conservatives  long-term investment in framing a narrative has clearly been rewarded. The shutdown, though, could even be a wake-up call to many conservative, rural voters those historically most hostile to government who rely on it disproportionately, and suffer in its absence.
        
          In truth, of course, America has a noble history of government activism, from building this nation s financial and physical infrastructure to creating Social Security and cutting poverty in half with the New Deal and the Great Society. Progressives should reach back to this history to move forward. As Franklin Roosevelt noted, our nation s early settlers regarded government  as their greatest single instrument of cooperative self-help  and  an indispensable instrument of their daily lives. 
        
          In putting together this strategy, there s a successful model upon which to draw. Fifty years ago, most gay men and lesbians could scarcely dream of sharing their stories with the public, let alone seeing marriages recognized by the state. But driven by the ferment of the 1960s, and the onslaught of the AIDS epidemic, activists built a movement based on turning shame into pride, and insisting to the world that  gay is good.  Over time, we built infrastructure that mastered effective ways of communicating our vision of LGBTQ equality. What worked, we learned, was telling the stories of our lives in ways that evoked emotion and shared values such as love and commitment to increase acceptance of LGBTQ people, and then translating that approval into policy triumphs.
        
           What if you couldn t marry the person you love?  asked a 2008 ad depicting a bride stumbling down an aisle cluttered by obstacles, unable to reach her groom. While the majority of Californians voted to ban marriage equality during that year s battle over Proposition s 8, in Santa Barbara where the ad was field-tested voters rejected the ban by 10 percentage points. Eventually, love won.
        
          What would an effective persuasion infrastructure look like for winning similar victories toward a progressive future? First, just as our movement championed the freedom to marry as both a goal in itself, and a strategy for promoting a broader vision of equality and inclusion, active government should be extolled as both a necessary check on concentrated power and an instrument for renewing investment in the civic space we share as Americans.
        
          Second, just as the Freedom to Marry mantra was  there is no marriage without engagement,  a persuasion infrastructure would research and test ways to engage the reachable-but-not-yet-reached; invest in the means and messengers that move them; and enlist a multitude of institutional voices to deliver a persistent drumbeat for change, as Lewis Powell urged conservatives to do. How could the suffering inflicted by the shutdown, for instance, be deployed in a  government is good  version of the Santa Barbara marriage equality ad? Perhaps it would feature poignant images of  We want to work  banners held up by furloughed government employees desperate to pay their rent, along with stories of Americans harmed that vividly show all the ways we rely on government from aviation security to protecting national parks to, yes, paying taxes.
        
          None of this means poll-testing the public to choose our values, but leading with our values and learning what works. Progressives should cultivate and deploy our best and brightest to share powerful stories of all that Americans have achieved through government: protecting food and water from pollution; building highways, dams, great cities, and a thriving middle class; expanding inclusion, equality, and freedom; literally reaching the moon.
        
          Finally, we should apply the latest research on how to change hearts and minds: Appealing to emotions and empathy works far better than arguing policy using reason and debate. For example, as former Freedom to Marry campaign director Marc Solomon described in Slate, voters in three key November 2018 ballot initiatives gave decisive support to policies protecting marginalized groups. The campaigns on behalf of rights for transgender Americans, people convicted of a felony, and undocumented immigrants explicitly drew on lessons from the marriage equality movement:  Build a connection between the affected group and voters through the sharing of genuine human stories.  Tying authenticity and perseverance to research on how to move people is pretty basic, but surprisingly effective when done in a sustained and strategic way.
        
          Reclaiming government cannot rely on communications alone. We must simultaneously rebuild trust in government by pushing and helping our political leaders to advance policies that genuinely serve the many rather than the few. A  Green New Deal  could be a promising start, as is the broad Democratic reform bill already introduced in the new House. But durable, successful change also requires civic engagement and the vision of possibility that inspires it.Marshaling that engagement, in turn, requires a savvy understanding of how driving a narrative, telling a clear and powerful story over and over, can mobilize public opinion.
        
          We ve had versions of this fight before.  I regard this contest as one to determine who shall rule this free country the people through their governmental agents, or a few ruthless and domineering men whose wealth makes them peculiarly formidable because they hide behind the breastworks of corporate organization,  declared Republican President Teddy Roosevelt during a similar struggle a century ago to address economic inequality, social injustice, and the concentration of power in the hands of the rich. Restoring such belief in government in a way that results in concrete action will be the key to ensuring that our democracy not only survives Trump, but thrives once again.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/trump-shutdown-food-stamps-snap-benefits-continue-february-budget.html,"
          The Trump administration announced Tuesday that Americans that rely Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, commonly known as food stamps, will not have those benefits shut off at the end of the month due to the shutdown, even if the government closure continues. As the practical reality of the prolonged shutdown of parts of the federal government has sunk in, there was growing concern about the 38 million low-income individuals who rely on monthly food benefits and if the government would be able to continue the subsidy.
        
          The Agriculture Department said it can ensure the food benefits get distributed without an appropriation by relying on a budget provision that allows the federal government to make some payments up to 30 days after a budgeted period s end, in this case Dec. 21. That gives the administration until Jan. 20 to provide states with the money to fund February food stamps. It remains unclear what will happen if the shutdown continues, as President Trump has said he s willing to do; the Agriculture Department has a $3 billion contingency fund for food stamps, which covers only a portion of the $5 billion spent monthly on the assistance.
        
           States are responsible for taking federal SNAP funds and loading them onto debit cards for program enrollees to spend on food at grocery stores,  HuffPost notes.  The average benefits come to about $123 per month per person.  Other government entitlements like Social Security and Medicare are unaffected by the shutdown.

          Transportation Security Administration officers are increasingly calling out sick ever since the partial government shutdown began on Dec. 22 and forced personnel to work without pay. CNN was first to report the story, saying that hundreds of TSA officers called out sick from work this past week. One source even called it a  blue flu,  in reference to the blue shirts that the security officers who check bags at airports wear.  This will definitely affect the flying public who we [are] sworn to protect,  Hydrick Thomas, president of the national TSA employee union, told CNN.
        
          Some of the numbers are staggering. More than 150 TSA employees called out sick on Friday morning at Kennedy International Airport in New York, reports the New York Times. At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the number of TSA officers who are calling out sick has increased by 200 to 300 percent, according to CNN. Although some contend the sick call outs could be a form of protest, union officials say it s more likely that those who are calling out sick are simply trying to arrange temporary work to earn a bit of cash.
        
          The Department of Homeland Security reacted angrily to the CNN report, with a. spokesman labeling it as  fake news  and denying the problem existed.  More #FakeNews from @CNN. Security operations at airports have not been impacted by a non-existent sick out,  Tyler Houlton wrote on Twitter. But the TSA later essentially confirmed the report, saying there had been an increase in employees calling out sick but denying that the trend had affected operations.  Call outs began over the Holiday period and have increased, but are causing minimal impact given there are 51,739 employees supporting the screening process,  the TSA said. The TSA also warned that if the  number of call outs  increase wait times could also rise.
        
          President Donald Trump later weighed in on the issue and praised Houlton for his tweet, calling CNN  a proud member of the Opposition Party. 
        
          The president s criticism led CNN to send out its own tweet defending its reporting, noting it had talked to  numerous TSA & union officials  for the report.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/trump-rejects-democratic-funding-plan-to-reopen-government-without-wall-money.html,"
          Democrats have settled on a plan. Shortly after the party takes control of the House of Representatives Thursday they will vote on a package of measures to reopen the federal government. The plan essentially involves two bills that split funding for the Department of Homeland Security and border security with the goal of ensuring that those that enjoy bipartisan support can make it through. The New York Times explains:
        
          The move is in large part designed to put Trump in a corner and pressure him to cave or take responsibility for keeping a large part of the federal government shut over the president s demand for wall money. For now, it seems the president isn t willing to budge.
        
          In the middle of tweetstorm that included lots of New Year vitriol, Trump also used the first day of the year to make clear that he would not support the Democratic plan to reopen the government without money for a wall along the border with Mexico.  The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative!  Trump tweeted.  The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security - and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!  That repeated a theme from a tweet from the previous day, when Trump said Democrats  will probably submit a Bill, being cute as always, which gives everything away but gives NOTHING to Border Security, namely the Wall.  The problem is that  Without the Wall there can be no Border Security,  he wrote in the last day of 2018.
        
          Trump went on to claim that all of these latest developments have  proven  that  Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring! 
        
          Democrats, meanwhile, are accusing Trump of promoting the shutdown, which entered its 11th day Tuesday.  While @realDonaldTrump drags the nation into #TrumpShutdown Week 2 and sits in the White House & tweets, without offering any plan that can pass both chambers of Congress, Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess,  Rep. Nancy Pelosi tweeted Monday as she promoted the Democratic plan to reopen the government. Although Pelosi said it  would be the height of irresponsibility & political cynicism for Senate Republicans to now reject the same legislation they have already supported,  it seems Republicans are willing to do just that. For now, GOP lawmakers appear happy to follow Trump s lead on this and have said they won t approve anything that doesn t have the president s approval.  It s simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won t sign,  Don Stewart, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/trump-shutdown-gop-brinkmanship.html,"
          We are in the midst of a historic government shutdown. While polls suggest that Trump and the GOP are taking the brunt of the blame for it, some Republicans and members of the media argue that  it takes two to tango. 
        
          Both sidesñism isn t the answer, though. The history of shutdowns gives clear guidance about which side is responsible: the side that rejects continuing budget resolutions in order to force a change in the status quo. In this shutdown, that has clearly been Trump and congressional Republicans.
        
          The conflict ties directly into a pre-existing academic debate about how and why parties play  constitutional hardball.  As Joey Fishkin and David Pozen wrote in a recent Columbia Law Review article titled  Asymmetric Constitutional Hardball,  the political science literature on asymmetric polarization and political structures demonstrates that Republicans are now the party that is more likely to escalate constitutional battles.
        
          Replying in the Columbia Law Review to Fishkin and Pozen, David Bernstein offered a contrary interpretation suggesting both sides are to blame:  If the President and Congress are unable to reach a compromise that would lead the President to sign a spending bill passed by Congress, both the President and Congress played constitutional hardball to shut down the government.  His case is unconvincing.
        
          Bernstein points to what he calls the  Reagan and Bush shutdowns  to argue that both parties engage in this sort of constitutional brinkmanship. Essentially, he claims that congressional Democrats working with Republican presidents used constitutional brinkmanship to shut down the government throughout the  80s and early  90s. Looking at each of these so-called shutdowns, however, it s clear that there really weren t  Reagan and Bush shutdowns  of any practical significance, and Bernstein s both sidesñism isn t justified.
        
          The 1981  shutdown,  the first of Bernstein s list of nine such events, lasted just two days with one furlough day, while the 1982  shutdown  was actually just a one-day-long accidental stoppage. The remaining shutdowns under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush were not accidental, but according to the Washington Post, they were remarkably short: three, three, two, one, one, one, and three days, respectively.
        
          When the New York Times examined the question in 1995 just prior to the Gingrich-Clinton shutdown, it found there had only been four previous short-lived furloughs for a grand total of one day, two afternoons, and a long weekend of government workers being sent home. I grew up in the D.C. area in the 1980s and early 1990s, the child of a nonessential federal employee, and I have no recollection of these furloughs, probably because they were nonevents.
        
          In fact, short funding gaps often do not constitute shutdowns at all, which means no real constitutional  hardball  was played in the circumstances cited by Bernstein. Even in the current shutdown, for about 10 days, departments and agencies were able to run on  carryover cash.  But since then, the effects have caused unavoidable damage. The Reagan and Bush funding gaps seem to have produced no major harm.
        
          In light of these details, it makes sense that Fishkin and Pozen did not include these minor events in their analysis of who plays constitutional  hardball. 
        
          Bernstein s view of shutdowns is that each party is equally responsible: It takes both Congress and the president, effectively both parties, to tango. However, this is not how shutdowns play out, practically, politically, and legislatively. When the president and Congress reach a budget impasse, the conventional next step is to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government funded at the status quo, to extend the previous budget while negotiations continue.
        
          Every once in a while, one side says,  No, no continuing resolution unless we get X, a change in the status quo.  Practically and politically, the side that rejects the continuing resolution because of a demand to change the status quo is the side bearing more responsibility for the shutdown. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Presidents Reagan and Bush were generally seeking changes to the status quo in terms of budget cuts, but Democrats often had their own demands as well. But because both sides generally shared responsibility and had relatively balanced sets of demands, each impasse was resolved quickly with minimal furloughs, if any. There was not much hardball played on either side.
        
          Again, the shutdowns of the mid-1990s and the 2010s have been different. In 1995, Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole passed a continuing resolution that did not extend the status quo but increased Medicare premiums, deregulated environmental policies, and included a balanced-budget requirement. Clinton wanted a status quo continuing resolution. The impasse led to two shutdowns, lasting a total of about four weeks, that were far more significant than anything that came before them. Yes, Clinton vetoed the GOP measure that modified the status quo, but he spoke out forcefully against shutdowns and sought to keep the government open during negotiations. As seen in that shutdown and this one, the continuation of the status quo is the nature of norms and conventions, and the changing of the status quo is the nature of hardball.
        
          The 2013 shutdown involved a similar dynamic as that of 1995ñ96: House Republicans were able to get Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and President Barack Obama to compromise closer to the Republican budget numbers. But Sen. Ted Cruz and the Tea Party House members blew up the deal in order to try to get Obama to sign a bill defunding his signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. This version of hardball was obviously never going to succeed, but the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party was able to force the entire caucus to shut down the government for half of October. Again, the capacity of the right-wing backbenchers of the Republican Party to have this kind of control over its leadership in 2013 confirms Fishkin and Pozen s understanding of who plays hardball.
        
          Democrats were more responsible for the January 2018 shutdown, because they were pushing for the change in the status quo for immigration reform and DACA. That shutdown, though, lasted only from a Saturday through a Monday, effectively a one-day furlough. And the Democrats essentially folded, without any concrete concessions. So much for hardball.
        
          Ultimately, in the 2018ñ19 shutdown, Trump is the one to blame because he has rejected the status quo of continuing resolutions in favor of demanding new funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump has even famously acknowledged that this was his asymmetrical decision, having told Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi,  I will be the one to shut it down. I m not going to blame you for it.  Trump has not lived up to that promise, as he increasingly tries to blame Democrats the longer the shutdown lasts. However, this history helps us attribute responsibility and blame to the side rejecting continuing resolutions and the status quo, regardless of whatever the president might tweet.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/house-republicans-forgot-roll-call-democrats-shutdown-bill.html,"
          House Republicans haven t been in the minority in eight years. And in a slapstick scene on the House floor Thursday afternoon, the rust showed.
        
          The House was voting on another stopgap bill to reopen the government, this one until Feb. 28. Nearly all House Republicans routinely have voted against House Democratic spending bills over the last two weeks in an effort to stay in lockstep with President Trump s demand for border wall funding. And it s important to their messaging that they show unity against the Democratic bills.
        
          When the bill came up, the Democrat presiding over the House, North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, called for a voice vote and declared the resolution passed. This is a standard majority move. What s supposed to happen afterward, though, is for a member who wants a recorded vote to call for a recorded vote. The Republican at the lectern responsible for this task was Kentucky Rep. Brett Guthrie. Either he didn t call for the recorded vote, or Butterfield didn t hear him. (If Guthrie did say something, it s certainly not audible on the C-SPAN replay.) Butterfield waited about 30 seconds and then moved on to the next item of business.
        
          In other words, because no roll call vote was requested, the Democratic bill to reopen the government had just passed without Republicans recording their objection. On paper, that might look like House Republicans had sided with Democrats to defy President Trump and reopen the government without wall funding.
        
          Some Republicans, realizing the messaging snafu that took place while they were tuned out, stayed in the chamber and tried to convince Butterfield, and Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, that Guthrie totally called for the recorded vote. Butterfield and Hoyer insisted that they didn t hear it. When Republican Whip Steve Scalise offered a series of ideas for redoing the vote, Hoyer noted that most of his members were already at the airport so, eh, sorry.
        
          Things then got noisy. Ohio Rep. Warren Davidson, a Republican Freedom Caucus member, walked over to the Democratic side, pointing at Butterfield and shouting at him that he heard Guthrie. Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, too, was shouting indiscriminately.
        
          When GOP Rep. Jason Smith screamed at the Democrats,  Go back to Puerto Rico!  an apparent reference to a Congressional Hispanic Caucus trip to the island last week, where Republicans accused them of  partying  during the shutdown Democrats jeered loudly.
        
          Eventually, Hoyer and Scalise talked privately, and Hoyer left the floor. I saw him about 15 minutes later emerging from Speaker Pelosi s office, and he confirmed that he d decided to give Republicans another shot: They would vacate the voice vote and try again next week. House Republican PR failure averted.
        
          Talking to some Republican members after the vote, they   were not so sure that Guthrie had called for the recorded vote after all.
        
           I wear two hearing aids, so I m the worst one to ask,  one member told me.
        
          Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar said he certainly saw Guthrie standing at the lectern, but didn t hear the objection.  There was a lot of commotion,  he said as a caveat. He said further that he had heard stories like this about Pelosi s bag of tricks, and that Republicans had better wake up when they re on the floor.
        
           We were warned I wasn t here when Pelosi was in the speakership before that she is known for this,  he said.  She is known for quick votes, sending people out, all of a sudden having a [unanimous consent] vote when nobody is around. She s known for this. 
        
           So plenty of us now are very aware of it,  he said,  and [this] brings it to a point that we re going to have to be on guard. And leadership is going to have to be on guard as well. 
        
          North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, the Freedom Caucus chairman, could barely disguise his grin afterward when asked whether he heard Guthrie call for the recorded vote.  I think there s a question about that,  he said, before saying very diplomatically:  I think at this point, I have no reason to question Mr. Butterfield s integrity. Let s put it that way. 
        
          I asked Meadows if this was an episode of Republicans getting used to life without the gavel.
        
           I think there could be a little bit of that,  he said.  You just have to understand: You have to ask for votes.

          Flight attendants work for airlines, and so they have, of course, been getting paid for the past five weeks, setting them apart from airport colleagues like TSA screeners, air traffic controllers, and customs agents. But it was Sara Nelson, the head of the flight attendants  union, who made the most forceful call for worker solidarity in the face of the shutdown. At an award dinner on Sunday, she called on the labor movement at large to stand up for federal workers:
        
          Nelson asked AFL-CIO leaders to talk to their locals about a general strike a tactic that hasn t been tried in the United States for more than 70 years. Then again, it s been longer than that (never) since the federal government was closed for five weeks.
        
          On Friday afternoon, I spoke to Nelson about why she spoke up, what needs to change, and how this dismal 35-day stretch can serve as a catalyst for a resurgent American labor movement. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
        
          Henry Grabar: I guess the government s up and running again, so that s good news.
        
          Sara Nelson: It s good news that a million people that have been locked out of work with no paychecks are going to get paid, back-paid, and hopefully have a chance to put their lives back together. We re going to be working very hard to make sure this never happens again because they should have never been put in the crosshairs here.
        
          Flight attendants have been getting paid, because you re private-sector employees. Where does the sense of solidarity with federal workers in aviation come from, for you or for your members? 
        
          Our country doesn t run without the federal workers who make it run, and there s no industry where that s more evident than the airline industry, where our private airlines work in tandem with the federal agencies. One really doesn t work without the other.
        
          My comments were fully rooted in the workers that I represent. As we saw this morning, when capacity was pulled down and planes were stuck, it s a very quick unraveling of flight attendant, pilot, mechanic, customer service jobs. Everyone s jobs were on the line and that includes the people I directly represent.
        
          Federal workers are not allowed to strike or participate in any kind of sickout. Did you speak to anyone from those groups about what it was like to work without pay and be prohibited from taking any kind of concerted labor action to protest those conditions?  
        
          It was incredibly frustrating. What we heard from all over the country was,  They could end this. Why are they staying on the job? We did away with slavery with the 13th Amendment.  There was a lot of confusion about how this could even take place. No other country in the world would put up with this.
        
          They felt really stuck. Don t forget, if they struck, they were putting it all on the line. Not only were they sacrificing potentially their health care, their pensions, the right to ever work for the federal government again, but they could be prosecuted for striking. That s how fundamentally they are not able to take action when there is such an egregious act against them. That s outrageous and that s something that has to change.
        
          Do you think the legacy of the air traffic controllers strike under Reagan was something people were thinking about? 
        
          Of course that s something people were thinking about. There were strikers in 1981 who were indicted. There s history here that people were following. Reagan made that a really popular move in the private sector as well, and that s when the right to strike was diminished in this country, and when labor rights and labor membership hit a steady decline. Are we better off for it? I think what we re seeing, with the teachers strikes, the hotel workers who took on Marriott and won, is that people are not willing to put up with it anymore. People are willing to do more to fight for their families because they have been pushed so far, and there has been so much productivity put on the backs of the American worker without any increases in wages.
        
          Going forward, what s the legacy of this 35-day period for federal workers and the labor movement more generally?
        
          We can decide to fight for real labor law in this country with the fundamental principle that if you go to work you get paid. And you have the right to strike if you are not given that.
        
          Coming out of this, for people working in federal-sector jobs, if you think they re not thinking about switching careers right now if that s possible, you re crazy. How are we going to recruit people, when we re in 30-year lows for air traffic controllers, unless we fix this? Why would you sign up for this kind of uncertainty? It s incumbent upon keeping the system together for the future that we fix this so we can attract people to these high-requirement jobs, so that we can promote our air transportation system and compete with the rest of the world.
        
          I want to ask about this AFL-CIO dinner where you asked leaders to go back to their locals and consider joining a general strike. How was that comment received by the people in the audience?
        
          Well, the people in the audience loved it; there were cheers and people were on their feet. The fundamental question I asked in that speech was: What is the labor movement waiting for? There are a million people locked out of work right now. More federal contractors locked out of jobs with no guarantee of backpay we re going to fight for them too. This was the largest lockout in U.S. history. This was the time for labor to act. If no one else was going to say that, I felt like as a member of the AFL-CIO executive council, that was my responsibility to speak out.
        
          We re not letting this go. This has started a conversation that s a going to be central to this presidential race. But more immediately, I was already in an emergency meeting to make sure that we don t let this happen again in 21 days.
        
          Has the Association of Flight Attendants ever struck?
        
          We had one of the most successful strikes in the aviation industry ever. We struck only seven flights and brought Alaska Airlines to its knees, which resulted in overnight, in some cases, 60 percent increases in pay for flight attendants, and dramatically improved  working conditions.
        
          The threat of that strike has resulted in companies capitulating before strike deadlines. We have never had to strike again. We have threatened it many times, but in the end airlines do not want to face as one of the executives of US Airways put it,  the phenomenon called CHAOS.  [Note: CHAOS stands for  create havoc around our system. ]
        
          Once we have the right to strike, we say a strike could happen at any time, the public doesn t know, media doesn t know, management doesn t know. Minimal risk to flight attendants, maximum impact on management. It still requires incredible solidarity among the work group and the willingness of every single flight attendant to walk off if they re called and we confirm all of that when we walk into it. They have not wanted to face this because it s very hard to defend against it. With CHAOS, we re really able to take control of the situation.
        
          One reason that seems relevant is, as we were seeing today, in air travel in particular, not everyone needs to walk off the job to have a national cascading effect, which seems like something to keep in mind the next time the government shuts down.
        
          Correct!

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-won-shutdown-trump.html,"
          Around noon on Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was expecting some sort of action to end the shutdown to come within the hour. She wasn t sure exactly what.
        
           I guess he s going to be saying something about how he s gonna build a wall,  she told a roundtable of journalists in the conference room of her suite of offices.  Hopefully he will understand that we can t go down that path of any discussion of that until government is open. 
        
          Over the course of the next hour, Pelosi took reporters  questions, with occasional interruptions when a staffer would slip her notes. Around 12:35, when she received one such note, she told the staffer that the caller would need to wait a couple of minutes, or perhaps someone else on staff could call back.
        
           It s Chuck,  she told the room, referring to the Senate Democratic leader.  It could be big, I don t know. 
        
          It was: Trump had caved. On the ropes as he faced atrocious polling numbers, Senate Republicans on the verge of mutiny, halts to flights at major East Coast airports on Friday, and no-shows at work from thousands of IRS employees, President Donald Trump went along with a Senate plan to reopen the government for three weeks without any border wall funding, an idea he d rejected several times since the shutdown began. A conference committee between House and Senate negotiators will try to reach a border security deal over the next three weeks and if it doesn t include additional physical barrier funds, Trump might declare a national emergency.
        
          In other words, after shutting down part of the government for 35 days, Trump secured zero dollars for his proposed border wall. Pelosi and Schumer, who refused to negotiate on the wall, had won the standoff. The only spin that Trump could come up with, in announcing the deal at the White House, was that he had successfully impressed the importance of physical barriers upon congressional Democrats,  dozens  of whom had reached out to him saying they were ready to deal on the wall. That may or may not be true. But he had to say something to save whatever face he could.
        
           He s going to claim victory whatever  the outcome is, Pelosi had said at the roundtable. She pointed to a centerpiece of flowers on the conference table.  We could plant these flowers along the border, and [he d say],  I got my wall.   
        
          It was Pelosi on Friday who actually got to claim credit for the victory. In another world, a Democratic leader might have grown antsy after a couple of weeks (or days) of the shutdown, delivered the president a chunk of his signature policy, and then watched, upon the next funding deadline, as the president chose to shut down the government again to get the next chunk. Instead, Pelosi trusted public opinion surveys that showed the president earning most of the blame for the shutdown, and waited for Republicans to break under the stress of an unsustainable position. It was a strategy born from experience, an experience that some House Democrats, in the days after the election, thought they didn t really need or wasn t worth the baggage.
        
          Pelosi spent much of the shutdown waiting patiently for the president s cave, but occasionally took to the offense. On Friday she explained how she thought through her plan to block Trump from delivering the State of the Union during a shutdown:  You always start with a feather, until you get to the sledgehammer. 
        
          She rattled through the process:  We re still in a shutdown. Let s agree on a mutually agreeable date.  No, I m coming anyway.  Please don t come until government is not shut down.  No, I m coming anyway.  The House will not be passing a concurrent resolution to prepare for the president s visit. 
        
          The polite way she introduced the State of the Union postponement, she said, fit in with how she tries to interact with the president:  You have to be respectful of the office that he holds, perhaps even more respectful of the office he holds than he is. 
        
          We don t know which of Trump s many stressors finally made him budge. But a couple of days after the State of the Union was officially called off from its originally scheduled date, he budged.
        
          Pelosi said she doesn t like to psychoanalyze the president or try to guess why he is the way he is. But she s hardly above jabbing at his insecurities. In December, she described Trump s fixation on the wall as a  manhood thing for him.  Earlier this month, she said Trump might be under the impression that furloughed workers  can just ask their father for more money.  And when a columnist began a question on Friday by calling Trump a  very complicated  person, she interrupted.
        
           No,  she said.  I think he s very simple. 
        
          It s either that simplicity or an overabundance of complications that leads Donald Trump to think that he may, at the end of this congressional debate over border security in three weeks, finally get his wall money. Expect the same voices who called on Pelosi to give the president some wall money in exchange for reopening the government to call on her again to cut a deal.
        
          During a press conference after the reopening of the government was announced, Pelosi was asked whether she was more flexible on wall funding now that the hostage had been released.
        
           Have I not been clear on the wall?  she said.  No, I ve been very clear on the wall. 
        
          Maybe Trump will pay attention this time.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/trump-border-security-funding-deal-declare-national-emergency.html,"
          The Senate was a familiar holding pattern Thursday afternoon: waiting to hear whether President Trump would sign Congress  compromise spending deal, which appropriated not nearly the amount of money he wants to build his  border wall,  before voting on it. Trump, despite hinting throughout the week that he would sign the bill and supplement its border security provisions with a smattering of additional funds later, had begun to waffle. Republican senators were literally praying Thursday for Trump sign it and avoid another calamitous government shutdown.
        
          Around 3 p.m., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell came to the Senate floor to provide an update.
        
           [Trump] has indicated he is prepared to sign the bill,  McConnell said.  He will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time.  In an alarming sign of how badly McConnell needed Trump to sign the bill, he also said that he would support the president s decision to declare the national emergency. McConnell for weeks had been one of the sharpest critics of the president s threat to declare a national emergency, knowing that it would divide Senate Republicans and set a precedent for Democrats to use such a declaration the next time they control the White House.
        
          Trump s strategy in declaring a national emergency would be to redirect military resources toward building a barrier on the southern border. It would be a broader option than what the White House, with a comfortable amount of Republican congressional buy-in, had been looking at earlier this week, which was to supplement the spending bill s $1.375 billion in barrier funding with extra millions from his legally available transfer authority.
        
          In a statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders suggested that Trump might be invoking an all-of-the-above strategy:  President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action including a national emergency to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border. 
        
          If Trump goes through with the emergency declaration, it will be tied up in court for years. The move will also receive push-back from some Republicans although McConnell s example of throwing up his arms, forgetting he ever argued against the move, and supporting the declaration is one that we should expect many more Republicans to follow. And if, somehow, it succeeds in court, national emergency declarations will become a go-to tool for future Democratic presidents who can t get their climate change or gun control legislation through Congress.
        
          But federal workers would be able to go to work on Monday.

          White House senior adviser Stephen Miller assured that President Donald Trump is ready to shut down the government in order to make sure he gets the funding to build the wall along the border with Mexico.  We re going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,  Miller, who has long been seen as one of the administration s most hard-line voices on immigration, said on CBS  Face the Nation. When asked whether that meant forcing a shutdown of the government, Miller didn t hesitate:  If it comes to it, absolutely. 
        
          Miller made sure to emphasize the president doesn t see the wall as a minor point that can be negotiated away.  This is a very fundamental issue. At stake is the question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country,  Miller said.  Whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country. 
        
          In a jaw-dropping point of the interview, Miller suggested  left wing, activist judicial rulings  were to blame for the death of a young Guatemalan girl while in the custody of border officials.  One of the great tragedies that is going on in our country today is the loopholes in our immigration laws and the deficiencies in our immigration laws,  Miller said.  And left wing, activist judicial rulings that incentivize the most vulnerable populations to come to our country. 
        
          Despite Miller s tough words, Democrats insisted that continuing to push on the wall was a fool s errand.  He is not going to get the wall in any form,  the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said on NBC s Meet the Press.  Even the House, which is a majority Republican, they don t have the votes for his 5 billion dollar wall plan.  Schumer s words virtually assure it will be a tense week in Washington ahead of the shutdown deadline Friday.

          On Wednesday, the government shutdown entered its 12th day and a new post-holiday phase of the standoff in which Americans began returning to work, school, and presumably reading and watching the news. President Donald Trump met with emboldened Democratic leaders Wednesday, as well as his Cabinet, ostensibly looking for a way out of the stalemate over the lingering question of funding the border wall that resulted in the closure of the federal government on Dec. 22. So where do things stand?
        
          The shutdown  could be a long time   and it could be quickly,  Trump said Wednesday. This seems like the most unassailably true, if grammatically troubling, thing Trump has said in some time.
        
          Despite the usual Twitter screeds from the president, Trump has been very nonchalant about getting the government reopened. Trump, you ll remember, is asking for some $5 billion in funding for a wall of some sort or something he can spin as a wall on the Southern border and seems to believe the politics and public opinion are (or at least will be) in his favor. While this appears to be a miscalculation of where Americans are at on the issue at the moment, you don t have to look further than Trump s cooked-up pre-midterm election tweets and comments about the so-called caravan of migrants a thousand miles away walking slowly toward the U.S. border to see where he holds immigration and the wall in the hierarchy of political issues. Immigration has and continues to be Trump s go-to issue when things aren t breaking his way, and the wall has always been a proxy for that debate. After a stinging, if unacknowledged loss in the midterm elections, here we are.
        
          There are signs, however, that Trump has overplayed his hand. During Trump s freewheeling meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and incoming-Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Dec. 11 in the Oval Office, Trump said he would be  proud  to shut down the government over funding for the wall. That s not exactly lowering expectations. Despite Trump s apparent willingness to wait out the Democrats (and those in his own party), public pressure usually builds on whichever side is seen as being responsible for the mess and playing politics with the country s core functions. So far, Trump has vacillated from proudly bearing responsibility for the current impasse to wildly blaming the Democrats for anything that comes to mind. Trump s usual attempts to assign blame, however, haven t brought the success he s had in the past lobbing incendiary, contradictory, and usually ridiculous tweets.
        
          The underlying issue is that Trump appears to be interpreting the shutdown as a sign of personal strength that will radiate out and somehow generate support. The optical problem he s facing, however, is that the $5 billion figure seems utterly arbitrary in the grand scheme of things. As such, at the moment, Trump simply appears to be unwilling to negotiate, even undermining his own party and administration in order to make a pointless point that $5 billion is the barometer of good versus bad border security policy because he says so. That argument has already been undercut by his own indecisiveness on a shutdown, as well as by Vice President Mike Pence s approach to the Democratic leadership about a $2.5 billion compromise for border security and wall improvements. Trump publicly repudiated that attempt Wednesday.  Somebody said $2.5 [billion],  Trump said to reporters.  No. Look, this is national security we re talking about. 
        
          Anything below $5 billion does not constitute national security, the argument goes, which leaves Trump in the weeds on numbers that to ordinary Americans (outside the hardcore Trumpistas) might feel are pretty similar.  Democrats have signaled a willingness to approve $1.3 billion for border security as part of a broader spending bill, and a portion of that money could be used to replace and repair existing sections of wall and fencing,  the Washington Post reports.  But they have drawn the line at the use of any additional taxpayer money for the construction of a new wall. 
        
          The longer Trump resists, the easier it will be for Democratic leaders to make the case that they offered billions for border security, but Trump wouldn t budge. And that pressure on Trump looks set to increase this week when Democrats officially take control of the House on Thursday. Democrats are expected to pass bills that would fund and reopen portions of the government without the wall funding.  House Democrats on Thursday plan to pass two bills: one to fund the Homeland Security Department at current levels through Feb. 8, which would continue $1.3 billion in border barrier funding; and the other to fund the rest of the government through Sept. 30, at levels negotiated on a bipartisan basis in the Senate,  according to the Post.
        
           I said,  Mr. President, give me one good reason why you should continue your shutdown,  Sen. Chuck Schumer said after a White House meeting with the president Wednesday.  He could not give a good answer.  In fact, Trump reportedly told Schumer he would  look foolish  if he allowed the government to reopen while the wall funding was being negotiated, according to sources briefed on the meeting.  We have given the Republicans a chance to take  yes  for an answer,  Pelosi said after the meeting. But with a West Wing hollowed out of talent and ideas and moderating influences, it s not clear Trump himself actually wants to get to  yes  at all.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/bill-oreilly-ann-coulter-trump-shutdown-reaction.html,"
          And now for the backlash. After Donald Trump caved on Friday, agreeing to temporarily reopen the government in exchange for, well, bupkis, he was not universally hailed as the hero he envisioned himself as.
        
          The three-week continuing resolution is pretty much the same deal Democrats had been offering since this whole thing started and more or less the same one Trump and Republicans had agreed to prior to the shutdown, before the president changed his mind under pressure from hard-line conservatives. In announcing the deal, Trump seemed to acknowledge that his right-wing allies weren t going to like what he had to say.  Many disagree,  he said from the White House Rose Garden,  but I really feel that working with Democrats and Republicans, we can make a truly great and secure deal happen for everyone. 
        
          The immediate reaction from conservative media, however, was mixed or least not as uniformly critical of Trump as you might expect given he was just bested on the national stage by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, both of whom refused to negotiate over border funding while parts of the government were shuttered. While the Ann Coulters and Mike Cernovichs of the world were quick to blast the president for being a political coward, others like Bill O Reilly instead focused on the short-term nature of the bill, which will give Trump the chance to hold the government hostage again in three weeks if and when Congress fails to find a comprehensive immigration deal to his liking. As Nicole Hemmer, an assistant professor at the University of Virginia s Miller Center, points out, there is a fault line running between those who are border absolutists and those who are Trump loyalists.  Conservative media, like conservatives in general, are divided,  she observed on Twitter.

          When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  suggested  to President Trump last week that he find a new date for the State of the Union address, so that the event would not occur during the government shutdown, her aides were adamant that it was just that: a suggestion. What it wasn t, they said, was an official rescinding of the invitation she had sent out earlier in January. Pelosi was just putting a proposal out there for him to chew over.
        
          But now it s official: President Trump will not be allowed to deliver a joint address in the House so long as the government remains shut down.
        
          Trump finally responded to Pelosi s  suggestion  Wednesday morning. In a letter, he stated that there were  no security concerns regarding the State of the Union Address,  as she had said would be the case.  Therefore,  he added,  I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.  And, as is the case with every formal letter that  Donald Trump  writes, it was obvious which specific line he forced his staffer to include:  It would be very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location! 
        
          The idea was to dare Pelosi to disinvite him and prevent him from delivering his speech. The move put the screws to Pelosi so much that  she did just that.
        
           I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President s State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened,  she wrote in a letter Wednesday afternoon.  Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened. 
        
          Trump responded shortly thereafter, in non-letter form, that was  not surprised. 
        
          The president now has many options. He could agree to reopen the government by Tuesday and still deliver the State of the Union in the House, as usual. He could agree to another date. He could deliver the address at a MAGA rally somewhere in the vicinity of the southern border though, as he s told us, being anywhere in the vicinity of the southern border is a wildly dangerous death trap. He could try to deliver it in the Senate, or he could deliver it on the steps of the Capitol. The true masterstroke, though, would be to submit his address in writing, freeing the country from the scourge of this annual 9 p.m. nightmare that has no effect on anything. He could do that even if the shutdown were over by Tuesday! It seems like a very strong idea, he should look into it.

          As the partial government shutdown drags on, more Americans are blaming President Donald Trump than Democrats in Congress. Forty-seven percent of Americans say Trump is responsible for the shutdown, while 33 percent blame Democrats, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that was conducted Dec. 21ñ25. Trump has expressed pride that the government has shut down due to his demand for a border wall, but only 35 percent say that should be included in a congressional spending bill. And only one-quarter of Americans say they support Trump s decision to shut down the government over the issue.
        
          There are also signs that the shutdown is costing Trump some popularity points. A Dec. 21ñ23 survey by Morning Consult found that only 39 percent of registered voters approved of the president s job performance while 56 percent disapprove. This marks the lowest approval rating for the president since August 2017, when Trump refused to strongly condemn the far-right protesters who had gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia.
        
          Despite the general unpopularity of the shutdown, there is no sign that it will be ending any time soon and now it looks likelier than ever that it will last into the new year. Lawmakers in the House of Representatives were told Thursday not to expect any votes this week. For now Democrats are working to draft legislation that would reopen the government once they take control of the House of Representatives on Jan. 3.
        
          Trump also made it clear Thursday he is in no rush to compromise and sent at least six wall-related tweets blaming Democrats for the  OBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall.  He also wondered whether Democrats  realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?  In a subsequent tweet he referred to a manhunt going on in California for a man accused of shooting a police officer to death as an example of why the wall is needed.  Time to get tough on Border Security,  Trump wrote.  Build the Wall!

          On Tuesday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made his counterpart, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, an offer to avert a government shutdown. President Trump would get the $1.6 billion in border security money, including some fencing, that Senate appropriators had agreed to over the summer, plus another billion for the administration to use on other immigration enforcement priorities. It was already a significant walk-back from the president s demand of $5 billion for a border wall and his pledge in a meeting last week that he would shut down the government and take the blame if he didn t get it.
        
          Democratic leaders rejected McConnell s offer almost instantly, describing the extra billion as a  slush fund  that Trump, in the words of a senior Senate Democratic aide, could  use for his radical immigration agenda.  The message behind Democrats  quick dismissal of what amounted to a face-saving measure for Trump was that they had him beat on the wall issue, and Trump, one way or another, would have to come to terms with that.
        
          Congress, at least, will give him a couple more months to dwell on it. On Wednesday morning, McConnell moved Congress into a punt formation, introducing a short-term  continuing resolution  to fund the government at current spending levels through Feb. 8. Both Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi have since said that Democrats would support the extension, and the White House is supposedly amenable to it which isn t to say that we should be surprised if Trump tweets a veto threat or two before ultimately signing it.
        
          How will anything be different in February? McConnell, during his weekly press conference Tuesday, tried to argue that this short-term punt would be the  least desirable outcome  for Pelosi.
        
           If I were in her shoes,  he said,  I would rather not be dealing with this year s business next year. I would assume her preference would be to roll out the new Democratic agenda by the fresh new Democratic Congress in the early stages. But I think this prevents that. 
        
          It s McConnell s job to find some way to spin every development as a win for Republicans, so points for effort. But standing firm against Trump s wall funding request has been a winning issue for Democrats in December, and it will be again in February. Trump s comments in last week s Oval Office meeting with Schumer and Pelosi that he, personally, would accept blame for a shutdown over the wall will still be valid in two months. There s no statute of limitations on a screw-up of that magnitude. So in February, Pelosi can just pass a funding bill with no additional wall money, proceed with  roll[ing] out the new Democratic agenda by the fresh new Democratic Congress,  and allow Trump and the Republicans to decide once again whether shutting down the government over an unpopular border wall project would be good politics. It isn t now, and it won t be then.

          It was most likely the airports that finally broke the dam. Friday afternoon, as news reports of disrupted flights poured in and the shutdown hit Day 36, Donald Trump finally announced that he would cave completely if temporarily on his demands for a border wall. The government will now reopen for three weeks, at the end of which time, he was careful to threaten, he may declare a national emergency if he doesn t get his way.
        
          Despite weeks of reporting on how the shutdown was affecting workers, Trump still appears to have no idea about why federal employees matter or why their acute hardship is problematic. It s a fitting coda to what we ve witnessed over the past few weeks. There was Donald Trump s buffoonish claim Thursday that federal workers who turned to food banks to feed their families during the shutdown can just  work along  with shops and banks. He was trying to correct for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who had said that he couldn t fathom how anyone could be unable to negotiate a loan for themselves. Here was Trump s course correction, delivered Thursday night:  Local people know who they are when they go for groceries and everything else. And I think what Wilbur was probably trying to say is that they will work along. I know banks are working along of if you have mortgages, the mortgagees, the mortgage  the folks collecting the interest and all of those things, they work along. And that s what happens in times like this. They know the people, they ve been dealing with them for years, and they work along. 
        
          And we all laughed at the rich president who used to claim repeatedly that we needed a voter ID to go to the supermarket now claiming that the shutdown wasn t a big deal for federal workers who had gone weeks without pay because they could just get friendly loans from that same supermarket, which should really be a food bank, which is where many of them had actually already been forced to turn. It s so tone-deaf it s almost funny.
        
          But it really isn t funny. It s ominous. There s more to Trump and Ross  bizarre Norman Rockwell parable of friendly greengrocers and your brother-in-law the jolly bank manager than just the cluelessness of old white billionaires who have never had to run a personal errand. They re also telling a crappy old story about good old American volunteerism and the beauty of local charity and the gosh-golly spirit of communities caring for their own. If that sounds familiar, it s because this story was actually the cornerstone of the Paul Ryan vision for America. It s the story wherein even if you slash government entitlement programs and food programs and health care, what arises beatifically and from the rubble to replace it all is good old-fashioned local and religious charities. In Paul Ryan s telling, there was no crisis a good old-fashioned barn raising couldn t cure. And so every time Trump minimized the human suffering of the shutdown, he wasn t just saving himself or belittling government workers. He was also building out a long-running conservative narrative that downplays the need for many crucial government services.
        
          That s why Trump was always ever only halfway on board about the difficulty of the shutdown. It s why he retweeted an op-ed from an anonymous writer, claiming to be a senior member of his administration, who trashed federal workers as lazy and disloyal to the White House. The op-ed went so far as to urge that the shutdown continue indefinitely so those workers would leave the government, with the author claiming that 80 percent of federal workers  do nothing that warrants punishment and nothing of external value.   That is their workday: errands for the sake of errands administering, refining, following and collaborating on process. 
        
          That s been the drumbeat on Fox News too, with one guest cheering that the shutdown made more Americans aware of  how nonessential a lot of these nonessential workers actually are,  a way of trashing both government workers and government services at the same time.
        
          Paul Ryan who worked for years to promote his view of a society built around his moral vision of elite  makers  who work and earn good incomes and  takers  who live on government assistance argued that private charities should do the bulk of the assistance. Ryan warned, in 2012, that the government safety net would turn  into a hammock that lulls able-bodied people into lives of dependency and complacency, that drains them of their will and their incentive to make the most of their lives. 
        
          Mike Konczal, writing about the need for social insurance programs in the Atlantic in 2014, put it this way:
        
          It s a story in service of the idea that government services food assistance and housing assistance and services for the poor can be readily offloaded onto private, especially religious, charities. To hear Secretary Ross and the president discuss the ways in which all of us can have private arrangements with the banker and grocer who live up the corner from Big Bird is to hear that story told again. Sure, it pinched when the TSA couldn t get our planes out on time. But work being done around housing, food insecurity, and women s shelters? They don t think that should be undertaken by government in the first place.
        
          I don t believe the president and Secretary Ross and Lara Trump are actually as clueless about the ways in which the majority of Americans, including government workers, live paycheck to paycheck as they sound. I think they were just making their best pitch for their optimal world, in which virtuous people are virtuous and charity solves our problems, rather than government.
        
          It s too easy to say that the enduring lesson of the shutdown is simply that Trump and his plutocrat Cabinet are hilariously clueless about how most of us live. The real story is much more grim: They are also trying to other us against one another, positing government workers as unpatriotic if they decline to work for free, and lazy for being unwilling to put the president s interests ahead of their own. They re making the same bad argument that I wish had stopped when Paul Ryan departed the national stage: that the best source of aid in a crisis lies in the charity of warm and loving communities, not in government services.
        
          The shutdown has mercifully ended, at least for the next three weeks. But beware of old men s fairy tales just the same. We could be back here again before we know it.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/nancy-pelosi-trump-emergency-wall-fail.html,"
          President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday in order to build a barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border. If he ultimately gets the wall he wants, it will only be because Democrats who control the House of Representatives let him have it.
        
          Fortunately, the Constitution does not give the president unfettered authority to spend federal funds on his own pet projects. Instead, we have a finely crafted system of checks and balances. Unfortunately, that system of checks and balances doesn t function when the actors who have the ability to check the president decline to use their power. By voting on Thursday to approve a budget deal without any explicit language barring the president s end-run maneuver, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and members of her caucus decided not to exercise their check. Now, they can t count on the courts to do it for them.
        
          The White House says that Trump plans to use $3.6 billion in military construction money for his wall. He can potentially do that on account of the 1982 Military Construction Codification Act, which says that when the president declares a national emergency  that requires the use of the armed forces,  the defense secretary may use available military construction funds to  undertake military construction projects   not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.  The Trump administration will argue that the wall is necessary to support the 6,000 active-duty troops now at the southern border. (The administration also plans to supplement the military construction money with smaller amounts from other sources that aren t linked to the announcement of a national emergency.)
        
          Here s what happens next: The 1976 National Emergencies Act allows Congress to override the president s emergency declaration, and if the House passes a resolution to that effect, the Senate would have to put it up for a vote within 18 days. It s not implausible that some Republican senators including those like Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado, who are gearing up for 2020 re-election battles in purple states, as well as Republicans whose home states are affected by the diversion of Army Corps construction money might join the Democratic minority to pass the resolution of disapproval in the upper chamber. (Defense hawks who object to the diversion of military construction funds might join in.) But the president could veto any congressional resolution, and it s unlikely that opponents of the wall could cobble together the two-thirds majorities in both houses that they would need for a veto override.
        
          So that leaves us with our last best hope: the courts. Alas, the legal challenge to the president s exercise of his emergency authority is far from a slam dunk.
        
          First, it s not clear that anybody could successfully sue to overturn the president s emergency declaration. The typical way to challenge  arbitrary and capricious  actions by the federal government is to sue under the Administrative Procedure Act, but the Supreme Court held in a 1992 case that the Administrative Procedure Act doesn t apply to actions taken by the president himself.
        
          The House of Representatives might nonetheless try to sue in its institutional capacity on the ground that Trump, by spending funds that the legislative branch didn t grant him, has trammeled on Congress  power of the purse. This suit wouldn t be based on the Administrative Procedure Act or any other specific statute but instead on general separation-of-powers principles. This might work, but there are significant hurdles along the House s path.
        
          The first is the doctrine of standing. The Supreme Court held in a 2015 case that  legislators whose votes would have been sufficient to defeat   a specific legislative Act have standing to sue if that legislative action goes into effect   on the ground that their votes have been completely nullified.  The Democratic-led House would argue that the president s decision to fund the border wall is essentially a  legislative act  beyond his authority, and thereby  completely nullified  House members  votes. But not all of the justices are on board with this  legislative standing  doctrine. In one of his last opinions, Justice Antonin Scalia said that  [d]isputes between governmental branches   regarding the allocation of political power  are not  cases  or  controversies  that the courts can resolve. Justice Clarence Thomas agreed. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who joined the court after 2015, might well adopt the same view. If so, then the House Democrats would start out with three votes at the high court against them.
        
          In any event, a win on  standing  merely gets the House into court; it doesn t resolve the main issue. On the merits, a court might say that the National Emergencies Act provides a specific mechanism for lawmakers to override the president s declaration and that the House s lawsuit amounts to an illegitimate end-run around that mechanism. Or a court might defer to the president s determination that an emergency exists, adding that if Congress didn t want the administration to have the power to redirect military construction funds, it shouldn t have ceded that authority. To be clear, I think that the House could mount a strong case, but I m not at all confident that the federal courts and especially the current Supreme Court will agree.
        
          Even if the courts side with the president against the House, we will still likely see a raft of piecemeal challenges to different parts of the wall from private landowners, environmentalist groups, and others. Some of these efforts might succeed in temporarily or permanently blocking portions of the barrier. But there was a much more straightforward way for House Democrats to fully block the president from building his wall, and they passed up that opportunity Thursday night.
        
          If the House had added a single sentence to the government spending bill saying, in effect, that  no additional funds authorized or appropriated under any other law may be redirected to the building of a border wall  then the legal landscape would now look quite different. It is entirely within Congress  power to take away any funds that the president might access under the Military Construction Codification Act, or any other statute, for his border barrier. To be sure, the Senate might not have passed such a bill, and even if it did, Trump might have vetoed it. But at least the House Democrats had leverage their votes were needed to avert a government shutdown. Now, they have effectively relinquished that leverage until the current spending legislation expires at the end of September.
        
          So why did the House pass the spending bill Thursday night with full knowledge of the president s next move? Perhaps Democratic leaders feared blowback from voters for allowing another shutdown. Perhaps they decided that as terrible as the border wall and usurpation of their appropriations authority might be it s not a sufficiently significant issue to justify a partial halt to government operations again. Perhaps they thought that the courts would do what the House Democrats declined to do themselves: confront the president s bald assertion of executive authority head-on.
        
          Any or all of those calculations might have been right. But they each entail enormous risks. If the president prevails in his bid to build a wall, the political bounce might buoy his chances for re-election in 2020. Another government shutdown would be bad, but a total breakdown in constraints on presidential power will be even worse. And while the judiciary is the last line of defense against executive overreach, that shouldn t lead lawmakers to lose sight of the fact that they are the first.
        
          Agree or disagree with the House Democrats  decision, we should all be clear about what that choice entailed. By voting to pass a spending bill that lacked any safeguard against the use of emergency powers for construction at the border, House Democrats made it much more likely that the president s emergency gambit would succeed. Congress  power of the purse is arguably the most significant barrier to an executive unbound. By letting that barrier fall, House Democrats might well have allowed Trump s wall to rise.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/trump-national-emergency-border-wall-autocracy.html,"
          Donald Trump has now been the president of the United States for two years, and many of the most sensational predictions for his time in office have not come to pass. The press remains rambunctious. Americans aren t scared to criticize the president. Courts continue to rule against the White House with reassuring regularity. Elections are, as the Democrats  big victory in the midterm elections strikingly demonstrated, still free. So perhaps those of us who have warned about the president s authoritarian ambitions really have, as a prominent conservative told me during a recent TV debate, been suffering from a bad case of Trump Derangement Syndrome all along?
        
          The president s intention to issue an executive order declaring a national emergency at the southern border suggests otherwise. In fact, it is hard to imagine a clearer piece of evidence that he really does seek unconstitutional powers: If Trump s past attacks on the legislature and the judiciary have, at times, felt like a drill, his intention to arrogate vast powers to himself under an utterly transparent pretext is the real deal.
        
          Americans often like to imagine that their system of checks and balances is a secure bulwark against the threat of autocracy. But in reality, no set of political institutions is, in and of itself, enough to constrain a popular and power-hungry president intent on destroying the republic. One of the reasons for this is the classic problem of the state of emergency, with which political philosophers and students of the law have grappled ever since the Roman Republic.
        
          As Cicero argued in De Legibus, the safety of the people is the highest law; when a polity faces some unforeseen emergency, there may thus be urgent and legitimate need to loosen some of the ordinary legal restrictions on the powers of the highest magistrate. At the same time, it is obvious that any legal recognition of the need for emergency powers creates a huge opportunity for abuse; if an aspiring autocrat declares a false emergency, he would instantly be liberated from the usual constraints on his power. The history of the 20th century demonstrates that this is no abstract concern: From Adolf Hitler in Germany to Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, some of the most brutal dictators of the past hundred years have consolidated their power by exploiting emergency legislation.
        
          It would be tempting to think that a similar course of action would be impossible in the United States because the Constitution creates such potent limits on the power of the president. But the differences between the powers that American presidents have traditionally exercised during states of emergencies and those granted by the infamous Article 48 of the Constitution of the Weimar Republic are a matter of degree, not of kind. As a recent article in the Atlantic argues, President Trump could  do all kinds of extraordinary things  by declaring a national state of emergency,  from seizing control of the internet to declaring martial law. 
        
          If American democracy has enjoyed astounding longevity, then, it is because two key safeguards have historically ensured that presidents have not arrogated tyrannical powers to themselves. The first is that American citizens have long had a strong commitment to democratic values, which made them very reluctant to vote for candidates who displayed authoritarian tendencies. A few presidents, like Andrew Jackson, have been elected as strongmen with a dubious commitment to the rule of law. Others, like Richard Nixon, have bristled against constraints on their power in the (imagined) privacy of the Oval Office. But the vast majority have not abused emergency powers, or played other forms of extreme  constitutional hardball,  because they had a deep commitment to preserving the republic.
        
          The second is that the president s counterparts in Congress have, in the past, made it clear that they would stand up to him if he overstepped the constitutional boundaries of the executive in a blatant manner. Perhaps the most impressive instance of this came when Franklin Delano Roosevelt, understandably frustrated by the Supreme Court s string of rulings against the New Deal, threatened to pack the court; even though he was extremely popular, some of his closest allies in the Senate made clear that they would refuse to confirm his nominees. Though FDR might have tried to pass the same legislation under the pretext of a national emergency, this effectively demonstrated how high a political price he would have had to pay for infringing on the powers traditionally enjoyed by Congress or the Supreme Court and he mostly desisted from further attempts to undermine other branches of government.
        
          These two key safeguards are now failing. For one, no successful candidate for the highest office in the land has ever attacked the very idea of legitimate political competition as openly and blatantly as Donald Trump. From his call to lock up his chief political opponent to his constant denunciation of independent judges and critical members of Congress, his desire for unconstrained power is in scary evidence.
        
          For another, it is hard to recall a juncture in American history in which the president s congressional supporters have been so willing to do his bidding. Mitch McConnell is an especially striking study in the dereliction of duty. Over the past weeks, the Senate majority leader has made clear that declaring a state of national emergency over the southern border would constitute an abuse of presidential powers. When, on Thursday, Trump announced his intention to declare a national emergency over let s see the southern border, McConnell immediately vowed his support.
        
          As I have argued before, the most powerful as well as the most poorly understood trick in the populist s toolkit is the ability to engage in  salami tactics.  When they set out to expand their power, populists usually do so one small slice at a time, issuing false pretexts for executive action and fake reasons for the  reform  of independent institutions. As a result, no single action by the executive seems like an existential threat to the rule of law. Without any clear moment of juncture, the system of checks and balances slowly decays.
        
          What is striking about Trump s intention to declare a state of emergency for such transparently fraudulent reasons is that he isn t even bothering to engage in salami tactics. This is about as clear an attack on the constitutional order as political scientists could have dreamed up for some in-class exercise on the rise of dictatorship. If Republican senators like Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse are not willing to stand up to Trump s cheap power grab now, they never will. And if the president s many opponents cannot take to the streets to oppose his autocratic tendencies at this juncture, it is clear that they won t do so until it s far too late.
        
          To be sure, none of this means that Trump is likely to follow in the footsteps of Ferdinand Marcos, or even Viktor Orb·n. If there s one thing that the past two years have demonstrated, it is that Trump lacks the vision or the discipline of most of the authoritarian populists who have successfully bent their countries  institutions to their will. If there was a populist Olympics, Donald Trump would not make medal rank.
        
          But Trump s incompetence should make us all the more concerned about the long-term threat to American democracy. An evidently erratic and highly unpopular American president is about to declare a national emergency on grounds that everyone knows to be spurious. And yet, it is likely that he will experience only the mildest blowback from his political allies. What does that tell us about the damage that a shrewd and popular president with the capacity to follow the increasingly sophisticated playbook of authoritarian populism could inflict especially if he could consolidate his powers under the cover of an actual emergency?

        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/border-wall-trump-deal-congress.html,"
          President Donald Trump is not a fan of the border deal that congressional negotiators struck Monday night, the one that he would need to sign by the end of the week to avoid the year s second government shutdown. While he said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that he would have to  study it,  he was  not happy about it. It s not doing the trick. 
        
          But! He didn t say he would veto it. As far as first reactions go, that was victory enough for Republican leaders desperate to avoid another disastrous lapse in funding. The trick over the next couple of days, then, will be to convince the president that this is not just his best option but actually a great deal for him.
        
          The most dismaying figure for the president in the deal is the $1.375 billion he  won  to fund approximately 55 miles of new border fencing. That s not only shy of the $5.7 billion he requested and then shut down the government over in a poorly planned-out effort to secure it. It s also shy of the $1.6 billion (and 65 miles) that Senate negotiators were willing to give him last summer, before he got the curious idea in his head that he might get more money following a Democratic electoral wave.
        
          But all numbers can be spun, and so Republicans are spinning this one. Several senators and a Republican aide involved in the talks pointed out that Trump will get roughly  three times  the amount of fencing money in this deal that he would get by signing a continuing resolution to fund the government at existing levels through the remainder of the fiscal year. Triple!
        
          They re also trying to convince Trump that he would be forcing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to eat her own words. Two weeks ago, Pelosi had said that  there s not going to be any wall money  in the bill, and during the shutdown, she had joked that she might be willing to offer one dollar but no more.
        
           I remember somebody from the House saying,  not one penny, not one dollar,    Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy said on Tuesday.  And based on what I see so far, there s at least $1.375 billion of those dollars, when the speaker said we wouldn t see a single one. 
        
          Democratic leaders, for their part, are defending themselves with an aesthetic technicality: There will be no  wall  only fencing, limited to  currently deployed  technologies such as bollard fencing.
        
           We ve always been for fencing,  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said during his weekly press conference,  but this doesn t allow for a concrete wall of any kind. 
        
          In an effort to distract the president from the words  doesn t allow for a concrete wall,  Republicans are also trying to cheer up Trump by pointing out how many undocumented immigrants he ll be able to detain. The GOP negotiators on the committee successfully beat back a Democratic request to cap how many  detention beds  shorthand for the government s detention capacity for undocumented immigrants would be available for interior, as opposed to border, enforcement. Democrats, alarmed by the Trump administration s escalation of interior enforcement, wanted to use the limitation in detention beds to force Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prioritize the deportation of criminals. But after Republicans went public with the new Democratic demand, and were prepared to pin the failure to reach a deal on them, Democrats dropped it.
        
          Democrats, though, were at least able to argue that the deal could bring down the overall detained population. The deal provides detention funds for an  average daily population  of 45,274. Since the current detention population is at about 49,000, Democrats argue, the Department of Homeland Security would have to start drawing down that number to near 40,500 by the end of September to hit the average. One Democratic aide described this mechanism as offering DHS a  glide path  toward reducing its detained population.
        
          Republicans understand that were this the end of the story, Trump would lose his mind. That s why it s not the end of the story.
        
          The deal also offers the administration another $750 million in  transfer authority,  meaning $750 million that Trump could tap in the event he needed it. If the president were to tap this entirely, it could pay for another 13,000 detention beds bringing the total to more than 58,000, well above even the president s request. Democrats argue that if the president did decide to transfer the money this way, it would take funding away from things like the Coast Guard or the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin even suggested that Trump could open himself up to legal issues if he tries to transfer the funds without citing any specific surge in the need for them.
        
          A Republican aide, though, said that Trump would simply have to give notice to Congress if he wanted to transfer the funds this way. A Democratic aide countered that  typically, the administration has respected Congress  prerogative to turn down transfer requests, and the Department of Homeland Security has never used its transfer authority over the objection of the chair of either the House or Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security.  But that s not really a denial that Trump would have the ability. And  typically  does not really apply.
        
          Trump seems to have been briefed on this and other enhancements available to him. Some senators are talking about, for example, nearly $900 million worth of Defense Department anti-trafficking funds that Trump could transfer toward  the wall.  Though Republican leaders have been nervous about him declaring a national emergency to build the wall, they re much more comfortable with him using the narrower tool of transfers to at least make up some of the fencing money he s not explicitly getting.
        
          And that may be why Trump, while unhappy with the deal, said he was  happy with where we re going. 
        
           I m thrilled,  he said,  because we re supplementing things and moving things around and we re doing things that are fantastic, taking from far less important areas. And the bottom line is we re building a lot of wall.  By Tuesday night, Trump tweeted that once the bill was  hooked up with lots of money from other sources,  he would be  getting almost $23 BILLION for Border Security. Regardless of Wall money, it is being built as we speak! 
        
          Figuring out how he landed at  $23 BILLION  can be tomorrow s fruitless accounting assignment. But if Trump ends up viewing the bill as something he can  enhance  with pots of money here or there, then that should be enough for him to overcome his initial displeasure with the agreement, sign the damn thing, and avoid a second, pointless government shutdown. Trump s aides might want to keep him away from Ann Coulter in the meantime, though.

          President Donald Trump has yet to break ground on his great border wall, but already it s proving to be a powerful deterrent. Republicans are running away from it.
        
          In TV interviews last weekend, Republican lawmakers bent over backward to avoid the word wall.  I happen to agree with the president on barriers,  said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine pledged  to continue to build physical barriers.  On Fox News Sunday, Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, used the word barrier 13 times. Trump is  winning the battle on the importance of a barrier,  said Mulvaney. On Face the Nation, Mulvaney boasted that Democrats were privately telling the White House,  We think you might be right on this barrier thing. 
        
          Barrier thing? If Trump is winning, why is everyone around him afraid to say the word wall?
        
          The answer is: Trump isn t winning. He s been losing on this issue for a long time. The wall, as he originally proposed it, was a dumb idea. Border security experts told him so. Democrats rejected it, and polls backed them up. Trump tried to get his way by shutting down the government, but nobody budged, and his approval ratings tanked. So now Republicans have retreated to a fallback position. They re claiming that renovations and extensions of current border infrastructure in short, the status quo count as Trump s wall.
        
          One sign of the president s troubles is the behavior of his polling adviser, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. She s been recoiling from the word wall like a vampire recoiling from sunlight. Democrats  keep calling it the wall, the wall, because they want that to be a four-letter word,  Conway complained on Fox News earlier this month. When an interviewer asked whether Trump would  sign something that doesn t have border wall funding,  Conway shot back,  It s not border wall funding. It s border security.  Last week on CNN, Conway and Chris Cuomo engaged in a 14-minute spell-casting duel. Cuomo hurled the word wall 15 times; Conway fired back with eight invocations of barrier and four uses of fence.
        
          Conway understands that the word wall is poison. Last week, a reporter asked her about a survey that showed 71 percent of Americans didn t think the wall was worth the shutdown.  Why is that a good question?  Conway snapped.  I m asking why you and the polling questions, respectfully, are still saying wall.  Survey questions about a  fence  tend to attract more support than questions about a  wall.  By shifting the GOP s language, Conway hopes to shift the polls.
        
          Why does a wall poll badly? Because it never made sense. It was a gimmick designed for the 2016 Republican primaries. As conceived by Trump and his aides, the wall was supposed to be huge, manly, and a manifestation of Trump s genius as a builder. It would be  massive,  made of concrete units 40 to 50 feet tall, bigger than the Great Wall of China. It would be an icon of American dominance, growing taller, according to Trump, every time Mexico refused to pay for it. When a rival candidate called it a fence, Trump bristled:  Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a  fence.  It s not a fence, Jeb, it s a WALL, and there s a BIG difference! 
        
          The wall was supposed to be unprecedented in scale and grandeur. It would be  like you have never seen before,  Trump promised. It would prove his superiority over  politicians  who, in Trump s words, had  no idea  how to construct such a thing.  Nobody builds walls better than me,  Trump declared at his campaign kickoff in June 2015. When a reporter asked the candidate how he would erect  a 1,900-mile wall,  Trump replied:  Very easy. I m a builder.  
        
          The whole shtick was a fraud. Trump knew nothing about the border. After he became president, border security officers explained to him that a huge concrete wall would block them from seeing people on the other side. They noted that along much of the border, rivers, canyons, and other natural features make a wall unnecessary or impractical. Experts pointed out the legal headaches of seizing ranchers  land. Instead of a wall, they recommended better detection technology, more personnel, and slatted fences along specific parts of the border. In other words, an extension of the current system.
        
          Trump didn t want to give up his dream. But in November, he lost the House. In December, facing trouble in the polls and in Congress, he began to change his language.  The Democrats are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a Concrete Wall,  Trump tweeted,  but we are not building a Concrete Wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats.  An extension of current fencing, he argued on Jan. 4, would be even more powerful than what he had originally envisioned:  A see-through wall made out of steel is far stronger than a concrete wall. 
        
          On Friday, as he ended the shutdown, Trump recast his position. He stood not for a massive concrete wall  We never proposed that,  he lied but for  smart walls  with  see-through visibility   equipped with sensors, monitors,  and  state-of-the-art drones.  These  structures  Trump also called them  barriers  and  fences  would be built only at  high-risk locations.  Such barriers were hardly radical, he argued, since the past two administrations had constructed them along one-third of the border. In fact, said Trump,  Most of the Democrats in Congress have voted in the past for bills that include walls and physical barriers and very powerful fences. 
        
          This retreat puts Republicans in a safer defensive posture. They shut down the government, and eventually reopened it, for nothing. By redefining the wall as an extension of current fencing, they give themselves a chance to attract Democratic support for at least some border construction, for which Trump can later take credit. The GOP s new position also helps Republicans deflect the objection that they controlled Congress for two years and did nothing.  We are building the wall right now, a portion of it,  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy assured Trump s supporters on Sunday s Meet the Press. The next day, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders bragged that Trump, with congressional authorization, had already  contracted to build roughly 115 miles  of border fencing.
        
          Meanwhile, the new position gives Republicans a better angle of attack. If Democrats balk at extending the fences, Republicans can call them hypocrites.  We ve got Democrats with hair on fire saying they ll never vote for a wall,  Mulvaney protested on Face the Nation.  But they voted for money to build that exact wall. In fact, something very similar is being built today.  Conway, speaking with reporters last week, said she would tell Democrats,  You re betraying your own past votes   if your border security package does not include a physical barrier. 
        
          But the Republican retreat also creates problems. To begin with, it complicates Trump s depiction of Democrats as the party of open borders. On Fox News Sunday, Mulvaney lambasted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for refusing to  give us a single dollar for the wall.  He asked whether Democrats were so  beholden  to Pelosi that they were  never going to vote for a barrier.  But 30 seconds later, he called Pelosi a hypocrite because she  just voted for almost a quarter-billion dollars for a barrier on the southern border.  Which is it, Mick? Is she a conniving centrist or a wild-eyed liberal?
        
          Second, piecemeal extensions of the status quo might not satisfy Trump s base. Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign adviser, says polls and focus groups show the president s supporters want a wall  that is not like anything that is built before.  That magnificent colossus is exactly what they re not going to get, and Trump isn t happy about it. Four weeks ago, the president s former chief of staff, John Kelly, told the Los Angeles Times that Trump s latest proposal was  not a wall.  On Twitter, Trump fired back:  An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED. 
        
          So good luck, Republicans, on selling your base and your boss on slats and sensors. Maybe, while avoiding the word wall, you can somehow convince Trump s supporters that they re getting one. But the narcissist who conceived this idea as a monument to his greatness might not surrender that fantasy without a longer fight. And it s hard to let go of the wall when your president is still on the fence.

          Since the government shutdown ended late last week, Senate Republicans have been saying they are extremely worried about the possibility of a second one. The 35-day mishap, with its $11 billion price tag (much of which is not recoverable), redounded to the benefit of nobody, not even the president who forced it. And GOP senators are well aware that they might suffer consequences at the ballot box should it happen again. Some of them are on the record making impressive statements to that effect in the New York Times. ( Shutting down the government should be as off limits in budget negotiations as chemical warfare is in real warfare,  said Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.  I ve said repeatedly throughout this process that government shutdowns are a bad idea,  said Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio.  This never should have happened,  said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.) Indeed some are pushing new legislation to ensure that Donald Trump cannot shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn t get the wall he isn t going to get. As for what will actually happen next, the president warned on Friday that if he didn t get a  fair deal  on money for his wall by that Feb. 15 deadline, the government would close again, or he d invoke emergency powers to try to build it.
        
          So the only question remaining seems to be this having made their positions against another shutdown clear, do Senate Republicans affirmatively want the president to go with his Door No. 2 and declare a national emergency in an effort to shift billions of dollars from disaster aid or other sources to build his wall anyhow? Unless the president just forgets the past six weeks happened, those appear to be the only two options, short of an unlikely Valentine s Day deal. At least on principle, you might think the GOP is not that much more inclined to support a declaration of national emergency and a radical expansion of eminent domain powers than a second shutdown. They are both bad options. As Politico reported on Monday:
        
          Maybe. Maybe there will be a big breakthrough in the coming week as the committee tasked with negotiating an agreement on border security attempts to resolve the impasse. But in the far likelier case that this doesn t happen, do Republicans in the Senate who just got clobbered over the shutdown really want a declaration of national emergency to happen next? Several have already gone on the record to oppose such a thing. Romney told MSNBC,  I think that s an action that would be taken in the most extreme circumstances, and hopefully, we don t reach that.  North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis told the Hill,  You can t be in a national emergency forever. For us to totally secure the border, that s a multiyear proposition.  Sen. Marco Rubio who stands to lose hurricane-relief funding tweeted,  I do not believe the White House will divert money from #Florida disaster recovery to fund border security. But if some reason they try, I will do everything I can to overturn such a decision.  Rubio has also said,  There s some concern   about how [an emergency declaration] could be used by future presidents for other reasons. 
        
          South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham had been emphatically opposed to an emergency declaration in early January.  I don t know legally if you can do that. I think that s a fallback position,  he said.  The best way is for the Congress to come back and do wall plus something else. I ll be watching.  Two days later he tweeted,  Mr. President, declare a national emergency NOW. Build a wall NOW. 
        
          This all brings us to William Barr, Donald Trump s choice to be the new attorney general. On Tuesday, Barr s vote was postponed by a week amid Senate Democrats  concerns, which was expected, and Barr s written response to questions about Trump s emergency powers, which was not. In written follow-up answers to Senate Democrats  questions about the power of the president to declare a national emergency to build his border wall, Barr declined to say what guidance he would offer the president. In response to a question from Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Barr wrote that  I have not examined the facts and circumstances pertaining to security on the southern border with this issue in mind, and therefore, I am not in a position to further comment on what would constitute a national emergency.  Barr added that, were he to be confirmed, he d ensure  that the Department s advice on this subject is consistent with any applicable law. 
        
          Now who even knows what s really on the table, given that the president has variously insisted that he will  almost definitely  declare a national emergency to get his wall done, and then that he would not, and then, as he put it on Friday,  We ll work with the Democrats and negotiate, and if we can t do that, then we ll do a obviously we ll do the emergency because that s what it is. It s a national emergency.  So. Things.
        
          Given the amount of thinking lawyers have put into the question of presidential power to declare a national emergency at the border, it would be frankly somewhat amazing if Barr hasn t given it any actual thought. If you are inclined to bone up, you should surely start here, (and then here, and also this, and this, and here, and many thousands of words suggesting that we are not presently in an emergency and also that the president cannot use eminent domain to toss people out of their ranches and churches and homes by simply saying there is one). Given the reality that many Americans are as opposed to a declaration of national emergency as they were to the shutdown, it might behoove Republicans in the Senate to find out whether the new attorney general plans to greenlight whatever power grab the president plans to arrogate to himself.
        
          Apparently, though, nope, they re cool. If Republican senators really wanted to stop this national emergency declaration from happening, all they would have to do is promise to veto any attorney general nominee, such as Barr, who refuses to reject the possibility. That s it. Instead, the current plan appears to be that Senate Republicans will let the emergency declaration go forward, try to blame House Democrats, and then allow the question to be tied up for months and years in the courts, with setbacks blamed on  liberal judges.  Is it brave? No! Is it a bold declaration against unchecked executive overreach that will set an awful precedent whatever the outcome? No! Is it consistent with conservative and libertarian views of property rights and limited government? Also, no! And should the president declare his emergency, does anyone think the Senate will at any time check him, as the law, on its face, demands? No to that too!
        
          Senate Republicans have no good option here between allowing another shutdown to happen and allowing the president to declare a national emergency without consequence. Moving calmly and deliberately toward the latter choice only because it s the one that hasn t yet been tested isn t just shortsighted and cowardly. It s Congress choosing again to do nothing to stop the president, and then claiming falsely that there is nothing they can do to stop him.

          Sen. Marco Rubio argued that President Trump s proposed plan to declare a national emergency in order to secure the funds he needs to build a wall on the southern border was a  terrible idea. 
        
          Speaking on Meet the Press, Rubio said he believed the use of a national emergency would set an undesirable precedent.  It doesn t mean that I don t want border security,  he said.  I just think that s the wrong way to achieve it. It doesn t provide certainty. And you could very well wind up in sort of a theatric victory on the front and then not get it done. 
        
          On Friday, Trump revived his talk of a national emergency, as he caved and congressional leaders reached a deal to reopen the government with a three-week continuing resolution that lacked any funding for a border wall. Trump threatened that if after three weeks lawmakers failed to present a bill that included border funding, he would either declare a national emergency or force another shutdown. (The recently concluded one was the longest in history, at 35 days.)
        
          A national emergency measure would likely be challenged in federal court, where a judge would debate what makes a  national emergency.  Rubio suggested on Sunday that he believed Trump s plan would not stand up to judicial scrutiny, and he doesn t appear to be alone in fretting about precedent. Sen. Roy Blunt said on Fox News Sunday that while he also wanted a border wall,  there might be a future president that I don t agree with that thinks something else is an emergency. 
        
          According to the Washington Post, Trump has argued to other White House officials that declaring a national emergency could pressure Congress to include wall funding in its legislative package and reassure his base that he is not giving up on his promise.

          The revolt of the unpaid federal workers may have begun on Friday morning in Monroe, Louisiana, where two flights were canceled because TSA workers didn t arrive to open the checkpoint.
        
          American Airlines 3243 to Dallas-Fort Worth and Delta Airlines 3942 to Atlanta, both scheduled to depart at 6 a.m., became the first U.S. flights to be canceled during the government shutdown because of a shortage of TSA workers. Security screeners missed their second paycheck on Friday, and call-out rates have surged to between 7 and 10 percent, causing intermittent delays.
        
          Monroe Regional Airport, which sees about 10 departures a day, usually opens its TSA checkpoint around 4 or 4:30 in the morning, staffed by a team of 10. Today, airport manager Ron Phillips said, only two workers showed up. The TSA arranged for replacement workers to be brought in from neighboring airports in Shreveport and Alexandria, and the checkpoint was up and running three hours later.
        
          Like delays caused by staffing shortages that hit New York-area airports later on Friday morning, the disruption serves as a warning about the fragile state of the country s flight infrastructure, which depends on tens of thousands of workers who have been working without pay for five weeks. The average TSA worker makes $35,000 a year, and the agency has said that elevated call-out rates can be explained by workers struggling to make ends meet.  Many employees are reporting that they are not able to report to work due to financial limitations,  the TSA says.
        
           Everyone was surprised this morning, it caught us all off guard,  said Philips. He said the TSA had reassured him earlier in the week that the five-week shutdown did not pose risks to airport operations contrary to warnings from labor unions representing screeners and FAA employees.  We assumed since they didn t receive their second paycheck they probably said,  The heck with it!    Philips said. If so, he added, he couldn t blame them.
        
          The Monroe airport was back to normal by later Friday morning, but there s still some suspense: A second shift is set to start at noon, and it s not clear who is coming to work.

          President Donald Trump s retaliation against Speaker Nancy Pelosi s efforts to postpone the State of the Union invitation denying Pelosi s use of military aircraft to travel to Afghanistan must be understood in its historical context and for its constitutional significance. While this dispute has largely been covered as another twist in a tit-for-tat cycle of retribution, it represents a far graver abuse of power than a political spat. Trump s interference in congressional travel misused the commander-in-chief power for political purposes, endangered the speaker s delegation, and obstructed the exercise of Congress  Article I legislative fact-finding responsibilities.
        
          As a House national security subcommittee staffer, I used to organize and accompany congressional delegations, or CODELs, and staff overseas fact-finding trips including four to Afghanistan during Pelosi s previous speakership. Having also served in the White House Counsel s Office, I have published on the specific topic of CODELs as an important arena for interbranch relationships. I know from experience. Trips into combat zones are logistically complicated multiagency and interbranch operations with ever-present security concerns. This most recent confrontation exposes long-held executive-legislative tensions. But Trump s acts are wholly unprecedented and dangerous departures from historical practice not to mention his obligations as the nation s chief executive.
        
          On Jan. 16, Pelosi sent a letter to the president citing difficulties in ensuring adequate security for a State of the Union speech before a joint session of Congress due to shutdown strains on federal agencies and employees. Pelosi suggested that Trump instead provide a written submission (as was done in the early days of the republic) or conduct the speech as an Oval Office address. Many accepted Pelosi s security rationale, others viewed Pelosi s letter as an effort to deny Trump the traditional SOTU megaphone and pageantry.
        
          Within 24 hours, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi, which White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted, informing the speaker that the president was withdrawing military aircraft authorization for her CODEL:
        
          That last line echoed Pelosi s comment about the SOTU that  He can make it from the Oval Office if he wants.  Adding to the insult, the White House reportedly did not inform the members of Congress slated to travel on the CODEL until 30 minutes before they were scheduled to go wheels up. The legislators were sitting on a U.S. Air Force bus when they found out.
        
          Afterward, Pelosi s chief of staff Drew Hammill tweeted out more details about the canceled trip. After noting there was no Egypt stop planned, Hammill tweeted:  The purpose of the trip was to express appreciation & thanks to our men & women in uniform for their service & dedication, & to obtain critical national security & intelligence briefings from those on the front lines.  He also noted that the Brussels stop related to mandatory flight crew rest given the distances involved in travel to South Asia (a required stop in Europe or North Africa is consistent with my trip planning experience), and therefore the CODEL was slated to make use of that time on the public s behalf to meet with representatives of NATO allies.
        
          Trump s letter was not only unprecedented in its use of commander-in-chief authority to ratchet up a political dispute, but it also revealed itinerary plans that had not been publicly released because of security concerns.
        
          In the wake of Trump s letter and revelation about trip details, Pelosi accused the president of endangering the travelers to the point the trip could no longer proceed even by commercial air travel. According to Pelosi, the State Department s diplomatic security service informed her office that it was too dangerous to fly to Afghanistan by commercial air after all the publicity. She told reporters:
        
          These are not idle security concerns. Congressional members and staff have been severely attacked and killed during foreign travel. A few examples:
        
          ï Rep. Lawrence Patton McDonald, D-Georgia, was among those killed when the Soviet military shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007 on Sept. 1, 1983.
        
          ï Rep. Leo Joseph Ryan, D-California, was gunned down on an airstrip in Guyana by cult members in the Jonestown massacre in 1978. Current Rep. Jackie Speier, D-California, who accompanied Ryan as congressional staff on that trip, was shot five times in the attack.
        
          ï Harold  Hal  W. Rosenthal, a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff member, was killed in a 1976 terrorist bombing in Istanbul while he was overseas on a congressional staff trip to Israel.
        
          Security is a paramount concern for the speaker of the House as third in the line of succession to the presidency. The speaker would be a highly valuable target for a terrorist network. She should have travel support resembling the president and vice president in order to accommodate her security detail and communications technicians especially when traveling into combat zones.
        
          The second half of Hammill s statement about the trip s purpose  to obtain critical national security & intelligence briefings from those on the front lines  is of fundamental and, indeed, constitutional importance. Congress was engaging in overseas travel to further its legislative power of inquiry in order to inform policy judgments. In McGrain v. Daugherty, the Supreme Court explained that congressional power to conduct inquiries is implied by the Constitution s grant of legislative power in Article I. The court correctly noted:  A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change.  What s more, as the court observed in Barenblatt v. United States, the  scope of the power of inquiry   is as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution. 
        
          Far from a mere  public relations event,  as Trump characterized Pelosi s trip, these initiatives provide critical information to senior policymakers responsible for authorizing use of force, appropriating funds, and establishing military regulations. To be sure, congressional travel can be abused by triviality or extravagance. But CODELs to combat zones allow our troops to see policymakers taking the risks and the time to visit them and hear from them. This trip would have also demonstrated American respect for and presented an opportunity to hear from Afghan partners on the ground. My travel companions and I learned a massive amount of information useful to our investigations and policy mandates on our trips to Afghanistan and other hot spots. For examples of our reports informed by overseas congressional travel, see  Warlord, Inc.: Extortion and Corruption along the U.S. Supply Chain in Afghanistan  and  Mystery at Manas: Strategic Blind Spots in the Department of Defense s Fuel Contracts in Kyrgyzstan. 
        
          Here, the president intentionally interfered with that function in an act of political retaliation. At a minimum, he set back any safe travel to Afghanistan by the speaker for the near future.
        
          Even under normal circumstances, congressional travel creates tensions between the branches. Last year I wrote a short law review article for a symposium on congressional oversight that addressed legal and practical challenges facing Congress as it engages in fact-finding overseas. In a section describing some of those practical challenges, I wrote about congressional reliance on the executive branch as an especially important area of concern:
        
          I then encouraged Congress to codify executive branch travel support obligations:
        
          I saw congressional reliance on executive branch travel support as a function of interbranch comity as problematic, because it gave the executive branch too much leverage over the CODEL agenda. My concerns, borne of experience, related to heavy-handed scheduling negotiations with the embassy staff or requests by the military to embed a general officer on the trip as a minder.
        
          Those concerns seem quaint now. I never contemplated the president of the United States abusing commander-in-chief powers to obstruct congressional travel. It is now clear that Congress will have to codify executive branch travel support obligations and otherwise engage in self-help in order to ensure it can engage in critical fact-finding overseas. But the president s misconduct transcends interbranch tensions or rank politics. Rather, by engaging in petty political retribution, he s trampled on constitutional obligations in two branches of government.

          Late on Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced he would deliver the State of the Union address after the partial government shutdown now on its 34th day ends. The decision came after more than a week of squabbling between Trump and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. The decision, if final, may end the strange, weeklong conflict.
        
          How did we get to this point? And why did the president reverse himself on Wednesday? Here s a timeline of events.
        
          ï Wednesday, Jan. 16: Pelosi sends a letter to Trump to  suggest  the president reschedule the address, originally set for Jan. 29, until after the shutdown, citing the planning and security work needed from federal employees who are not being paid during the shutdown. She also offered him the alternative of submitting the address in writing. A spokesman for Pelosi later clarified that the letter was not a rescinded invitation but instead a simple proposal.
        
          ï Later in the day, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted that the department was prepared to provide security for the speech. Pelosi would later retort that Nielsen  should be advocating for her employees to be paid. 
        
          ï Thursday, Jan. 17: While not officially responding to Pelosi s letter, Trump one-upped Pelosi s suggestion with an order. He notified her that her previously undisclosed trip to meet with NATO leaders in Brussels and troops in Afghanistan (which he called a  seven-day excursion ) would be postponed because of the shutdown.  In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate,  he said in the statement. Trump, as commander in chief, can deny a congressperson s use of military transport, which Pelosi was to have used because of security concerns.
        
          ï After criticism over the announcement, the White House canceled Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin s planned trip to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. Melania Trump still went ahead with a trip to Florida on a government jet for a weekend vacation.
        
          ï Friday, Jan. 18: Pelosi s office alleged that the speaker would not attempt to fly commercially to Afghanistan because the White House had leaked information about the trip, putting the congressional delegation in danger. The Trump administration called the allegation a  flat-out lie.  No news outlets appeared to have reported on the plans before Pelosi released her statement decrying the leaks, but Pelosi s spokesman told Slate that they had discovered multiple sources from the administration were attempting to leak the news that morning.
        
          ï Sunday, Jan. 20: Trump let Pelosi know he hadn t forgotten the matter:
        
          ï Tuesday, Jan. 22: ABC News reported that Trump was planning two State of the Union speeches: one official one for Congress, which he planned to deliver on the scheduled date in the House chamber or elsewhere in D.C., and one unofficial one at a political rally outside of D.C. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that the White House was moving forward with plans to hold the address in the House.
        
          ï Wednesday, Jan. 23: Trump finally responded to Pelosi s earlier suggestion of postponing the State of the Union, dismissing the idea that there would be security risks.  Therefore I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union,  he said in a letter to Democratic leaders.  It would be very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location! 
        
          ï Pelosi responded that afternoon, meeting his challenge to disinvite him from giving the address.  I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President s State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened,  she wrote in a letter.  Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened. 
        
          ï Trump, who called her decision a  disgrace  and declared that  the State of the Union has been canceled by Nancy Pelosi because she doesn t want to hear the truth,  said he would look for alternative locations for the speech. Officials in West Virginia, North Carolina, and Michigan invited him to deliver the speech in their states. Some senators encouraged the president to host the address in their chamber.
        
          ï Shortly after 11 p.m., Trump appeared to cave, announcing in a tweet that he would deliver the address after the shutdown ends.  As the Shutdown was going on, Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union Address,  he tweeted.  I agreed. She then changed her mind because of the Shutdown, suggesting a later date. This is her prerogative - I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over. I am not looking for an   alternative venue for the SOTU Address because there is no venue that can compete with the history, tradition and importance of the House Chamber. I look forward to giving a  great  State of the Union Address in the near future! 
        
          According to the Washington Post, Pelosi is the first House speaker in history to deny the use of the chamber to the president for his State of the Union address (no president has delivered it elsewhere since the capital moved to Washington in 1800). While updating Congress on the state of the union is constitutionally mandated, there is no deadline for it to take place, and it places no limit on the shutdown.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/mcconnell-shutdown-judge-confirmations-trump.html,"
          Last week, the Trump administration put forth its first new slate of names for federal judgeships in 2019. All six were men, and apparently all six were white, although the White House declined to answer any questions about their backgrounds. Should they succeed in seating these six prospective jurists, President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will gain the distinction of having seated only the 3,130th through 3,135th white men to be given lifetime appointments on the federal bench. Historic progress indeed. Late Tuesday, the White House also announced its intention to renominate 51 judges who did not get through the previous Congress. It seems the need to pick up the pace on seating judges is now desperate.
        
          Tuesday was the 46th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. That ruling is ever more under direct assault in the legislatures the U.S. Supreme Court is now poised to narrow or deny a woman s right to choose. As Trump packs the federal courts with judges who write openly about  the moral tragedy of abortion  or refuse in written opinions to call abortion providers  doctors  because  the object of their action is not healing but killing,  his defenders continue to claim that there is nothing shocking about the fact that the president s record-shattering 84 confirmed judges are 76 percent male and 91 percent white, per the Federal Judicial Center. (For comparison, Obama s confirmed nominees were 58 percent male and 64 percent white.) Not renominated this week was Thomas Farr, the mastermind behind North Carolina s racist voter suppression laws who was tapped to fill seats for which two black women nominated by Obama were blocked by Republicans. Farr would have been only the 3,130th white man to sit on the federal courts, but his nomination was killed in December by GOP Sens. Tim Scott and Jeff Flake. Had either of these women been confirmed, they would have been the first black Americans to serve in a district that is 27 percent black.
        
          Senate Republicans have also apparently been mulling the idea of a rules change that would allow them to move even faster on judicial nominations, with Sen. Todd Young, R-Indiana, telling Hugh Hewitt on Monday that the GOP conference may soon consider different ideas for ways to cut down debate time on Trump s mountain of judicial nominees. The government shutdown has now dragged into its 33rd day, but the Republican obsession with jamming judges through continues to comically accelerate. It is starting to have the distinct feeling of a post-apocalypse smash-and-grab, by white men, for white men, to ensure that whatever is left of government post-Trump goes to team Handmaid s Tale.
        
          Trump s boosters continue to tell us that there is nothing troubling about the fact that his judicial picks are almost 80 percent male and 90 percent white. It s essentializing to assume that one s gender or race makes a difference to one s judicial fitness and philosophy, they say. Indeed, we re probably just days out from hearing that, per House Minority Whip Steve Scalise s, R-Louisiana, logic, the lack of female candidates is Ruth Bader Ginsburg s fault. (Last week Scalise blamed Nancy Pelosi for the fact that most House Republicans are white men.)
        
          The interest in ramming judges through has only picked up since the midterm elections.  If the Democrats had acquired a majority in the Senate, they could have blocked every person President Trump nominated for federal judgeships,  former House Speaker Newt Gingrich wrote in an op-ed post-election, noting that judicial appointments were  the biggest achievement of Trump s first two years, and now it is likely guaranteed to continue.  Carrie Severino, the chief counsel and policy director of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, told Politico at the time that  Executive orders don t outlast the president, legislation can change, but these judgeships last a long time,  adding that there are  a lot of Never-Trumpers and conservatives who have had to admit, sometimes begrudgingly, that  Wow, this has been a home run.   
        
          It s a pretty nihilist vision, even in a maximally nihilist time, and it comes just as a brain-melting new profile of Mitch McConnell by Charles Homans appeared in this weekend s New York Times Magazine. Homans points out that McConnell has demonstrated his willingness to essentially break the Senate itself in his quest to ensure that the judicial branch will become the ultimate arbiter of all future policy questions:
        
          Even as he hides from and deflects the devastation caused by Trump and Trumpism, McConnell seems sanguine about the fact that the one institution he truly cares about and let s be clear it is the judiciary, not the Senate will be the thing that emerges from the rubble: As Homans puts it,  The shutdown distilled the essence of McConnell s position in Trump s Washington: a man of institutions and establishments whose own legacy was now tied to that of a president who seems hellbent on burning both to the ground. 
        
          In some sense, then, McConnell is behaving perfectly rationally. His approach screw the shutdown, screw the Russia interference, and screw any attempt to protect the franchise, we will eventually win in the courts is just a mirror image of the approach many Trump opponents, including myself, have taken throughout the past two years (which is to focus on all that other stuff, because for now, the courts appear to be holding). But while progressives still hope that an independent judiciary will act as a check on Donald Trump, McConnell is taking a longer view doing something rather more apocalyptic and decidedly more cynical. He continues to pack the judicial branch with extremely young, radically conservative white Christian men who will assuming constitutional democracy survives continue to deliver wins on gun rights and anti-abortion rights as well as the deregulation of environmental, consumer, labor, and other safeguards, long after Trump leaves office. These picks will also continue to work to circumscribe the vote itself, through gerrymandering, voter suppression, and limitless money in politics.
        
          McConnell last week penned an op-ed trashing the House Democrats  effort to protect the ballot box, H.R. 1, an effort to implement what should be bipartisan voting rights and election reforms, which include protecting the Voting Rights Act and improving voter registration and anti-corruption measures. But as he sleeps through the shutdown and bats away voting reform, McConnell is working double time to ensure that his remaking of the judiciary outpaces any improvement on the ways in which we vote. Of all the cynical lines in Homans  piece, the most gutting may be McConnell s own observation about the way out of our current political moment:  Well, I mean, the ultimate check against any of this is the ballot box. 
        
          The other line that lingers:  The decision not to fill the Scalia vacancy I think that s the most consequential thing I ve ever done.  Mitch McConnell wants to be judged for having stolen a seat at the Supreme Court from one president and given it to another. And yet McConnell s utter failure to accept any responsibility for Trump or the Trumpism that came with it isn t even his greatest sin. His greatest sin is his continued plan to ram through judges while Rome burns, because he wants to ensure that minority-majority rule in America remains in place in case we accidentally survive the havoc wreaked by Russia and the decimation of both Congress and the presidency. He will do nothing to stop any of these things from corroding democratic norms and institutions, evidently in the hope that courts remade in his image can be the last institutions standing.

          They can t pay the rent. They re going to food pantries. Heading to pawn shops to sell their stuff. Their kids are worried. And the next payday, this coming Friday, seems certain to bring another painful reminder of their depleted bank accounts.
        
          A whopping 800,000 federal employees are suffering deeply from the pointless cruelty of the government shutdown, along with legions of workers for government contractors. Some of them are furloughed, and others are required to show up for work. None of them are being paid. And in a strange twist, the ones called back to work for free generally can t even receive unemployment benefits.
        
          On a human dignity level, it s an affront for people to be treated as pawns in this way, and it s a further insult to so devalue the critical work of our nation s public servants. On a more concrete level, it s a tremendous hardship for people not to be paid any wages at all for more than a month. It s unclear how many of these workers were already forced to live paycheck to paycheck, but based on data, it seems likely that the number is not insignificant. A Federal Reserve report just last year found that 4 in 10 adults, if faced with an unexpected $400 expense, either couldn t cover it or would have to sell something or borrow money.
        
          For a large number of workers in this country, though, what federal employees are experiencing now is a fairly typical indignity and hardship. Too often, workers especially low-wage and immigrant workers are paid only a fraction of what they re owed, or are not paid at all for their work.
        
          When I was in the New York Attorney General s Office, we handled a number of cases in which wages were not paid to workers. Several such cases involved home health agencies that failed to pay their workers for weeks and even months of labor. These caregivers helped patients who were elderly, sick, or disabled, bathing them, preparing their food, helping them with toileting, and changing bedpans. The details varied: One employer recorded a YouTube video promising to pay the money owed to workers and hired new aides even as he failed to pay existing ones; another employer created false tax documents showing wages that were never actually paid; a third threatened to fire workers after the labor department showed up to investigate.
        
          There were restaurant workers who worked hard to set up a flashy new Manhattan eatery before its grand opening: stiffed. There were the landscapers on Long Island, underpaid for years and then not paid anything for their last three weeks of work. The unpaid Queens construction workers doing myriad jobs on residential homes. And countless day laborers who regularly struggled to be paid.
        
          Why did these people keep showing up? For the same reasons federal workers keep going in, even without a paycheck. First off: They needed the job. People are usually reluctant to leave even a bad job, because it s still better than no job. And just as many federal workers are deeply committed to the mission of their jobs, many of the low-wage workers in our cases were also mission-driven, like home health aides devoted to the patients in their care.
        
          The cases we handled all took place in New York, which for years has had among the strongest labor laws, most aggressive enforcement agencies, and highest union density in the country. How many similar and worse situations emerge every day in other states, including those with less worker-protective landscapes?
        
          A 2017 study by the Economic Policy Institute of wage violations in the 10 most populous states found that 2.4 million workers in those states lose $8 billion annually to minimum wage violations, with per worker losses averaging $3,300 annually, amounting to nearly a quarter of their earned wages. According to the study, nearly one-fifth of low-wage workers experienced minimum wage violations. Such violations can include, for example, uncompensated work time off the clock, being paid a weekly rate that doesn t add up to the minimum wage, having illegal deductions made from their pay, or having hours shaved from time cards. Minimum wage violations aren t the same as being stiffed altogether, of course, but losing out on a quarter of earned wages surely has an agonizing impact.
        
          Serious workplace infractions by employers usually attract limited attention from public policy experts and especially government budget offices, perhaps in part because of who is affected: immigrants, people of color, low-wage workers. I ve often wondered why policymakers sometimes don t seem to take this problem seriously. Perhaps it s because low-income people are struggling in so many ways education, housing, just surviving at all that it may seem like not getting paid for work is just another normal challenge of being a low-wage worker in the United States. The shutdown is offering a new and more viscerally immediate face to the national problem of work without pay, but there s little reason that American empathy toward unpaid national park rangers and TSA agents shouldn t extend to ordinary working stiffs who get stiffed.
        
          Being paid for your labor is the most elemental workplace right, and it s a serious hardship when it doesn t happen. It s demeaning and demoralizing, and it causes ongoing stress and lasting damage for workers and their families. It s outrageous that people would ever have to work for free, whether they re locked-out federal employees or low-wage construction, home health, or restaurant workers. And it s hardly sufficient redress to get paid at some much later date the money you were already owed in the first place.
        
          Some legislators are working on short-term solutions for the current crisis for federal employees. A council member in D.C. proposed emergency legislation to protect both federal employees and contractors from eviction and foreclosure during the shutdown, and more than two dozen U.S. senators are pushing for legislation to protect government employees from eviction, foreclosure, repossession of their cars, and penalties for late payment for bills or student loans.
        
          These steps are urgently needed, but the real answer, of course, is for the president to end his shutdown immediately. Our federal government shouldn t be just one more wage cheat, and the American people shouldn t be complicit. Federal workers should get their pay, as well as some interest and damages and workers for government contractors should be compensated, too, as Rep. Ayanna Pressley has argued.
        
          What s the solution for everyone else? For the home health aides, construction workers, restaurant servers, and others who don t get paid what they re owed? We have a lot of work to do to create a culture of labor-law compliance, but the first step is to have a broader societal understanding that degraded labor standards and violations of workers  rights have real repercussions in the lives of families and communities.
        
          Once that happens, actually improved legal and legislative accountability should follow. State and federal legislators should pass stronger penalties for stiffing workers. More state attorneys general and criminal prosecutors should take on this issue, since wage theft actually involves more money than other forms of theft. Our overburdened, under-resourced labor enforcement agencies should finally get the funding they need to make sure that hard work actually pays. Most importantly, we should ensure that all workers can exercise their bargaining rights together so that everyone, from park rangers to day laborers, can have a meaningful voice at work.

SLATE,https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/government-shutdown-hurricane-season.html,"
          On Jan. 17, dozens of regional and state emergency managers were scheduled to convene in Miami for a weeklong course preparing them for the upcoming extreme weather season. The annual Emergency Management Institute, as it is formally called, is the main way federal authorities train their state and local counterparts on the basics of navigating deadly natural disasters, including when to begin evacuations and how to prepare for the effect of a storm surge.
        
          But the course has been canceled this year and is unlikely to be rescheduled another casualty of the current partial government shutdown, which is the longest in history. The Federal Emergency Management Authority, which conducts the training with specialists from the National Hurricane Center,  may only provide services that directly apply to the protection of human life or the protection of property,  a spokesperson tells Mother Jones. Day-to-day operations are close to fully staffed, but research, development, and training exercises all key aspects of the outreach work these agencies do before hurricane season starts in May have been suspended. Winter normally offers government staffers a reprieve from hurricane and tornado season, giving them time to update and test forecasting models in addition to training first responders in the event of future natural disasters. But none of that work can be completed during the shutdown.
        
           We ve already lost three weeks. We re likely to lose a fourth week,  says Eric Blake, union steward at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.  You can t recreate this time. 
        
          The timing could hardly be worse. The past few years have produced three of the five costliest hurricanes to hit the United States on record, including Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico and left roughly 3,000 people dead. This past year s hurricane season was relatively mild by historical standards but still included two major storms and a series of horrific wildfires in California.  This is an administration that thinks nothing of the future,  says David Titley, a retired naval officer who formerly served as chief operating officer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
        
          Even though many employees at NOAA, which includes the National Hurricane Center, have not been furloughed, their work is limited in scope and virtually impossible to do without the assistance of partner agencies. The Environmental Modeling Center in Maryland has been all but shuttered. More than 95 percent of NASA employees have been sent home, removing an important resource for scientists in need of satellite imagery for research.
        
          Ahead of severe weather season, these few weeks would normally be when government employees update and test existing forecasting models, but at the Environmental Modeling Center, which runs the current weather-forecasting model, only one staffer is working, according to the Washington Post. And that person is not tasked with fixing the model when it runs poorly, as it was reported to have done last month.  The U.S. model is basically standing still. Nothing s happening right now,  Blake says. (Neil Jacobs, deputy administrator of NOAA, disputed this finding in an op-ed published in the Post and Courier, writing,  Model accuracy ebbs and flows as a function of complex weather patterns. )
        
          The National Weather Service had actually planned to use this winter to unveil a new global forecasting model as part of an ongoing effort to catch the United States up with better-performing models overseas.  It s the best generation of hurricane models,  Blake says. But the testing and research that are necessary before the model s rollout are impossible to accomplish during the shutdown, which means it might not even be ready in time for hurricane season.
        
          That lack of forward focus might blunt the accuracy of future forecasting models come hurricane season, but it already has eliminated a crucial opportunity to train emergency managers. Former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate told NPR that none of the emergency training sessions can be rescheduled this year.  And that means those people are not getting the training they were trying to get to get better at what they re doing,  he said. Perennial staff shortages, which FEMA has acknowledged as a factor contributing to its scattershot response to Hurricane Maria, will not be addressed either. The agency cannot onboard new staffers during a shutdown.
        
          A FEMA spokesperson noted in an email that  emergency work as well as public infrastructure and mitigation projects  are considered essential and not impacted by the shutdown. That designation does not include management training, despite sessions having essential-sounding names like  Determining Which Critical Decisions Need to Be Made Based on Hazards, Vulnerability, Risk, and Impacts,  according to a schedule reviewed by Mother Jones.
        
          The FEMA spokesperson would only say,  Training and exercises are suspended during a lapse in appropriations.

          Tuesday will mark one month in the shutdown of the U.S. government, with no end in sight. Federal workers are lining up for food in Washington. More than 400,000 government employees have worked that entire time without pay, few of them more visible than the screeners of the Transportation Security Administration.
        
          Last Monday, I wrote that if any group of government employees could end the shutdown, it would be the 44,000 TSA screeners who keep the nation s airports running. The next day, Washington Post reporter Robert Costa wrote that GOP lawmakers see a TSA walkout as Trump s Achilles  heel the one factor that could force the president to back down from his demand that lawmakers fund a border wall.
        
          On Friday morning, backed by members of the United Steel Workers, the Teamsters, and other private-sector unions, one chapter of the union that includes the screeners Local 332 of the American Federation of Government Employees held a rally at Pittsburgh International Airport to raise awareness about the workers  declining morale and dire financial position.  There are real people out here, fighting for their lives, fighting for their homes, fighting to feed their kids,  TSA officer Ava Basalyga said, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.
        
          It s illegal for the TSA to strike, as Barbara Ehrenreich and Gary Stevenson called on them to do in the New York Times this week. Instead, the union that reps the TSA, the American Federation of Government Employees, has sued the federal government. One in 15 TSA workers called out on Thursday about double the normal rate, but well short of an absence that would cripple commercial air traffic.
        
          What if TSA workers did walk out? There s a worrisome precedent: the 1981 air traffic controllers walkout. Like the TSA screeners, the controllers were forbidden to strike. Like the TSA screeners, they were upset with their pay. Like the TSA screeners, they thought their role gave them leverage over Washington.
        
          President Ronald Reagan ordered them back to work within 48 hours. On Aug. 5, he fired the 11,500 controllers who had not returned to their jobs and banned them from federal employment for life. Airline travel was disrupted for weeks, but there were no accidents. The union was dismantled. Many of the controllers never recovered. It was a defining moment for Reagan and cowed the American labor movement for decades to come.
        
          In the American Prospect, Joseph McCartin, a historian and the author of Collision Course: Ronald Reagan, the Air Traffic Controllers, and the Strike That Changed America, makes the argument that it s time for the TSA to get sick a reliable onetime pressure move for federal workers that Reagan s dismissal of the controllers union, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers  Organization, all but put an end to. On Thursday, I spoke to McCartin about four reasons this time is different and why federal workers should escape the long shadow of 1981.
        
          Air traffic controllers were making higher-than-average salaries in 1981, and they struck for a $5,000 raise no small thing.  They were seen as well-paid workers already,  McCartin said. All this was happening as the nation recovered from the small 1980 economic downturn and slid into the worst recession since the Great Depression.  The public was primed to side with Reagan.  TSA screeners, by contrast, start off making just $15 an hour; the median screener makes $40,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics about 20 percent less than the average American salary. Oh, and of course, they ve been working for a month for nothing during the longest run of private-sector job growth since World War II.
        
          Furthermore, Reagan had recently won 44 states, and his popularity was soaring; Donald Trump has shut down the government over a wall, and his popularity is falling.
        
          It was clear as early as 1979 that there was a risk of a strike when the PATCO contract ran out; Reagan called the possibility a  peril to national safety  during the campaign. Just as police unions today use  slowdowns  to circumvent strike bans and show their discontent with public officials, PATCO had previously used unauthorized  sickouts  to have its demands met.
        
           I asked many of them,  What did you think when Reagan said you have 48 hours to return to your jobs?  They said they thought he was crazy,  McCartin recalled.  They felt, Reagan can threaten all he wants, but they can t run planes without us. What they didn t reckon with was the degree to which the administration had prepared for all this.  The administration had military flight controllers ready to step in and moved quickly to train replacement controllers, sometimes fudging test results to get them on the job quickly. The gamble paid off: After a period of disruption, air travel resumed sans PATCO.
        
          Needless to say, it s difficult to imagine the Trump administration has such a plan in place or could execute one if they did. (Federal Aviation Administration employees including controllers have also been working without pay since December, so they might not be gung-ho about breaking a TSA sickout to keep the government shut down.) Finally, it s not clear there is an equivalent workforce trained and ready to replace TSA scanners at a moment s notice.
        
          Air travel was a mess in 1981. Barely two years had passed since President Jimmy Carter deregulated the industry, and many carriers were still in a defensive posture, flying half-empty planes on newly competitive routes. FAA chief Lynn Helms got the airline brass together that summer to prepare for the disruptions of a PATCO strike and urged them to see it as an opportunity, McCartin said. They agreed.
        
           [PATCO] thought the airlines would bang on the door of the White House and say,  Get the controllers back to work, we re bleeding to death!    McCartin observed.  But they used it as an opportunity to get on the hub-and-spoke model we re familiar with. There was massive disruption, only tolerated because the airlines took advantage of it. 
        
          Again, it is hard to imagine the Trump administration working with airline CEOs to prepare for a sickout and harder still to imagine today s carriers gamely tolerating days or weeks of disruptions.
        
          There are tens of thousands more TSA workers now than there were air traffic controllers in 1981. Covering for them would require an enormous deployment of manpower. Air travel is much more central to the U.S. economy now than it was then. U.S. airlines carried 849 million domestic passengers in 2017, up from 297 million in 1980.
        
          All this activity is tightly scheduled and interconnected. A sickout doesn t need to be national, McCartin noted, to cause a national disruption. It just needs to hit a few key hubs, like Atlanta, Chicago, or New York.

          President Donald Trump proposed an immigration deal in a bid to reopen the government, offering a series of concessions that Democrats immediately said weren t enough to launch any kind of serious negotiations and end the longest shutdown in history. In a speech from the White House Saturday afternoon, Trump said he would extend deportation protections for some undocumented immigrants who arrived in the country as children in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. As part of the deal, Trump also offered to extend temporary protected status for people in the country who are fleeing countries affected by natural disasters or violence.
        
           I am here today to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis along the southern border,  Trump said. Yet even before he spoke and details of the proposal leaked, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi characterized it as a  non-starter,  noting it amounted to  a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable.  Democrats continue to insist the president must reopen the government first and then they can sit down with him to negotiate border security issues.
        
          Axios summarizes the main points of Trump s plan, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he will bring to a vote this coming week:
        
          Even if there was not much surprising in the substance of Trump s Saturday speech, it did mark a sharp change in tone from his previous address on the shutdown. Rather than highlighting the violence at the border, Trump talked about a  common-sense compromise  and a  compassionate response.  He also seemed to play down the wall itself.  This is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea,  he said.  These are steel barriers in high-priority locations. Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water. 
        
          Earlier in the day, though, Trump appeared to be escalating the rhetoric against Pelosi, with the president saying he hoped she can  come along and realize   that walls work.  He then went on to accuse Pelosi of  being controlled by the radical left, which is a problem.

          What does it look like for a legislative stalemate of four weeks, during which time zero progress has been made toward a conclusion, to actually begin getting worse? It looks much like the two central players in the stalemate trolling each other through the cancellation of the other s plans.
        
          With progress toward ending the deadlock plunging toward absolute zero, President Donald Trump announced Friday evening that he would be making a  major announcement concerning the Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border, and the Shutdown, tomorrow afternoon at 3 P.M., live from the [White House].  Speculation was that this might be his long-rumored national emergency declaration e.g., a punt of his wall fight to the courts and that it might not. But one thing was clear after the most cartoonish week of the shutdown yet: The only fresh ideas coming out of the White House or the Capitol are hijinks.
        
          Early this week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who determines who is and who isn t allowed to address the House of Representatives,  suggested  that Trump delay his State of the Union address until the government was reopened. Trump spent a day digging around for the proper countertroll and arrived at canceling her congressional delegation s government transport to Brussels and Afghanistan, a trip that had previously been kept under wraps for security purposes. On Friday, the speaker and her delegation gave up on their commercial travel accommodations, blaming the White House for blowing the lid off of that too.
        
           We ll go another time,  Pelosi told reporters on Friday, expressing unusual confidence that the government would ever reopen.
        
          It s unclear what other items either Pelosi or Trump might have on the schedule that the other could cancel. If there s anything else, each side should pre-emptively cancel their own plans immediately so that we can move on to the next phase of shutdown prankery whoopee cushions? and then, when all else is exhausted, perhaps some sort of negotiation.
        
          With competing pressures keeping the bulk of both parties firmly in their own corners, it has proved quite difficult for smaller, bipartisan  gangs  in either party to garner any support for even their most small-bore proposals. And really, these  gangs  one in the House, one in the Senate have only considered variations of one proposal: Republicans reopening the government along with vague Democratic winking to the president that they might be open to some physical barrier in negotiations afterward.
        
          On Wednesday, members of the House s bipartisan, centrist  Problem Solvers Caucus  visited the White House. The seven Democratic members who attended released a statement afterward saying that  there is   strong agreement that if we reopen the government, the possibility exists to work together and find common ground to tackle some of our country s toughest problems and fix them.  Whoever penned that masterstroke of banality deserves a promotion.
        
          I asked Rep. Tom Reed, the Republican co-chairman of the Problem Solvers Caucus, what progress was made at the meeting.
        
           The step was taken   with Democratic members going to the White House,  Reed said.  That was a good step. If you re not even going to the room, to the table, to have a conversation, then we ll never get anywhere. So hopefully this will breed more of those conversations.  In other words, no progress was made at the meeting. The caucus was unable to solve this particular problem, where Trump wants wall money as a condition of reopening the government, and Democrats won t negotiate until the government is reopened.
        
          In the Senate, a bipartisan group began meeting on Monday to solve the irresolvable problem. They drafted a letter in which they promised to debate and mark up the president s border security request if the president first agreed to sign a bill opening the government for three weeks. The letter, though, only said that the markup would include  debating and voting on investments on the Southern border that are necessary, effective, and appropriate to accomplish that goal. 
        
          Much like the statement from the Problem Solvers Caucus, this one wouldn t go so far as to say that Democrats would be willing to throw a few bucks toward the wall. The group had wanted to find language that could get signatures from 20 Republicans and 20 Democrats, but the White House successfully stanched the flow of Republican ink. The letter wasn t sent.
        
          If Trump is refusing to consider anything less than guaranteed money for his wall, and Democrats aren t willing to say that they ll give him wall money after he reopens the government, the fourth week of the shutdown ends the same way as the previous three did: with no legislative path out of the shutdown. The only progress made this week was toward a higher level of trolling.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/pelosi-commercial-travel-afghanistan-trump-shutdown.html,"
          A statement from Nancy Pelosi s office revealed Friday that the speaker of the House had planned to defy Trump s retaliatory efforts to cancel her trip abroad by flying commercially to Afghanistan. But now, according to that statement, Pelosi has canceled her second attempt at taking a congressional delegation to visit the troops and blames the Trump administration for leaking her travel plans.
        
           In the middle of the night, the State Department s Diplomatic Security Service provided an updated threat assessment detailing that the President announcing this sensitive travel had significantly increased the danger to the delegation and to the troops, security, and other officials supporting the trip,  Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said in a Friday statement.  This morning, we learned that the Administration had leaked the commercial travel plans as well. In light of the grave threats caused by the President s action, the delegation has decided to postpone the trip so as not to further endanger our troops and security personnel, or the other travelers on the flights. 
        
          Trump had canceled Pelosi s undisclosed plan to lead a congressional delegation on Thursday by revoking her access to the planned military transport. He promised to allow her to reschedule what he called a  seven-day excursion  and  public relations event  once the partial government shutdown ends.  Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial,  he added,  that would certainly be your prerogative. 
        
          The move was widely interpreted as retaliation for Pelosi s letter the previous day asking Trump to reschedule the Jan. 29 State of the Union address until after the shutdown ends, citing the number of security workers who would have to work the event without pay.
        
          The purpose of Pelosi s planned trip, according to Hammill, was to  express appreciation and thanks to our men and women in uniform for their service and dedication, and to obtain critical national security and intelligence briefings from those on the front lines.  While in Brussels for pilot rest, the congressional delegation was to meet with NATO commanders and allies  to affirm the United States  ironclad commitment to the NATO alliance. 
        
          In the statement Friday, Hammill said Pelosi s office had learned the Trump administration had leaked the congressional delegation s commercial travel plans. While no news outlets appeared to have reported on the plans before Pelosi s statement, Hammill told Slate that multiple sources from the administration were attempting to leak the news. A White House spokesperson responded to Pelosi s statement by pushing back on the claim:  The idea we would leak anything that would put the safety and security of any American at risk is an offensive flat out lie. 
        
          In a statement Friday, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget announced a full ban on the use of government-owned or government-chartered aircraft during the shutdown for a congressional delegation without express permission from the White House chief of staff. Late on Thursday, the White House also canceled a scheduled trip led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
        
          Some critics pointed out that President Trump flew to Afghanistan during the shutdown and that Melania Trump still flew to Florida on a government jet Thursday for a weekend vacation, just hours after her husband postponed Pelosi s trip to visit U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
        "

          President Trump on Thursday notified House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he was postponing her previously undisclosed trip to Europe and the Middle East, ostensibly because of the partial government shutdown. The move appeared to be in retaliation for a letter Pelosi sent to Trump on Wednesday asking him to reschedule the State of the Union address, scheduled for Jan. 29, until after the government has reopened (or to deliver his address in writing), citing the number of currently furloughed workers who would be involved in the planning and security work.
        
          Trump s letter read,  Due to the Shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the Shutdown is over. In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate. 
        
           Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial,  he added,  that would certainly be your prerogative. 
        
          It s unlikely Pelosi would take a commercial flight in lieu of the military transport that had been arranged. According to Politico, Pelosi s trip to Afghanistan had been kept secret because of security concerns, and she was set to leave on her trip later Thursday. While in Afghanistan, she was to meet with members of the military, as Trump did when he went to Iraq during the shutdown last month.
        
          In a statement responding to Trump s announcement, Pelosi s office denied that she planned to travel to Egypt. A spokesman explained,  The Congressional Delegation to Afghanistan included a required stop in Brussels for pilot rest. In Brussels, the delegation was scheduled to meet with top NATO commanders, U.S. military leaders and key allies to affirm the United States  ironclad commitment to the NATO alliance. 
        
          The purpose of the trip was to  express appreciation and thanks to our men and women in uniform for their service and dedication, and to obtain critical national security and intelligence briefings from those on the front lines,  according to the statement.
        
          Trump has not otherwise responded to Pelosi s letter, and according to Politico, the administration believes the government could still conduct a State of the Union address during a shutdown. But it remains unclear if Pelosi would simply cancel the event herself, as it is her role as speaker to invite, or disinvite, the president to give the address. Earlier in the day, Pelosi said she requested the SOTU postponement because she and other Democrats did not want security officials to work the event without pay.
        
          In response to Trump s statement, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer called the decision to postpone Pelosi s trip  a petty move and unworthy of the president of the United States.  Sen. Lindsey Graham took the opportunity to criticize Pelosi without supporting Trump s response:  One sophomoric response does not deserve another,  he tweeted.  Speaker Pelosi s threat to cancel the State of the Union is very irresponsible and blatantly political. 
        
          Other government trips will, it appears, continue as planned. A White House official told NBC News that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin will lead a delegation to Davos, Switzerland, next week for the World Economic Forum, as was planned. [Update, 6:27 p.m.: The White House has now canceled that trip.]
        
          The shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, is now on its 27th day, with no indication of ending soon.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/shutdown-science-government-stopped.html,"
          When the U.S. government shuts down, much of the science that it supports is not spared. And there is no magic light switch that can be flipped to reverse the impact.
        
          For instance, large-scale instruments like NASA s Stratoscopheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy ñ the  flying telescope  ñ have to stop operations. Eventually bringing such instrumentation back up to speed requires over a week. If the shutdown lingers, contingency funds provided to maintain large-scale instruments supported by agencies including NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation will run out and operations will cease, adding to the list of closed facilities.
        
          When I headed NSF s Division of Chemistry from March 2016 to July 2018, I experienced firsthand two shutdowns like the one the country is weathering now. The 1,800 NSF staff would be sent home, without access to email and without even the option to work voluntarily, until eventually an end to the shutdown was negotiated. As we were unsure how long the shutdowns would run, a lot of time was spent developing contingency plans ñ and coordinating with many hundreds of researchers about them. Concerns about what will happen to researchers  day-to-day projects are compounded by apprehension about interruptions to long-term funding.
        
          Many federal agencies perform science. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health are less affected by the shutdown this time since they already have their budgets for fiscal year 2019. But agencies including the NSF, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and NOAA have had to stop most work.
        
          In some sensitive areas involving plants, animals, earth or space phenomena that are cyclical or seasonal, scientists may miss critical windows for research. If something happens only once a year and the moment is now ñ such as the pollination window for some drought-resistant plants ñ a researcher will miss out and must wait another year. Other data sets have long records of measurements that are taken daily or at other defined times. Now they ll have holes in their data because federal workers can t do their jobs during a shutdown.
        
          Databases go dark. Many scientists and engineers across the country ñ indeed, across the globe ñ rely on the information in these databases, such as those offered by NIST, which is part of the Department of Commerce. When data can t be accessed, projects are delayed.
        
          Vital scientific meetings such as that of the American Meteorological Society and the American Astronomical Society which are heavily reliant upon the expertise of federal scientists have been affected by the shutdown, too. Federal scientists from the closed agencies cannot travel to conferences to learn about the most recent work in the fields, nor share their own findings.
        
          And of course, federal scientists serve as journal editors, reviewers and collaborators on research projects. Their inability to work has an impact across the scientific community in moving science and technology forward for our nation.
        
          Without a doubt, the government shutdown will delay, cancel or compress implementation timelines of initiatives to help drive development of new science and tech in the United States. This affects both U.S. research progress and the American STEM workforce. Missed (or delayed) opportunity costs are high, as some planned investments are in areas with fierce global competition and significant investments by other countries ñ think next-generation computers and communication ñ which are critical to the country s national security.
        
          The shutdown is not some long vacation. The amount of work that must be done at federal agencies isn t reduced. In fact, while the employees are away, the work continues to build up.
        
          For some divisions at the NSF, where I worked, the early part of the year is the peak period in terms of workload. Scientists submit around 40,000 research proposals annually, hoping to secure funding for their projects. The longer the shutdown, the more intense the workload will be once the government reopens, since decisions about the support of research still need to occur during the current fiscal year. Decisions ñ and projects ñ will be delayed.
        
          It is important to note that the government shutdown is exacerbating the effect of mostly flat budgets (with the exception of the 2009 stimulus) that many federally funded scientific agencies have been dealing with for more than a decade.
        
          Prior to the shutdown, contingencies were made to ensure that some of the scientific facilities have spending authority for at least a month or so of operations. But, if the shutdown continues, furloughs of facility staff may become necessary if the limits of obligated funding are reached.
        
          And, with all of these negatives, for all of the agencies that are shut down, the biggest question is what will happen to their budgets. Here we are, four months into the fiscal year, and agencies do not know what will happen to them for what remains of FY 2019. It is difficult to plan, it is difficult to continue to function and it affects STEM workforce morale, retention and ability to attract quality personnel into vitally important scientific roles.
        
          Now that we re facing the longest government shutdown to date, national security, health and the economy continue to be jeopardized by STEM research that s been slowed or stopped.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/trump-emergency-powers-wall-legal-case.html,"
          President Donald Trump has reportedly backed off for now from a proposal to invoke emergency powers under federal law or any  inherent  constitutional authority to build a wall along America s southern border, even though Congress has refused to accede to this request. Still, Trump is maintaining that he retains the authority to make such a move, and it s possible the frenetic commander in chief could change his mind again and whipsaw our nation into crisis the moment he gets impatient or feels slighted. Commentators, meanwhile, have rightly warned just how many federal laws actually do authorize certain kinds of emergency actions by a president. Others have pointed out differences between the current circumstances and other historical moments, such as Truman s seizure of steel mills during the Korean War, or even Lincoln s invocation of a national crisis to issue the Emancipation Proclamation.*
        
          But what is missing in this discussion is sufficient attention to the long-standing, fitful relationship between executive power and the country s deep-rooted problems of inequality and prejudice. Sure, Lincoln may have cited an emergency to liberate slaves in the seceding states, but many more presidents have claimed crises real or manufactured to target political and ethnic minorities outright, or to impose unequal burdens on them. Just think of the Roosevelt administration s shameful efforts to round up and intern individuals of Japanese ancestry based on vague fears of espionage and racist stereotypes during World War II. Or the George W. Bush administration s expansive theory of executive power after 9/11, which enabled  surveillance, detention, and torture these policies raised concerns that Muslims were being mistreated systematically, too.
        
          The current fight over the wall is of a piece with previous moves by the Trump administration such as family separation of unauthorized migrants and the Muslim travel ban and raises the same specter of expansive state power that can be marshaled against vulnerable political minorities. Like Muslim visitors, refugees and other migrants from Central and South America have been demonized as a group for the actions of a few and generally have little political power of their own to influence the debate so as to protect their own rights. Migrants have been called carriers of disease and potential perpetrators of violent crime by this openly xenophobic president. In retrospect, the description of weary migrants as  armies,   caravans,  and  invaders  in recent weeks may have been rhetorically priming citizens for such a wild power play all along. And in each of these areas, Congress has not sanctioned the president s policies, leaving him to  insist that he alone has the power to fix things.
        
          So we shouldn t pretend that the president s flirtation with emergency power is just about a wall. He and some of his key allies want to accomplish other things, too, acting unilaterally if he must. That includes ensuring that some immigrants especially those from places he s dubbed  shithole countries  are treated differently from others, enabling the use of lethal force against migrants, separating family members at the border, and even processing asylum claims differently, depending on who the applicants are and where they come from. If we allow him to gin up an emergency on this occasion, it will be easier to do so for all of these other things that affect foreigners and the dispossessed.
        
          The difficulty of attacking this problem frontally particularly in the courts can be seen in the Muslim ban outcome, where five conservative justices deferred to President Trump s judgment that national security required the exclusion of travelers from certain Muslim-majority countries. Existing jurisprudence requires evidence of malicious purpose before equal protection claims can succeed, and on the surface it might seem that building a giant concrete wall doesn t single anybody out. To make matters worse, the courts tend to treat foreigners as though they have fewer constitutional rights than citizens, despite the 14th Amendment s promise to protect all  persons.  Some judges will look the other way when someone cries  equal rights violation  unless there s a smoking gun. And this is all before we toss in a potential demand for deference to the executive.
        
          That these challenges would emerge during an actual lawsuit doesn t disturb the fact that extraordinary power has been historically deployed against vulnerable populations and makes life miserable for them. Outside of the courts, we don t have to subscribe to a few judges  parsimonious views of what equality demands. Recognizing the link between emergency power abuses and discriminatory action, then, will hopefully cause progressives to redouble political efforts to resist the current charade of Trump s vanity wall.
        
          Yet, there s more: how we might handle such a claim of extraordinary presidential power now would have major spillover effects. It has consequences for not only policies that affect foreigners, but also other policies like Trump s ban on transgender service members, which also rests in part on a strong assertion of presidential prerogative for a blatantly discriminatory action. For an authoritarian populist like Trump, who s already skeptical of human and civil rights, successful assertions of extraordinary authority can be a slippery slope toward broader and more pernicious actions, which is why this needs to be nipped in the bud now.
        
          Our legal and political tradition has ordinarily held that laws and policies must rest on empirical reality a real need, not a made-up one that government power always be justified, that we consider the scale of the emergency a president claims relative to the project he wants to undertake, and that we ask if there are other ways of dealing with the problems identified.
        
          If a president has invoked a law in bad faith, or has made up a crisis out of whole cloth, that should weigh heavily against allowing a policy to proceed. But it s crucial to see that it s not just up to judges to determine what constitutes an emergency action rather, we all have a part to play in helping to determine when it s reasonable for a president to act on his own.
        
          That collective judgment will have to be expressed in many different ways by making our views known to our elected officials, by filing and deciding lawsuits if it comes to that, by pushing Congress to vote to override a presidential veto and defund such an effort. But the president s plan doesn t just raise a concern about deliberative democracy; it also creates an opportunity to stand up for basic human dignity and equality for all.

          House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in her just-thinking-out-loud-here voice, passed on a suggestion to President Trump regarding the State of the Union address that s scheduled for Jan. 29: Since preparation for SOTUs requires a lot of planning and advance security work from federal employees currently on furlough, maybe he should consider another date unless the shutdown wraps up soon? Or submitting it in writing would work, too.
        
          It was unclear in reading Pelosi s letter whether she was asking him to reschedule or informing him that he would have to. State of the Union addresses require the speaker of the House to invite the president to Capitol Hill and for the House and Senate to pass a resolution. When Pelosi wrote that she  suggest[s]  the two  work together to determine another suitable date after government has re-opened for this address,  or to deliver the address in writing on the 29th, was this her diplomatic way of telling him the invitation was revoked?
        
          A spokesman for Pelosi said,  No,  this was not a formal rescinding of the invitation, just a proposal. Then, however, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer went on CNN and said,  the State of the Union is off.  A spokesman for Hoyer then clarified that  he hadn t read the actual letter and misunderstood.  OK. For now, this is just a proposal for Trump to mull over. If he decides that he does want to press forward and give a joint address to Congress on that specific day, he could receive a proper disinvitation.
        
          Trump could decide to sidestep a thrilling public scheduling debate with Pelosi altogether and choose one of several other options.
        
          The first option would be to reopen the government and deliver the address to Congress as scheduled. But let s not be frivolous.
        
          If the government is still shut down, he could submit the address in writing, as Pelosi suggested, and earn some goodwill with the millions of Americans who take their 9 p.m. Tuesday television programs seriously. He could deliver the speech from the Oval Office or another White House set-up. He d probably appreciate some applauding crowds, though, applauding for his applause lines. In that case, he could submit the address in writing and deliver it later that day during a MAGA rally along the border. The net effect of any of these alternatives is that the following day, Republicans and Democrats would   still wake up with starkly different views about the merit of funding additional physical barriers on the southern border and few political incentives to reach an agreement. But surely they ll have more ideas for cheeky letters.

          The Trump administration announced Tuesday it was recalling nearly 50,000 furloughed federal workers and putting them back on the job without pay to fulfill critical government functions as the government shutdown stretches into its fourth week with no end in sight. Those workers will join the 420,000 federal employees that have already been classified as essential and are working without pay. The recalls have functionally kept large swaths of the government open, but the Trump administration has simply shifted the burden of responsibility to the individual workers who are being compelled to work without getting paid.
        
          There are 800,000 federal workers overall who have been furloughed and are not getting paid during the shutdown. The recalled workers are being required to process tax refunds and fill food inspection roles, among other regulatory roles.  The efforts in recent days illustrate how President Donald Trump is trying to limit the impact of the partial government shutdown and shield favored industries as the funding impasse thwarts the deployment of new aircraft, stock offerings and even craft beers,  Bloomberg reports.  Critics say the Trump administration is skirting federal law by continuing some functions amid the political stalemate  A 149-year-old law bars agencies from spending money Congress hasn t given to them, with only limited exceptions for  emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property. 
        
          A host of unions representing different groups of affected federal workers, including the air traffic controllers and the National Treasury Employees Union, have tried suing the government for forcing their workers to stay on the job without pay, but the courts have so far rejected the arguments.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/trump-border-wall-support-government-shutdown.html,"
          The government shutdown has already proved costly for President Donald Trump. A majority of Americans, including 53 percent of independent voters, blame him for the crisis, the longest in the country s history. Trump s approval rating has continued to slide since the shutdown began more than three weeks ago, now barely scratching 40 percent. Last week s antics, in which Trump misused a prime-time address to score political points, lambaste the opposition, and demonize immigrants, apparently managed to persuade a laughable 2 percent of viewers of the need for a border wall. Only 31 percent of Americans support Trump using emergency powers to build the wall, as he has suggested he might, with 66 percent opposed. Trump s visit to the border in Texas didn t fare any better, with landowners announcing their intention to fight the government s plan to seize their lands through eminent domain. In a desperate attempt to sway public opinion, Trump proceeded to tweet misleading figures on crime and immigration, which were soon fact-checked and debunked. Through it all, the president has appeared distraught, a hustler whose bluff has run its course.
        
          But while Trump s current gamble appears doomed, his longer nativist con faces better odds. Forty-two percent of Americans now support the construction of the border wall, a full 8 percentage point jump from previous results on the same question, published one year ago. Respondents who said they  strongly support  the wall s construction increased as well, from 25 percent to 29 percent, while the number of Americans who  strongly oppose  the wall has fallen dramatically, from a clear 53 percent majority a year ago to a startling 38 percent in the middle of Trump s border-inspired government paralysis.
        
          Trump s nativist rhetoric has been particularly successful with Republican voters, 88 percent of whom support the president s border wall. As alarming as it is, the number is part of a larger trend. In another recent poll, 3 out of 4 Republican respondents identified illegal immigration as the biggest challenge facing the United States, an irrational concern in a country where income disparity, gun violence, or drug addiction are far more worrisome, but one that fits Trump s fearmongering like a glove. And while it s tempting to dismiss the president s demagoguery as unreasonable, Trump s messaging continues to be an effective device for emotional manipulation, as Slate s Yascha Mounk recently wrote. With the exception of the possibility of impeachment, nothing makes Republicans angrier than illegal immigration.
        
          Democrats should be careful not to misread the zeitgeist. The prolonged success of Donald Trump s nativist message among Republican voters and the way his manic insistence on the wall has apparently made noticeable inroads among the general public need to be taken seriously. Of course, Trump is wrong in his aggressive call for the border wall, and so are those who mistake a humanitarian crisis happening thousands of miles from the border in Central America with an existential threat against the United States, but intellectual annoyance is an ineffective political tool.
        
          If the Democratic Party s ultimate goal is to win the presidency back from Trump, it will have to carefully consider how best to approach the issue. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli·n Castro, who recently announced his presidential candidacy, has called the president  a failed leader  on immigration while dismissing Trump s persistence on the wall as merely a way to stoke his political base. Other Democratic candidates will likely echo Castro s position during the party s primaries. They should be prudent. With the general election in mind, it seems misguided to dismiss the wall as nothing but a political symbol or a dog whistle.
        
          In 2020, the party s ideals on immigration could have to take a backseat to the more pressing issue of electability. Democrats could consider, for example, shelving calls to abolish ICE, a rallying cry for some of the party s base but a fairly unpopular position nonetheless. It s not a matter of resigning the party s progressive principles or its more ambitious goals on the issue, but rather a call for stark pragmatism and for workable immigration policies. From the beginning of his presidential campaign, Trump s nativist rhetoric has struck a raw nerve. However hateful and irrational, it seems to have endured. The Democratic candidate for president will need to recognize its existence and deactivate its persistent toxicity while also validating the concerns of those who, for example, support building Trump s border wall. It will be a delicate balancing act, to say the least.
        
          In the meantime, the president will be sticking with his not-so-delicate message.

          One of the criticisms of the Democratic Party that has been made approximately one billion times since Barack Obama took power in 2008 is that its leaders are too quick to compromise. From the decision to leave the  public option  out of the Affordable Care Act, to Obama s offer to make cuts to entitlement programs in 2013, to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer s agreement to  fast-track  the confirmation of judicial nominees in October 2018, a pattern has emerged: Dems bend over backwards to make concessions to Republican interests and talking points but Republicans never, ever return the favor.
        
          The border wall-shutdown standoff is exactly the kind of situation in which another Democratic fold would seem to be, er, in the cards. And yet not only have Schumer and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi not folded, it doesn t seem like they ve even thought about folding, despite some grumbling by new House members from swing districts. It s gotten to the point where Donald Trump invited several centrist-ish rank-and-file Democrats to have lunch with him Tuesday without caucus leaders, ostensibly to woo and seduce them, but it didn t work; none of them went. Pelosi even got off a good zing about it:
        
          Democrats: Not in disarray! They also, per multiple polls, hold the significantly more popular position on just about every shutdown and wall-related question and looking forward, an ABC-Washington Post survey found that respondents opposed Trump s oft-threatened plan to launch the wall project via a declaration of national emergency by a blowout-level, mercy-rule 66ñ31 margin.

        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/national-emergency-wall-trump-impeachment.html,"
          A version of this piece first appeared on the blog Impeachable Offenses.
        
          The looming question in the ongoing government shutdown is whether President Donald Trump will, as he repeatedly threatens, declare a  national emergency  to get funding for his border wall if Congress will not pass budgetary authorization for the edifice. Multiple excellent analyses of a president s legal authority to declare such emergencies have appeared. The upshot of all of them is that the administration could make superficially plausible arguments for such authority but that all such arguments would trigger compelling legal challenges. Moreover, a use of  emergency  powers to circumvent congressional unwillingness to fund a long-wished-for presidential pet project would be both unprecedented and a serious challenge to constitutional separation of powers norms.
        
          What has not been fully addressed is the claim, floated by several commentators, that declaration of a national emergency under these circumstances would constitute an impeachable offense. As a constitutional matter, I believe such a declaration could constitute part of a larger pattern of impeachable conduct. However, three factors would make the political path to impeachment on that ground very tricky. The first is the promiscuity with which Congress has ceded emergency authority to the president. The second is the Supreme Court s overzealous limitations on the so-called congressional veto a mechanism for constraining presidential misuse of Congress  grants of discretion. The third is the distressing likelihood that Republican legislators, blinded by tribalism and cowed by Trump s enduring popularity with the Republican base, would not defend their own constitutional authority. Let s walk through the problem.
        
          First, as all but a few outliers concede, impeachable offenses need not be crimes. As George Mason, who introduced the phrase  high Crimes and Misdemeanors  into the constitutional text, observed, the primary objective of the impeachment mechanism is to forestall  [a]ttempts to subvert the Constitution.  Multiple British parliaments, from whose precedents Mason drew the phrase  high Crimes and Misdemeanors,  employed impeachment, not for punishment of statutory crime, but to remove executive officials who  subvert[ed] the ancient and well-established form of government  of Great Britain.
        
          One of the most fundamental precepts of American constitutional government is that Congress makes the laws and, in particular, maintains the power of the purse. Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution is unequivocal:  No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.  The wall dispute is nothing more than an appropriations fight. The president wants Congress to appropriate money for a special purpose building a border wall and Congress declines to do so. A president who claims the power to spend $5.7 billion dollars on a project Congress has expressly refused to authorize is therefore in undoubted violation of the most basic separation of powers principle   unless he can claim that Congress has somehow already authorized him to act.
        
          That s where the threatened declaration of national emergency comes in. One potentially salutary effect of Trump s threat is that it has awakened the public to the striking variety of laws permitting a president to claim emergency powers. On the one hand, the existence of such laws is unsurprising. In the modern interconnected world, real threats to the public welfare war, terrorism, disease, or natural disaster can arise quickly. Sometimes the federal government is the only entity with the resources for adequate response, and sometimes action will be required before Congress can authorize it. On the other hand, Congress  choice to delegate emergency power rests on the assumption, the norm if you will, that presidents will not misuse that power to circumvent ordinary constitutional arrangements. Trump is casting a bright and disconcerting light on that happy assumption.
        
          The most likely legal sources of emergency authority for wall building lie in statutes relating to military matters such as 10 U.S.C. Section 2808(a). That act provides that, upon presidential declaration of  a national emergency   that requires use of the armed forces,  the government may  undertake military construction projects   that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces. 
        
          Of course, whatever one s view of the current situation at the border, there is no serious case that it  requires the use of the armed forces.  Regulating commerce, immigration, and crime at the border are all traditional civilian functions, and there has been no recent change, no  crisis,  remotely justifying military intervention. Moreover, even if one believed that the Army had a useful role to play in border security, it cannot be plausibly argued that building several hundred miles of wall would be  necessary to support  military operations. Indeed, Trump s approach to the issue would turn the statute on its head. He has not claimed that there are required military operations for which a wall would be necessary support. Rather, he claims that the wall is necessary, and thus, in the absence of congressional authorization to build it, military funds should be diverted for its construction.
        
          But assume that whether under Section 2808(a) or some other statute Trump claims emergency power to build his wall. Opponents would have two possible avenues of response.
        
          First, subject to rules about standing, a variety of folks might sue (Congress itself, individual members of Congress, border landowners, conservation groups, etc.). Three lines of argument seem likely: (a) there is no  emergency  justifying a presidential declaration in the first place; (b) emergency or not, building a border wall doesn t fit within the parameters of whatever emergency statute Trump chose to rely on (e.g., building a wall is not necessary to support military operations); or (c) the broader contention that this particular declaration of emergency powers is a transparent nullification of the Constitution s allocation of powers among the branches of the federal government.
        
          Traditionally, courts try very hard to avoid second-guessing presidential decisions in areas where either the Constitution or statutes grant him wide discretionary authority. That said, using emergency powers to authorize a long-debated civilian construction project in the face of congressional refusal to appropriate seems such a flagrant abuse that I suspect the courts would ultimately rule against Trump. Nonetheless, he would have a fig leaf of legal justification, and resolving the matter would take months or years.
        
          Alternatively, Trump s congressional opponents could invoke the provisions of the National Emergencies Act. That law, passed in 1976, created a mechanism for congressional termination of presidentially declared emergencies. As originally written, such emergencies ended once the president said so or Congress passed a  concurrent resolution  (a resolution by both the House and Senate). In its original form, the law did not involve the president in the congressional termination process; once the concurrent resolution passed both houses, the emergency would be over, regardless of what the president had to say about it.
        
          However, in a 1983 case called INS v. Chadha, the U.S. Supreme Court seemingly voided all so-called legislative vetoes. Chadha involved a statute that allowed a vote by one house of Congress to reverse certain executive branch decisions about immigration cases. The court decided that this procedure violated the constitutional requirement that lawmaking be bicameral, i.e., involve votes by both the House and Senate, and the so-called presentment clauses that require presidential signature before a bill can become law. The primary focus of Chadha was the unicameral nature of the immigration procedure at issue, but Chadha at the least casts grave doubt on the validity of even bicameral congressional veto procedures.
        
          Therefore, in 1985, Congress amended the National Emergencies Act to specify that presidential emergencies terminate when  there is enacted into law a joint resolution terminating the emergency.  This language implies that, to become  law,  the joint resolution would have to be presented to the president for signature. Thus, the president could veto the resolution, leaving the emergency in place unless Congress could summon two-thirds majorities in both houses for an override.
        
          In any previous era of American history, securing a majority or even a supermajority of both the House and Senate to void a president s blatant nullification of the constitutional appropriations authority of Congress would, I think, have been a cinch. Any rational legislator, even one of the same party as the president, would recognize that acquiescence would badly dilute his or her own institutional power. Not to speak of creating a precedent that would be employed by succeeding presidents of the opposite party.
        
          However, the standards and institutional self-respect of this Congress (particularly, if I may say, its Republican members) are so degraded that it seems entirely possible that all but a handful of Republicans would vote to uphold the emergency declaration the Constitution and separation of powers be damned.
        
          Which brings us to impeachment. I have no doubt that the founders would have considered presidential abuse of emergency powers to nullify congressional appropriations authority to be impeachable conduct. Invocation of emergency authority in the wall dispute would be unprecedented. It would amount to presidential rule by decree and subversion of a bedrock of American constitutional design.
        
          That said, I suspect even the most doctrinaire constitutionalists might hesitate to impeach a president for a single instance of such abuse. One can fairly argue that Harry Truman s effort to seize the steel industry for national security reasons in the face of a nationwide strike was a more egregious overstep, and the remedy there was not impeachment but a judicial smackdown by the Supreme Court in the Steel Seizure Case. However, an unwarranted emergency declaration by Trump would not be an isolated misstep but merely a single item in the bill of particulars supporting impeachment for a pattern of conduct destructive of the constitutional order.
        
          The likelihood of a Trump wall emergency becoming part of articles of impeachment would be enhanced if one or both of two things occurred.
        
          First, before Congress could seriously contemplate impeaching Trump for abusing his emergency powers, it would have to have exerted its own authority by voting to terminate Trump s emergency declaration under the National Emergencies Act. If Congress made no effort to use this tool or failed to secure majority votes in both houses, it would be poorly placed to argue that Trump had committed a major constitutional sin against congressional prerogatives. Congressional termination of the emergency by majority votes including significant numbers of Republicans in both houses would be an especially persuasive indicator that this was a constitutional, and not a partisan, disagreement. Still better (though implausible) would be termination votes by veto-proof two-thirds majorities. Sadly, the events of the past two years give one little confidence that many Republican legislators retain sufficient awareness of constitutional principles or indeed sufficient institutional self-respect to resist their raging leader.
        
          Second, if the Supreme Court definitively rejected Trump s move as an unconstitutional breach of the separation of powers, the case for impeachment would be significantly strengthened. A ruling against Trump on the ground that he violated the terms of a particular emergency powers statute would also be helpful, though not as compelling. Mere misapplication of statutory language even if the misapplication is willful and flagrant has less resonance as a ground for removal than a constitutional infraction. In either case, Trump would surely bluster and denigrate the judges, but a well-reasoned judicial repudiation of Trump s overreach could stiffen the spines and harden the resolves of Republican legislators now too timorous to do what most know is right.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/trump-steel-slat-border-wall-prototype-saw.html,"
          The Department of Homeland Security found in 2017 that the steel slat border wall prototype can be cut through with a saw, NBC News reported Thursday. President Trump has been championing the steel slat design as a cost-effective alternative to a concrete wall in an attempt to demonstrate his willingness to negotiate with Democrats during the government shutdown.
        
          In October 2017, six contractors commissioned by the Trump administration built eight different border wall prototypes in San Diego near the U.S.-Mexico border. Customs and Border Protection, an agency run under the Department of Homeland Security, then conducted tests on the prototypes to check for vulnerabilities. The agency produced an internal report in February indicating that inspectors were able to breach the steel slat prototype with a saw. NBC obtained a picture of the resulting hole:
        
          The next month, in March, President Donald Trump visited San Diego to inspect the prototypes. During his visit, he noted his preference for  see-through  barriers such as the steel slat design. He d previously argued that this feature allowed people to avoid getting hit by  large sacks of drugs  that may be catapulted from the other side.
        
          Trump is currently refusing to sign any spending bills that do not include a $5.7 billion allotment for a barrier along the border, which has led to a weekslong partial shutdown of the government. He has repeatedly made the false claim that Democrats are requesting a steel slat barrier.
        
           While the design currently being constructed was informed by what we learned in the prototypes, it does not replicate those designs,  Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Katie Waldman told NBC when asked about the steel slat vulnerability.  The steel bollard design is internally reinforced with materials that require time and multiple industrial tools to breach, thereby providing U.S. Border Patrol agents additional response time to affect a successful law enforcement resolution. In the event that one of the steel bollards becomes damaged, it is quick and cost-effective to repair. 
        
          Building Trump s barrier would be a complex challenge given the varying terrain along the U.S.-Mexico border and would be disruptive to private property owners and wildlife. The hypothetical barrier would likely require technological enhancements such as tunnel detectors and motion-sensing cameras. Arrests for unauthorized border crossings are also at a historic low and the bulk of illegal drug imports enter the U.S. through official ports.
        
          Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Ralph DeSio told San Diego outlet KPBS that the prototypes  were not and cannot be designed to be indestructible.  During the 2016 presidential race, Trump promised that the wall would be  impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful.

          Wall, wall, wall! Why are Democrats fixating on this wall thing?
        
          One possible reason is that it has been what President Donald Trump and the people around him have been talking about constantly for the past three years.  DHS is committed to building wall and building wall quickly,  the Department of Homeland Security recently wrote on its website.  I would ask for wall. We need wall,  said DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in an appearance before Congress.  The wall will get built,  Trump said in the Dec. 11 Oval Office meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer during which he promised to shut down the government unless Congress authorized wall funding.  It s not a fence, it s a wall. We re going to build a wall,  he said in 2017.  Maybe someday they ll call it the Trump Wall,  he said in 2015.  A nice powerful wall  is needed urgently to prevent the entry into the U.S. of refugees from Central America, Trump said Thursday morning.
        
          Here is a transcript on the White House s own website from a Wednesday event at which the president explained that when he talks about a wall, he is expressly talking about a physical wall and not  a multi-faceted approach to border security :

          Iowa Rep. Steve King, who has openly supported white nationalist policies, appears to feel satisfied by President Donald Trump s attempt to bring fringe anti-immigrant talking points long espoused by King into the mainstream in his campaign for a border wall, as the New York Times reported Thursday.
        
           White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization how did that language become offensive?  King asked the Times in an interview.  Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization? 
        
          The report comes one day after Iowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra announced that he planned to challenge King in the Republican primary in 2020, in part because the  current representative s caustic nature has left us without a seat at the table.  King, who was first elected to Congress in the deep-red district in Iowa in 2002, narrowly beat a Democratic challenger last year.
        
          While the question King posed to the Times is itself shocking, King s support for white supremacy has long been documented. A list of some things he has said and done, in no particular order:
        
          ï In 2016, King said on MSNBC that white people (or Western civilization an only slightly improved reading of his statement if you re feeling generous) are the  subgroup of people  who have contributed the most to the world.ï He tweeted last year that  We can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies,  a key belief of white nationalism.ï That tweet was in support of the far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who has said he  hates Islam  and wants to ban the Quran. King also hosted Wilders at a breakfast.ï King retweeted a neo-Nazi who believes pornography is part of a Jewish plot to destroy Christian families and morality.ï He complained the U.S. was becoming a  third world country  because of immigrants, whom he also blamed for the threats of ISIS and Ebola.ï He has displayed a Confederate flag in his office, despite being from the decidedly not-Southern state of Iowa. After the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting, he continued to defend displaying the flag in public buildings.ï He once tweeted out a cartoon of Obama wearing a turban while vowing revenge for the Crusades.ï King dismissed concerns about the racial profiling of Ferguson, Missouri, protesters because they were all  of a single origin, I should say, a continental origin. ï He complained this August about the  Great Replacement  conspiracy theory that contends mass migration is destroying white civilization.ï In that interview, he also said:  If we don t defend Western civilization, then we will become subjugated by the people who are the enemies of faith, the enemies of justice  and blamed abortion for killing  millions  of white babies.ï In August, he also met with a far-right Austrian party with historical ties to Nazis.ï In 2013, he said that for every child of undocumented immigrants  who s a valedictorian, there s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and they ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert. 
        
          While a few people in his party have loudly condemned the congressman s openly racist behavior, Trump, who once called King a  smart person with, really, the right views on almost everything,  has not joined them in doing so. Trump has boasted about raising money for King s campaigns, as the Times noted. The president s current language about the  crisis  at the border reflects only loyalty to King s rhetorical legacy.

          The United States Coast Guard offered up five-page tip sheet to its employees that are grappling with missing paychecks due to the nearly three-week shutdown. The guidance titled   Managing your finances during a furlough  gives some clear-eyed financial advice and practical suggestions on dealing with the sudden, unanticipated loss of a salary for an uncertain amount of time. It then went on to give some more tone deaf advice in  Step Four: Supplement Your Income,  including babysitting, dog walking, and selling your stuff to make ends meet.
        
          The Coast Guard is part of the Department of Homeland Security, unlike the other branches of the military that are under the Department of Defense, and therefore its funding is impacted by the government closure. Of the Coast Guard s 8,500-person civilian workforce that last received a paycheck Dec. 22nd, 6,400 are on indefinite furlough, while 2,100 others that have been deemed essential workers are still on the job working without pay, the Washington Post reports. On top of those workers, there are 41,000 active-duty Coast Guardsmen working without pay as a result of the shutdown.
        
          The Coast Guard took the tip sheet down from its Coast Guard Support Program website after it was reported on by the Post, telling the paper the tips do not  reflect the Coast Guard s current efforts to support our workforce during this lapse in appropriations.  Across the federal government there are 350,000 workers currently at home on furlough and 420,000 working unpaid with assurances they ll be paid retroactively.

          Now that the dust has settled from Donald Trump s Oval Office speech selling his government shutdown for a border wall on Tuesday night, one thing is clear: He blew it. He blew it for a thousand reasons, including his strange flat affect, the words-read-in-proof-of-life-video cadence, his crucial factual misrepresentations, and how he bore the burden of persuasion and just didn t persuade. It was a failure of negotiation, a failure of policy, and most catastrophically a failure of television. No episode of The Apprentice featuring such a mediocre performance and boring reveal would have ever made it to prime time.
        
          But amid all the legitimate bellyaching about whether the major networks should have agreed to carry a nonñnews event delivered by a serial fabricator, many may have missed the bigger victory: Two years into the Trump administration, the center seems to have held. Something that looked like normal prevailed. Tuesday night proved that something is checking this out-of-control president. Trump spent several days prior to the prime-time Oval Office address laying the groundwork for a plan to declare a state of emergency at the southern border and unilaterally employ a  military version  of eminent domain to seize private land along the border to build his wall without congressional consent.
        
          Whether the president could have done any of that is in dispute. The academy spent the weekend debating the president s legal authority to make such a move, but it is an open question. Trump certainly could have tested this insane new challenge to our democracy in courts, as he has done time and again before. Yet somehow it looks like, for now at least, Trump blinked. Somewhere, a legal adviser must have told him that he didn t have the clear authority to do what he planned to do, or that the legal risk was too high, or that he would be entering a yearslong quagmire of litigation that he might not win. And apparently, he listened. So instead of doing what he did when he announced his Muslim ban, or his transgender ban, or when his administration started unlawfully taking children from their parents at the border, or any number of his other misguided legal proclamations, Trump opted to stand down. Instead he went with the b-roll an Oval Office infomercial for helping poor migrants at the border by paying for a wall to keep them out, because they re actually probably horrible violent criminals. Indeed, but for the toll-free number on the bottom of the screen and all the xenophobic talk about  killing, beheading, and dismembering,  it came across more as a lengthy pitch for a humanitarian aid charity than an announcement of an imminent national security crisis.
        
          It wasn t necessarily going to go this way. For days prior to the speech, the president had signaled his intent to declare a national state of emergency.  We re looking at a national emergency because we have a national emergency. Just read the papers,  Trump told reporters on Sunday. Over the weekend, legal experts debated whether Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, or Bruce Ackerman of Yale Law School had the better of the claims around the scope of the president s legal authority to make such a declaration. The question, it seemed, would ultimately come down to what the Supreme Court might determine. But as all that academic analysis was happening, a funny thing also occurred: Conservative thinkers actually recognized the enormous threat to our constitutional system that such an emergency declaration without an actual emergency would pose. Former Judge Andrew Napolitano, for one, explained on Fox News how under the system Trump is proposing, Barack Obama might have declared a state of emergency to address health care reform,  but obviously he didn t, because he couldn t.  David French agreed. Jonah Goldberg argued that it would be catastrophic for Trump to arrogate such powers to himself. Senate Republicans seemed to concur, with obvious hedges:  I m confident he could declare a national emergency,  Sen. John Cornyn told CNN.  But what that may mean in terms of adding new elements to this, in terms of court hearings and litigation that may carry this on for weeks and months and years. To me, injecting a new element in this just makes it more complicated.  Sen. Susan Collins of Maine added that although the law provides the president with emergency powers,  the administration should not act on a claim of dubious constitutional authority.  Again, surprisingly, Trump seems to have listened.
        
          For two years, those of us who bemoaned the hemorrhaging rule of law, and the demise of the legal guardrails that constrain normal presidents, have worried that what s holding our constitutional democracy together is actually only norms, not laws, and that each time this president does whatever damn Calvinball thing he wants, the courts must clang painfully into gear in a lumbering response to his whims. Even if he loses more often than he wins, the result has been a perpetual shock to the legal system and palpable harms to real people as the cases grind forward. But Tuesday night, the opposite seems to have happened: The soft power of legal norms and the warnings (or lack of enthusiasm) of his closest boosters, including his own White House counsel, seem to have spooked the president into standing down. That is how normal constitutional democracies function, but it s been such a foreign occurrence in recent years, we almost didn t clock it when we saw it.
        
          To be certain, Trump isn t done threatening to declare a state of emergency and dare all of us to just deal. On Wednesday, he told reporters in the Oval Office that he maintains  the absolute right to do national emergency if I want,  adding,  My threshold will be if I can t make a deal with people that are unreasonable.  Now, in some sense, the legal threshold for determining whether a national emergency exists is usually not failure to have your political demands met. But the statement suggests that the president, who stormed out of a meeting with Democratic congressional leaders Wednesday afternoon, is still not above going it alone. He may yet just declare an emergency to be able to tell his base he did everything he could to get his wall and chance it in the courts. Even still, it s refreshing to witness the president backing away from a demented theory about boundless executive power rather than immediately taking it out for a test run to see how fast it will go. Since the president was inaugurated two years ago, that hasn t happened as often as it should.
        
          For the folks who maintain that strong institutions remain the best check on this presidency, even as Trump corrodes and corrupts those institutions daily, it s heartening to see Congress, the courts, and even network television beginning to morph so as to better respond to these attacks. On Tuesday, Trump demonstrated that he isn t quite as good at TV as he once believed, he s not terribly gifted at policy or negotiation, and he s more frightened by soft legal norms than he s previously let on. A year ago, we doubted whether any of our institutions would survive Donald Trump. More and more, it appears they may be tougher than they looked.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/trump-border-wall-military-congress-shutdown-emergency.html,"
          As the shutdown stretches on, the Trump administration is beginning to realize the severity of its consequences for millions of Americans and is desperately searching for a way out. While President Donald Trump did not declare a national emergency during his speech on Tuesday night and subsequently direct the military to build a border wall, the plan remains on the table. Axios on Wednesday cited an administration official as describing an emergency declaration as  the most likely ultimate option. 
        
          This plan is not only outlandish it s also illegal. Commentators have noted that the military is prohibited from enforcing domestic law without express congressional authorization, and there are specific prohibitions that would apply directly to efforts to enforce immigration law. In addition to those concerns, there s an even more basic one: The Defense Department lacks funding to build a border wall, and Trump s claims of emergency authority do not change that.
        
          There are at least three significant legal issues with Trump s plan that stand in the way of securing funds for the military to build the wall. First, there is no emergency allowing for him to utilize the military in this manner. Second, the relevant emergency construction authority does not allow him to build a border wall, because the statute requires that the construction be needed to support the use of armed forces, but in this case, it would be the other way around. Third, the legality of seizing vast swaths of private, state, and tribal land to build a wall along the entire border is highly suspect at best.
        
          In short, even if the president declares a national emergency, he cannot simply use the military to build a wall.
        
          The president wants to use emergency powers to build the wall because Congress has not provided funding for it, meaning that any attempt by the Trump administration to do so would result in serious legal consequences. The Constitution requires that  No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.  This requirement is reaffirmed in the Anti-Deficiency Act, which states that government employees may not  make or authorize an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation or fund for the expenditure or obligation.  Any action by an executive branch agency necessarily requires funding, at the very least the salary paid to the individual carrying that action out.
        
          When a government employee violates the ADA, the head of the agency is required to submit a report to the president and Congress detailing the violation and the actions taken. The ADA specifies that individuals who violate the law are subject to administrative discipline, including  suspension from duty without pay or removal from office.  For knowing and willful violations, there are criminal penalties, including up to two years in prison.
        
          In an attempt to sidestep the lack of funding, Trump has proposed invoking emergency authority. Specifically, he reportedly wants to exercise emergency military construction authority pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 2808, which states that:
        
          The National Emergencies Act sets forth the procedures for declaring a national emergency and for fast-track congressional review of that determination. (The law was passed in the wake of Nixon s abuse of emergency authorities.) The authority is broad, with no specific definition as to what constitutes a national emergency. However, the declaration of a national emergency to justify emergency military construction is rare; the only recent instance in which a president invoked the provision domestically was after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, to do work on  military installations storing sensitive materials or demilitarized chemical weapons. 
        
          While the National Emergencies Act provides broad authority to declare a national emergency, simply saying he thinks something is a national emergency does not provide Trump with the authority to build a wall. In order to use emergency military construction authority, there must in fact exist a national emergency  that requires use of the armed forces.  In other words, beyond declaring simply that a national emergency exists, the executive branch must be able to show that the emergency at issue necessitates use of the armed forces.
        
          There s no evidence that any such emergency exists with respect to our border with Mexico. Border crossings are quite low by historical standards. And while the Trump administration has falsely argued that a border wall is necessary to combat terrorism, its own data shows there is  no credible evidence  of terrorists crossing the Mexican border. Instead, there has been an increase in families with children escaping violence in Central America and seeking asylum in the United States. There is no reasonable argument that families and children seeking asylum constitute an emergency that demands a military response.
        
          And while the administration has recently seemed to suggest that drug smuggling could be the basis for an emergency declaration, such a notion is not supported by the administration s own Drug Enforcement Agency. According to the 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment, only a small portion of the heroin and fentanyl that comes into the country is smuggled between ports of entry where the wall would be built. Far more comes through the ports themselves.
        
          But even if the Trump administration were able to argue for some type of emergency, or a court declined to closely review the executive branch s judgment on this matter, it would also have to show that military construction was  necessary to support such use of the armed forces.  But as Trump has made abundantly clear, the construction of a wall is not to support the use of the armed forces; it s the purpose of employing the military in the first place.
        
          This is no small distinction. Congress provided emergency construction authority to allow for the Defense Department to begin military construction projects quickly to support emergency efforts. The touchstone is that there is an actual need for the military to act, and in the process of taking that action, the DOD may need to engage in construction without going through the detailed process normally undertaken prior to military construction. President Trump s proposal turns this rationale on its head. Under his reported plan, the DOD essentially would be turned into Trump s personal construction company, stepping in where the executive branch otherwise lacks authority to build.
        
          Finally, any border wall could only be built on property under the jurisdiction of the DOD. Section 2808 only allows the DOD to  undertake military construction projects.  Section 2801(a) specifies that    military construction  as used in this chapter or any other provision of law includes any construction, development, conversion, or extension of any kind carried out with respect to a military installation,  and Section 2801(c)(4) states that  the term  military installation  means a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department. 
        
          Federal lands make up less than one-third of the 2,000-mile southern border, and military bases are a small percentage of that. (This is assuming that the DOD could even claim jurisdiction over all federal land for these purposes, which is not a given.) Thus, if Trump intends to utilize the military to build a border wall, it would require seizing significant amounts of private, state, and tribal land along the border. Trump has explicitly discussed this option, saying he could use  the military version of eminent domain  to build his wall. However, absent congressional authorization, it is highly dubious at best that the president can simply seize the land. (See Youngstown v. Sawyer.)
        
          Some legal commentators have suggested that rather than Section 2808, Trump might attempt to use authority under 33 U.S.C. 2293, which provides for reallocating funds for civil works during national emergencies. Similar to Section 2808, this provision applies to any national emergency that  requires or may require use of the Armed Forces,  meaning it would raise the same legal issues there. But even more importantly, this provision does not provide any new authority for the military to engage in construction projects. It s a reprogramming authority, meaning that it allows for the DOD to reallocate funding between projects but not undertake new, unauthorized projects. The provision makes this clear, saying that the funding can only be utilized for  authorized civil works, military construction, and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense  (emphasis added). It provides no new authority for the DOD to build a border wall.
        
          The proposal to use a sham emergency lacking in factual basis to convert the military into Trump s personal construction company is not only illegal it also raises serious practical concerns. Any funding for emergency projects must be taken from existing funding for military construction, meaning that Trump will have to divert money from projects the military has determined are needed in order to pay for his border wall. That will not sit well with DOD officials, and it will also raise serious concerns among members of Congress when legitimate military construction projects in their districts are delayed or canceled.
        
          In addition, the proposal would likely face significant opposition from the officials asked to carry it out. As with any action by the administration that involves use of taxpayer funds, there would be career officials throughout the government who would have to sign off on the use of funding and carry out the plan itself. Given the administrative and legal penalties associated with violating the ADA, they would likely have serious concerns about exposing themselves to those risks. Even if the Trump administration would look the other way, there would be significant congressional oversight. (And while the imposition of criminal consequences is admittedly unlikely in this context, the statute of limitations for criminal penalties would extend beyond Trump s first term.)
        
          But beyond all of these specific concerns, a broader issue is raised by this contemplated action. It is not only illegal and impractical, but wholly at odds with our constitutional structure and values. Trump s proposal is the type of unilateral action one would expect to find in an authoritarian regime. The national emergency is not at our southern border. It sits in the White House.

          When the Pardon Furthers the Conspiracy: Limits to the Pardon Power
        "

          In just the latest example of his quixotic and impulsive decision-making style, President Donald Trump has been reportedly considering using emergency powers to build his wall. While such a move faces major constitutional and legal hurdles, the practical effects would likely follow a clear pattern for this administration. The president s past demands for instant gratification have created an uncomfortable dynamic for Cabinet members and agency heads, who have rushed through policies vulnerable to all manner of legal challenge.
        
          To a degree beyond any previous president, though, Trump s rash orders have been particularly vulnerable to administrative process challenges. While Trump seems to relish the chaos created from lobbing political curve balls, his caprice often saddles his agencies with sharp rebukes in federal court. On an array of issues, courts have blocked Trump administration policies, finding them illegal for failure to provide adequate public notice and comment periods, and for ill-considered,  arbitrary and capricious  rulemakings. The fate of any Trump emergency proposal won t likely be determined on these grounds, but these cases demonstrate just how much self-inflicted harm Trump has done with decisions like these.
        
          The federal executive bureaucracy is by nature a lumbering beast. But under pressure from Trump s itchy Twitter finger to produce swift results, the administration s agencies are producing flimsy administrative records that fail to pass muster in federal court. As a result, the Trump era has seen a significant uptick in successful Administrative Procedure Act claims levied against the government on key policy matters. These cases evidence a deeply flawed executive process, filtering down from the president and the White House to the federal agencies, which Trump oversees.
        
          The Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law, serves as a guardrail against executive branch abuses. For example, a federal court recently struck down as  arbitrary and capricious  a Trump administration policy effectively barring immigrants from seeking asylum in the United States based on fear of domestic abuse. This case was just one of many.
        
          Administrative policymaking relies on the steady accretion of evidence to bolster the legal case for policy action, or inaction. This reality has often stymied federal agencies in the Trump era. Environmental groups, in particular, have won a slew of victories against the administration. The Trump administration has reversed, or attempted to reverse, at least 78 environmental rules over the past two years an unprecedented number. In their haste, agencies have made serious errors, prompting several court victories in cases against the administration. These include a judicial decision blocking the Bureau of Land Management s attempt to delay a rule requiring oil and gas companies to limit methane leaks when drilling on federal lands. In that case, the judge upbraided the agency, finding that the decision reflected a  lack of a reasoned analysis  and failed to comport with mandatory public notice and comment requirements. The D.C. Circuit also admonished the Environmental Protection Agency for trying to delay a rule improving safety at facilities using hazardous chemicals, finding that the agency made a  mockery  of federal law and vacating the delay as  arbitrary and capricious.  And another federal judge held that the environmental agency had illegally delayed a rule regulating the certification and training of pesticide applicators.
        
          In several cases, judges have rebuked Trump s agencies for failing to show good evidence to support their actions. Many of the administration s policies remain ensnared in litigation. A recent congressionally mandated report confirming the immense, intensifying impacts of climate change on human health and the economy is likely to present an additional hurdle for Trump s agencies  efforts to roll back pollution standards. The report puts in stark relief the gulf between the administration s efforts to eliminate certain environmental rules and the strong, countervailing scientific evidence refuting those goals.
        
          The violations of administrative requirements have also extended to other arenas. For example, a federal judge, relying on the Administrative Procedure Act, blocked an attempt by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, helmed by Ben Carson, to postpone a rule giving low-income families better access to housing in wealthier neighborhoods. The agency later reinstated the rule.
        
          While Trump isn t solely to blame for all of these failures, agency heads appear anxious to appease the president by touting fast-moving policy actions. Last year, the EPA, under then-Administrator Scott Pruitt, produced a report boasting about the agency s rapid regulatory rollbacks, even as the agency s actions faced serious challenges in court. Even as Pruitt remained mired in ethics scandals, Trump stood by his side for months, citing this regulatory slashing efficacy (Pruitt was ultimately forced to resign, but it took a comical number of bad headlines to get him to quit). Other agencies have engaged in similar communications exercises, in service of the president s agenda. The president himself likes to count the number of regulatory rollbacks initiated by his administration, sometimes falsely inflating the figures.
        
          As agency heads find themselves in the line of fire, they will continue to be forced to choose between placating their mercurial boss and complying with federal law. Both options are a losing game.

          Let s stipulate that there actually has recently been a dramatic and threatening increase, as Donald Trump claims, in the number of gang members, terrorists, and drug smugglers passing undetected across the U.S.-Mexico border in unprotected parts of the desert. There hasn t been, but let s be generous stipulators. Then let s take a step back to ask: Even if everything Trump says about this  invasion -level influx of criminals is true, could there be any slower and less urgent response to it than approving partial funding to eventually erect a 700-to-900 mile wall that will have to be built, after a complicated process of land acquisition, through remote wilderness?

          The expectation coming into President Trump s primetime address Tuesday night was that Trump would use the nationally televised moment to try to make a case that building a wall was some sort of an emergency, something urgent, something that required the nation s attention not just anytime but right now. Despite his penchant for fiery unsubstantiated rhetoric to make his point, from the Oval Office Trump flatly offered up little more than reheated immigration talking points that slowly got around to the idea that a wall would be a good idea. The lines haven t really changed since the campaign, which was now two-plus years ago, and for a president who is trying to stoke a sense of an emergency offering up nothing new from last week, or last month, or even last year, doesn t provide much of a rationale for dropping everything to fix a thing that hasn t changed all that much. The wall, whatever it might look like, came off as a priority for a frustrated president, not an emergency.
        
          What was tactically noticeable about Trump s speech and the buildup is the slow-motion humanitarian pivot he s trying to pull off, as if he could possibly win over middle-of-the-roaders who are appalled by the detention of children and the callous treatment of migrants and refugees on the border in Americans  name. Here are consecutive lines in the speech that exemplify the discordant tone:
        
          What?  A crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul?  The president is concerned about the migrant women and children? The humanitarian pump fake surely isn t fooling anyone that doesn t want to be fooled at this point. It also undermines the emergency powers argument. The biggest tragedy is the plight of migrant women and children, so you want to build a wall right this minute to make sure they re safe? That s obviously not what Trump intends. But it s important to remember, the wall is why we re here at the moment without a functioning government. The wall that is supposedly not simply a policy priority, but a full blown national security emergency.
        
          The burden was on Trump to make that case, and he didn t really come close. At one point, Trump waxed hypothetical.  Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes?  Trump asked.  They don t build walls because they hate the people on the outside but because they love the people on the inside.  I mean, sure. The entirety of Trump s speech was a reminder that he s not very good at making the case for something or explaining anything, his only effective rhetorical and political tool is scaring the bejesus out of people. If he s not trying to terrify you, it s probably not working.
        
          Trump made a pass at terror by going on to link undocumented immigrants to crime and violence and drugs and other things that are bad. It s a tactic that gets his most ardent supporters frothing at the mouth, but it s a one-trick pony with diminishing returns. Trying to link the wall to heroin shows how thin the  argument for the wall is. The president, from the Oval Office, added the requisite gore to sad stories plucked from obscurity, using lines like:  the life of an American hero was stolen ;  savagely murdered in cold blood ;  raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer ; and  killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor.   How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?  Trump darkly pondered.
        
          It was a speech so unpersuasive and likely self-defeating that it didn t need much of a response, but Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered one up anyway. Standing awkwardly close on a single podium that smacked of a Saturday Night Live skit, neither Democrat was able to emphatically dunk on Trump s nonsense. Pelosi dutifully said the wall was dumb and Trump in the wrong for the real world consequences of shutting down the government.  The fact is, we all agree we need to secure or borders while honoring our values,  Pelosi said.  The fact is, the women and children at the border are not a security threat. They are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump s own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened.   This president just used the backdrop of the oval office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration,  Sen. Schumer said in closing.  The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a 30-foot wall.

          That left the majority of the comedy to, of all people, President Trump himself, who made some of those very rambling, incoherent remarks last week while discussing a meeting with generals at the Pentagon.  They were better looking than Tom Cruise and stronger,  he noted, adding that the room was the greatest he d ever seen and that he saw  more computer boards than I think they make today.  A few Late Night audience members couldn t contain their laughter.
        
           Why does he always sound like a coworker telling you about a dream he had?  wondered Meyers.
        
          Meyers then went on to call out major networks for giving the president a platform for his primetime address.  First of all, just because Trump wants to address the nation doesn t mean networks should air it,  Meyers said.  Otherwise, they re just passing on his lies unfiltered. They should either reject him outright, or if he insists on speaking in primetime, make him do it as a contestant on The Masked Singer. 
        
          If major networks were to refuse to pause their regularly scheduled programming for Trump s primetime address, it would not be unprecedented. In November 2014, ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox chose not to air President Obama s immigration address, instead sticking with their regularly scheduled episodes of Grey s Anatomy, The Big Bang Theory, The Biggest Loser: Glory Days, and Bones, respectively. But all of the major networks are expected to air Tuesday s address live.

          On Tuesday, Donald Trump will step in front of the camera to do what he has often done on television: lie. This time, though, he will not do so as part of a reality show or an informal back-and-forth with the press. He will instead use a nationwide prime-time address, usually reserved for wartime, a real national calamity, or a historic occasion, to scare the American public into believing in an imaginary emergency on the southern border.
        
          First and foremost, Trump will do so to try to untangle the government shutdown, a crisis of his own making that has begun to disrupt the lives of a growing number of Americans. He will lie about the responsibility of the Democratic congressional leadership in the current predicament. He will fail to admit that the burden of the impasse lies wholly on his shoulders because of his fixation with building a border wall. In doing so, Trump will disrespect the time and attention of the millions watching across the country simply to score political points.
        
          The president will then proceed to tell a story about immigration in America. The speech, a carefully designed piece of propaganda and fearmongering, will paint a fallacious picture of a nation under threat. Trump will speak of Central American refugees who escaped poverty and unimaginable hardship as if they were barbarians storming the country s gates. He will refer sloppily to gangs, terrorists, and shady foreigners. The threat, he will insist, has become so grave that he was left with no choice but to send thousands of U.S. troops to the border. He will praise America s immigration-enforcement agencies as heroes in a war and stress the urgent need for a physical barrier between the United States and Mexico. Trump may then, reporting suggests, declare a formal national emergency. The situation has left him no other alternative, he ll say.
        
          He will be lying.
        
          The southern border is not being overrun by undocumented immigration. Arrests at the border have dropped to numbers not seen since the early 1970s. Immigration from Mexico, in particular, has fallen to historically low levels. The number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States has been declining steadily since at least 2007. Over the past 10 years, undocumented immigration has increasingly taken the form of visa overstays rather than unlawful border crossings. Immigrants are also putting down stronger, deeper roots in America. Almost 7 out of every 10 immigrants in the United States have been living here for over a decade, building peaceful and hardworking lives that affirm the American ideal and contradict Trump s nativist demagoguery. When uprooted, their stories of deportation are harrowing.
        
          Contrary to what Trump will likely say on Tuesday, the vast majority of those detained at the country s southwest borders are not potential terrorists, drug dealers, or mobsters, but unauthorized immigrants, petty thieves, or drunk drivers, hardly deserving of a national emergency worth billions of dollars. There are not many gang members either. In 2018, Border Patrol agents identified 728 immigrants with possible gang affiliations, not insignificant but a number far less alarming than the supposed savage multitude Trump will lie about tonight. Contrary to the administration s wild claims, border agents caught only a handful of immigrants classified in the terrorist database in the first half of fiscal year 2018, not the thousands the administration insists are threatening the country and crossing the border. And what about drugs? By the DEA s own account, the solution to drug trafficking lies in more sophisticated and effective inspections across the border s points of entry, not in the costly and unproductive erection of a wall.
        
          The president, of course, could instead choose to level with the American people and describe the real challenges ahead for the country on issues like border security and immigration. He could say he will focus on less flamboyant but more sensible goals, like improving the border s formal entry points, strengthening programs like E-Verify, or curbing visa abuse. He could also be frank about the real humanitarian crisis in the region and what America can do to help, an emergency happening more than 2,000 miles south of the border with Mexico, deep inside Central America. Trump could, for example, explain how the United States needs to embark in an ambitious nation-building project, not unlike the Marshall Plan, to rescue Central America s Northern Triangle of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, where the vast majority of current emigration toward the United States originates. He could announce his intention to join the ambitious blueprint already laid out by the government of Mexico, which will invest over $30 billion over the next half-decade to improve conditions throughout the region.
        
          Donald Trump could do all this, but he won t. Instead, the president of the United States will barge into the country s living rooms to wage an asymmetric political battle, unspool another chapter of his pernicious nativist narrative, and flat-out lie. Here s hoping enough of those watching can see the stunt for what it truly is.

          Taken at face value, rhetoric from the White House and the Department of Homeland Security would lead Americans to believe that the United States is facing a terrorism crisis at our southern border. The picture being painted is one in which thousands of terrorists have been stopped from crossing the border to infiltrate the homeland. If that were true, that would indeed be a crisis.
        
          In reality, no such crisis exists.
        
          Federal courthouses and prisons are not filled with terrorists we ve captured at the border. There is no wave of terrorist operatives waiting to cross overland into the United States. It simply isn t true. Anyone in authority using this argument to bolster support for building the wall or any other physical barrier along the southern border is most likely guilty of fearmongering and willfully misleading the American people.
        
          Why do I know this? As director of the National Counterterrorism Center from December 2014 through December 2017, it was my job to lead the government s efforts to collect and analyze all available information about terrorist threats to the homeland. It was my responsibility on behalf of the intelligence community to synthesize and present that terrorism picture to our most senior decision makers up to and including the president of the United States so that sound decisions could be made about how to protect the homeland from terrorist attacks.
        
          Here is the ground truth on this issue. Terrorist groups like al-Qaida and ISIS spend time talking about, brainstorming, and even fantasizing about ways in which they can do harm to the United States. At times, those conversations have certainly included discussions of ways in which terrorist operatives might be inserted into the United States. But we also knew from intelligence reporting that terrorist groups have a very high regard for our Homeland Security capabilities, including our border security. They know we have become a much  harder  target than at the time of 9/11 and that getting their operatives into the United States is an extremely challenging proposition.
        
          In part, that s why terrorist groups pivoted in recent years to a different business model. Rather than focusing on trying to insert a terrorist operative from abroad, it has proven to be far easier for an organization like ISIS or al-Qaida to inspire or motivate an individual already inside the United States to act on their behalf. That change has left us with the threat condition that prevails today, in which the greatest terrorism threat we face is from what we call Homegrown Violent Extremists in most cases individuals who were either born here or have lived here for most of their adult lives.
        
          The most recent public testimony of our intelligence community professionals including the acting director of the NCTC and the FBI director makes that focus on homegrown extremists abundantly clear. What s more, recent testimony by these officials has not highlighted serious terrorism-related concerns about the southern border. It remains a theoretical vulnerability, but not one that terrorists have been able to exploit.
        
          So, what to make of these thousands of so-called terrorists prevented from entering the country across our southern border? Where do these numbers come from? What seems true is that our system of terrorist watchlisting is in fact working. Though the DHS has not provided data to support its claims, I suspect that on many occasions in recent years, perhaps adding up to thousands, individuals who live abroad and want to travel to the United States have been denied the opportunity to do so because of a concern about a potential nexus to terrorism. Such an individual would have their visa or Electronic System for Travel Authorization application denied and no travel would occur. In other cases, so-called Special Interest Aliens from countries of terrorism concern have likely been stopped at the border.
        
          But each of those visa denials or SIA encounters hardly equates to disruption of a terrorist plot or the  capture  of a known terrorist. Our watchlisting system is predicated on a carefully calibrated risk management approach. When the intelligence community acquires information that points to a potential link to terrorist activity, individuals are not permitted to travel to the United States. But it should not be assumed that every individual who was denied the opportunity to enter the U.S. was in fact a would-be terrorist intent on doing us harm. We are certainly not facing a  crisis  of thousands of terrorists trying to cross our southern border.
        
          For those not willing to take my word or others for it, there is a better indicator that the administration s arguments about a large-scale terrorist infiltration across the border are specious. If that proposition were true, there would certainly be current intelligence assessments laying out the details of this threat, even citing specific cases of imprisoned terrorists who had made their way through the criminal justice system. And if the administration wished to provide support for its claims, I suspect it would have worked to declassify for public consumption relevant portions of those classified assessments or, at the very least, highlighted past prosecutions using publicly available court documents. To my knowledge, no such effort is underway. That s because the intelligence community is almost certainly not able to stand publicly behind what the White House and the DHS are saying.
        
          If the administration and indeed Congress were in fact looking for ways to make the American people safer from terrorist attacks, there are things that should be done, apart from building walls. Indeed, for every dollar spent on a $5 billion southern border wall, American public safety could benefit exponentially more from spending it on counterterrorism elsewhere.
        
          First and foremost, we could expand our investment in prevention programs aimed at countering violent extremism here in the U.S. This prevention work involves intensive engagement with communities at the state and local level, and it is difficult, often frustrating work. Success or failure is hard to measure, and it has proven challenging to build trust between the government and communities where extremism can take root. But walking away from these programs, as the current administration has done, is hardly a recipe for success in countering extremism here in the United States. Even relatively modest sums would have significant impact in this area. We are talking millions, not billions.
        
          Secondly, the government could accelerate investments aimed at modernizing our watchlisting systems. In the period since 9/11, much has been accomplished in this area, and we are probably better than any nation in the world when it comes to identifying bad actors and keeping them from entering our country. But there is much more to be done in terms of using modern information technology to enhance our risk management approach, including stepped-up collection and analysis of biometric information. Dollars spent in support of these objectives would do far more to keep us safe than dollars spent on physical barriers.
        
          Lastly, the government can and should increase programming and resources aimed at dealing with purely domestic terrorism, which seems to be of growing concern. To its credit, the administration gave attention to this issue in its recently published counterterrorism strategy. But it remains to be seen if dollars and programs will follow from that strategy document.
        
          To be sure, there are terrorists located abroad who are intent on trying to enter the United States. But the number almost certainly isn t in the thousands, as has been claimed or implied by the administration. Making such fantastic and unsupportable claims only undermines public trust and confidence in our watchlisting system and in our counterterrorism community. In other words, the rhetorical exaggerations themselves undercut our national security. Most importantly, responding to the challenge posed by terrorist travel is well within our capabilities as a nation wall or no wall. The intelligence and law enforcement professionals charged with preventing terrorists from entering the United States are highly capable, extremely dedicated, and equipped with a wide range of tools and capabilities to keep us safe. They deserve our trust and confidence. The political manipulation of real facts does both these professionals and the American public a deep disservice.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/trump-declaring-national-emergency-fund-wall.html,"
          A version of this piece first appeared on the blog Balkinization.
        
          President Donald Trump said on Friday that he was considering declaring a national emergency to build a wall on the southern border, despite congressional refusal to fund such a wall. On Sunday, the White House chief of staff confirmed the story, telling CNN s Jake Tapper that the administration is well along in the planning stages of using presidential emergency powers to accomplish what Congress will not allow. Trump is giving a national address on Tuesday to promote the wall with his national emergency proposal looming in the background. By late Monday evening, his aides seemed to be preparing the ground for an emergency proclamation.
        
          Some critics, including my colleague Bruce Ackerman, have leapt too quickly to the conclusion that such a move would be lawless and might even subject wall builders to criminal prosecution. Others have claimed that it would be tantamount to tyrannical rule by decree and cited the Supreme Court s 1952 decision reversing Harry Truman s unilateral wartime takeover of the steel industry.
        
          The truth is that the White House s emergency gambit reveals the full extent to which Congress has already delegated emergency powers to the executive branch of the federal government. Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center has collected a daunting list of statutes authorizing emergency powers, which is super helpful on this point. (Goitein summarizes the statutes in a recent article at the Atlantic.) The upshot? Declaring a national emergency to build the president s ridiculous wall would be a national embarrassment. It ought to be unlawful too. But whether declaring a national emergency to build a wall actually is unlawful under current circumstances turns out to be a much closer question than it should be. The key statutory provisions are 10 U.S.C. 2808 (authorizing emergency reallocation of certain military construction funds) and 33 U.S.C. 2293 (authorizing emergency reallocation of certain civil works project funds).
        
          I ll leave the analysis of these heretofore obscure statutes to others. But as it happens, I have a book out this spring from Yale University Press on a theory of emergency power, based on a lost manuscript by political theorist, jurist, and Lincoln administration insider Francis Lieber. Historian Will Smiley and I found the manuscript in the National Archives and Yale University Press is publishing an annotated edition of it, along with a long introduction by Will and me. Not surprisingly, I think a bit of history from what is still the U.S. s biggest constitutional emergency may help us see what has happened.
        
          For a century and a half, the American Civil War has been a key case study for students of emergencies in constitutional democracies. As president, Abraham Lincoln exercised broad emergency powers. He marshaled troops to the Capitol. He suspended the writ of habeas corpus, something the Constitution seems to vest in Congress in cases of rebellion and invasion. And on Jan. 1, 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing slaves in the rebellious states on the basis of military necessity.
        
          Lincoln defended each of these acts as part of his constitutionally authorized emergency powers. But as Lieber the leading jurist of the law of the Civil War observed at the time, Civil War emergency powers did not give Lincoln unconstrained authority. Lieber was a fierce defender of Lincoln s constitutional prerogatives. He believed deeply in a president s inherent constitutional authority to do what is necessary to rescue the republic. But he also believed just as fiercely that the executive s authority had limits. As Lieber saw it, a president s claims of emergency had to be tested against the necessity of the moment. The law only extended emergency powers to the executive branch when an emergency actually warranted those powers. Lieber believed deeply that the courts stood ready to review proclamations of emergency power and limit the president s overreaching.
        
          Today, this seems like a thin reed on which to rest the legal constraints against presidential tyranny. Will the courts really be willing and able to second-guess executive branch determinations of whether an emergency exists? Such a belief was not at all implausible in Lincoln and Lieber s time. The executive branch was tiny; Lieber was called in because the War Department had only one principal lawyer. Moreover, the Supreme Court during the Civil War engaged in close review of the Lincoln White House s decisions.
        
          In privateering and blockade-runner cases involving the seizure of neutral and Confederate vessels, for example, the court did not defer to the executive s views. Even when the court ruled in favor of the administration, as it did in the pivotal 1863 Prize Cases, the court did not do so out of deference. Indeed, in dozens of admiralty cases during the war, the federal courts performed their own evaluations of the facts and the law.
        
          Judicial review existed for military action on land too. Union officers faced the very real prospect of damages suits in the courts, where unwarranted destruction or taking subjected them to personal liability for the injuries they caused. And directly after the war, in Ex Parte Milligan, the Supreme Court reversed a conviction obtained by the Lincoln administration s wartime military commissions. Lieber disagreed with the decision in Milligan because he believed that the beginning of white violence against the Reconstruction governments necessitated continuing federal military tribunals in the South. But he agreed that the court had the authority to closely review the executive branch.
        
          In the intervening century and a half, however, the culture of close judicial review of executive action in wartime has diminished. For one thing, the vast growth in the executive branch has led the president s resources to dwarf those of the courts. Forms of serious judicial review of executive branch assertions persist, to be sure, even in national security matters. Witness Hamdan v. Rumsfeld and the post-9/11 sequence of cases. But the world of tort suits and damages actions against federal officials and military officers is now a thing of the past. The institutional context now creates far more deference than ever existed in Lieber s day.
        
          The Trump threat may produce a re-evaluation of this judicial deference to executive determinations. As Jennifer Rubin, Preet Bharara, and others have pointed out, there is simply no national emergency warranting the use of emergency powers. Apprehensions of people entering at the border are down by more than 1.5 million per year as compared with almost 20 years ago. Terrorist apprehensions take place almost entirely at airports and sometimes on the Canadian border. And there is no time pressure other than the government shutdown itself, which in turn is simply the result of the president s inability to get Congress to agree with his proposal.
        
          It appears that the federal courts may be the institution that will have to tell it like it is. The National Emergencies Act of 1976 created an elaborate system intended to allow the two houses of Congress to check presidential emergency proclamations. But that system has been a dead letter ever since the Supreme Court ruled a similar legislative veto unconstitutional in INS v. Chadha, decided in 1983.
        
          The Civil War s robust model of emergency powers mobilized the force of the federal government when the country confronted the gravest emergency in American history. To allow those powers to govern this juncture would be to skip past tragedy to farce. The courts played a big role 150 years ago. If called upon, let s hope they do so again.

          On Monday, President Trump announced the latest phase of the government shutdown over funding a wall on the border the presidential Oval Office address.
        
          The primetime speech, which all of the major networks and cable stations have credulously agreed to cover, is the latest attempt by Trump to gin up a crisis on the southern border that the American people increasingly aren t buying. Trump aides have reportedly told the president that the calls for a wall or slats or whatever, haven t moved the needle on the contrived standoff that is the three-week long government shutdown. So expect a shift into rhetorical overdrive on the *crisis* on the border that only an emergency wall that will take years to construct can solve.
        
          With the White House losing momentum on the arbitrary timing of the arbitrary wall backed by arbitrary levels of funding, Trump needed to make a move to make his big idea seem, well, less arbitrary and more like a crisis. Hence, you have White House surrogates disingenuously talking terrorism again on news talk shows and the president of the United States casually suggesting he might go full dictator and use executive emergency powers to push through what he has been unable to do through the normal channels of governance. Make no mistake, Trump has been unable to actualize his wall policy during two full years with Republican control over both houses of congress because he is monumentally bad at his job and building a wall is not only asinine, it is definitionally not a crisis, let alone an emergency.
        
          Since there s no actual crisis, Trump is here to create one. Again. Otherwise, he wouldn t have anything to do. The White House says Trump will then head to the border (again) on Thursday to take a tour of some sort. Remember when Trump sent troops to the border right before the midterm election? To steel the nation against the threat of desperate migrants walking north more than a thousand miles away?
        
          The crisis is not on the border, it s in the Oval Office.

          President Donald Trump s obsession with a border wall with Mexico has now kept the government partially shut for three weeks. But the commander in chief didn t always think it was such an essential idea. In fact, it started out as a gimmick, or, as the New York Times calls it,  a mnemonic device of sorts.  During the time when Trump was weighing his presidential candidacy, aides wanted to come up with a way to help him remember to talk about getting tough on immigration, which was always seen as a key issue in his campaign.
        
          Political advisers Sam Nunberg and Roger Stone apparently came up with the idea.  How do we get him to continue to talk about immigration?  Nunberg claims he told Stone.  We re going to get him to talk about he s going to build a wall.  The plan worked like a charm. Trump talked about immigration in his speeches, and the wall narrative got huge reactions from the crowd, which obviously thrilled Trump. So he kept pushing the idea harder and harder.
        
          The laser focus on the wall, though, makes even some immigration hardliners nervous, because most don t actually see it as the most important priority. And some who agree with Trump that immigration needs to be curbed worry that he ll be willing to trade away things that are far more important in order to get his wall.  I ve always thought it created a danger that he would trade almost anything in order to get the wall,  said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies.  I m still worried about that now. 
        
          Michael D Antonio, a Trump biographer, says the wall is naturally appealing to Trump because of his background in real estate and the idea that he d leave behind a legacy.  I think he d like it being called the Great Wall of Trump,  D Antonio said, noting he d probably like it even more if there was a plaque honoring the president who built it  every mile or so. 
        
          For now, it seems the wall remains an impasse, and negotiations to reopen the government aren t really getting anywhere.  We didn t make much progress at the meeting, which was surprising to me,  acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Saturday. In a meeting that included Vice President Mike Pence, the administration continued pushing for cash to build the wall. Negotiations are set to continue Sunday. Trump wrote on Twitter that  not much headway made today  before continuing with his message:  After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!

          Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told a bunch of reporters Friday afternoon after a White House meeting that President Donald Trump is willing to keep (some of) the government shut down for  years  if Democrats in the Senate don t agree to provide funding for his partial border wall/steel slat thing:
        
          Incredible! POTUS confirmed Schumer s account at a subsequent and characteristically honesty-free/insane Rose Garden press conference. Here he is, for example, making an illuminating point about how apparently there aren t  Welcome to America  signs along the entire 1,850-mile U.S.ñMexico border:
        
          Pelosi and Schumer and the other high-level government officials at the meeting no doubt enjoyed  learning  this surprising fact.

          What???? Epic. Also, you can definitely, definitely not apply for citizenship right after crossing the border; you have to already be a legal permanent resident of the U.S.
        
          In any case, despite a few Republican senators having publicly speculated about the possibility of making some sort of deal to end the shutdown, it seems like the Republican caucus is still standing behind Trump s position that it s the border wall or nothing. (It will take 60 votes to pass a bill through the Senate ending the shutdown; there are only 47 Democrats in the chamber, and in any case, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would have to bring the bill up for a vote in the first place.)

          President Donald Trump is getting impatient with the partial government shutdown he created, and now is threatening to shut down the entire U.S-Mexico border if Democrats don t give in to his demands to fund the wall.  We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,  the president tweeted at the beginning of the seventh day of the partial government shutdown.
        
          He then went on to write a series of tweets in which he said that closing the border would be a  profit making operation  because the  United States loses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA.  For Trump, there are two options:  Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border. 
        
          The president also went on to threaten to slash aid to Central American countries.  Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money. Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!  he wrote.
        
          The words mark an escalation for the president who had previously said that if Democrats refused to build the wall then the government would remain partially shut.  I can t tell you when the government s going to be open,  Trump told reporters on Tuesday.  I can tell you it s not going to be open until we have a wall or fence, whatever they d like to call it.  This, however, was not the first time the president has threatened to close the southern border entirely.
        
          Even though the president seems to be doing his best to try to get Americans to blame Democrats for the partial government shutdown, it seems most aren t buying it. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday found that 47 percent of Americans blame Trump for the shutdown, compared to 33 percent who say Democrats are to blame.

          President Donald Trump had an uplifting message of hope for Americans on Christmas Day, making it clear he is not willing to compromise in order to get the government fully working again.  I can t tell you when the government is going to be open. I can tell you it s not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they would like to call it,  Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after he made a traditional Christmas Day phone call with service members. Trump once again repeated what has become a favorite talking point of his, implying Democrats oppose the wall because of how that word sounds.  I ll call it whatever they want, but it s all the same thing,  he said.
        
          Trump insisted the wall was needed to stop drugs from flowing into the country and end human trafficking.  We can t do it without a barrier. We can t do it without a wall,  he said.  The only way you re going to do it is to have a physical barrier, meaning a wall. And if you don t have that then we re just not opening  the government. Trump also repeated a claim made on Christmas Eve that he had approved  a 115-mile-long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas.  Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security expanded on what exactly the president was talking about, but the president repeated the claim Tuesday.  It s going to be built, hopefully rapidly,  he said.  I m going there at the end of January for the start of construction. That s a big stretch. 
        
          Trump claims federal workers affected by the shutdown agree with him that he should keep the government closed until Democrats agree to fund the wall.  Many of those workers have said to me and communicated, stay out until you get the funding for the wall,  Trump said.  These federal workers want the wall. The only one that doesn t want the wall are the Democrats, because they don t mind open borders, but open borders mean massive amounts of crime. 
        
          At one point in his chat with reporters, Trump strangely veered into talking about fired FBI Director James Comey as a way of illustrating his talking point describing Democrats as hypocrites.  Everybody hated Comey, they thought he did a horrible job. The Democrats hated him. They were calling for his resignation. They were calling for his firing,  Trump said.  Once I fired him, everybody said,  Oh, why did you fire him, why did you fire him?

          President Donald Trump wants to bring American troops home from Syria and Afghanistan. But Trump doesn t want to look weak. To keep up his tough-guy act and satisfy his base, he wants to deploy troops on our southern border, where he claims they ll stop terrorists, deter illegal immigrants, and help build a wall. Trump thinks he can shift American militarism from the Muslim world to Mexico without paying a political price. But a fellow Republican, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, is trying to wreck Trump s plan. Graham, who supports the border wall, is using that issue to pummel the president for pulling out of Syria and Afghanistan.
        
          Trump says ISIS is finished.  We have defeated ISIS in Syria,  he tweeted on Wednesday. It s time to leave Syria to Russia and Iran, the president argues, and defend our own borders for a change.  Our great Military  is doing a  great job   on our Southern Border,  Trump declared on Thursday. Now the president has another mission in mind:  Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall! 
        
          Trump wants Americans to think of the southern border as a war zone, with  thousands of innocent lives  lost every year to  criminal organizations  and  massive drug inflow.  The real terror threat, he falsely asserted in a speech on Thursday at the White House, isn t in the Middle East; it s at home, where  every day, 10 known or suspected terrorists try to gain entry into our country.  Democrats who oppose a border wall are weakening America in the face of this enemy, said the president:  The Democrats continue to oppose border security, no matter how many innocent people get hurt or die. 
        
          Politically, this is an ambitious scheme. Trump is trying to frame a budget fight over a wall a wall between the United States and a friendly country as our most important national security issue. Important enough, in his view, to shut down the government if Congress won t pay for the wall.  Any measure that funds the government must include border security,  the president demanded on Thursday,  for the safety of our community. 
        
          That argument is a tough sell. Trump is wrong on the facts: Undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. He s also on the wrong side of polls: Most Americans don t want a wall and don t think it s worth shutting down the government. But the president s biggest problem is that the places from which he s withdrawing troops the Middle East and southwest Asia pose a far bigger terror threat than does any country south of our border. And Graham has decided to drive that point home at Trump s expense.
        
          In speeches, press conferences, TV interviews, and tweets, Graham is accusing the president of ignoring his military commanders and national security officials. Graham calls the Syria pullout a  big win  for Russia  They are ECSTATIC,  he tweeted on Thursday and a  sign of American weakness  to Iran and North Korea. At a press conference that day, Graham charged that the pullout was  akin to surrendering. 
        
          Trump isn t just fleeing the battlefield, according to Graham. He s endangering the United States. The Afghan branch of ISIS poses  a direct threat to our homeland,  has  the United States in their target sets,  and  is plotting to hit America,  Graham warned the president. If Trump withdraws troops, said Graham,  We are setting in motion the loss of all our gains and paving the way toward a second 9/11. 
        
          Graham doesn t just challenge Trump s seriousness on terrorism. He takes direct aim at the president s political strategy, arguing that the pullouts make a mockery of Trump s tough talk about the border. Withdrawing from Syria is like  tearing down a wall  that s protecting us from terrorists, Graham declared Thursday on CNN. On Twitter, he roasted Trump:  Outsourcing our national security and the fight against ISIS to Russia, Iran, and Assad/Syria   will result in an Open Borders policy for ISIS. 
        
          Graham s attacks have stung Trump. On Thursday, the president tweeted back at Graham, saying it was  time to focus on our Country & bring our youth back home.  On Friday, Trump bristled at the suggestion that he was surrendering the Middle East to Russia.  There has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on China or Russia,  he tweeted.
        
          Trump has the power of the presidency in this fight, but Graham has the stronger ground politically. The senator is directly undercutting the president s attempt to change the subject from Syria and Afghanistan to Mexico. Moreover, when you pull troops out of a country full of terrorists, Americans soon forget about the bloodshed you avoided. Instead, you get blamed for the next terror attack at home. And Graham s televised warning about a second 9/11 is handy material for Democrats and journalists in the event of a major jihadi strike on the United States.
        
          Graham also has an advantage because of the way Trump has framed the fight over the border wall. Having promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, Trump now extols Mexico as a buffer and ally in blocking illegal immigration from Central America. In fact, the White House is using that relationship as a cudgel against Democrats.  It s a sad day in America when the Mexican government is doing more to protect our borders and stop the illegal flow of drugs, human trafficking, and terrorists across our borders than Senate Democrats are willing to do,  White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders sniped Friday morning on Fox and Friends.
        
          That s an invitation to turn the question back to Syria and Afghanistan. If buffers and allies are important in protecting us from nonlethal threats to the south, aren t they also important in protecting us from lethal threats to the east? Isn t the military better suited to fighting terrorists than to constructing a wall against civilians? Isn t Graham right that an abrupt withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan makes Trump s bluster about a border wall which Graham otherwise supports a joke?
        
          Graham can t stop the pullout. But politically, he can make it hurt the president. On Friday, Graham told reporters that he s calling for hearings  right now  to debunk Trump s rosy portrayal of the situation in Syria. Graham intends to summon as one of his witnesses Defense Secretary James Mattis, who announced on Thursday that he s resigning to protest the troop withdrawals. On Saturday, the New York Times reported that Brett McGurk, Trump s special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition in Syria, is also resigning in protest.  I could not carry out these new instructions and maintain my integrity,  McGurk said of the pullout order. The firefight over Syria and Afghanistan has moved inside Trump s country, inside his party, and inside his administration. There s no wall the president can hide behind.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/12/pelosi-schumer-trump-fight-oval-office-government-shutdown-wall-funding.html,"
          The Oval Office meeting late Tuesday morning between President Donald Trump and congressional Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer was supposed to begin with a brief photo opportunity and the chance for the participants to offer a bland nicety or two for the cameras. Instead, the cameras stayed for about 15 minutes as the three got into a comical argument about the topic at hand: funding for Trump s proposed border wall, the impasse at the center of an end-of-year government-funding negotiation. Though the bickering wasn t a flattering look for any of the leaders in attendance, Democrats ultimately secured the sound bite they wanted, with Trump welcoming blame for any shutdown that might come.
        
          The meeting began earnestly enough, with the president welcoming Pelosi and Schumer and sharing the news about how bipartisan criminal justice reform and farm bills would be moving through Congress soon. He first brought up the wall in joking fashion, describing it as the  easy  issue Congress still had to resolve. From there, though, he went into talking points about the necessity of the wall.
        
           The wall will get built,  Trump said,  but we may not have an agreement today. 
        
          After this monologue, he asked Pelosi if she had anything to say. She did. She observed that the American people  recognize that we must keep government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything, and that you should not have a Trump shutdown. 
        
           Did you say Trump?  Trump asked. And we were off.
        
          Pelosi and Trump got into a lengthy argument about whether a bill meeting Trump s full wall-funding request of $5 billion could pass the House. Trump said that he  would have it passed [in the House] in two seconds,  but that it wouldn t matter, since it would get filibustered in the Senate. Pelosi, who s just a little better of a vote-counter than Trump, urged him, then, to  go do it  if it really could pass the House, to at least start the discussion.
        
           You will not win,  she said.
        
          It was around here that Pelosi or  Nancy,  as the president consistently referred to the current minority leader and speaker-designate suggested for the first time that the meeting could be more productive if the press weren t there. But no way was the press going to leave the room.
        
          Then it was time for  Chuck  to speak. While the Pelosi-Trump exchanges were between two leaders with very different styles, the Schumer-Trump exchanges had the tenor of an argument about the Yankees  bullpen. Several times, when Schumer urged him not to shut down the government, Trump shot back that Schumer was blamed for the last shutdown.
        
           This spiraled downward,  Pelosi interrupted, again.
        
          The two somehow came to argue about election results. Trump bragged about how they gained seats in the Senate, to which Schumer responded that  when the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he s in real trouble. 
        
           I did,  Trump chimed in.  We did win North Dakota and Indiana. 
        
          Trump mocked Pelosi, too, saying she was in a position  where it s not easy for her to talk  as in, she has been trying to corral 218 votes for speaker and couldn t show any weakness on wall funding.
        
           Mr. President,  Pelosi said,  please don t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as a leader of the House Democrats who have just won a big victory. 
        
           Elections have consequences, Mr. President,  Schumer said.
        
           That s why the country is doing so well,  Trump added.
        
          Vice President Mike Pence sat silently in crossfire of the whole spectacle, trying to disappear into the furniture.
        
          Though Schumer and Pelosi seemed uncomfortable in the setting for much of the meeting, they were ultimately successful in getting what they wanted. When Schumer observed that the president had said 20 times that he would shut down the government if he didn t get his wall, Trump bit.
        
           You want to know something?  the president said. Schumer sure did.  I ll take it. You know what I ll say? Yes. If we don t get what we want, one way or the other, whether it s through you or through military or anything you want to call, I will shut down the government. 
        
           Fair enough,  Schumer said, toning down his enthusiasm.
        
           I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,  he continued.  Because the people of this country don t want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I m not going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down, it didn t work. I will take the mantle of shutting it down. I m going to shut it down for border security. 
        
          Schumer, somehow, resisted the urge to do a chef s kiss.
