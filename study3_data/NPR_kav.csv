NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/11/656624663/mcconnell-warns-of-scary-prospect-if-gop-loses-senate-control-in-midterms,"Updated at 8:52 p.m. ETSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has a message for Republican voters who are celebrating the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh: Get to the polls in November if you want more conservatives sitting on judicial benches. Lose the Senate, and the project of confirming judges is over for the last two years of President Trump,  McConnell said in an interview with NPR in his Capitol Hill office.  That, I think, is a scary prospect to the people who like what we ve been doing on the judge project and I hope will help us hold on to our majority. McConnell said the raucous, sometimes aggressive fight over Kavanaugh s nomination came at a perfect time for Republicans. Polls showed GOP voter enthusiasm slumping over the summer as energy for Democrats spiked.All that turned around when Republicans grew frustrated with the protracted battle over Kavanaugh. The Kentucky Republican said it awakened them to the Supreme Court cause   an issue that inspired many of the same voters to back Trump in 2016. As of the last week or so the hottest issue in our races has [been the] Kavanaugh nomination,  McConnell said, even outpacing tax reform, which the top Senate leader listed as a major legislative accomplishment.  We knew the Democrats were fired up. They have been all year. No question about that.  But what we are now seeing is that the enthusiasm and energy on the Republican side comes close to matching the Democratic side, and given the states that we re competing in, that s really good news for us,  he said.McConnell also called activists opposing Kavanaugh a  mob  and criticized Democrats for encouraging their actions. He said Republicans were inundated with protesters in recent weeks and had their lives disrupted. We were literally under assault ourselves,  McConnell said.  Trailing members for their homes; getting in their faces here in the Capitol. An effort clearly to try and intimidate us. And one of the reasons I was so proud of the result last Saturday on Judge Kavanaugh is that we stood up for two things. We stood up to the mob and we also stood up for the presumption of innocence in this country. He also rejected any comparison between those protesters and the conservative Tea Party activists who protested the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act or the raucous crowds that chant  lock her up  and jeer at reporters at many of Trump s own campaign rallies.Democrats say the Kavanaugh fight was equally energizing for their voters and for women in particular. At the same time, Republicans are losing support among women in addition to already low numbers among Hispanic and African-American voters.All problems McConnell admits. We ve always had something of a gender gap,  McConnell said.  It s never been as wide as it is now. He said he hopes electing qualified women to the Senate, like Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee and Martha McSally in Arizona, will help close that divide. He also pointed to Hispanic Republicans like Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as evidence of diversity within the GOP ranks, but he noted that attracting black voters has been a bigger challenge. I think we can improve our position with women voters and with Hispanic voters for sure,  he said.  With African-Americans, we haven t been able to make much headway. He did point to Sen. Tim Scott, the first African-American senator elected in South Carolina, as a  noteworthy  addition to the GOP conference. He s arguably the most popular politician in South Carolina,  McConnell said.  So there is hope with African-American voters as well. But I m more optimistic about closing the gender gap and by improving our position with Hispanics. Several key issues Republicans once touted as the central themes for the midterm elections have faded in recent weeks. McConnell says tax reform remains one of his top accomplishments, despite the fact that it is playing a smaller role in campaigns this year and has been eclipsed by the Supreme Court debate.The GOP message on health care has also shifted. Gone are the days of candidates vowing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Now Republicans are actively embracing protections for people with pre-existing conditions   a central tenet of the law they all opposed.McConnell said many Republicans are explicitly vowing to keep those protections, even as two GOP Senate candidates, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, are suing to weaken consumer protection provisions in the health care law. Every one of our candidates have been able to respond to it by saying that they are in favor of making sure that people with pre-existing conditions are covered,  McConnell said.  You can favor the lawsuit and still be in favor of maintaining coverage or adjusting conditions. McConnell sidestepped whether Republicans would take another run at rolling back Obamacare next year after failing to get the votes for their scaled-down repeal legislation. He called that failed effort  the single biggest disappointment this Congress and really the only major disappointment  after moving bills through  on so many different fronts. The top Senate Republican distanced himself from the unusual public criticism that Trump leveled at the Federal Reserve Bank s economic policies. Trump said the Fed had  gone crazy  for raising interest rates.McConnell instead said of his own posture on monetary policy,  I generally avoid commenting on the market. It goes up and it goes down. Or giving the Fed advice. "
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/11/656293787/-himtoo-left-and-right-embrace-opposing-takes-on-same-hashtag,"In the aftermath of the Kavanaugh hearings, Pieter Hanson s mother took to Twitter. In a viral tweet, she claimed that he wouldn t go on solo dates with women because of  the current climate of false sexual accusations by radical feminists with an axe to grind.  She then ended the tweet with #HimToo, a hashtag that gained popularity over the weekend among those who believe that men such as Brett Kavanaugh are victims of false accusations.There was just one issue: Her son didn t agree with the #HimToo movement. The Internet exploded with support for Hanson after he rebuked his mother s tweet in a post of his own. In the countertweet, he wrote,  I respect and #BelieveWomen  and added that his mother had been misguided.The hashtag #HimToo also exploded, on both the left and the right sides of the political Twittersphere. Now, both sides are battling to control the narrative surrounding sexual abuse allegations using the same hashtag. #HimToo is just the latest trend in the social media political battle, but it illustrates how the meaning of a single hashtag can be twisted to control the narrative. The history of #HimTooLong before Pieter Hanson charmed the Internet, #HimToo had a rich history of use along both party lines. It was first used before the 2016 presidential election in conjunction with the #I mWithHer rallying cry of Clinton supporters to also express support for Clinton s running mate, Tim Kaine. Then, #HimToo was picked up by Trump supporters. Along with cries of #LockHerUp came #HimToo in reference to those surrounding Hillary Clinton, such as Barack Obama.#MeToo and #HimTooHowever, when the #MeToo movement started last year, #HimToo took on a new meaning, relating not just to politics but to sexual assault experiences as well. Some used the hashtag as a way to deliberately point out male victims of sexual assault and abuse or share their stories.Other #MeToo activists used the hashtag as a way to point out bad behaviors of men and hold them accountable. Author Christopher Golden cites #MeToo as the direct reason for his own 2017 #HimToo Facebook post in which he admits fault in some of his past behavior toward women.  It seemed to me that there s no solution to the problem without the participation of men, the acceptance that most men have behaved badly toward women at some point in their lives,  he said.   I wanted men to actually talk about their personal behavior toward women. How the Kavanaugh hearings popularized #HimToo#HimToo enjoyed modest usage on the Internet, going relatively unnoticed next to more popular, recognizable hashtags, until the Kavanaugh hearings kicked off last week. In the latest revival and reuse of the hashtag, it s the men who are victims. Supporters of Kavanaugh started posting #HimToo to paint him as a victim of false allegations and used the hashtag to point out the larger problem of innocent men being accused of sexual crimes they didn t commit in the age of #MeToo. One #HimToo supporter, Joe Chadwick, from Clearwater, Minn., told NPR he promotes #HimToo not as an attempt to discredit Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, but as a way to point out the need for fairness in sexual assault hearings. Kavanaugh is a victim, Chadwick said, because of the way in which he was treated as guilty from the get-go.  I m not really sure there s a middle ground,  he said.  That s the way our legal system works   innocent until proven guilty. I d rather have one guilty guy go free than one innocent man be locked up. There has to be a presumption of innocence. It doesn t mean you don t believe the accuser or that she s lying about it; it just means that without corroborative evidence, the benefit of the doubt goes to the accused. He called today s climate for men an age of  sexual McCarthyism  in which women seem to be given the monopoly on morality and trustworthiness. Kaya Jones, a singer from Los Angeles who has also been a victim of abuse, agrees that women should not automatically be believed. In terms of the Kavanaugh hearings, she was undecided about whether Ford was telling the truth.  We don t know because she didn t use the appropriate avenues for redress,  Jones said.  I m a firm believer in speaking out. But you cannot ruin someone s life on an  if ; be certain or don t [make] any accusations. In the end, Jones posted in support of Kavanaugh because she felt that Ford had turned into a political pawn for those who opposed his nomination to the Supreme Court. #MeToo allows false claimsThe #HimToo movement in support of Kavanaugh has been, in some ways, the antithesis to #MeToo and #BelieveHer. Kaitlin Bennett, a conservative activist from Ohio who posted about #HimToo, believes #MeToo has had unfortunate side effects. #MeToo gave way to allow women to come out and make false claims,  she said.  This stuff does ruin people s lives. I think the #HimToo is reminding people that while women have been so propped up in media and that s important, we also can forget about the men who are falsely accused. Another #HimToo supporter, Kimberly Meyer of Barrington, Ill., said that she believes #MeToo is overrated and obscures instances in which women behave badly. Sometimes the women are aggressors. They go into situations with powerful men and they re the ones instigating the problem; they ll intentionally dress sexual,  she said.  It s men s turn to speak up. #HimToo rallyMen who support the #HimToo movement will have a chance to speak up in person at an upcoming rally in Portland, Ore., on Nov. 17. The rally is being organized by Portland resident Haley Adams and will feature different conservative speakers. Adams firmly believes that #HimToo is not in opposition to #MeToo but rather seeks to support men as well as women. Men too can be abused; men too can be lied about. #HimToo has nothing to do with politics, it s about supporting men too,  she said.  There s a war on men.  Men are at risk today. I would not want to be a male today because of what s going on. They re being falsely accused, slandered, attacked and harassed at their homes.  She cited Kavanaugh as an example, saying that his hearing was part of her inspiration for organizing the rally.Mocking #HimTooIt wasn t long, however, before the trolls came out to play. #MeToo activists on the left saw the viral tweet of Pieter Hanson s mother and soon began to mock #HimToo with humorous versions of her original post.Liberal activist Molly Jong-Fast of New York City was among the first   and loudest   trollers, posting numerous iterations of #HimToo mock tweets, such as ones that used photos of Donald Trump Jr.For Jong-Fast, these types of tweets are her way of fighting against what she calls  misinformation  and reclaiming the narrative.  The #HimToo hashtag is a larger way for Republicans to change the narrative, take the attention, and make it about white male oppression. It s Tucker Carlsonism as a hashtag,  she said.  We re often sort of fighting against these larger talking points. She said she felt that the #HimToo hashtag came across as entitled. Her decision to use Donald Trump Jr. as the photo for her mock tweets comes from Trump Jr. s past appropriation of #MeToo into joke posts.Qasim Rashid, of Washington D.C., also felt that #HimToo attempted to take attention away from women and survivors. He said he had never felt at risk of being falsely accused and that the bigger issue is sexual abuse against both men and women. It s not hard not to be at risk,  he said.  I was raised in an environment to treat all people with respect and not do anything without consent. For some of the joke posters, the humor was not only used to disarm opposing arguments but also to help process their own anger and sadness following the Kavanaugh hearings. Charlotte Clymer, of Washington D.C., said she was filled with rage after seeing the way the Kavanaugh hearings were handled. As a survivor herself, her takeaway from the hearings was that boys and men are held to a lower standard, while survivors are often silenced, targeted and shamed, she said. It was a s***** experience,  she said.  Laughter is the best medicine and I think all of us felt a bit better laughing about all of it.  She also said that she enjoyed Hanson s response to his mother s tweet, calling it the best part of her week.  Last night was a momentary reprieve from the pain, but it doesn t fix anything,  she said.  The oppressor cannot be the victim Not all the responses were as humorous. Nicole Torres, of Chicago, posted about how #HimToo missed the point of the #MeToo movement.  The oppressor cannot be the victim,  she wrote, and she compared #HimToo to  #AllLivesMatter, saying that they were both useless hashtags.  I abhor women who would use false allegations against a man, and it is valid, and it does happen,  she said.  But #HimToo is trying to dismiss #MeToo. They will do anything to dismiss the female voice. The various uses of #HimToo are not something that Golden predicted when he originally posted the hashtag last year.  Hashtags can be as harmful as they are helpful,  he said.  Sometimes they start a real, productive dialogue, but it has to go further than that. In this case, #HimToo has seemingly blossomed into a movement, taking on a life of its own. "

Joe Manchin supported Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation to the Supreme Court. Up for re-election in a state President Trump won big, this Democrat faces tricky political consequences."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/10/656017613/with-kavanaugh-confirmed-both-sides-of-abortion-debate-gear-up-for-battle,"The end of the fight over Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court nomination sets up a new battleground over abortion rights, and activists on both sides of the issue are gearing up for what s likely to be a series of contentious battles from the high court to state legislatures.Planned Parenthood is unveiling a new strategy designed to prepare for the possibility of a nation without the federal protections for abortion rights outlined in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.In an exclusive interview with NPR, Planned Parenthood Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens said the reproductive rights group is preparing to  super-size  its efforts to connect women with abortion services in what could become an increasingly difficult environment. Already, she said, women in many states with restrictive abortion laws have difficulty obtaining the procedure. Over the last years, obviously, there has been a great retraction of access for women in this country in many, many states,  Laguens said.Abortion rights opponents have been working for decades to pass new restrictions at the state and national levels, with their eyes the ultimate prize: overturning Roe and other Supreme Court decisions that have affirmed the right to an abortion. Both sides see that possibility as far more likely with Justice Kavanaugh on the court. He replaced retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, who had often been the court s swing vote on abortion and other controversial matters.Life After Roe?Planned Parenthood s new strategy to fight back includes three major components: expanding access in states with laws favorable to reproductive rights; policy work aimed at strengthening reproductive rights; and efforts to reduce stigma surrounding abortion.If Roe were overturned or substantially weakened, state legislatures would become the front lines of the fight. Officials at Planned Parenthood and other groups are preparing to lobby state lawmakers and other elected officials to strengthen protections for abortion and remove restrictions already on the books.In states with more liberal laws, abortion rights advocates see an opportunity to shore up and expand access, with an eye toward serving women from other states. That could include expanding access to medicated abortion through telemedicine and using technology to inform women about how and where they can access services, Planned Parenthood officials said. Already women across this country have to access funding; they have to access transportation; they have to access housing; they have to access support networks,  Laguens said.  That is gonna be a greater need if there are further restrictions when Roe is attacked by this court. In Illinois, the organization has expanded its surgical abortion services from two to five locations over the past two years, said Dr. Amy Whitaker, medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois.Whitaker said she already serves women from throughout the Midwest, and she expects to do that  on overdrive  if Roe is overturned and surrounding states pass increasingly restrictive laws. With Kavanaugh on the court we know that we re gonna need an ironclad network of states and providers across the country where abortion will still be legal and accessible, no matter what happens on the Supreme Court,  Whitaker said.Cultural influencers As a final step, Planned Parenthood s Vice President of Communications, Kevin Griffis, said the organization recently restructured its communications division to create a team focused on working with  cultural influencers  like television writers and producers to tell stories about abortion and reproductive health. The organization has been consulted on shows including CW s Jane the Virgin, HBO s Girls and Fox s Glee, he said.  [Stigma] truly is at the heart of the attacks that we re seeing,  Griffis said.  And I think the key to reducing that is really being able to change people s perception of abortion so that they see it for what it is   which is a really safe medical procedure and a typical, standard part of healthcare.  Courts and statehousesAbortion rights opponents also are preparing for the next phase of this fight, said Concerned Women for America CEO and President Penny Nance.As soon as Kavanaugh was sworn in, Nance said, abortion rights opponents  were talking about, starting to get together and think about the best cases to move forward, to put in front of the court. Several states have passed abortion restrictions that are currently being litigated and could eventually come before the Supreme Court. Iowa, for example, passed one of the most restrictive laws earlier this year. That law, banning abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat could be detected, was blocked by a county judge before it could take effect.Nance said abortion opponents also will be preparing to continue to push for new abortion restrictions at the state level. The state legislature for the past 10 years have been very fertile ground for moving the ball down the field on the issue of life,  Nance said.  And so we will continue those efforts, and I think we will continue to see success. But first, the mid-termsWhile advocates on both sides of the abortion debate are looking ahead to legal battles in the coming months and legislative sessions next year, neither side is losing sight of another opportunity to rally each base   the mid-term elections, now less than a month away.The abortion rights group NARAL is launching a $750,000 direct mail and digital ad campaign aimed at suburban female voters in eight cities. The group has also launched a $1 million ad campaign targeting Republican candidates and urging abortion rights supporters to  vote them out.  The group is running ads spring-boarding off Kavanaugh s confirmation and warning that the Republican Party  harms and silences  women.Fresh off their victory in the Kavanaugh fight, abortion opponents are also running mid-term get-out-the-vote campaigns.Mallory Quigley, Vice President of Communications for the abortion opponent group Susan B. Anthony List, said her group s primary focus now is on voter canvassing and other efforts leading up to the mid-term elections next month. The Kavanaugh confirmation battle kind of exemplified...why we ve been engaging in Senate races across the country since last summer,  she said.  And that s precisely because the Senate is where Supreme Court justices are confirmed. "
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/10/655932709/talking-with-boys-about-sexual-assault-and-consent,"In the basement of a suburban Philadelphia home, half a dozen high school freshman boys recently met to munch on chips and pretzels   and to talk about sexual assault in the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings.A Jewish group called Moving Traditions brought them together as part of its programs to encourage teenagers to talk about this and other difficult issues. Temple Sinai in Dresher, Pa., sponsors this local group.Volunteer group leader Cody Greenes, 35, introduced the week s topic by asking the boys to raise their hands if they ve heard of the #MeToo movement. Then Greenes led a discussion about the historical power differences between men and women and how that can play out when it comes to sex.After talking about the larger issue, Greenes posed the question:  Do we believe that verbal consent is necessary? Most of the boys said yes, but one, David Levin, argued it isn t always simple. He described a situation on a bus where both people already said they re interested in each other and the girl purposely sat next to the boy. And then she, like, puts a blanket around you two and lays down, and cuddles into you and grabs your hand so you can hold hands and stuff,  says Levin, who suggested those are signs of consent.Complicating the discussion, the boys talked about a case where verbal consent may not be enough   say, if a movie producer asks a subordinate to have sex.Arriving at the right answer on your ownMoving Traditions founder and CEO Deborah Meyer says the goal is not to tell teens how they should behave, but to give them the space and guidance to arrive at the right answer with their peers. We help guys uncover the tenderness and the connection and the joy in themselves, as a human being, and develop for themselves a sense of ethics and values and responsibility,  Meyer says.Talking about sexual assault and consent this way sounds different from what a lot of people heard in the past, often during presentations for incoming college freshmen. We gave females rape whistles and mace and we told them to be careful when they went out and not to be raped. And then we would sit down and talk to men and tell them not to be rapists,  says Sharyn Potter, a professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire.Bringing in the bystandersPotter says research shows that only a small percentage of men are perpetrators, so it doesn t make sense to frame this as a men vs. women problem. Instead, she focuses on educating the community with a  bystander intervention strategy.  We teach people to be aware of these situations, and then we give people the skills to intervene in these situations before, during and after,  says Potter, who also co-directs the Prevention Innovations Research Center at UNH.Potter says it can be difficult to encourage people to intervene because they re often concerned about being seen as a  killjoy  or  party pooper.  She says what s needed is cultural change, like what happened with the movement to end drunken driving.Decades back, most people were uncomfortable taking a friend s keys when they were too drunk to drive. But after years of research and education campaigns, the rate of alcohol-related traffic deaths has been cut in half since the 1980s.Potter says for sexual assault, this kind of culture change is just getting started. But there are examples.One of the teenagers from the Moving Traditions group, Matthew O Donnell, says he already has used these skills as a high school freshman. At a football game, he says another guy was touching a girl and trying to get her to be intimate. He wasn t sure if it was a problem, but just in case he made an excuse to separate them. When I saw it happening I was just kind of like,  Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.  And the bathroom was on the other side of the stadium,  O Donnell says. He says he asked the guy to come with him, and the potential problem was averted.Potter says that s a perfect example of identifying a situation and then intervening in a way that doesn t make a big fuss. She says more of that, along with praise for people like O Donnell when they intervene, will lead to the culture change that could result in fewer sexual assaults in the future."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/sections/publiceditor/2018/10/10/654142555/reflecting-on-the-ford-kavanaugh-hearings-coverage,"The tail end of Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court nomination process released a powerful next phase in the #MeToo movement, as women poured out their previously untold stories of sexual assault. The political wrangling, meanwhile, provoked a furious, largely partisan, clash. Two stories entwined, each offering multiple individual threads to explore. NPR s listeners and readers found plenty to praise and also to critique across the 12 hours of live special coverage and extensive newsmagazine and online coverage. My analysis, as always, takes into account a wide breadth of coverage. Much of the coverage was very good. Yes, there were occasional slip-ups: some crude language in the special coverage commentary, and bits of analysis that came across as overly partisan when NPR s staff failed to cite sources for their conclusions. Those I chalk that up to the stresses of live radio (and I later heard the news staff make a concerted effort to clarify words that might come across as loaded).Two other themes in the listener and reader concerns stood out and deserve a deeper look. Both involve fairness. The role of NPR, as I see it, is to provide listeners and readers with the facts of a situation, and, secondarily, multiple perspectives on how to interpret those facts, or on how those facts are being received. Either way, listeners and readers then get to form their own opinions about the issues. Overall, I thought the coverage tackled a wide spectrum. But on a couple of occasions, the balance tipped.One time when the proportion was off was on the Sept. 30 Weekend Edition Sunday show. That was three days after the nearly nine hours of Senate Judiciary Committee testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett Kavanaugh regarding Ford s allegations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers.That day, nine stories (out of a total of 20) somehow dealt with the Kavanaugh nomination, or the fury of the many women who began sharing their own stories in the aftermath of Ford s allegations. The show started with analysis from Mara Liasson, who came to the conclusion that  if we are in an ongoing kind of stress test of our democratic institutions, Thursday was a day when those institutions really seemed to buckle under the stress.  That was followed by an interview with a guest who argued that Kavanaugh, in his testimony,  seems to have been dishonest and misleading sort of throughout.  After a piece about a name change in Macedonia, there was an interview with Ana Maria Archila of the Center for Popular Democracy, concerning her Capitol Hill elevator confrontation with Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake about her own sexual assault. All that was in the first half-hour of the program.Later, a high school student was interviewed regarding her Huffington Post op-ed about her anger while watching the day of hearings. A reported piece interviewed two men for their reactions (one reflected on his own inappropriate past actions); a compilation of reaction from women featured mostly those who were profoundly moved by watching the hearings. There was another interview, about the role of race and gender in the Ford-Kavanaugh hearings, with a former member of the legal team that assisted Anita Hill when she testified in the confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas. Molly Ringwald was interviewed about the 1980s films (including ones she starred in) that glorified the high school party scene. Amidst all this was an interview in the show s second hour with Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review. As the headline on the piece says, he was brought on for a  Conservative Take On Kavanaugh Hearing And Investigation.  Instead of conveying the range of perspectives that was intended, the labeling came off as a profoundly  other-izing  approach, particularly since no other interview was similarly labeled as a  liberal take.  Likewise, it was odd to ask the high school student who was angered by the hearings to talk about what she had heard from other students who felt Kavanaugh was being treated unfairly. It s better to let someone speak for themselves. Host Lulu Garcia-Navarro largely articulated alternative points of view in the interviews, as hosts should. Taken individually, the interviews and perspectives were valid. But overall, there was a lot of commentary on the two stories   sexual assault and the hearings   all from one side, and very little actual reporting to advance the story. I asked Sarah Oliver, the show s executive producer, about the listener concerns. She told me: Likewise, Christopher Turpin, NPR s acting senior vice president for news, said: I m not arguing here for reflexive balance; that does not serve the truth. For example, there s no counterpoint for an interview with a woman that has been sexually assaulted. But the truth is not served, either, by piling on with stories that leave a listener with the impression that everyone feels the same way about these issues. A half-dozen readers from across the political spectrum wrote in to protest the choices of a couple of the photos used of Kavanaugh on npr.org, including the one at the top of the page here and then leading the nine-photograph slide show partway down the page here. Those who complained about the photos variously thought they were  unfair,   unflattering,   prone to evoke a negative impression  and  an attempt to make Kavanaugh look as mean and ugly as possible.  One point: The leading image of the slide show led the npr.org home page at some points, so it perhaps took on greater importance if the readers encountered it there. That said, after talking to the newsroom, it s clear they put quite a bit of thought into the choices.Nicole Werbeck, NPR s senior supervising editor for visuals and engagement, said the slide show was designed to represent the full scope of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, including the senators, the special prosecutor and, of course, Ford. Two other photos of Kavanaugh were included, both of which showed him with a less-emotional demeanor.  What I always try to make sure of is that we re giving a full picture of what we re seeing for the day, and try to make it as fair and balanced as possible,  Werbeck said.Photos, of course, can convey in a glance what could otherwise take a pile of words, and they can absolutely be prejudicial. But the one takeaway from Kavanaugh s testimony that dominated the conversation afterward was exactly that anger that he showed; the president praised it, and many analyses in recent days have argued that it was a key factor in saving his nomination. If one had to choose a single photo to illustrate his testimony that day, a photo of his furious face (and the ones NPR chose were far from the most unflattering photos out there from which to choose) seems to me to be the most accurate choice. One final point: A couple of readers suggested that NPR should  provide equally unflattering images of all sides,  as one put it. Rather, I d argue that NPR should choose photos that convey what happened. One person got angry; the other didn t. "

The Supreme Court is an institution of law. It is not a partisan or political institution,  Kavanaugh said.  The justices do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle. We do not caucus in separate rooms. The Supreme Court is a team of nine, and I will always be a team player on the team of nine. Trump, however, began the ceremony with a sharp partisan rebuke. On behalf of our nation, I want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure,  Trump said. A man or a woman must always be presumed innocent, unless and until proven guilty,  the president added, to applause in the White House East Room.  And with that, I must state that, you sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent. Kavanaugh thanked some of the senators key to his confirmation, including Maine Republican Susan Collins and West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, who sealed the bare majority needed to confirm him. Although the Senate confirmation process tested me, as it has tested others, it did not change me,  the justice said, affirming that he s committed to fairness and impartiality on the bench.But the rancor left from his confirmation battle was on display Monday morning on the street outside the court, where several dozen protesters chanted,  Hell, no, we don t support sexual predators on the court. Kavanaugh is getting off to a swift start. He has already hired four women to serve as his Supreme Court clerks, something that he noted Monday evening was a first, and has studied the legal briefs for the cases on deck. Those center on which kinds of crimes trigger mandatory prison terms under the Armed Career Criminal Act.Any technical arguments are likely to be overshadowed by Kavanaugh s first public appearance wearing the traditional black robe donned by Supreme Court justices.The bruising campaign to install Kavanaugh onto the court could leave a mark on his reputation and on public confidence in the institution, legal experts say.The former dean of Yale Law School, from which Kavanaugh graduated, wrote he was  shell-shocked  by the judge s forceful testimony denying sexual assault allegations and decrying what he called a concerted effort by liberal enemies, including the Clintons. For as long as Kavanaugh sits on the court, he will remain a symbol of partisan anger, a haunting reminder that behind the smiling face of judicial benevolence lies the force of an urgent will to power,  Yale law professor Robert Post wrote in Politico.  No one who felt the force of that anger could possibly believe that Kavanaugh might actually be a detached and impartial judge. Kavanaugh s allies predicted the partisan air around his confirmation would fade. They point out he served for 12 years on the country s second-most important court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where he penned more than 300 opinions, many of which were upheld by the Supreme Court. These things always blow over,  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a news conference shortly after Kavanaugh won confirmation.The justices themselves have expressed concern in recent years about public perception of the court. This is a really divided time,  said Justice Elena Kagan, who addressed the current climate of the court at an event at Princeton University last week.  Part of the court s strength and part of the court s legitimacy depends on people not seeing the court in the way that people see the other governing structures in this country. Chief Justice John Roberts has made keeping the court above the partisan fray a priority in his tenure.Roberts addressed that issue in 2017, in remarks at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. It is a real danger that the partisan hostility that people see in the political branches will affect the nonpartisan activity of the judicial branch,  he said. It is very difficult I think for a member of the public to look at what goes on in confirmation hearings these days, which is a very sharp conflict in political terms between Democrats and Republicans, and not think that the person who comes out of that process must similarly share that partisan view of public issues and public life.

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/08/654713560/how-is-kavanaugh-likely-to-rule-on-critical-issues-heres-a-look-at-his-record,"Brett Kavanaugh is a Supreme Court justice. That much is certain after senators narrowly approved his controversial nomination Saturday, putting an end to his bitter confirmation battle with a slim vote in his favor.But even as one phase of Kavanaugh s story ends, another is beginning: His lifetime tenure on the highest court in the U.S. And this story promises to last much longer.So, what can we expect to see from Kavanaugh on the biggest, thorniest issues likely to come before the Supreme Court? Of course that question won t be answered with certainty until we see him actually on the nation s highest bench   but there are clues to be found in Kavanaugh s past statements and opinions.Here s a brief breakdown of where the newly minted justice has come down on five major topics that have proven to be lightning rods in the courtroom and beyond. Scroll down or click from the list below to jump to a particular issue.AbortionInvestigating the presidentGunsCampaign financeFederal agencies and environmental regulationsPerhaps the biggest question hanging over Kavanaugh s confirmation hearings in September was the matter of Roe v. Wade. The landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling made abortion legal nationwide   much to the anger and frustration of many conservatives, who have been seeking its reversal virtually ever since.With Kavanaugh on the court, conservative justices now have a solid majority, inspiring anti-abortion activists  hopes   and abortion rights advocates  fears   that the moment may finally be at hand. But is it really?Kavanaugh answered cautiously when asked about it during his confirmation hearings, saying the decades-old ruling  was settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court.  Asked about Planned Parenthood v. Casey   the 1992 case that affirmed Roe and asserted that states couldn t place an  undue burden  on women seeking legal abortions   he called it  precedent on precedent. Those statements echo his comments in private before the hearings to Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who supports abortion rights and who provided the critical vote needed to confirm Kavanaugh.At the same time, his record as a federal judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals adds nuance to these blanket assessments. One example surfaced as recently as last year.In a case that would later be decided by the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh s appellate court ruled in favor of an undocumented 17-year-old in immigrant detention who had been seeking an abortion. Kavanaugh wrote the dissent in that ruling, arguing that precedents are clear in  allowing the Government to impose reasonable regulations so long as they do not unduly burden the right to abortion that the Court has recognized. The court s decision supporting the teen, Kavanaugh argued,  is ultimately based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong: a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. Government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand. Still, even before he began his stint on the appellate court, Kavanaugh asserted that he would follow Roe v. Wade as established precedent. In his confirmation hearings to join D.C. s federal appellate court, Kavanaugh assured Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of that   while remaining wary with his language, as he would more than a decade later. The Supreme Court has held repeatedly, Senator,  Kavanaugh said,  and I don t think it would be appropriate for me to give a personal view on that case. Again, like abortion, Kavanaugh s past statements on the extent and limits of executive power offer fodder for multiple interpretations.On the one hand, he cut his teeth as a young lawyer serving as an aide to Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who led the investigation of President Clinton.On the other, he voiced resistance to such probes about a decade later, after serving for years in the administration of President George W. Bush. Having seen first-hand how complex and difficult that job is, I believe it vital that the President be able to focus on the never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible,  he wrote in a 2009 law review article, laying out his case for a statute protecting sitting presidents from investigation.If we wanted a check on presidential malfeasance, Kavanaugh argued, the Constitution has already given us one: impeachment by Congress. We should not burden a sitting President with civil suits, criminal investigations, or criminal prosecutions,  he added.  The President s job is difficult enough as is. And the country loses when the President s focus is distracted by the burdens of civil litigation or criminal investigation and possible prosecution. That piece raised some eyebrows, particularly among skeptical Democrats   and particularly since the man who nominated him, President Trump, is now facing a special counsel probe of his own into Russian interference in the 2016 election. As Robert Mueller s investigation continues to deepen, the question of whether the president can be subpoenaed or indicted has been asked often.Kavanaugh s own answer remains unclear.For instance, just two years ago, he celebrated U.S. v. Nixon, the unanimous 1974 ruling that forced the embattled president to hand over subpoenaed materials, as one of  the greatest moments in American judicial history    one in which  judges stood up to the other branches, were not cowed and enforced the law. And during his confirmation hearings last month, he refused to answer senators  direct questions about the subject, saying that he, like other justices in their hearings before him, would not address  hypothetical cases. That did not exactly ease Democrats  concerns.Oddly enough, the high court has very seldom weighed in on the Second Amendment. In fact, the last landmark case to address the matter came a decade ago, when the Supreme Court s split decision in D.C. v. Heller expanded the amendment s protections to include not just groups, but individuals as well.That expansion did come with limitations, though   and as NPR s Nina Totenberg explained earlier this year,  it has long been assumed that the caveats in the decision were the price  of getting Justice Anthony Kennedy on board with the majority.Now that Kennedy has retired, what will his successor have to say? Kavanaugh believes in a very vigorous Second Amendment right to bear arms,  UCLA law professor Adam Winkler told Totenberg,  and he thinks there is little room for constitutionally permissible gun control. In this respect, Kavanaugh s position has been clearly defined. In disapproving D.C. s ban on handguns, in approving a ban on machine guns, and in approving longstanding regulations such as concealed-carry and felon-in-possession laws, Heller established that the scope of the Second Amendment right   and thus the constitutionality of gun bans and regulations   is determined by reference to text, history, and tradition,  he wrote in 2011.The comment was part of his 52-page dissent from a federal appellate court ruling that backed a ban on assault weapons in Washington, D.C. He carved out a position that is strongly in favor of gun rights   and strongly skeptical of any new or novel limitations on gun ownership that break with  tradition. In this respect, he argued, the Second Amendment should be treated much like the First. A ban on a class of arms is not an  incidental  regulation,  he wrote.  It is equivalent to a ban on a category of speech. Hints of Kavanaugh s position can be gleaned from a couple of recent cases before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals   and that position looks not unlike that of his predecessor on the court, retired Justice Kennedy.Kennedy, the court s quintessential  swing vote,  famously swung toward the conservatives in the split Citizens United ruling, which held that the First Amendment protects unlimited independent political spending by corporations. That 2010 decision dramatically loosened campaign finance laws and opened the spigot on political money.Just one year later, Kavanaugh addressed the matter of campaign finance in a case concerning foreign political contributions. In this respect, he sided with precedent that non-U.S. citizens could not contribute directly to candidates or political parties   but he made clear that his opinion was to be taken narrowly, and did not address whether foreign nationals could make contributions on behalf of political issues.That limited scope took on added importance when the Supreme Court later affirmed the ruling of Kavanaugh s court. Now, as high court precedent, some have argued that the narrow ruling suggests foreign political contributions are OK   just so long as they support political issues, rather than actual candidates.In fact, that s precisely the argument put forward by a Russian firm that was indicted for interference in the 2016 election. In a court filing earlier this year, Concord Management and Consulting cited Kavanaugh s 2011 opinion in defending its efforts as mere  issue advocacy,  not outright support of a political candidate.But progressive advocate Chiraag Bains told NPR s Peter Overby that perhaps Kavanaugh s position on campaign finance can be seen even more clearly in a decision rendered one year before Citizens United. In that case, Kavanaugh ruled that the group EMILY s List could raise unlimited funds through a nonprofit wing dedicated to issue advocacy. That opinion, to me, shows that even before Citizens United, Kavanaugh had bought into the idea that donors have the right to make limitless expenditures based on the out-of-touch idea that if spending isn t officially coordinated with a candidate, it cannot ever be corrupting,  Bains told Overby.Kavanaugh has proven to be a skeptic of the Environmental Protection Agency and other federal attempts to establish environmental regulations without consulting Congress.In 2012, he dissented from the appellate court ruling that upheld EPA regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, saying that it didn t matter that they  may well be a good idea as a matter of policy.  The task of dealing with global warming is urgent and important. But as in so many cases, the question here is: Who Decides? The short answer is that Congress (with the President) sets the policy through statutes, agenciesimplement that policy within statutory limits, and courts in justiciable cases ensure that agencies stay within the statutory limits set by Congress,  he wrote.If federal agencies overstep those bounds   as the EPA did with its pollution regulations, according to Kavanaugh   they re grabbing powers from the other branches. In cases like this one,  he noted,  the bedrock underpinnings of our system of separation of powers are at stake. His prevailing point in this case   as with others, such as his 2013 dissent objecting to a Justice Department action against SeaWorld   was that agencies must stay in the lanes allotted to them.Or, as he asserted to Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., during his confirmation hearings:  Ultimately, my approach to statutory interpretation is rooted in respect for Congress. "

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/07/654893306/a-quick-look-at-brett-kavanaugh-the-new-supreme-court-justice,"Justice Brett Kavanaugh became the newest associate justice of the Supreme Court when he was sworn in Saturday evening.On Tuesday morning, he will sit to the left of Justice Elena Kagan, in the most junior spot on the high court s bench, and will hear arguments in three criminal cases before the court.Here s a quick look at some key information about Kavanaugh as he begins his lifetime appointment to the court.Expected to cement a conservative majority: Kavanaugh replaces retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was a swing justice because he voted with the four liberal justices in cases on some hot-button issues including affirmative action and gay rights. Kavanaugh is expected to be a more consistent conservative and cement a five-justice conservative majority. As long as I ve been following the court, the major way to think about the court is in terms of who is the swing justice,  said former George W. Bush Solicitor General Paul Clement at a Supreme Court discussion in September. With Kavanaugh on the bench, Clement said,  I m not sure there will be one. Willing to uphold restrictions on abortion: Most observers believe Kavanaugh will uphold greater abortion restrictions than Justice Kennedy would have. They point to his dissent in Garza v. Hargan, which would have upheld an Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) decision to prevent a 17-year-old from temporarily leaving ORR custody to obtain an abortion, even though a Texas judge had already granted the minor a judicial bypass for the procedure. Kavanaugh argued that the agency should have had more time to find a sponsor for the minor to live with before she made the decision to end her pregnancy.At a Supreme Court preview in September, former Obama Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. predicted that with Kavanaugh on the bench, Roe v. Wade will be overturned, at least in part, within five years.  These are highly principled people,  Verrilli says,  and Roe is incompatible with their most deeply held views about how you ought to understand and interpret the Constitution. Skeptical of administrative power: Kavanaugh is skeptical of judges deferring too much to administrative agencies, and in particular has questioned the applicability of the Chevron doctrine, the principle that judges should defer to reasonable interpretations by agencies when statutes are ambiguous. He has argued that judges should stop looking to whether statutes are ambiguous and instead  strive to find the best reading of the statute  themselves.On U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, he dissented in several environmental cases because he believed that the EPA was not interpreting its governing statutes reasonably.Believes presidents should be protected from criminal investigations and civil lawsuits:  As NPR reported in July, after he was part of the Starr investigation during the Clinton administration, Kavanaugh came to believe that, during their time in office, presidents should be protected from criminal investigations, as well as civil lawsuits. In 2006, he wrote in the Minnesota Law Review about presidential investigations: Even the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation   including preparing for questioning by criminal investigators   are time-consuming and distracting. Like civil suits, criminal investigations take the President s focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. And a President who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as President. Kavanaugh also indicated that he would overturn Morrison v. Olson, a 1988 Supreme Court case that upheld an independent counsel statute as constitutional. At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh stressed that the independent counsel statute in Morrison was different from the current special counsel system which functions as part of the Justice Department.Unpopular overall and a factor for the midterms: Even before the sexual misconduct allegations against him, Kavanaugh had been polling as one of the least popular Supreme Court nominees in recent times. However, a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that amid the Kavanaugh controversy, the gap in the enthusiasm between Republicans and Democrats for the midterms has closed.Has political roots...: Kavanaugh joined independent counsel Kenneth Starr s team in 1994 to investigate then-President Bill Clinton. He worked as a regional coordinator of the 2000 Bush-Cheney campaign and was a member of Lawyers for Bush-Cheney during that campaign. After George W. Bush took office, he served as a White House counsel and then as the president s staff secretary until 2006, when he was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit. He was originally nominated in 2003, but Democrats held up his nomination for three years, arguing that he was too partisan.... and elite credentials: Kavanaugh is the second member of the current Supreme Court to graduate from Georgetown Preparatory School, the elite Jesuit high school in suburban D.C. made famous this fall because of Christine Blasey Ford s sexual assault allegations. Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump s first nominee to the high court, graduated from the school in 1985, two years after Kavanaugh did.Kavanaugh went on to Yale College and Yale Law School. He clerked for Judge Alex Kozinski on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, who recently retired amid sexual harassment allegations, and Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, whose seat he will now occupy."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/06/655191582/demonstrators-gather-at-u-s-capitol-in-anticipation-of-kavanaughs-confirmation,"Updated at 4:50 p.m. ETThe U.S. Senate voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice, while protesters gathered outside the U.S. Capitol to voice their anger at the decision.Kavanaugh s confirmation felt nearly inevitable by Friday afternoon, when two previously undecided senators, Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced they would support him. But that near-certainty did not stop protesters from gathering outside the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court early Saturday.Protesters could be found inside the U.S. Capitol as well. Vice President Pence, presiding over the Senate, began Saturday s final vote by reminding people gathered in the gallery that  expressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted  there. But as soon as Pence motioned to proceed with the vote, protesters began yelling. It started with a few voices; one person could be heard yelling,  Where s my representation? I did not consent.  The voices grew louder and louder. The Senate proceeded with the vote, but Pence repeatedly called for order to be restored in the gallery.When Manchin s name was called and he announced his vote for Kavanaugh s confirmation, yells of  shame!  could be heard from the gallery and Pence momentarily suspended the vote a second time to ask for order to be restored.NPR s Scott Detrow reported that as of around 1 p.m. ET Saturday, some protesters had broken through barriers set up in front of the Capitol and had made it as far as the main plaza and steps, where police began to slowly remove people one by one.As of about 4:30 ET, the U.S. Capitol Police confirmed a total of 164 arrests. One hundred fifty people were arrested on the East Front of the Capitol at about 12:45 p.m. At about 2:30 p.m, one person was arrested in the Senate gallery. And at about 3:45 p.m., during the Senate vote, 13 people were arrested and removed from several Senate galleries. All of these individuals were charged with  crowding, obstructing or incommoding  (to incommode is to inconvenience someone).NPR s Shannon Van Sant said anti-Kavanaugh protesters, of which she saw hundreds, far outnumbered Kavanaugh s supporters in front of the Capitol but that a small group of Kavanaugh supporters had shown up. And she said many of the demonstrators, regardless of their opinions about the Supreme Court nominee, shared a common sentiment: They don t feel their voices are being heard.Sophia Piper, a 16-year-old from Kavanaugh s hometown of Bethesda, Md., told Van Sant she chose to demonstrate against Kavanaugh s confirmation Saturday  in support of all survivors who have told their stories and been met with disbelief from their parents, law enforcement, any other adult in power in their lives. Though she knew Kavanaugh s chances of confirmation would be high when she arrived Saturday, Piper said, she still felt a sense of optimism. Seeing all the anti-Kavanaugh demonstrators, she said, made her feel confident about the next generation and the upcoming midterm elections.  No matter what happens this afternoon, I am going to continue to support survivors,  Piper said.Jayme Zovko, a pro-Kavanaugh demonstrator from Pittsburgh, told Van Sant that she supports Kavanaugh because of his judicial record and her belief that  he ll be neutral in his decisions. She wanted to make clear, however, that her support of Kavanaugh does not mean she does not believe in the validity of the #MeToo movement.  Just because I support him does not mean I don t support that idea that women should be listened to,  Zovko said.  But ... not all women are truthful. The #MeToo movement   it s an important movement ... but I don t believe Ford s claims. Zovko said she believes the anti-Kavanaugh demonstrators have  good intentions.  I m heartened today,  she added.  We spoke to a gal who does not support Kavanaugh and had a good discussion with her, very respectful. "

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/06/654409999/final-senate-vote-on-kavanaugh-nomination-expected-saturday,"Updated at 11:31 p.m. ETA sharply divided Senate   reflecting a deeply divided nation   voted almost entirely along party lines Saturday afternoon to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.A little more than two hours later, Kavanaugh was sworn in during a private ceremony as protesters stood on the court s steps.Kavanaugh becomes the nation s 114th Supreme Court justice and President Trump s second appointment to the court, creating a conservative majority on the nation s highest court for years to come.The Senate vote was 50-48. Only one Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, joined Republicans in backing Kavanaugh. One Republican, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, voted  present  although she said she opposed the nomination. One GOP senator was absent during the vote because of his daughter s wedding thousands of miles from Washington, D.C.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as he flew to Kansas for a political rally, Trump said he was  very, very, very happy  about the vote and said Kavanaugh will be  a brilliant Supreme Court justice for many years. After the vote, the president called Kavanaugh to congratulate him, the White House said in a statement. Trump also spoke with Vice President Pence, Sen. Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan.Kavanaugh was sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy Saturday evening. Roberts administered the constitutional oath and Kennedy the judicial oath.  Both oaths will be administered so that [Kavanaugh] can begin to participate in the work of the Court immediately,  the court said in a statement prior to the swearing in. A formal investiture ceremony will take place at a later date, the Supreme Court also said.And Trump told Kansas rallygoers that he will hold a ceremonial swearing-in for Kavanaugh at the White House Monday evening. Senators sat at their desks during Saturday s roll call, rising when it was their turn to vote.  The session was presided over by Pence. In the debate preceding the vote, senators sounded as though they were describing two different men. McConnell called Kavanaugh  among the very best our nation has to offer.  Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the 53-year-old Kavanaugh a victim of  an ugly left-wing smear campaign  and charged Democrats with character assassination.Kavanaugh had been accused by three women of sexual misconduct while he was in high school and college more than 30 years ago   charges he angrily denied.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called Kavanaugh s confirmation  a low moment for the Senate, the court, and the country  and said of Kavanaugh,  He doesn t belong on the nation s highest bench. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who was first elected in the  Year of the Woman  in 1992 after the confirmation of Justice Clarence Thomas, said that in confirming Kavanaugh the Senate would be telling young girls and women that  your voices just don t matter. On Air Force One, Trump told reporters his speech in Mississippi last week, in which he was widely seen to be mocking Christine Blasey Ford,  had such a great impact.  I think it was a very important thing.  Ford had accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982 when they both were in high school.Trump also said women, far from being outraged at Kavanaugh,  were outraged at what happened to Brett Kavanaugh, outraged. Asked about the #MeToo movement and her husband s recent comments about its potential impact on men, first lady Melania Trump weighed in on Kavanaugh s controversial nomination before Saturday s vote.  I would say if we re talking about the Supreme Court and Judge Kavanaugh, I think he s highly qualified for the Supreme Court,  Mrs. Trump said while speaking to reporters in Egypt during a solo international trip to Africa.  I m glad that Dr. Ford was heard; I m glad that Judge Kavanaugh was heard. FBI investigation was done, is completed and Senate voted. But when asked whether she believed Ford, the first lady would not answer directly.  I will move on that and I think that all the victims, they need   we need to help all the victims no matter what kind of abuse they had, but I am against any kind of abuse or violence,  the first lady said. In the hours before the vote, police arrested demonstrators who had broken through barriers around the Capitol and tried to climb the building s steps. Protesters were also heard shouting from the Senate gallery during the roll call.A total of 164 people were arrested according to U.S. Capitol Police.Speaking after the vote, McConnell said the protests against Kavanaugh over the past several weeks have  turned our base on fire.  Citing the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and  the virtual mob that assaulted us in the course of this process,  McConnell said  they ve managed to deliver the only thing that we had not been able to figure out how to do, which was to get our folks fired up. A recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll showed in fact that the Republicans have narrowed the enthusiasm gap with Democrats in the past few weeks.In an interview with the Washington Post, Trump said Murkowski will face political consequences for opposing Kavanaugh.  I think she will never recover from this,  Trump said.  I think the people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did.  Murkowski lost a primary battle in 2010 but was re-elected as a write-in candidate.  She next faces voters in 2022.On Friday, after the nomination cleared a key procedural hurdle with a 51-49 vote, two previously undecided senators, Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced they would support Kavanaugh. That support all but assured Republicans of the votes they needed to push the nomination across the finish line.In a much anticipated speech on the Senate floor Friday afternoon, Collins said that she believed that Ford was a survivor of sexual assault. Still, Collins said, the allegations  fail to meet the  more likely than not  standard,  and  I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court.  And in a statement issued soon after Collins spoke, Manchin explained he was supporting Kavanaugh notwithstanding the  serious accusations  leveled against the judge and lingering questions about Kavanaugh s temperament.  I have reservations about this vote given the serious accusations against Judge Kavanaugh and the temperament he displayed in the hearing,  Manchin said.  And my heart goes out to anyone who has experienced any type of sexual assault in their life. However, based on all of the information I have available to me, including the recently completed FBI report, I have found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist who will follow the Constitution and determine cases based on the legal findings before him. I do hope that Judge Kavanaugh will not allow the partisan nature this process took to follow him onto the court. Speaking to NPR on Friday, a lawyer for Ford said the California professor s goal was never to derail the nomination.  Dr. Ford s goal here was never to impact the process to derail a nomination,  attorney Lisa Banks said on All Things Considered.  What she was trying to do was what she thought was the right thing to do as a citizen, which is to provide the information to the U.S. Senate so they could make the most informed decision possible. Her goal wasn t to derail this nomination; it was to inform the nomination and she s done that. "

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/05/654852290/whats-next-in-the-kavanaugh-confirmation-fight,"Updated 5:33 p.m. ET FridayAfter GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine came out in favor of confirming him Friday afternoon on the Senate floor, Judge Brett Kavanaugh is all but certainly headed for the Supreme Court in very short order.The Senate advanced Kavanaugh s nomination, 51 to 49, Friday. A final vote is expected Saturday. There was a lot that went down Friday. What exactly happened and what does it mean going forward?Let s explain.What did Collins say?The political world was waiting for what Collins would say. After voting in favor of advancing Kavanaugh s nomination, Collins said she would announce later Friday afternoon how she would vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation. From the Senate floor, after praising Kavanaugh s judicial record and criticizing left-wing groups that opposed Kavanaugh, Collins said she believed Christine Blasey Ford was the victim of sexual assault, but that the facts presented do not mean Ford was assaulted that night or by Kavanaugh. I found her testimony to be sincere, painful and compelling,  Collins said.  Nevertheless, the four witnesses she named could not corroborate any of the events of that evening gathering where she says the assault occurred. She added,  The allegations failed to meet the  more likely than not  standard  and,  Therefore, I do not believe these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court. She then praised the #MeToo movement, saying it is  real,  that  it matters  and  is long overdue.  Collins also intimated that Ford may have been used by  people who wanted to engineer  Kavanaugh s defeat and  cared little about her well-being. What does this mean for other votes?Shortly after Collins  speech ended, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, who is up for re-election this year, also announced he is voting yes.  I have reservations about this vote given the serious accusations against Judge Kavanaugh and the temperament he displayed in the hearing,  Manchin said in a statement.  And my heart goes out to anyone who has experienced any type of sexual assault in their life. However, based on all of the information I have available to me, including the recently completed FBI report, I have found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist who will follow the Constitution and determine cases based on the legal findings before him. I do hope that Judge Kavanaugh will not allow the partisan nature this process took to follow him onto the court. Manchin voted in favor of advancing Kavanaugh s nomination earlier in the day, but it was unclear how he would vote on final confirmation. It would have been quite the drama if Collins had announced a no vote, and Manchin would have been the deciding vote on whether Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Instead, Collins gave Manchin a degree of political cover.Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against advancing Kavanaugh s nomination advancing to a final vote. That indicates she s unlikely to change her vote, because voting no on cloture for someone nominated by the president of your own party is a bold move. It signals she has real concerns that have not been allayed. It s hard to see how that happens in the next 24 hours when the FBI investigation is already wrapped up.Sen. Jeff Flake, another thought-to-be-wavering senator, also voted to advance the nomination and told reporters after the vote that he expects to be a yes on final confirmation.  I would think so,  Flake said. He noted,  Unless something big changes, I don t see what would. But anyway I m glad we had a better process. We needed a better process. What happens now?A final confirmation vote is expected Saturday.It remains to be seen how other red-state Democrats will vote now that Collins and Manchin have all but guaranteed Kavanaugh s confirmation to the court.There are 10 Democrats running for re-election in states President Trump won in 2016, and the Kavanaugh confirmation battle has fired up the GOP base.Democrats Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Jon Tester of Montana announced their opposition to Kavanaugh Sept. 28, a day after the gut-wrenching testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, perhaps the most vulnerable senator up for re-election, also announced that she s voting no.Do any of those   or other   votes change?When could Kavanaugh be seated on the Supreme Court?As early as Tuesday morning, as NPR s Nina Totenberg reported on All Things Considered Friday.What could it mean for the midterms?All year, Democrats have dominated on who is more fired up for November s midterm elections. But an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found Republican enthusiasm on the rise since the dueling Kavanaugh and Ford testimonies. Democratic enthusiasm is still high, but the gap closed significantly to a statistical tie.Does that last? Kavanaugh being confirmed will keep Democrats fired up, but was it a short-term bump for Republicans or does it recede? If Friday wasn t the vote to confirm Kavanaugh, what was it?Friday s vote was on what s known as cloture. That s whether to end, or close, debate. For this vote, that was to end debate on Kavanaugh s nomination and advance it to a final vote.Think of it this way: Don t you ever have those moments when someone just won t stop talking, and you want to say,  Enough already ? When they won t stop talking in the Senate, that s called a filibuster. And to cut them off in the Senate, you need 60 votes to do it.But not for Supreme Court nominations anymore. Why doesn t the Senate require 60 votes anymore to confirm a Supreme Court nominee?Democratic Leader Harry Reid, when he was majority leader in 2013, grew frustrated by Republicans  record use of the filibuster. Sen. Mitch McConnell, then minority leader, hatched a plan to thwart President Barack Obama from remaking the federal judiciary by aligning Republicans against Obama s nominees in lockstep. That made it impossible to get 60 votes, thereby making it impossible for Obama to get anyone through.In response, Reid threatened to change the rules and get rid of the 60-vote requirement for lower court nominees. McConnell persisted, and Reid changed the rules. McConnell then warned that he would up the ante and blow up the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, and when he got in power, he did just that last year during the confirmation process for Neil Gorsuch.That leaves us where we are now with an acrimonious and pitched political battle, roughly along party lines, to vote through a Supreme Court nominee.OK, so the vote Friday was 51-49. Who voted and how?The key quartet everyone has been watching are Republicans Flake, Collins, Murkowski and Democrat Manchin.Three of the four voted for cloture to advance Kavanaugh   Flake, Collins and, surprisingly to some, Manchin.That was enough for a majority.If Manchin had voted no, would that have sunk Kavanaugh?No, because that would make it a 50-50 tie, and Vice President Pence would be called in to break the tie in his titular role as president of the Senate.Why would Manchin vote yes?He s is up for re-election in a very red state, West Virginia. Trump won West Virginia by more than 40 points. Manchin is favored to win re-election, but the Kavanaugh confirmation battle has fired up what was seen as a dormant Republican base.Manchin is trying to tread carefully and not jeopardize his chances. Do the senators have to vote the same way on a final vote?No. There s nothing stopping any one of them from changing their vote. It s a completely new vote. It is rare for someone to change a vote from one step to another, but it s not unheard of.Some senators are fine with advancing a nomination or bill to be voted on, but not OK with the nominee or the substance of legislation.In fact, last year, Collins voted yes in committee on Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, but then voted against her in the final vote. Her reason: DeVos wasn t strong enough on public education.A committee vote is not exactly the same as ending cloture, but it s a decent corollary as a two-step process.Why might a senator change his or her vote from one step to another?Some senators object to the increased use of the filibuster and might want to uphold what they call  regular order.  The late-Sen. John McCain, for example, voted in favor of advancing the GOP s Affordable Care Act repeal legislation to the Senate floor and then dramatically voted no on final passage.Some might want to thread a political needle, especially when they re in the majority, but in a state that leans the opposite way from their party. For example, say you are a Republican, from a left-leaning state like Maine. You might not want to appear to be siding with Democrats in trying to outright block a nominee but want to wait to announce your final vote. But that is not what happened with Collins."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/05/654775614/kavanaugh-allegations-prompt-some-prep-schools-to-examine-their-culture,"Editor s note: This story contains language some may find offensive.The allegations of drinking and sexual misconduct swirling around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have prompted a new round of soul-searching at elite prep schools like the one he attended three decades ago.  Schools are taking a hard look at how they may have permitted a culture of drinking and sexual misconduct. Over recent weeks, as Dr. Christine Blasey Ford has detailed her accusations against Kavanaugh, many alumni of those esteemed institutions say the picture of drunken debauchery that has emerged is painfully familiar.          I was deeply shaken,  says Alexandra Lescaze, who graduated from the National Cathedral School in 1988.  She says the news prompted a slew of  really bad memories.  Bad things happened to her, she says, and even worse things to others. For example, she says at one party, she witnessed what kids used to call a  lineup.   There was a drunk girl in a room, and there was a boy in there with her, and there were other boys lined up outside the door, and my friend recalls hearing  I m next!   I m next!     It was such a toxic culture of power and privilege, she says, many guys didn t even try to hide it. For example, as she remembers, one guy actually included the term  date rape  in his reminiscences beside his senior picture in his yearbook.   Imagine having the balls to put that in your yearbook,  she sighs.  They just felt like [they had] complete impunity. It was really bad.  And schools knew it, too.  In 1990, the Washington Post reported that seven schools sent a joint letter to parents, warning them about the excessive drinking and sex at unsupervised parties. The schools, including Georgetown Preparatory School, which Kavanaugh attended, called it a  recipe for disaster.  Georgetown Prep s current president declined to comment for this report. But in a recent letter to parents, the Rev. James Van Dyke vowed to re-evaluate school culture and to  continue our ongoing work with the guys on developing ... a healthy understanding of masculinity ... and to talk with them honestly and even bluntly about what respect for others, especially respect for women and other marginalized people means in very practical terms   in actions and in words.   This has been a call to every educator to think through what kind of a community they want to be creating on campus,  says John Palfrey, head of school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.  I think any school that isn t engaged in soul-searching about the kind of culture that is on a campus is making a mistake. Most schools have already changed dramatically since the  80s, Palfrey says. That has been driven by evolving attitudes in society at large, and by a student body that is no longer so exclusively drawn from the privileged and powerful.   Palfrey says new initiatives at school have also had an impact. He says from the moment students arrive on campus to the day they graduate, they are all educated in what he calls a  culture of consent and respect.   It s definitely progress, he says, but  I certainly can t say that we are out of the woods yet. Indeed, just three years ago, St. Albans School, an elite all-boys school in D.C., was embroiled in scandal involving student misconduct. Girls at its sister school, National Cathedral School, collected a Google document full of allegations of of unwanted sexual advances at parties and inappropriate comments by St. Albans boys as part of an effort to design new prevention programs. That prompted a flurry of online posts from the boys that school officials called  inappropriate.  Later the same year, St. Albans had to recall its yearbooks after discovering seniors had included crude and sexist slurs.  That s way too recent. This is very disturbing,  says attorney Eric MacLeish, who represents victims of sexual assault and is an alumnus of St. Albans. That tells me there s an issue at that school. It s really indefensible,  he says. St. Albans declined to comment, but in a letter to parents and alumni this week, the school apologized for the incidents and vowed to learn from past mistakes.  We embrace moments like this ... as opportunities to reflect deeply on who we are and what we value,  wrote Headmaster Jason Robinson.  Not that it hasn t been painful. In his letter, Van Dyke from Georgetown Prep noted how  tough  it has been to see the school s image so tarnished. But writing this week in America magazine, Van Dyke insisted that the school s challenge is  not a public relations challenge but one of school culture.  Alumnus Jerry Parshall says he doesn t think the school is quite living up to that standard. He says the letter he received from the president  focused too much on the good work that prep students are doing in the world and their public service  and on denying any sense of entitlement.  I wish they had owned up a little bit more,  he says,  to say,  Look, there clearly was a problem here back then, and there s more we can do about it, and we re going to work to fix it.   Palfrey of Phillips Academy says some schools have been quicker than others to really walk the walk.   In difficult situations, I certainly think there are cases in which schools make a decision based on [protecting their] reputation [instead of what s best for kids] and they shouldn t. Ultimately, schools say the most powerful force for change is the kids themselves.  As three seniors wrote in the St. Albans school newspaper this week,  The acceptance that our community has problems is not a mark on our character or our school; rather, an honest effort to address these problems shows our true strength as young men.   They went on to write that only by  standing tall as the men of St. Albans School will we give to our sisters ... what we have owed them for ages.  It s heartening to many administrators to see how expectations and attitudes of this generation of high schoolers have evolved. But Palfrey says he worries some of the progress may be undermined by what happens in Washington. If the Senate votes to confirm Kavanaugh, despite the allegations against him, he says it will send students a mixed message about underage drinking and sexual misconduct.  It will make it seem that these things are not as consequential or important as we ve been saying they are,  says Palfrey.  And it will make it more complicated for us as educators to hold the line on sexual misconduct in some ways.  And even if the Senate votes no, Palfrey says, public officials have already made comments in recent weeks that also undermine what schools have been trying to teach. "
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/05/654712035/protesters-make-final-push-to-derail-kavanaughs-bid-before-confirmation-vote,"Updated at 4:40 p.m. ETInside the Senate chamber Friday, lawmakers gathered to consider Brett Kavanaugh s controversial nomination to Supreme Court. There, the federal judge earned just enough support to advance to a final vote on his confirmation.Outside the chamber, meanwhile, a much louder kind of drama has been unfolding   much of it aimed at the few senators who remained undecided. Before Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced their support for Kavanaugh s confirmation on Friday afternoon, protesters launched a last-ditch campaign to persuade the senators to vote no.With Collins and Manchin publicly on board, Kavanaugh had the votes Friday evening to be confirmed to the high court. A final vote is expected over the weekend.The protesters  campaign came just a day after an hours-long demonstration ended in hundreds of arrests. By the time Friday morning arrived, barricades had been erected around the Capitol building, but that did little to dissuade some determined demonstrators from hefting signs and raising their voices against Kavanaugh s bid to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.Kavanaugh s confirmation would likely swing the court rightward in its judicial leanings   but that s not what protesters have been most concerned with Friday. They re focused on the allegations against Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in the 1980s.In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, the federal appeals court judge flatly denied Christine Blasey Ford s assertion that he sexually assaulted her while they were both in high school.The FBI provided a confidential report to senators on Thursday after a limited inquiry into allegations of misconduct. Republicans said the new interviews offered no corroboration of Ford s claim and said Kavanaugh had been thoroughly vetted. Democrats, for their part, decried the probe as woefully narrow in scope.Many of the demonstrators around Capitol Hill are not satisfied either, and they got an early start Friday explaining why. These are credible allegations. And when he was responding to them [during his testimony last week], he still has to behave   and should behave   with the comportment of an officer of the court and someone who can be respectful,  Rachel Cella, an attorney who flew in from Alaska, told NPR.  And that s not what we saw from him. I would be troubled to have to appear before him as an advocate. Cella had joined one of many small, scattered groups of demonstrators who had assembled outside the Supreme Court building just before the Senate cloture vote on Friday morning. While their numbers were dwarfed by the rally the day before   in which thousands showed up to march and lobby their senators personally   Cella said their determination remained steady.Few of those lawmakers have held more importance than Cella s own senator, Alaska s Lisa Murkowski. The moderate Republican put forward a surprise  no  vote on cloture for Kavanaugh on Friday, moving to block his advance just a day after dozens of Alaskan voters flowed into her office to speak with her.More than 100 Alaskan women had made the trip in hopes they could sway such a pivotal vote. And it may have made a difference: The senator told NBC News she did not make her final decision  until walking into the floor this morning.  It s a long journey. It s uncomfortable. Red-eye flights are not fun. But you know what, it s worth it,  Cella said.  We re all here. We re all in the same boat. We all did this. Not all the demonstrators lodged protests against Kavanaugh.Some gathered to show their support for Trump s nominee, as Caroline Simon reports for USA Today. She says about a dozen donned shirts reading  I stand with Brett  and  Women for Kavanaugh  and stood outside the office of Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.Others wore red  Make America Great Again  caps and sought to counter the anti-Kavanaugh demonstrators with chants of their own.At times, the two groups of protesters, both for and against Kavanaugh s confirmation, met in the hallways for heated arguments   including this one recorded by NPR s Barbara Sprunt, which at least ended amicably enough in a high-five.The halls of the Senate office building played host to some of the most tense eruptions of protests, though, including one outside the office of Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. Long seen as a crucial swing vote on Kavanaugh s nomination, Flake proved pivotal in obtaining the FBI investigation. But on Friday, he followed his party s leadership in voting for cloture and reportedly signaled he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh in the end.That did not sit well with protesters, who quickly massed outside his office door. Even as police officers ushered members of the media away, the demonstrators  chants of  I believe survivors  echoed down the hallway.Flake remained publicly on the fence about his final vote stance for much of Friday. So did Collins and Manchin   and that fact was not lost on Kavanaugh s opponents, who also packed Manchin s office to persuade him to side with his fellow Democrats.Their efforts appear to have been for naught. With support from Flake, Collins and Manchin, Kavanaugh has secured the majority necessary to be confirmed to the Supreme Court. Still, the decisive move failed to extinguish the day s controversy.As Manchin addressed the media after making his announcement, protesters shouted over him in anger:  Look at us. Look at us. Look at us. "

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/05/654600596/will-the-kavanaugh-saga-leave-bruises-that-heal-or-permanent-scars,"President Trump s choice of Brett Kavanaugh is already the most contentious nomination to the Supreme Court since Clarence Thomas won a 52-48 confirmation vote in 1991.Thomas  was the closest vote confirming a justice since the 1800s, and it followed a stormy hearing and an adverse vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee. The process nearly foundered on accusations of sexual harassment and racial prejudice.But the Senate in that day settled down, and Thomas has served on the court for 27 years ñ a nearly always silent anchor on the court s right.The Kavanaugh controversy did not have a racial element, but at times has seemed equally bruising. It has divided the Senate just as evenly.And it may prove to be more permanently divisive, not only for the Senate s confirmation process but for the Senate itself and for the Court as well.It must be said that the atmosphere of collegiality has been deteriorating in both institutions for some time. But the Kavanaugh confrontation has featured more raw partisanship on all sides than even the Thomas affair. Boy, you all want power,  said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, his voice rising to a shout at the Democrats across from him in a public hearing.  God, I hope you never get it! That came from a Republican who had twice voted to confirm Democratic nominees for the Supreme Court and who was once considered something of a bridge between the parties.It is one more manifestation of the emotional cauldron that boiled throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and has simmered ever since. And it may poison relationships in the Capitol and the Courthouse for some time to come.By tradition, both the Senate and the Supreme Court have been thought of as elevated plateaus in American political life. In these hallowed spaces, the air was rarefied. Party ties existed but mattered less.Ideology was present and contentious, but it was not always salient. Much if not most of the time, differences were expressed and explored in a calm atmosphere. A belief in tradition and the power of compromise prevailed.Perhaps this memory owes much to myth. Nations, like people, are inclined to idealize and sanitize their pasts. Some, too, may be attributable to the lower profile of both Senate and Court in the generations before C-SPAN, cable TV news and social media.But there surely has existed a keen sense that being the Senate   and acting accordingly   mattered for its own sake. Some of this can be seen in the courtly way senators address each other in the chamber even now.They do not use names but refer to each other as  the distinguished  gentleman or  gentle lady  or as the senator from such and such state. What is said in the cloakroom, or behind closed doors, does not get repeated on the Senate floor.The ambience of this more bipartisan Senate was on display last month in the tributes to the late Senator John McCain of Arizona, a Republican to be sure but one with many friends across the aisle.This notion of Senate decorum was visible at times in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing a week ago, primarily in exchanges between the two most senior members of each party ñ a quartet that has served a combined century-and-a-half in the Senate. Even in anger they spoke to each other in a familiar, almost familial manner. Such courtliness was not shared by most of the rest of the committee on either side.When the Senate convenes to vote on Kavanaugh, which style will predominate? And when the Senate returns to business after these tense midterm elections, what atmosphere will prevail?On what of the new session of the court with Kavanaugh installed? Older notions of institutional dignity and balance have been, if anything, even more powerful on what we so often call  the highest court in the land.  (Those last three words, faintly antique, suggest again that poetic-mythic quality emanating from these institutions.)In this conception of the Senate and Supreme Court, one often cited that old adage about politics making strange bedfellows. It was apt, and often applied to positive and productive things that happened.Relationships beyond party made possible the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The historic breakthrough relied as much on Republicans as Democrats, as the latter party s Southern  Dixiecrat  wing was adamantly opposed to the legislation.That was still the case 20 years later when Republicans and Democrats in the Senate worked together on a tax overhaul both could applaud. They overcame the more fractious folks from the House and gave President Reagan a bill he could happily sign into law. All that actually happened.And four years after that, Republican President George H. W. Bush worked with a Democratic Congress to slim the federal deficit by raising taxes (as well as reducing some forms of spending). That budget deal, and other similarly bipartisan budgets hammered out in the 1990s, actually managed to bring federal revenues and outlays into rough balance by the end of the decade. (It didn t last, but that was largely because one party took control thereafter and pressed its own fiscal agenda.)The Senate in those times was scarcely a love fest, but individual Democrats and Republicans typically had friends ñ even really good ones   in both camps.Something like this spirit has characterized the Supreme Court, at least in the popular imagination. We had the friendship of Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsberg, for example. Although at ideological loggerheads, they and other justices shared interests in music and art. The justices were known to spend social time together, as did their clerks.Here again, the institutions and their denizens had an interest in promoting this kinder, gentler image. It surely served their own self-concepts of superiority. But it also helped them fulfill their functions and maintain a higher degree of public respect for them and their work product.Perhaps the quickening of the pace of life, the endless siege of media attention, the coarsening of our political discourse and the deepening of divisions between the parties and the regions of the country have simply made that pleasant illusion too difficult to sustain.Surely the tensions brought out by the clash over Kavanaugh are testament to this. And not least in these considerations is the confrontation of two powerful movements ñ the emergent #MeToo and the ascendant Federalist Society ñ whose energies collided so dramatically with the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford.Friday s vote to advance Kavanaugh s nomination to its final phase falls precisely on #MeToo s birthday, the anniversary of the New York Times expose of Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.In the intervening twelve months, more than a dozen men in pinnacle positions in entertainment, news and business have been toppled by credible accusations of sexual harassment, abuse or assault. Inspired by these examples, women have come forward to tell their stories in countless organizations, workplaces and institutions.But in this latest high-profile confrontation, this impressive movement collides with another that has also been enormously transformative. That is the four-decade effort to remake the federal judiciary in accordance with more conservative ideas of legal policy and constitutional interpretation.As one appeal for donations from one longtime conservative group spelled it out Thursday night:  This is the moment we ve been waiting for now for half a century... That effort has largely been organized and driven by the Federalist Society (formally the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies), founded by law students and legal scholars at Yale and the University of Chicago in 1982.But even before the Society took form, conservatives and libertarians were talking about the need to restock the federal courts with judges who would read laws as literally as possible and not be tempted to use their power to redress perceived wrongs or bring about social change. The terms originalism and textualism came into common usage.The critique of  activist judges  had begun many years earlier, of course, after the landmark decisions of the high court under Chief Justice Earl Warren. Those included Brown vs. Board of Education, mandating desegregation of public schools, and Baker v. Carr, establishing the principle of one-person-one-vote in drawing election maps. The Warren Court also ruled against prayer in public schools and underscored the rights of criminal suspects.But perhaps the most explosive decision from the court came after a new Chief Justice, Warren Burger, took over in 1969. Appointed by President Richard Nixon, Burger was presumed to be about reversing the court s liberal drift. But in the 1973, he sided with the majority in the Roe v. Wade decision, when the court voted 7-2 to legalize abortion in all 50 states.Unlike the reaction to other Supreme Court bombshells before and since, the pushback against Roe did not subside over time. If anything, it grew. By 1980, with the election of President Ronald Reagan, opposition to Roe had become a focal point for most Republican candidates. As time passed, the party platform became ever-more definitively anti-abortion, while Republicans who favored abortion rights were increasingly rare. And the Federalist Society became a force in its own right.When President Trump was running in 2016, he repeatedly pledged to appoint only justices whose commitment to overturning Roe was clear. He campaigned on a pledge to choose only from a list of prospective nominees presented by the Federalist Society.He has since done exactly that with his appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch (who was confirmed with all Republicans and three Democrats voting aye), and Kavanaugh.The last two previous appointees of a Republican president, John Roberts and Samuel Alito, were also Federalist Society alumni, along with 1991 appointee Clarence Thomas. So Kavanaugh would complete the court s first Federalist Society majority.The Federalist Society is about restoring a set of values from the past and defending settled arrangements. The #MeToo movement is about challenging such values and renegotiating such arrangements.Whatever happens to Kavanaugh, or the comity of this Senate and this Court, that larger struggle will be with us all for the foreseeable future."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/05/654552328/senate-to-take-decisive-vote-on-kavanaugh-amid-protest-from-democrats,"Updated at 8:41 p.m. ET Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate on Friday, and his confirmation now seems all but certain,  after a key swing vote, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, declared her support in a speech on the Senate floor.Moments after Collins completed her remarks, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced in a statement that he too will support the nomination when it comes up for a final vote.That final vote is expected as soon as Saturday. In a much anticipated speech, Collins said that she believed that Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers more than 30 years ago, was a survivor of sexual assault. Still, Collins said, the allegations  fail to meet the  more likely than not  standard,  and  I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court. Speaking to NPR after Collins and Manchin announced their support for Kavanaugh, a lawyer for Ford addressed whether the California professor feels she failed because confirmation is now a near certainty.  Dr. Ford s goal here was never to impact the process to derail a nomination,  attorney Lisa Banks said on All Things Considered.  What she was trying to do was what she thought was the right thing to do as a citizen, which is to provide the information to the U.S. Senate so they could make the most informed decision possible. Her goal wasn t to derail this nomination, it was to inform the nomination and she s done that.   Earlier Friday Collins was part of the majority that voted 51-49 to end debate. President Trump tweeted after the procedural vote that he was  very proud  of the Senate for taking the critical step.One Democrat, Manchin, voted with Republicans to end debate and move the nomination forward. One Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, voted with Democrats against ending debate.In a speech on the Senate floor Saturday night, hours after the support of Collins and Manchin made it clear Kavanaugh was all but certain to be confirmed, Murkowski announced she will oppose the nomination when it comes up for a final vote. But as a courtesy to another GOP senator whose daughter is getting married far from D.C. Saturday, Murkowski also said she will ask that she be recorded as  present  in Saturday s vote. The Alaska Republican noted that being recorded as  present  would not change the outcome. In a speech leading up to the vote, Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said  the resistance is located right here on Capitol Hill  and urged his colleagues to  say no to mob rule  by voting to confirm Kavanaugh.The top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, said Republicans have  largely chosen to ignore the testimony  of Ford.Murkowski and Collins sat quietly and undisturbed at their adjacent desks as a clerk called the roll.They sat near the aisle separating senators from both parties   an almost symbolic placement that reflected how the two moderate Republicans were considering crossing the aisle to join with Democratic colleagues to oppose Kavanaugh. Midway through the vote, as stoic, stone-faced senators sat speechless around them, Collins and Murkowski began an animated conversation in hushed tones. Both nodded eagerly in agreement with the other. But when all the votes were cast, ultimately Murkowski voted no and Collins voted yes. It was a surprise to Grassley, who told reporters he didn t realize the Alaska Republican would vote no until she cast her vote. Trump, in a tweet Friday morning, criticized what he termed  the very rude elevator screamers,  who he said are  paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad!  Without evidence, he alleged that the protesters, several of whom said they have been sexual assault victims, were  paid by [financier George] Soros and others. Senators had one day to review a confidential supplemental background check into Kavanaugh s behavior in the early- to mid-1980s when he was in high school and college. The closely guarded collection of interviews is celebrated by Republican leaders as concrete proof that Kavanaugh did not harass or abuse women. Democrats say the interviews, which they originally requested, are incomplete and inconclusive.The FBI report did little to alleviate a bitter partisan fight over Kavanaugh s nomination. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced Thursday that the Senate would proceed anyway with the Friday procedural vote. What we know for sure is the FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh,  McConnell said.  The second thing we know for sure is that there s no way anything we did would satisfy the Democrats. Kavanaugh took an unusual step to boost his nomination Thursday evening, writing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal expressing regret for the heated tone of his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, including comments decrying Democratic attacks that were seen by some wavering senators as too partisan.  I was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times. I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said,  Kavanaugh wrote. The White House defended Kavanaugh s demeanor during the hearings. Any human being who has been falsely accused of a range of things including gang rape has a right to be upset, has a right to be angry, and that s what we saw last week,  said White House spokesperson Kerri Kupec during an interview with Morning Edition.McConnell received the 51 votes needed to clear the procedural hurdle on Friday. Republicans have enough votes to ensure Kavanaugh s nomination in the vote expected Saturday, now that Collins and Manchin have announced their intention to support the judge. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., is a reportedly a yes on the nomination, barring a major development. Collins, Murkowski and Flake spent hours in a secure room in the basement of the Capitol on Thursday reviewing the roughly 45 pages of FBI interviews. Collins and Flake both said the investigation was thorough.Flake forced Republicans to launch the additional investigation last week after a tense negotiation with Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats. Flake spent a large portion of the afternoon reviewing the FBI work and said he saw no new evidence to corroborate any of the claims against Kavanaugh, which Flake had previously indicated would mean he will vote to confirm.Democrats saw something very different in the report. Several criticized Republicans for limiting the FBI investigation to just nine interviews. They said the process ignored many potential witnesses, including Ford.The FBI also apparently did not interview Kavanaugh. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said those issues raised serious doubts about Kavanaugh and his qualifications.  Judge Kavanaugh stated at his hearing that the individuals at the incident involving Dr. Ford refuted her version of events,  Schumer said Thursday.  From their own public statements, we knew that to be false, and nothing in this report changes that. Similar concerns moved Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., to announce Thursday that she would oppose Kavanaugh. Heitkamp is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot in November and has seen her poll numbers slip in recent weeks. She is running for re-election in a state that Trump won in 2016 by more than 35 points.Heitkamp said she was troubled by Kavanaugh s aggressive appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the message his confirmation would send to women and girls across the country.  When considering a lifetime appointment to Supreme Court, we must evaluate the totality of the circumstances and record before us,  Heitkamp said in a statement.  In addition to the concerns about his past conduct, last Thursday s hearing called into question Judge Kavanaugh s current temperament, honesty, and impartiality. "
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/05/654347194/trump-pushes-due-process-for-some-for-others-lock-them-up,"President Trump says the fight over his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, is about more than just the nation s highest court. He says it s about how America treats the accused.Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual misconduct decades ago, allegations he adamantly denies.Trump tweeted Thursday that  Due Process, Fairness and Common Sense are now on trial! Central Park Five caseBut Trump has not always been such a staunch defender of due process.In one infamous case in 1989, Trump actually took the opposite approach.That year, a woman jogging in New York s Central Park was brutally beaten and raped.Five black and Latino teenagers, known as the Central Park Five, were charged with the crime.Before they were brought to trial, Trump took out full-page ads calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty in the state. The ads called for the city government to  unshackle  law enforcement officers from concerns about  police brutality.  The problem with our society is the victim has absolutely no rights and the criminal has unbelievable rights   unbelievable rights,  Trump told Larry King in a CNN interview in 1989 discussing the ads.Years later, the five men were exonerated by DNA evidence, and another man confessed to the crime. The five reached a settlement with the city in 2014 for $41 million.Trump decried the settlement in an op-ed in the New York Daily News, saying it was a  disgrace  and that the wrongfully convicted men were not  angels  in the past.Yusef Salaam, one of the Central Park Five, told MSNBC in 2016 that Trump owed them an apology, but he didn t expect to get it. This thing that he did to us, calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty, I always think if this had been the 1950s, we would have become modern-day Emmett Tills,  Salaam said, referring to the 14-year-old African-American boy lynched in Mississippi in 1955. Lock her up Trump has continued his selective support for due process as president.Even with the 2016 election long over, he still presides over campaign rallies where crowds chant  lock her up,  referring to his onetime rival Hillary Clinton. It s deeply troubling to read the president s pattern of comments about people presuming their guilt, particularly people that are under investigation by his government,  said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.Trump has targeted numerous current and former government officials, from former FBI Director James Comey to Justice Department employee Bruce Ohr, accusing them of breaking the law.The president has repeatedly said special counsel Robert Mueller should be investigating Democrats and those he seems to consider opponents. If he was doing an honest report, he d write it on the other side,  Trump told reporters in August.  Because when you look at criminality, and you look at problems, take a look at what they did, including colluding with the Russians   the other side. Even as the head of the executive branch, Trump still seems to behave as if he is outside of law enforcement, Turley said. That s a very flawed concept, because he s not just anyone. He is the president, these FBI agents ultimately report to the director of the FBI, who ultimately reports to him,  he added.Not a legal matterAlthough Trump has invoked due process when it comes to Kavanaugh, the Senate confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee is not the same as a court case. There is no legal due process, it is an entirely political proceeding,  said Clark Neily, vice president for criminal justice at the Cato Institute.Neily said that does not mean the Senate should not strive for a  moral fairness  to maintain institutional credibility.Asked by NPR about Trump s support for due process in light of his history with the Central Park Five and  lock her up  chants, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president. He is simply stating the fact that we are a country of law and order, we are a country that still believes that you re innocent until proven guilty and we want to see that process go through in its entirety,  Sanders said.But, Neily argued, Trump has applied those principles unevenly, depending on who is accused. He occupies the bully pulpit and he is in a position to remind Americans that we are a rule-of-law nation ... he s consistently failed to do that unless it s in the service of people or objectives he personally cares about,  he said."

Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse   where Kavanaugh serves as a federal appellate court judge   and then marched to the steps of the Supreme Court building less than a mile away. All the while they carried signs and shouted slogans rejecting President Trump s nominee, who has been the subject of several sexual misconduct allegations in recent weeks.There, on the steps of the Supreme Court, a series of speakers drove home their central theme:  We believe survivors. The U.S. Capitol Police said 302 people were charged with demonstrating unlawfully in two Senate office buildings.The protest comes precisely a week after Kavanaugh and one of his accusers, Christine Blasey Ford, delivered dueling testimonies to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ford alleges that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while the two were in high school in the 1980s. Kavanaugh, for his part, flatly denies the allegation, and he has the backing of Trump and dozens of GOP senators.The protest also comes the same day that senators reviewed the FBI inquiry into the accusation, an inquiry that Democrats have rejected as too limited. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey had some particularly harsh words for it   including one we can t use here.As this political drama unfolded among senators, the protesters made their way into the Hart Senate Office Building s atrium.  Hey, hey, ho, ho   Kavanaugh has got to go,  the black-clad demonstrators shouted in the cavernous central area, circled by police officers.Those officers eventually detained a number of those protesters and led them out of the building, while some Senate staffers watched from the hallways above them.Others gathered in the offices of Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, whose votes are likely to be decisive when it comes to Kavanaugh s future. The moderate senators are two of just a handful of politicians who have not yet announced whether they will be voting for or against his confirmation.Sarra Khlifi of Anchorage, Alaska, was among the protesters who made the trek to D.C. to lobby Murkowski, her state s senior senator. Khlifi told Alaska Public Media s Liz Ruskin that she took the American Civil Liberties Union up on its offer to fly women to the nation s capital. Several others joined Khlifi on her trip.

Ford s attorneys said on Wednesday that although she wanted to talk with investigators and had materials to give them, Ford had not spoken to the FBI.Another person who evidently did not talk with the FBI was Kavanaugh himself. NPR has confirmed the identities of six people whom the FBI interviewed as part of its investigation:It wasn t immediately clear who the three other people might be. A number of Kavanaugh s former high school or college classmates have come forward to describe his conduct from their youth, including a North Carolina State University professor, Chad Ludington. But there were no indications on Thursday morning as to whether the FBI might have talked with him or the other former classmates, or with people recommended by other witnesses whose names aren t public.A third woman who has leveled allegations against Kavanaugh and Judge, Julie Swetnick, evidently was never contacted by the FBI, according to her attorney.Ramirez s attorney also said on Thursday that she had given investigators the names of a number of people from her college days who she said could corroborate allegations she has made against Kavanaugh. The FBI apparently did not speak with any of them.That isn t clear, but it s expected to be the basis for the next political fight in this story. The White House had said it wasn t imposing any restrictions on the FBI. That may have been the case, but it also may have imposed restrictions requested by Senate Republicans. The Senate set the scope of the investigation,  as White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters on Thursday. Democrats argued that the findings of the FBI are therefore invalid, because investigators weren t permitted the time or authority to pursue the case fully. The most notable part of this report is what s not in it,  said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.Republicans say that Kavanaugh has been vetted more than enough   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said on Thursday morning that it s time to move on. I ve now received a committee staff briefing on the FBI s supplement to Judge Kavanaugh s background investigation file,  he said.  There s nothing in it that we didn t already know. These uncorroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by Judge Kavanaugh, and neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations.

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/04/654187465/kavanaugh-nomination-battle-is-fought-with-millions-in-secret-cash,"Advocacy groups are ratcheting up the war over Judge Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court nomination, shedding the last vestiges of a high-minded issues debate in favor of more acidic attacks on character and motives.The attacks are fueled by the allegation, now being investigated by the FBI, that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted a girl while in prep school. And now they re further stoked by Kavanaugh s opening statement at last week s Senate Judiciary Committee meeting. This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit,  he told the committee. He said it was funded with  millions of dollars in money from outside, left-wing opposition groups. Since July, when President Trump nominated Kavanaugh, the warring advocacy groups have spent some $10 million on TV ads either assailing or praising him.Advocacy organizations on both sides are able to keep donors  contributions secret. But spending on TV advertisements must be disclosed to the Federal Communications Commission, and by that measure, the conservative groups are spending more than the liberals.The sharpest attack so far may come from the American Civil Liberties Union, which abandoned its policy of not endorsing or attacking candidates in order to challenge Kavanaugh. The ad uses quick edits to tie Kavanaugh to President Bill Clinton, who was impeached for lying about his Oval Office affair with Monica Lewinsky, and comedian Bill Cosby, now in prison for sexual assault.The ACLU introduced the ad this week, with a million-dollar ad buy in Alaska, Colorado, Nebraska and West Virginia, the home states of two undecided senators   Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.   and two whom the ACLU hopes to sway   Republicans Cory Gardner of Colorado and Deb Fischer of Nebraska.The conservative Judicial Crisis Network almost simultaneously launched an ad saying,  The liberal mob and their media allies tried to ruin a good man with smears,  while Kavanaugh  fought back, clearing his name. The spot is running in West Virginia and North Dakota, home of Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who, along with Manchin and Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., is both uncommitted on Kavanaugh and seeking re-election next month. A little over $4 million has been spent running ads in just those states,  said Douglas Keith of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University law school. The center has been tracking TV ad spending on the Kavanaugh nomination.Keith said there is another $2 million being spent in Maine, home of undecided Republican Sen. Susan Collins, and about $500,000 to reach Murkowski in Alaska. He noted that none of the targeted states have high-cost media markets. Especially when you re looking at states like North Dakota and Alaska,  Keith said,  this is really an incredible amount of spending. "
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/04/653991555/senators-reviewing-fbi-report-on-kavanaugh-ahead-of-friday-vote,"Updated at 10:12 p.m. ETJudge Brett Kavanaugh issued a mea culpa of sorts on the eve of a key Senate vote that could determine whether or not he reaches the Supreme Court, admitting in an op-ed that his testimony last week forcefully defending himself from sexual assault allegations  might have been too emotional at times.   I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said. I hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son, husband and dad. I testified with five people foremost in my mind: my mom, my dad, my wife, and most of all my daughters,  Kavanaugh wrote Thursday evening in the op-ed published online by Wall Street Journal. Last Thursday in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Blasey Ford said Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her while the two were in high school more than three decades ago. Speaking after Ford, Kavanaugh angrily and tearfully denied ever committing any sexual misconduct, but he acknowledged that there had been times when he had too much to drink as a high school and college student. And Kavanaugh had also cast the allegations against him in boldly partisan terms, saying that the multiple accusations were a  calculated and orchestrated political hit  that was  fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election... and revenge on behalf of the Clintons.  Those sharp words had led many Democratic senators, along with other political and legal observers, to conclude he didn t have the right temperament to sit on the nation s highest court   an impression Kavanaugh sought to address in the op-ed.  Going forward, you can count on me to be the same kind of judge and person I have been for my entire 28-year legal career: hardworking, even-keeled, open-minded, independent and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good,  Kavanaugh writes, recalling how in his speech upon his nomination by President Trump in July he said that  a good judge must be an umpire a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no political party, litigant or policy.   I revere the Constitution. I believe that an independent and impartial judiciary is essential to our constitutional republic. If confirmed by the Senate to serve on the Supreme Court, I will keep an open mind in every case and always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law,  Kavanaugh promises in concluding his op-ed.That pledge of neutrality seems centrally aimed at wooing key Republican senators who have been withholding judgment on Kavanaugh s nomination. But Democrats quickly pushed back that it wasn t enough.  That testimony was written, carefully prepared, planned, premeditated   not some emotional outburst,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee said on CNN. The Palm Beach Post also reported earlier Thursday that retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens told a group of retirees that there was  merit  to criticism that Kavanaugh  has demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential [litigation] before the court that he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities. Before Kavanaugh s op-ed on Thursday, critical undecided senators had signaled that the supplemental inquiry by the FBI into those allegations had been  thorough.  While not announcing how they would vote, they did not signal further reservations about Kavanaugh. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters after reviewing the report,  It appears to be a very thorough investigation, but I am going back later today to personally read the interviews.  Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who insisted on the further investigation before allowing Kavanaugh s nomination to advance out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also said the report was thorough and indicated that no new evidence had emerged to corroborate the claims against Kavanaugh. Their votes are seen as decisive, along with that of GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. When the agreement to have the FBI do an additional background check on the Supreme Court nominee was reached last week, Flake indicated that he would vote in support of Kavanaugh absent new information. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin is also undecided. Two other undecided senators declared their intentions on Thursday. Tennessee Republican Bob Corker, a Trump critic who is retiring, announced he would vote for Kavanaugh. North Dakota Democrat Heiki Heitkamp, facing a tough re-election battle in a conservative state, announced she would oppose the nomination in an interview with WDAY, a television station in Fargo. Senators   and a few Republican and Democratic aides with proper clearances   are allowed to read a single copy of the FBI report in a secure room at the Capitol in alternating one-hour shifts.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, was one of the senators who said she reviewed the material.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said that regardless of the findings of the FBI investigation, the Senate will vote this week on whether to end debate on Kavanaugh. That is expected Friday morning.If that vote passes and the Senate agrees to close the discussion about Kavanaugh, it starts a 30-hour clock that would end with another vote on whether he should take the open seat on the Supreme Court. That final vote is expected to take place sometime over the weekend. Both votes need a simple majority to pass. The chamber is sharply divided so Republicans need as much support as they can get, but it isn t yet clear how many senators will vote for Kavanaugh.At a rally Thursday evening in Minnesota, Trump expressed confidence that Kavanaugh would still be confirmed, calling him an  incredible intellect, an incredible person and an incredible talent.  The crowd broke out into cheers of   We want Kavanaugh!  and  Vote him in! Trump didn t mock Ford s testimony   as he had at a rally Tuesday night   but did argue Democrats were beginning to see negative political ramifications from the protracted fight over Kavanaugh, especially in the battle for the Senate. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll this week found that Democrats  enthusiasm gap just ahead of the midterms had evaporated while once dormant GOP engagement was surging. Trump seemed to reference that poll and others that had similar findings in a tweet earlier on Thursday, and then told the crowd that Democrats would pay for their obstruction at the polls.  All you have to do is look at the polls over the last three or four days and it shows that [Democrats ] rage-fueled resistance is starting to backfire at a level that nobody s ever seen before,  Trump told the Minnesota crowd. Three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct decades ago, allegations he has strongly and emotionally denied.Those allegations have drawn out Kavanaugh s nomination process, which a few weeks ago seemed on course for a swift confirmation. Under the agreement that paused action on the nomination, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to recommend Kavanaugh s nomination to the full chamber on the condition that the FBI get seven days to look into the misconduct charges.Special agents have been at work since then, talking with people in the case. A White House official confirmed that the FBI had interviewed nine people. The official, who asked not to be identified, declined to name the people, saying that background investigations are confidential.NPR has confirmed six people whom the FBI interviewed as part of its investigation: Kavanaugh s high school friends P.J. Smyth, Mark Judge, Tim Gaudette and Chris Garrett; Ford s friend Leland Keyser; and a second Kavanaugh accuser, Deborah Ramirez.Ford, who is a professor in California, was not interviewed by the FBI, her lawyers say. Kavanaugh had not been questioned either, Feinstein said.Ramirez provided a list of around 20 names to the FBI of people who she says either witnessed Kavanaugh s alleged sexual misconduct or heard about it contemporaneously. Her legal team says the FBI did not contact those individuals.The FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.Partisan dispute over the inquiryThe scope of the investigation has become the latest political battle in the larger war over Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court. Democrats have accused Republicans and the White House of putting extreme limits on the FBI s work.  This looks to be the product of an incomplete investigation, I don t know,  Feinstein told reporters on Thursday morning.GOP lawmakers and the administration say the FBI was empowered to look at all  credible  allegations against Kavanaugh.It remains unclear what specific parameters the White House put on the investigation   whether, for example, it may have established any restrictions of its own or whether it simply applied those from Senate Republicans in making the assignment to the FBI.In other words, the question is whether the White House went along with establishing guardrails for the FBI that were set by McConnell even if no White House official set them.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., complained to reporters that he thought the whole process involved with the vetting of Kavanaugh had been  greatly constrained. The Senate majority leader, McConnell, rejected that, along with all the allegations against Kavanaugh in a speech on Thursday morning. He and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said that the FBI has established that Kavanaugh has been telling the truth all along and that the time has come to install him on the high court. Fundamentally, we senators ought to wipe away the muck from all the mudslinging and politics and look at this nomination with clear eyes,  Grassley said.  Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified nominees to ever come before the Senate. Battle royalFederal judges are at the heart of the political strategy pursued for years by McConnell and President Trump, and the stakes are never higher than when they involve a vacancy on the Supreme Court.So Republicans eagerly want to confirm Kavanaugh and need every vote they can get in a closely divided Senate chamber. That is why when Flake suggested the price for his support might be the weeklong pause to permit an investigation, Republican leaders had no choice but to agree.Democrats not only oppose Kavanaugh, but they also remain deeply embittered by the experience that closed out the tenure of President Barack Obama, when McConnell refused to schedule a vote on Obama s nominee for a Supreme Court vacancy that Trump eventually got to fill.Accordingly, the war over Kavanaugh was always going to be caustic and protracted even before sexual assault allegations surfaced against him. But they escalated the drama to another level by involving the ongoing national reckoning over sexual assault and the #MeToo movement.The accusersIn her congressional hearing last week, Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when he was drunk at a small social gathering during summer vacation when they were in high school.Ramirez, who is a former classmate of Kavanaugh s at Yale, said Kavanaugh drunkenly exposed himself. And a third women, Julie Swetnick, has said she was raped at a party that Kavanaugh attended with his boyhood friend Mark Judge. It was one of a number of parties at which Swetnick says girls were targeted with alcohol for sexual abuse or rape.Kavanaugh angrily and tearfully denied ever committing any sexual misconduct, but he acknowledged to the Judiciary Committee that there had been times when he had too much to drink as a high school and college student.The picture that has formed of him since then in the press has been of a hard-partying prep school athlete and Yale frat boy. Kavanaugh s former classmates say they saw him so drunk so often they hold open the possibility that he might have blacked out during his high school and college days.Complicating matters further is the presence of attorney Michael Avenatti, who is representing Swetnick. He is avowedly anti-Trump and has been a foe of the White House since filing a lawsuit against the president on behalf of adult film actress Stormy Daniels.Trump and Judiciary Committee Republicans have singled out Avenatti over his past work targeting the president and also argued that Swetnick is not a credible accuser."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/03/654054108/poll-more-believe-ford-than-kavanaugh-a-cultural-shift-from-1991,"After a day of wrenching testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford   who has accused him of sexual assault in high school   more Americans say they believe Ford s account over Kavanaugh s denials, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Wednesday.In choosing who is telling the truth, 45 percent said Ford is, up from 32 percent ahead of her Sept. 27 testimony. A third (33 percent) said Kavanaugh is the one telling the truth, up slightly from 26 percent before he testified but not as much of a rise as for Ford. The daylong hearing appears to have been influential in helping people decide who was telling the truth. Before the hearing, 42 percent said they were unsure whom to believe. Now, just 22 percent are unsure.The results represent a shift from 1991, when more people said they believed then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas over Anita Hill. Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment in the workplace. A 1991 CBS/New York Times poll, also conducted days after their dramatic, televised Capitol Hill testimonies, found that 58 percent believed Thomas more, as opposed to just 24 percent who said Hill.  If it remains  he said, she said,  the benefit of the doubt is very different than 1991, and it goes to Ford not Kavanaugh,  said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll.  It shows the reaction to the testimony and does show an underlying change in attitude than 27 years ago. Yet Republicans are pushing forward with Kavanaugh s nomination, seeing enthusiasm among the GOP base rising dramatically in the midst of the Kavanaugh controversy. Even President Trump, after days of calling Ford  credible,  changed his tune and mocked Ford at her during a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night, a day after the poll was conducted. Thirty-six years ago, this happened,  Trump said.    I had one beer.  Right?  I had one beer.  How did you get home?  I don t remember.  How d you get there?  I don t remember.  Where is the place?  I don t remember.  How many years ago was it?  I don t know. I don t know. I don t know. I don t know.  What neighborhood was it in?  I don t know.  Where s the house?  I don t know.  Upstairs, downstairs, where was it?  I don t know. But I had one beer. That s the only thing I remember.   The crowd applauded wildly, as the president s ridicule grew. Ford, in her testimony, offered more detail than the president noted.With just over a month to go until the consequential midterm elections across the country that will determine who controls Congress, Republicans are gambling that several of the key groups leaning toward Democrats   young people, Latinos and independents   won t show up in big numbers at the polls.But those who said November s elections are  very important  oppose Kavanaugh s nomination 51 percent to 44 percent.Americans are hotly divided by party on whom to believe. Yes, there is a big gender gap. Men are split on whom they believe: 39 percent say Kavanaugh, 37 percent say Ford. Women, on the other hand, are far more on Ford s side: 52 percent believe her, 27 percent say Kavanaugh.But that gap disappears when looking at it by party ñ 80 percent of Democratic men believe Ford as do 74 percent of Democratic women. Among Republicans, 77 percent of men believe Kavanaugh, as do 73 percent of women.Where there is a difference by gender is among independents. Independent men are split 39 percent to 35 percent, siding slightly more with Ford, while a solid majority of women believe Ford, 56 percent to 24 percent. Partisanship is really the driving force,  Miringoff noted, pointing out that partisanship is the  most dominant  force  in dividing public opinion. That would make sense considering how partisan a performance Kavanaugh turned in during his testimony, deriding Democrats  conduct as an  embarrassment  and dismissing the movement against him as  revenge on behalf of the Clintons. That was enough to rally Republicans and Trump to his side, but not the public overall.Nearly half of Americans say they oppose Kavanaugh s nomination   48 percent compared with 41 percent who support it. Before his testimony, 43 percent opposed his nomination and 38 percent supported it. Overall, by a 40 percent to 31 percent margin, more voters say they are likely to vote for a candidate in these midterm elections who opposes Kavanaugh. About a quarter of voters said it makes no difference to their vote.The FBI is conducting a supplemental investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh that is expected to be wrapped up by the end of the week. If there is still a doubt about whether the allegations against Kavanaugh are true after the investigation is complete, Americans say he should not be confirmed to the Supreme Court by a 52 percent to 40 percent margin.That is also a big difference from 1991. Back then, the same CBS/New York Times poll found that 56 percent thought Thomas should be confirmed, even if doubt still existed.But one group does still think he should be confirmed if doubt exists: 77 percent of Republicans say so, which helps explain the bitter battle being waged to confirm Kavanaugh.The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll was conducted Monday and is based on interviews with 1,183 adults, including 996 registered voters. Among questions of adults, there is a margin of error of 3.8 percentage points; for registered voters, it is 4.2 percentage points."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/03/654015874/poll-amid-kavanaugh-confirmation-battle-democratic-enthusiasm-edge-evaporates,"Just over a month away from critical elections across the country, the wide Democratic enthusiasm advantage that has defined the 2018 campaign up to this point has disappeared, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.In July, there was a 10-point gap between the number of Democrats and Republicans saying the November elections were  very important.  Now, that is down to 2 points, a statistical tie.Don t see the graphic above? Click here.Democrats  advantage on which party s candidate they are more likely to support has also been cut in half since last month. Democrats still retain a 6-point edge on that question, but it was 12 points after a Marist poll conducted in mid-September.The results come amid the pitched and hotly partisan confirmation battle over Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court. Multiple women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct when he was in high school and college. He categorically denies all the allegations. The FBI is conducting a supplemental investigation into the accusations that is expected to be wrapped up by the end of this week.With Democrats already fired up for this election, the Kavanaugh confirmation fight has apparently had the effect of rousing a dormant GOP base. The result of hearings, at least in the short run, is the Republican base was awakened,  noted Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll.While Democrats and Republicans are now equally enthusiastic about the midterms, the story is very different for key Democratic base groups and independents. While 82 percent of Democrats say the midterms are very important, that s true of just 60 percent of people under 30, 61 percent of Latinos and 65 percent of independents.Democrats need to net 23 seats to take back control of the House, but if those groups stay home in large numbers, it would blunt potential Democratic gains. With 34 days to go until Election Day, it all points to another election dominated by party activists. If there aren t 34 dramatic moments [between now and then], it will be  my base versus your base,    Miringoff said. He noted that the Republican move to push Kavanaugh s confirmation forward, despite his unpopularity and that more people believe accuser Christine Blasey Ford than Kavanaugh, appears to be intended to fire up the GOP base in hopes of retaining control of Congress. The Republicans  approach has been, and continues to be, all about the base,  Miringoff said.  This is their M.O., and that s what we re seeing. That works if turnout is not high. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll was conducted Monday. These questions were asked of 996 registered voters and has a margin of error of 4.2 percentage points."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/03/653954063/trump-inflames-tensions-over-kavanaughs-nomination-after-mocking-accuser,"Updated at 7:51 a.m. ET on ThursdayThe FBI s highly anticipated supplemental background check on Brett Kavanaugh was sent to the White House and Capitol Hill overnight, with senators set to review the report on Thursday in the final chapter of what has become a deeply acrimonious confirmation battle.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the planned arrival of the report on Wednesday night and said all senators would get a chance to review it ahead of the next procedural milestones in the chamber.Only one copy is being made available to senators and their aides.Senators ñ and a limited number of Republican and Democratic staff members with the requisite security clearances   will be allowed to read the report in a secure room at the Capitol in alternating one-hour shifts, according to congressional sources.The schedule is expected to start with GOP staff slated for the first period between 8 ñ 9 a.m on Thursday, then Democrats from 9 ñ 10 a.m.Senators may be able to discuss what s in the document but it isn t clear whether a copy of the full report, or a redacted version, might become public, or if so, when.Meanwhile, McConnell said he has started the clock running toward the finale of the Kavanaugh saga.The Senate could vote to end debate on the nomination in the early hours of Friday morning. If senators vote to close the debate, that would start another clock ticking toward a final vote on whether to put Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court.Shortly after 1 a.m. ET Thursday, spokesman Raj Shah announced that the White House had received the FBI s supplemental background check and urged the Senate to act. The report was ordered by the president at the request of the Senate. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, announced that the report had been received by the committee just after 3 a.m. ET, defending the process to vet Kavanaugh. The margin of support within the bitterly divided Senate is understood to be close. Republicans need every vote they can get to install Kavanaugh, which is why the stakes are so high for whatever is contained in the FBI report.Another political battle on Thursday may take place even before any procedural action. According to the latest indications on Wednesday evening, the FBI had not interviewed two of the key players in the Kavanaugh saga: the nominee himself or his first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford.Ford s attorney said on Wednesday afternoon that she still wished to talk with FBI investigators but hadn t, and told Grassley that Ford had supplemental documents to give the FBI.Democrats are expected to cry foul about an investigation that omits Ford and Kavanaugh; Republicans may take the position that they ve already talked extensively with the Senate and the public in their open hearing last week.Republicans also accuse Democrats of trying anything to damage Kavanaugh and delay his confirmation. Five days of public hearings. Sixty-five private meetings with Senators. More than 1,200 responses to written questions from members,  McConnell said.  More than 500,000 pages of documents for review   the most produced for any Supreme Court nomination in history. And the 300-plus opinions Judge Kavanaugh has issued during his 12 years on the D.C. Circuit. Now, the majority leader said, it is time for the Senate to move forward.Trump mocks accuserThe FBI report was due to senators following a day on which President Trump added fresh animosity to the already tense debate over Kavanaugh with new comments that mocked the sexual misconduct allegations against his Supreme Court nominee.Trump risked alienating key undecided senators when he derided the testimony given by Ford, the woman who has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s at a high school party.At a rally in Mississippi Tuesday evening, Trump complained about the impact the allegations have had on Kavanaugh and his family and the delay some in his own party pressed for to further investigate the claims.The president also poked fun at Ford s recollection of details about the episode, including how much she drank and where the party was located. What he s going through: 36 years ago, this happened.  I had one beer.  Right?  I had one beer,    Trump said to cheers and laughter from his supporters.  Oh, good. How did you get home?  I don t remember.  How did you get there?  I don t remember.  Where is the place?  I don t remember.  How many years ago was it?  I don t know. I don t know. I don t know.   Three undecided Republican senators criticized the comments Wednesday as unhelpful and distasteful. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, addressed Trump s comments in a brief talk with reporters camped outside her office. The president s comments were just plain wrong,  she said.Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake agreed. There is no time and no place for remarks like that, but to discuss something this sensitive at a political rally is just not right,  Flake said on NBC s Today show.  I wish he hadn t done it and I just say it s kind of appalling. Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski didn t mince words, telling reporters Trump s remarks were  absolutely, wholly inappropriate. Pressed on whether they would impact her vote on Kavanaugh s nomination, Murkowski repeated her admonishment to the president, saying,  I am taking everything into account. I think the president s comments [Tuesday] mocking Dr. Ford were wholly inappropriate, and in my view unacceptable. Partisan divide:  Never seen anything like this Trump s comments come at a time of intense political division in Washington. The Senate has descended into direct partisan attacks and personal animus as the country grapples with serious questions about how to handle allegations of sexual assault.Some lawmakers say they worry the political fight over Kavanaugh s nomination is melding with the broader #MeToo movement in a way that could politicize the discussion of assault in general.Retiring Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., is among those who say the Senate s handling of the allegations against Kavanaugh has created an impression that the issue of sexual assault is itself political. I know a lot about sexual assault and so the thought that we don t care about that is ridiculous,  Corker said.  But that s how it s being portrayed and it s a shame. And actually I m going to say just generally speaking this aggressive effort that s underway is actually hurting the effort. It s not uncommon for partisan battles to intensify this close to a midterm election, but many senators from both parties say the anger over Kavanaugh is approaching a new peak. Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy, the longest-serving current senator, said the mood in the Capitol is among the worst he has seen. I ve been here a long time   under both Republican, Democratic leadership,  Leahy said.  I ve never seen anything like this. I think it diminishes the Senate. We re supposed to be conscience of the nation. We re not acting like that. Leahy, one of the most senior Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, says he worries the fight will have a lasting impact on both the Senate and the courts. It also diminishes the United States Supreme Court,  Leahy said.  It makes it look like a political arm of the White House. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., blamed Democrats for politicizing Kavanaugh s confirmation process and passionately defended Trump s nominee at the confirmation hearing last week.He predicted the Supreme Court nomination process would be forever changed   there would be a  before  Kavanaugh and an  after  Kavanaugh for those seeking federal office or a judicial appointment. I m telling all of my colleagues that this is the most despicable thing I ve seen since I ve been up here,  Graham said.  Woe be unto those who run for office in the future or want to be a judge. There s a lot at stake here. Graham was one of three senators who had their personal information, including cell and home phone numbers and addresses, posted on Wikipedia and recirculated on Twitter. He and other Senate Republicans now travel the halls of the Capitol with a police detail out of fears of violence.Protesters confront senatorsThe fight over Kavanaugh has also sparked passionate debate with voters across the country. Protesters are flooding the halls of Capitol Hill to confront lawmakers, showing up in restaurants where senators are dining and waiting for their planes to land at Washington s airport.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was one of those people met by protesters at the airport on Monday. On Wednesday, he shot back in a speech on the Senate floor about what he called harassment:  We will not be intimidated by these people. He added,  It s time to put this embarrassing spectacle behind us.  And as he has all week, McConnell reiterated his timeline for moving forward:  The Senate will vote on this nomination this week. The protesters are credited with helping influence Flake s decision to call for the supplemental FBI investigation that is currently underway. Ana Maria Archila and Maria Gallagher, two activists opposed to Kavanaugh, approached Flake in an elevator last week, just after he announced that he intended to vote for him.The two asked him to look them in their eyes and they said voting for Kavanaugh  is allowing someone who actually violated a woman to sit on the Supreme Court. This is not tolerable. You have children in your family. Think about them. Soon after, Flake joined Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., in asking for the additional FBI interviews. Flake has given conflicting reports as to how much that conversation influenced his thinking, but many credit the two women for prompting the Arizona Republican to have second thoughts about proceeding to a full Senate vote.Some senators say all is not lost. Retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, was one of several senators who described the Senate as a place that moves on   because it has things to do. We ve always recovered. We always have enough really sincere, decent, honorable people to make these things work,  Hatch said.  And we have plenty of those right now. NPR s Tim Mak contributed to this report."

I think that it s a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of,  Trump said Tuesday afternoon outside the White House.  This is a very difficult time. Kavanaugh s nomination remains in limbo this week, as the FBI looks into allegations of sexual assault made by numerous women. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., vowed again on Tuesday to vote on the nomination by the end of the week, insisting that the results of the FBI inquiry be kept private, for senators only to see.Late last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard from both Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who alleges Kavanaugh drunkenly pinned her down on a bed and groped her against her will at a high school gathering in 1982. Scrutiny has been building this week on Kavanaugh, not only because of the accusations, but because of his testimony at that hearing.A number of Kavanaugh s classmates have publicly said he misrepresented or lied about his drinking habits when he was in school, while he testified under oath in front of the Senate.President Trump said that if Kavanaugh did lie to Congress, then  that would not be acceptable,  but the White House has said the administration does not feel that Kavanaugh lied under oath.At the same time, a backlash to that backlash has begun brewing in conservative circles. Many Republican senators have said they view the accusations and subsequent questions as desperate delay tactics on the part of Democrats. A vote against Kavanaugh is a  yes  vote for more of these despicable tactics being used time and time again in the future,  said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, on the Senate floor Tuesday.President Trump, as well as his family, has raised fears about the possibility of politically motivated false accusations. Trump himself has been accused of a range of sexual misconduct, from harassment to assault. He has denied every accusation. You could be somebody that was perfect their entire life and someone could accuse you of something,  Trump told reporters Tuesday afternoon.  You are truly guilty until proven innocent. And the rally in Southaven, Miss., on Tuesday night, Trump went further. He mocked Ford s testimony, noting she said she could remember how many beers she consumed but couldn t remember details about the location of the house where she says the assault happened or how she got home that night.Trump asked a series of questions, acting out both sides of Ford s congressional testimony to laughs and applause from the crowd. What neighborhood was it in?  I don t know.  Where s the house?  I don t know.  Upstairs, downstairs, where was it?  I don t know but I had one beer, that s the only thing I remember!    Trump said.  And a man s life is in tatters! A man s life is shattered. After Ford s testimony last week, Trump had called her a  very credible witness.  It s a damn sad situation,  Trump told the roaring crowd on Tuesday, after chants of  We want Kavanaugh! We want Kavanaugh!  had quieted. Think of your son,  Trump said.  Think of your husband. Michael R. Bromwich, one of Ford s lawyers, called it a  a vicious, vile and soulless attack  in a post on Twitter.Trump s comments echoed a message his son, Donald Trump Jr., relayed in an interview that aired this week on DailyMailTV. Trump Jr. said he fears more for his sons than for his daughters in the age of #MeToo. I got boys and I got girls, and when I see what s going on right now   it s scary,  Trump Jr. said.  The other problem is for the people that are real victims of these things, when it is so obviously political in cases like this, I think it diminishes the real claims. The idea that people in the U.S. are wrongfully  guilty until proven innocent  is an idea that wasn t manifesting itself politically on the right until last week, GOP pollster Frank Luntz told The Washington Post. In this era of #MeToo, there are a lot of men   and some women   who believe that justice no longer exists in America,  Luntz said.This raises the possibility of conservatives rallying around the Kavanaugh confirmation fight and cutting into the enthusiasm advantage among Democratic women, many of whom were politically activated when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. NPR s Danielle Kurtzleben reported recently on how women have swung further toward the Democrats this year than in elections going back at least two decades.An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from Sept. 23, just a week after the allegations were known, showed interest in the election among white men at 64 percent, higher than in 2010 when Republicans retook the House and 2014 when the GOP took control of the Senate."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/02/653570004/good-and-mad-examines-how-anger-can-be-perilous-for-women,"Following a hearing last week that sought to look into sexual assault allegations brought against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the FBI is investigating further and discussions of assault have been kicked off around the country.For author and New York magazine writer Rebecca Traister, Thursday s contentious hearing highlighted important differences in the way Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who testified to the allegations, told their stories.Traister says Ford s polite and constrained demeanor was in stark contrast to Kavanaugh s use of a full range of expression. He had in his arsenal the ability to use anger, fury, tears in a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people. I don t think that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford   I can t imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room armed with that same weapon, that same tool; that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her,  Traister tells NPR s Rachel Martin.Traister s new book, Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women s Anger, is a deeper exploration of that dynamic. She says the idea for the book came to her just before the 2017 Women s March. She describes a buildup of anger   her own anger, the anger of other women that spilled over from the 2016 election of President Trump, and anger at many of the white women who voted for Trump in that election   as a catalyst for her book.Though the Women s March had a massive turnout and has been followed by  a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal, teacher strikes, women running for office in historic numbers, and then #MeToo,  Traister says the potency of women s anger and activism is still routinely diminished.In an interview with Morning Edition, she discusses why she chose to examine women s anger and how it has been both politically transformative and perilous for women throughout U.S. history.On why women s anger has been historically perceived as threatening Well, in part, that anger of the founding   our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protested in ways that we understand correctly to this is our revolutionary moment. But when they made their new nation, they codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British government. So they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women.On the silencing of women of color in the #MeToo movementI think it s almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long. In fact, it s women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers of so many of our social movements, in ways that have remained invisible to us. So when we think about #MeToo, one of the things that gets lost is that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the  70s by women of color. ...In 1991, it was Anita Hill, whose testimony against Clarence Thomas, claiming that he sexually harassed her, sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment wasn t individual behavior but damage done to a class. It s Tarana Burke, who in 2006 pioneers and leads the #MeToo movement. And then when the #MeToo movement erupts   I think it s really important that we understand that the first people to get attention were very wealthy white actresses. ... I don t say that to diminish the experience or the reality of the harm they sustained. But in fact, all of that is foregrounded by women of color whose stories so often get lost or kind of erased.On why the power of women s anger is not limited to a progressive partisan agendaMy argument is not that women s anger is always righteous. It s that it s very often politically potent and yet we re told not to take it seriously, still. I think that it s the anger that women are feeling across the country that is having a catalytic connective impact. And this is part of a long process   social movements take a long time. The kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh is going to be part of a far longer story that s going to extend deep into our future.Noor Wazwaz and Ashley Brown produced and edited this story for broadcast.

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/02/653560525/dean-at-catholic-university-suspended-for-tweet-about-kavanaugh-accuser,"A dean at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., has been suspended for a tweet that, according to university officials,  demonstrated a lack of sensitivity  to sexual assault survivors.William Rainford, dean of the university s National Catholic School of Social Service, posted the tweet on his official university account last week, one day before Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh made back-to-back appearances before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Rainford references Julie Swetnick, the third woman to come forward with sexual misconduct allegations against the Supreme Court nominee. Swetnick has alleged that she witnessed sexual assault by Kavanaugh during a party and was herself the victim of assault in an incident where Kavanaugh was present. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation.In his position as dean, Rainford oversees the university s undergraduate, graduate and Ph.D. programs in social work.  Swetnick is 55 y/o,  Rainford wrote.  Kavanaugh is 52 y/o. Since when do senior girls hang with freshmen boys? If it happened when Kavanaugh was a senior, Swetnick was an adult drinking with&by her admission, having sex with underage boys. In another universe, he would be victim & she the perp! More than 40 graduate social work students walked out of their classes to protest Rainford s tweet the following afternoon, according to The Tower, Catholic University s independent student newspaper. The students created a petition of demands, including Rainford s resignation, an apology from university President John Garvey and a university donation to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.  I was very upset that, one, the dean would say something like that, but also that he would be so nonchalant about students here who are victims of child molestation and sexual assault,  Bi Anncha Andrews, another social work graduate student, told the paper. I don t want him speaking for me as a social worker or as a Catholic,  added Victoria Conaway, a social work graduate student.On Friday, a day after the walkout, Garvey released a statement announcing that Rainford s remarks were  unacceptable  and that he would be suspended for the remainder of the semester.   The tweets called into question the validity of some accusations of sexual assault made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Of deepest concern to me is that they demonstrated a lack of sensitivity to the victim,  Garvey said. We should expect any opinion he expresses about sexual assault to be thoughtful, constructive, and reflective of the values of Catholic University,  particularly from a university-affiliated social media account, he added. The statement maintained that the university has  no position on the Kavanaugh matter.  In an apology letter to the university, Rainford, who has served as dean since 2013, acknowledged that his tweet  suggested that [Swetnick] was not the victim of sexual assault.   I offer no excuse,  he wrote on Thursday.  It was impulsive and thoughtless and I apologize. ... Victims who suffer assault and abuse need to be heard, respected, and provided treatment and justice.  Rainford s @NCSSSDean Twitter account is no longer active. Associate Dean Marie Raber will serve as acting dean until Rainford returns. At a campus protest on Monday, students, alumni and faculty members called for Rainford s resignation. More than 100 people participated, according to The Washington Post.  The tweets not only mocked a survivor of a campus sexual assault, but also suggested a scenario in which she was instead a perpetrator,  a campus announcement of the protest read. Start by believing survivors... Not mocking them on Twitter,  read one protester s sign."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/02/653492150/is-8-enough-the-consequences-of-the-supreme-court-starting-one-justice-down,"As the fight over the Brett Kavanaugh nomination continues to reverberate throughout the country, the shorthanded Supreme Court began its new term Monday. Republicans had hoped to seat nominee Brett Kavanaugh in time for the start of the term, but that, of course, did not happen.Just like the beginning of the 2016 term, only eight justices sat on the bench when Chief Justice John Roberts opened the court term. In 2016, after the sudden death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell held up President Barack Obama s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court for almost a year, leaving the court with eight members until a newly elected President Trump could fill the seat.The difference this time is that the eight-justice court is evenly split between conservative and liberal justices, with little wiggle room in many closely contested cases. In 2016, Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes voted with the court s liberals, was still there.Now he has retired, and for the first time in well over 30 years, there is no justice like Kennedy or Sandra Day O Connor who sits ideologically at the center of the court.On Monday, the action moved among the three branches of government like a Hollywood movie.At the White House, Trump held a sun-dappled press conference to talk about his new trade deal, but inevitably, he faced Kavanaugh questions. Among them: Given how partisan Kavanaugh s performance at a confirmation hearing was last week, could the president assure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he s confirmed to the court?The president never really answered the question, telling reporters,  You ll have to ask him that question, but I can tell you he s been treated horribly. Meanwhile, behind the scenes at the Capitol, the Republican leadership was trying to limit the scope of the FBI investigation that was forced upon them last week when three Republicans said they would not support Kavanaugh unless the FBI background investigation was reopened.What that investigation entails remains an open question, with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation, and Trump saying he wants a comprehensive, but short, investigation.The consequences of a 4-4 split on the Supreme CourtWhile all these machinations were taking place, the Supreme Court began hearing cases. The liberal-conservative split was apparent in the first case argued, a challenge to a regulation under the Endangered Species Act.The central player in the case was the dusky gopher frog.The species lives in only one pond in Mississippi and is in danger of becoming extinct when the ephemeral pond that it lives and breeds in is gone. Ephemeral ponds dry up periodically and usually lack fish, so the frog s eggs don t get eaten.At issue in the frogs  case is whether the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can designate an area in Louisiana where the frogs once lived as a critical habitat in the hope that at some point in the future, the frogs may be moved back to this area, where there are more ephemeral ponds.Weyerhaeuser, the timber company that leases the land, has challenged the designation as a potential threat to any future development plans.On the steps of the high court after the argument, Noah Greenwald, the endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity, explained why Congress enacted Endangered Species Act in the first place. The web of life that we ourselves depend on is built of species,  he said.  Ecosystems are made of species; we all depend on species for our food, our medicines, for clean air, for clean water. Weyerhaeuser s lawyer did not come to the microphones.But inside the court, the four liberal justices pointed to language in the Endangered Species Act that allows reasonable actions, like this one, as they see it. The court s conservatives complained that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service doesn t say what reasonable is.A 4-4 tie would allow the lower-court ruling to stay in place, meaning Weyerhaeuser loses.How fast the court gets a ninth justice depends on how quickly the Senate can ... hop along.Court avoids most hot-button issues this fallIn the meantime, the justices will be hearing a wide array of cases, but none present the hot-button issues of abortion, gay rights or affirmative action.Indeed, the justices seem intent on keeping their distance from those issues, at least for now. They recently postponed any decision on whether to hear a case that tests whether the federal ban on discrimination in employment covers gay and lesbian employees.Among the cases granted this term, Kennedy s absence will likely be felt most strongly by defendants in death penalty prosecutions. On Tuesday, for example, the court will hear a case testing whether a death row inmate, Vernon Madison, who suffers from extreme dementia, can be put to death for a crime he no longer remembers.Kennedy often voted with the four more liberal justices in death penalty cases   here, a 4-4 divided opinion would affirm the Alabama Supreme Court s decision to execute Madison. The Supreme Court has ruled in the past that an inmate must have a  rational understanding  of why they re being executed.Other cases, though relatively minor on their own, may be harbingers of ideological shifts to come.Overturning precedent?The court will hear at least three cases this term in which the justices are asked directly to overrule a decision in an earlier case. Considering the focus that respecting precedent (known in legalese as stare decisis) received during the first round of Kavanaugh s confirmation hearings, these cases will be important markers for how willing the court is to overturn established legal doctrine.One of these cases deals with the constitutional provision barring defendants from being prosecuted twice for the same crime. It s called the double jeopardy clause. But since 1852, the court has recognized an exception to the double jeopardy rule that allows the state and federal governments each to prosecute an individual for the same crime.In the case before the court, Terance Gamble was prosecuted for being a felon in possession of a firearm twice; first by Alabama and second by the United States. He claims that violates the Constitution s double jeopardy provision, and if the court were to agree, it would be overruling a century and a half precedent.But there s more.Some scholars worry that if the court decides to overrule itself and forbid state and federal prosecutions for the same crime, a president could immunize allies from state law prosecution by pardoning them after they have been prosecuted for a federal crime.Thus, if onetime Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was convicted of federal tax and bank fraud, were to be pardoned, under current Supreme Court precedent, he could still be charged for some of the same crimes under state law. But perhaps not if the 1852 precedent were to be reversed.Administrative agency powersOn Tuesday, the court will hear a case that tests the  nondelegation doctrine.  The doctrine, in theory, prohibits Congress from granting legislative power to executive branch agencies. The court has used it only twice in its history to strike down acts of Congress.Both of these decisions came in 1935, in reaction to vast grants of power to agencies during the New Deal. Now comes a case that could revitalize the nondelegation doctrine in an era when, like the New Deal, conservatives decry the expanding administrative state.The case before the court deals with a federal sex offender registration statute. Under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), Congress gave the attorney general the power to decide how to apply the 2006 law to offenders whose crimes occurred prior to that date.Herman Gundy was convicted of rape in 2005, and in 2008, the attorney general applied the registration provisions of SORNA to him retroactively. He violated the law after he was transferred from a prison in Pennsylvania to a halfway house in New York because he crossed state lines and failed to register.He argues that SORNA granted open-ended power to the executive to decide what qualifies as criminal under the statute and therefore violates the non-delegation doctrine.Immigration enforcementNext week, the court will hear a case that could give the federal government the power to indefinitely detain, without a bond hearing, all immigrants who have committed certain crimes.A federal appeals court ruled that the government could only do so if it detained those immigrants promptly after their release from prison. The Trump administration appealed that ruling, arguing that under current law, it could imprison those immigrants at any point after their release.Eduardo Padilla is one of the immigrants who challenged the Trump administration s position. A legal permanent resident since coming to the United States as a toddler in 1966, Padilla was convicted of a firearm offense and served six months in jail and was released in 2002.Eleven years later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained him initially without a bond hearing because, under federal law, that conviction made him deportable. He argues that because ICE did not arrest him promptly after his release from prison, he does not qualify in the class of immigrants that ICE can hold without such a hearing."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/02/653414359/president-trump-brett-kavanaugh-and-beer,"Drinking beer became such a theme in last week s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that Saturday Night Live spoofed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s many references to drinking beer with his friends.But there are serious questions underlying all the focus on beer: whether Kavanaugh was fully forthcoming in his testimony and what his behavior was like when drunk.During his Rose Garden press conference Monday, President Trump was asked whether he would withdraw Kavanaugh s nomination if it was determined that he lied about his drinking under oath. I was surprised at how vocal he was about the fact that he likes beer,  Trump said.  And he s had a little bit of difficulty. I mean, he talked about things that happened when he drank. I mean, this is not a man that said that alcohol was   that he was perfect with respect to alcohol. Later, Trump again characterized Kavanaugh as having described a problem with alcohol when he was younger.  I watched that hearing and I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man with drink,  Trump said.Kavanaugh never went that far in his testimony, speaking mostly in general terms.  I drank beer with my friends,  Kavanaugh said in his opening statement.  Almost everyone did. Sometimes I had too many beers. Sometimes others did. I liked beer. I still like beer. But I did not drink beer to the point of blacking out, and I never sexually assaulted anyone. He added later that in high school, he and his friends sometimes  did goofy or stupid things,  things that he said he looks back on and cringes.Democratic senators pressed for more details about his drinking, whether a reference in his yearbook to the  ralph club  was related to vomiting from drinking too much and whether he had ever forgotten details after a night of drinking. In both cases, Kavanaugh pushed back on the senators, asking them whether they had ever drunk too much.At one point, rather than answer a question about alcohol consumption, Kavanaugh began reciting his academic and athletic credentials. He also opaquely blamed a disagreement between college roommates for one college classmate s claim that he was aggressive or even belligerent when drunk.Kavanaugh s sometimes evasive answers about drinking have prompted several people who knew him in high school and college to come forward in recent days. When Brett got drunk, he was often belligerent and aggressive,  wrote Yale classmate Chad Ludington in a statement released on Sunday and posted by The New York Times.  On one of the last occasions I purposely socialized with Brett, I witnessed him respond to a semi-hostile remark, not by defusing the situation, but by throwing his beer in the man s face and starting a fight that ended with one of our mutual friends in jail.  In a report published online Monday, the Times provided more details about the 1985 incident.The White House distributed statements from two other college classmates who said they never saw such behavior. I not only socialized with Brett, but I was there with him at the end of the night when we came home, and there in the morning when we got up. I never saw Brett black out or not be able to remember the prior evening s events, nor did I ever see Brett act aggressive, hostile or in a sexually aggressive manner to women. Brett was and is a good-natured, kind, and friendly person, to men and women,  said former dorm suitemate Dan Murphy in a statement.  The behavior I ve heard other people want to attribute to him, but from people who did not live with Brett and therefore not in the same position to observe, is simply wrong, and such behavior is incompatible with what I know to be true. Regardless of what Trump said in the Rose Garden on Monday, those in the White House working to secure Kavanaugh s confirmation aren t copping to the idea that he had  difficulty as a young man with drink. Raj Shah, the White House spokesman handling Kavanaugh s confirmation, said that what Kavanaugh describes is pretty typical high school and college behavior, that he has in general terms  acknowledged pretty much everything,  including underage drinking and at times drinking too much.How to explain Trump s characterization of Kavanaugh? Trump s views on alcohol are shaped by his own life experience.At an opioid event last year at the White House, Trump talked about his brother Fred, who from a young age told him never to drink.  He had a problem with alcohol,  Trump said of his brother. He had a very, very, very tough life because of alcohol   believe me, very, very tough, tough life,  Trump said.  He was a strong guy, but it was a tough, tough thing that he was going through. It is perhaps ironic that beer would come to play such a central role in the controversy over the Supreme Court pick of a president who so spurns alcohol. I m just saying, I m not a drinker,  Trump volunteered during the press conference Monday.  I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life, OK?  Though, he said, he has been to parties in high school and college where people were drinking, going  crazy.  They were 16, 17 years old, and I saw a lot of it. Does that mean that they can t do something that they want to do with their life?  Trump asked.And, that, according to Shah, was Trump s point: Kavanaugh  drank a lot  (to use Trump s phrasing), but that was a long time ago and should not overshadow his accomplished career and qualifications to be a Supreme Court justice.Kavanaugh s critics say he simply hasn t been forthcoming about his drinking all those years ago, including when he was under oath testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. They argue it is relevant, both as a matter of truthfulness but also because alcohol can affect behavior and memory, and Christine Blasey Ford alleges Kavanaugh was stumbling drunk when he assaulted her   an event he strenuously denies."

What his wife is going through,  Trump said,  what his beautiful children are going through is not describable. It s not fair. Trump pledged in a White House Rose Garden news conference that he would not constrain the FBI s inquiry, but he also so far has not released the written scope of work that lays out the assignment to the bureau.Democrats led by the Senate Judiciary Committee s ranking member, Dianne Feinstein of California, have called for the White House to back up its assurances about the FBI investigation by revealing what, specifically, it has written in its instructions.Trump didn t discuss whether he might release the written scope of work. The FBI isn t pursuing a criminal investigation into Kavanaugh. It s doing a new background investigation, effectively as a contractor for the White House. That s why the parameters of its assignment, as made by the president and his aides, are important.Trump said FBI special agents began their work on Friday, worked through the weekend and are  really working hard and putting in a lot of hours.  They are expected to compile their findings in a new report for the White House  that it would then share with the Senate Judiciary Committee. The full Senate could then vote on Kavanaugh on Friday.The president was asked whether he has a  Plan B  in case investigators substantiate the claims about sexual misconduct made by Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick   or the FBI discovers something else that could be problematic for Kavanaugh.Trump said he didn t want to talk about a Plan B but also said he was  open  to whatever investigators find. Look, I m waiting just like you,  he said.  If they find something, I ll take that into consideration. Absolutely. I have a very open mind.

Kavanaugh was nominated to fill the vacancy created by the retirement this past summer of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who often cast the pivotal swing vote on cases. Whereas last term the high court decided several landmark cases with 5-4 decisions, such as Trump s travel ban, limitations on how public-sector unions can collect fees and the privacy rights of cellphone users, for now there are fewer high-profile cases awaiting the justices this fall. Here s a look at some of the upcoming cases that might be considered by an evenly-divided Supreme Court. Weyerhaeuser Company v. United States Fish and Wildlife ServiceThe very first case the Court will take up concerns a frog species that is threatened with extinction: the dusky gopher frog. Weyerhaeuser., a large timber company, is challenging the federal government s classification of Louisiana timberland as a  critical habitat  for the dusky gophers. There are only 75 dusky gopher frogs left in the wild and they are protected by the Endangered Species Act.  Lawyers for Weyerhaeuser argue that a parcel of Louisiana land should not be considered a habitat for the frogs, since they don t even live there yet. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says the only way to save the frog is to relocate them to newly constructed ponds in pine forests throughout the South, like the one owned by Weyerhaeuser. Madison v. Alabama On Tuesday, the justices will hear death penalty case involving Alabama death row inmate Vernon Madison. He has spent nearly half of his life awaiting execution after being convicted in the killing of an Alabama police officer who was responding to a domestic disturbance in the mid-1980s. Madison shot and killed the officer and also fired at his then-girlfriend, who survived the shooting. Advocates for Madison say he now suffers from dementia and cannot remember the fatal shooting that sent him to death row. About 30 minutes before Madison was supposed to be executed by lethal injection in January, the high court issued a temporary stay. The central question raised by the case is whether the state of Alabama would violate the Constitution s 8th Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment by executing a man whose dementia is so severe that he cannot recall committing any crimes. Nielsen v. Preap This case, scheduled for argument on Oct. 10, is about whether the federal government can detain immigrants awaiting deportation after finishing a prison sentence over a crime unrelated to their legal status. The Trump administration is appealing a lower court ruling that the White House says makes it more difficult to deport those in the country illegally. After an immigrant who is a convicted criminal finishes a a prison sentence and is released, the federal government cannot then re-apprehend that person and hold them indefinitely for possible deportation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled. Trump officials are appealing that decision. It is an important case to the Trump administration, which has pursued a hard line policy on immigration.Meanwhile, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union counter that allowing the indefinite detentions without a bond hearing would encourage  arbitrary detention. It is the second immigrant detention case the court has taken up in recent months. In February, the court ruled that immigrants held in detention   sometimes for years   are not entitled to a bail hearing, where they could win their release. It was a win for the Trump administration and it overturned a lower court ruling. "
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/01/652563101/good-and-mad-explores-womens-anger-at-a-pivotal-moment,"Months ago, I was asked to review Rebecca Traister s Good And Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women s Anger. What timing,  I thought, as I read the book while red-robed handmaidens protested Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court nomination confirmation hearings. Maybe Traister will have to write an afterword about this,  I thought, as Serena Williams touched off a global conversation during the U.S. Open final about which women are allowed to express anger   and when. Oh, definitely about this,  I thought, as multiple men accused of sexual misconduct mulled their comebacks. A couple of them resurfaced with blisteringly tone-deaf essays in (ostensibly) respected publications.As I sat writing this review, the TV on my desk was tuned to Christine Blasey Ford s testimony accusing Brett Kavanaugh of assault. Shortly thereafter, an acquaintance took to Facebook to furiously spill out the brutal details of her own rape. A close friend started an email thread to our circle of female college buddies with the subject line  Angry Anger with Anger on Top. Which is to say   it s easy to imagine that now is an even more fitting moment for Good and Mad than Traister herself may have imagined when she wrote it.It hardly even needs saying that women s anger (more from one party than the other) has been roiling since the 2016 election. Good and Mad is one of a few new releases taking on the formidable task of exploring the intersection of politics and anger.And Traister is trying to do a lot in her 250 pages. She writes in the introduction that her goal is to explore  the specific nexus of women s anger and American politics, about how the particular dissatisfactions and resentments of America s women have often ignited movements for social change and progress. But there s much more here than that. She also illustrates the many ways that American society shuns angry women, convincing them that their rage is impolite, unattractive, or even unhealthy. This point is made over and over, but it doesn t get repetitive or tiresome, so much as that it hammers home just how pervasive the phenomenon is.Traister also writes that she s trying to provide women with validation for whatever rage they are currently feeling. Her book s final line:  Don t ever let them talk you out of being mad again. In covering all that ground, she has done her research   the book is thick with citations of other books, as well as interviews with candidates, activists, and longtime politicians. That said, her book is not a detached chronicling of women s anger in American history. She, at times, injects her own opinions and experiences into some of the stories, as well as her own politics   Traister is a liberal, and the book is unmistakably so.Traister effectively conveys that women s anger has shaped America, and also that much of it is mischaracterized or ignored in popular accounts of history.There s an explanation of how women of the temperance movement weren t all a bunch of hectoring moralists; many were also seeking a way to stop men from beating their wives. Or that the same Rosa Parks who quietly refused to give up a bus seat was also an outspoken anti-rape activist   and that at the age of 10, she picked up a brick and threatened a white boy who was attacking her. Or that women, not just men, were present and resisting police in the Stonewall Riots.The book ranges across centuries of American history, with chapters exploring different facets of women s anger: one on how it often disguises itself as sadness or humor or religious fervor; another on how women politicians are penalized for daring to get publicly upset; another on racial divisions among contemporary feminists; and many others.Because those topics often bleed into each other and are hard to disentangle, this all contributes to one weakness of Good and Mad: It s a book that reads best when consumed one chapter at a time.I finished a chapter examining media responses to anger in powerful women like Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama, then jumped into a new chapter about how women hide their anger   which moved from the temperance movement to Upton Sinclair to Sen. Patty Murray to Emmett Till   then hopped into another chapter, also about hiding anger (this time with humor), that started with Rep. Pat Schroeder and moved on to Flo Kennedy. More than a few times, I found myself wondering where I was again.Which is to say, it feels more like a string of essays than a single narrative of women s anger in American history.But those essays are impressively crafted, and it s a testament to Traister s talent that it s easy to shrug and continue reading in the maelstrom of history she brings together.Even if you occasionally lose the thread, Traister excels at consistently throwing out insights that are so clean that they seem like you had them in your head in the first place.Any woman who has tried to candy-coat her fury in jokes will punch the air at Traister s description of how she has done it, too:And that s one of many nod-furiously-along moments. There s also the unsettling sense that sex-positive feminism has often been  a strategic attempt to obscure or distract from more unpleasant challenges to male power.  And the frustration you feel when you re practically glowing with rage   and it comes out as tears.One of Traister s other greatest strengths is that she has been intentional about bringing in a range of voices   especially black women. She lucidly picks apart just how much more difficult it is to navigate anger as a black woman, but also expands out to investigate the racial divisions within mainstream feminism that many white feminists are only beginning to grasp.But her intersectionality also highlights a group of women that is largely left out of her examination of contemporary politics: conservative women.To be clear, this is not to prescribe that the book should split its time equally between Democratic and Republican women, or even close to equally. The overwhelming brunt of the political anger in America right now has been from women who are left of center.But an exploration of women s anger is not comprehensive if it doesn t chart out the full terrain of that anger   and that means talking to women in the party that is much less angry now.Beth Moore and Jen Hatmaker, for example, are just two examples of white evangelical women who have publicly voiced their fury at President Trump s election. Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly were two of the loudest voices denouncing sexual harassment at conservative Fox News.Even one chapter exploring how conservative women are feeling their anger   or are conflicted about their anger, or are even not feeling it   would not only provide a more complete portrait, but also bolster the rest of Traister s considerable work, throwing it into greater relief.I finished drafting this review on the day after the Ford-Kavanaugh hearings. Democratic senators had walked out of a committee vote in protest. Republicans were being publicly confronted by survivors of sexual assault.But for anyone who reads Traister s book, myself included, one comparatively quiet moment from the hearing just might stick the longest. Does that work for you?  Ford asked the panel at one point, after being asked if she d like a break.  I m used to being collegial. Aren t we all."

We ve heard from the alleged victim, but now it s time to hear from the hero, Judge Brett Kavanaugh,  says Sen. Chuck Grassley, played by cast member Alex Moffat.In walks a shouting, sniffing Judge Brett Kavanaugh, in an appearance by Matt Damon. I m gonna start at an 11, I ma take it to about a 15 real quick!  he yells.He talks a lot about beer.  I m usually an optimist, I m a keg is half-full kind of guy,  he says.Echoing the real Kavanaugh s statement that  you ll never get me to quit,  Damon s judge notes,  I m not backing down ... I don t know the meaning of the word stop. Aidy Bryant played Rachel Mitchell, the Arizona prosecutor brought in to question Ford, who says,  I m here mostly for Twitter. Later on in the scene, Kate McKinnon, who can do a good impression of pretty much anybody, channeled the indignation of Sen. Lindsey Graham, who lashed out on Thursday at Democrats. You put this man on the Supreme Court now,  McKinnon s Graham says.  No vote, no discussion. You give him a damn robe and you let him do whatever the hell he wants. Because this right now, this is my audition for Mr. Trump s Cabinet. And also for a regional production of The Crucible. Weekend Update had its usual digs at the week in politics, beginning with the Ford and Kavanaugh appearances.  A classic debate of she said, he yelled,  as Colin Jost described it.Kate McKinnon was back (again!) as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, giving her take on Kavanaugh and his calendars. Today on Ginsburg s agenda:  Don t die. Kanye West was the night s musical guest. He performed three times, the first of which was ... in a costume of a bottle of Perrier.He ended the show with a song performed while wearing a Make America Great Again hat. West is a noted fan of President Trump.On Sunday afternoon, President Trump tweeted about the first show of the season, saying,  Like many, I don t watch Saturday Night Live (even though I past hosted it) - no longer funny, no talent or charm. It is just a political ad for the Dems. Word is that Kanye West, who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told  no ), was great. He s leading the charge! The show is back live next week with host Awkwafina and musical guest Travis Scott."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/29/653017161/fbi-contacts-deborah-ramirez-kavanaugh-accuser-as-investigation-begins,"Updated at 7:35 a.m. ET SundayThe FBI on Saturday began its first full day of work on an additional background investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and has reached out to the woman who alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed himself to her while the two were students at Yale University.The woman, Deborah Ramirez, has agreed to cooperate with the FBI investigation, according to a statement issued by her attorney, John Clune.  Out of respect for the integrity of the process, we will have no further comment at this time,  the statement said.Ramirez s allegations, outlined in a report by The New Yorker last Sunday, come on top of the allegations brought against Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford, who in dramatic testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday testified that the judge sexually assaulted her at a high school party more than 30 years ago. As part of a deal negotiated by Senate Republicans, the FBI will have one week to look into the allegations, which Kavanaugh has strenuously denied.President Trump formally ordered the FBI to conduct the probe on Friday, but according to a report by NBC News, the White House is limiting the scope of the bureau s investigation. The agency is examining the claims brought against Kavanaugh by Ford and Ramirez, but according to NBC, agents have not been permitted to investigate allegations made by a third woman, Julie Swetnick.In a sworn declaration released Wednesday by her attorney, Michael Avenatti, Swetnick alleges that from 1981 to 1983, she went to several parties that Kavanaugh also attended and observed him drunkenly pressing himself against girls without their consent. The judge has denied those allegations as well.Rather than investigating Swetnick s allegations, NBC reported, the White House counsel s office has given the FBI a list of witnesses it is permitted to interview. According to the report, officials who spoke to NBC on the condition of anonymity  characterized the White House instructions as a significant constraint on the FBI investigation and caution that such a limited scope, while not unusual in normal circumstances, may make it difficult to pursue additional leads in a case in which a Supreme Court nominee has been accused of sexual assault. The FBI declined to comment to NBC about its report. White House spokesman Raj Shah said  the White House is letting the FBI agents do what they are trained to do. Late on Saturday, Trump called the NBC report incorrect on Twitter, saying,  Actually, I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion. Please correct your reporting! Asked about the FBI investigation earlier on Saturday, President Trump told reporters he thought the probe was  going very well.  They have free reign, they can do whatever they have to do, whatever it is that they do,  said President Trump.  They ll be doing things we have never even thought of ... and hopefully at the conclusion, everything will be fine. The president also said he wanted the FBI to identify who may have leaked a confidential letter written by Ford about the alleged assault to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Was it Sen. Feinstein? Certainly her body language was not exactly very good when they asked her that question,  the president said.  I would like to find out as part of it who leaked the papers. Which Democrat leaked the papers. Feinstein has denied that she or anyone on her staff leaked the letter.While it remains unclear who else the FBI may engage during the investigation, at least two potentially key witnesses have said they intend to cooperate.The first is Mark Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh who according to Ford, was in the room during the alleged assault. Judge has said he has no memory of such an assault ever occurring.An attorney for Leland Keyser, who Ford says was at the party, was also willing to cooperate with the FBI, but Keyser s attorney has said her client has no recollection of the party where the assault is said to have happened.In a statement issued by the White House on Friday, Kavanaugh said he will continue cooperating with the confirmation process. Throughout this process, I ve been interviewed by the FBI, I ve done a number of  background  calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me. I ve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate. The FBI is expected to produce a final report for the White House, which the administration will then give to the Senate. As NPR s Philip Ewing reported: The FBI is unlikely to open a criminal investigation. Instead, its investigators are expected to pursue the same kind of background inquiry they have conducted on Kavanaugh in the past, focused on the new allegations. The FBI will not provide a determination about the truthfulness of what witnesses tell investigators in interviews, but as Ewing noted,  Even if the bureau serves only as a gold-plated transcription service in this case, the completeness of those transcripts might exceed the body of evidence that now exists   and it would be evidence obtained from witnesses who could be prosecuted if they lied to the feds. The Senate moved ahead with a procedural vote on Kavanaugh s nomination late on Friday, but is expected to put off the final floor vote until the FBI finishes its review.Asked on Saturday about whether he needs a backup plan in the event that Kavanaugh s nomination fails, President Trump said,  I don t need a backup plan. I think he s going to be fine. "

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/29/652836892/education-spending-bill-yale-discrimination-investigation-faults-in-student-loan,"You re reading NPR s weekly roundup of education news.A new education budget awaits approvalA new spending bill could add $581 million to the Department of Education s budget. The legislation would bolster career and technical training and programs that serve low-income students.  One specific program in the bill   Title IV, also known as The Every Student Succeeds Act  was questioned this week during a hearing of the Senate education committee. Lawmakers deliberated whether this billion-dollar pot of money could legally be used to arm teachers across the country. One senator, the committee s top Republican, Lamar Alexander, interpreted the law saying,  Title IV specifically gives states the decision about spending their money to create safe conditions, including drug and violence prevention.  Education Secretary Betsy DeVos also expressed a hands-off approach recently, making it clear that this decision is up to states. The spending package, which would give the Education Department a budget of $71.5 billion, still needs a signature from President Donald Trump to pass.6 ways to talk to your kids about sex after Kavanaugh The country watched this week as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford gave their testimonies of an alleged sexual assault that Ford said happened while the two were in high school over 35 years ago. NPR s Anya Kamenetz spoke to sex education experts about how you should talk to your kids, not just about sex, but also consent. Here are six things you can do to make the Kavanaugh story a  teachable moment.  Home schooling is growing and changing rapidlyThe New America Foundation reports the number of home schooled students has doubled since 1999. With the growth of online learning in K-12, homeschooling looks different than it did in past generations. Families  motivations are changing, too: religion is no longer the primary reason for choosing home schooling. The top reason was dissatisfaction with public school offerings. Report finds faults in student loan forgiveness programA new report from the Government Accountability Office finds that a popular student loan forgiveness program has been badly mismanaged. Public Service Loan Forgiveness was created in 2007 under a supposedly simple idea: Spend ten years in public service while making monthly payments on your student loans, and the government would forgive what s left at the end. But it s becoming clear the program is a muddle. Last week, NPR reported that, since October of 2017, the first year borrowers could qualify for forgiveness, 99 percent of applications have been denied. And in a deeply critical review of the PSLF program, the Government Accountability Office found persistent communication problems between the Education Department and its student loan servicers. NPR s Cory Turner reported that many borrowers may have worked in public service, sometimes for years, without being told their loan payments wouldn t count towards PSLF. GAO recommends, among other things, that the Education Department provide clear information to its contractors and borrowers about a wide range of issues ñ like who actually qualifies. In a response to the report, the Education Department agreed with GAO s findings and with all of its recommendations.Yale under investigation for discrimination against Asian-AmericansThe departments of education and justice are opening an investigation into whether the undergraduate admissions policies at Yale University  improperly discriminate on the basis of race, particularly in regard to Asian-American applicants,  according to a university statement. Together with a similar investigation into Harvard, a separate lawsuit, the case against Yale challenges the current state of the law on affirmative action. In related news, a national survey of nearly 500 college admissions directors, found that almost half believe some colleges hold Asian-American applicants to higher standards than other applicants. Free preschool means more working mothers  That s according to a new analysis by the Center for American Progress, which specifically looked at Washington, D.C. s preschool expansion. The nation s capitol began to expand funding in preschool in 2009 and by last year, 7 out of 10 3-year-olds and 9 out of 10 4-year-olds were enrolled. As a result, the rate of mothers with young children working rose dramatically.  D.C. now has the highest maternal labor force participation rate of the 50 largest cities in the country.This story has been updated to reflect a new statement from Yale University."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/29/652822947/opinion-christine-blasey-fords-moving-testimony,"I think a lot of people might have felt a jolt in their souls when Christine Blasey Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that one of the most vivid, indelible memories she has of the night she says she was sexually assaulted at 15 by a 17-year-old Brett Kavanaugh behind a closed door, while his friend looked on, was what she recalled as  the uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense. Judge Kavanaugh denies the allegations.It is hard not to be chilled and sickened to hear a woman recall how she heard cruel laughter from two older boys, as they stumbled drunk back to the party, after they had pinned her to a bed and tried to strip off her clothes, sexually assault her, and made her fear for her life by clapping a hand over her mouth to stop her screams. It was a story of cold, brute male force, followed by uncaring laughter. Demeaning and dismissive laughter that, in a way, is its own kind of assault. Many women have heard that kind of laughter.It is always a little precarious when a specific human story with many moving parts becomes a social or political symbol. Ford s moving testimony unlocked a heavy door in America this week. Her pointed, painful memories helped inspire many women to unearth their own, often for the first time, to talk about the times they have been assaulted, pawed, groped, humiliated or raped. These are stories many women have locked away, just to keep going. They need to be heard now, both out in the open, and in the privacy of families. All of those stories from so many women don t necessarily prove that 17-year-old Brett Kavanaugh attacked 15-year-old Christine Blasey Ford in the summer of 1982. Just as middle-aged Kavanaugh s record of promoting women, or coaching a girl s basketball team, doesn t prove that he didn t.That door Ford and so many other women have opened, often at great personal cost, could throw more light onto the darkness of sexual assault. But will the events of this week encourage more women and men to trust they will be heard if they have the courage to come forward? Or do they have to fear they will be met with disbelief, indifference, and even the cold, derisive laughter that Christine Blasey Ford made so many remember?"
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/29/652724915/republicans-push-kavanaugh-nomination-forward-but-at-what-cost,"Everything was on track. The show was out of the way. It was time to vote.That s what Republican leadership and those supporting Judge Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court thought   until Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake upended those plans, calling for a  short pause  for a limited, one-week FBI investigation.By day s end, the White House had acceded and asked for an investigation, too. President Trump tweeted Friday night that the investigation is started and Kavanaugh  will someday be recognized as a truly great Justice of The United States Supreme Court! It was a day of drama and tortured consciences, giving Democrats and those opposing Kavanaugh s nomination one last hope that something will emerge to derail Kavanaugh for good. Republicans, on the other hand, hope the FBI investigation will exonerate Kavanaugh, who has maintained he has committed no sexual misconduct amid allegations from Christine Blasey Ford and two other women. Republicans are putting everything in place for a vote late next week on Kavanaugh s nomination. But at what cost? In a year when women, especially Democratic women, are fired up to vote and wanting to send a message to President Trump, who has been accused of sexual assault or misconduct by at least 22 women, Republicans are taking a gamble that Kavanaugh s confirmation won t hurt them at the polls in November s midterm elections.In this cultural moment   when many women thought the #MeToo movement had moved the country beyond the he said, she said perceptions of the 1991 Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings and into a new era   it s hard to see those women not being even more fired up to turn out at the polls if Kavanaugh is confirmed.At the same time, few things fire up the Republican base like a Supreme Court confirmation fight. And the elevation of this battle   with Kavanaugh s and Republicans  pitched and partisan cries   could have the effect of firing up a GOP base that sees the opposition as unyielding, unfair and willing to do anything to score a political point at Trump s expense.And confirming Kavanaugh even if the allegations from Ford are true is what 54 percent of Republicans want, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released this week before Thursday s hearing.Republicans believe the limited FBI investigation will give wavering Republican senators confidence   and a degree of political cover   to vote for Kavanaugh. Then they can say to Democrats, you wanted an investigation, you got one, now it s time to vote. And Republican leadership is moving apace for that vote to happen as quickly as possible late next week. Nearly immediately after Flake emerged from a backroom Friday, where he was huddling with Democrats on the compromise plan for an investigation, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, began the vote on Kavanaugh s nomination. Quickly, Kavanaugh was approved 11-10, along party lines, and moved along to the full Senate, even as Democrats on the committee were asking what exactly they were even voting on. Not wasting much time, either, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., got a procedural vote, originally scheduled for Saturday, out of the way Friday night to advance Kavanaugh s nomination to the Senate floor.So the table is set, but what of the china? The hearings Thursday featured a  terrified  and, even as Republicans  including the president said,  credible  Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of a sexual assault while in high school decades ago   an allegation the federal appeals court judge has vehemently denied. Millions watched, tears were shed and stomachs churned. Kavanaugh then emerged   emotional, angry, defiant and partisan. This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit,  Kavanaugh said,  fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups. Kavanaugh was one of the lawyers working with independent counsel Kenneth Starr and helped author the report that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.It was the most partisan performance by a Supreme Court nominee in history. Republicans say it was justifiable outrage, because Kavanaugh s reputation has been forever marred and he maintains he has been wrongly accused. But Kavanaugh ripped off a veil of impartiality Americans have come to expect from Supreme Court justices. That veil is one reason Supreme Court justices   and the court itself ñ have been held in higher regard than Congress or the partisan politicians who occupy the Capitol.Kavanaugh s performance Thursday, with the help of Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, rallied the GOP   and that all-important audience of one, President Trump ñ to his side. After the hearing, Trump tweeted that  Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him. His testimony was powerful, honest, riveting. It s not clear at this point whether Kavanaugh will be confirmed. But for many Americans, regardless of political stripe and for different reasons, Thursday was emotional and frustrating, fist-shaking and embarrassing. It highlighted the kind of grievances and cultural divides that separated the country over the years and burst into full view with Trump s election, after simmering during much of the 2016 campaign.Thursday s hearing bruised a nation. It represented something of a de-evolution   of an institution in the Senate that has been progressively moving in this direction and of American politics itself, something few thought could get even worse.So where does that leave the country? There isn t a much better motivator to vote than anger, and Kavanaugh s confirmation fight   with the ideological direction of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance   is only likely to drench an already angry electorate with even more fuel."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/28/652558787/what-difference-would-it-make-if-the-fbi-were-to-investigate-kavanaugh,"A wild turn of events on Friday flipped a new FBI investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from a long shot into a sure thing.That was one result of an eleventh-hour agreement among the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee after a contentious session of offstage horse-trading.The panel voted to recommend the embattled Kavanaugh to the full Senate on the condition that the final floor vote not take place until after the FBI conducted a background investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct confronting the nominee. The inquiry would be  limited in scope  and completed within a week. The White House later Friday ordered the bureau to do just that. The FBI is expected to produce a report for the White House, which the administration would then give the Senate.The compromiseDemocrats and outside groups had been calling for the FBI s involvement since the allegations by Christine Blasey Ford and other women first surfaced that Kavanaugh had assaulted them or committed other such acts   allegations that Kavanaugh strongly denies.Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., pitched the delay and new investigation to his compatriots, apparently setting that as his condition for ultimately supporting Kavanaugh on the Senate floor. Republican leaders, who need every vote they can get to confirm the nominee, agreed.Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, had opposed involving the FBI but said Friday he would take up Flake s case. Ultimately he secured an agreement with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. We ve had a good day today by moving the nominee,  Grassley told reporters.  A good day. We re very happy with the progress we ve made. Democrats said the compromise was the right move. I think it will be better for the country that this FBI investigation occur,  Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., told NPR.  I m not sure what the answers will be. It s possible some of the witnesses won t even agree to talk with FBI. ... But to think we wouldn t even try would be the saddest thing for the country.  What happens nextThe new deadline for a Kavanaugh vote is Oct. 5. Grassley asked President Trump to instruct the FBI to spend that week conducting interviews, reviewing documents and looking into the new accusations.The president agreed. The supplemental FBI background investigation would be limited to current credible allegations against the nominee and must be completed no later than one week from today,  Grassley said.It wasn t immediately clear whether  current credible allegations  would mean the FBI would interview only people connected with Ford s case or with some of the other women who have come forward with allegations against Kavanaugh.The FBI is unlikely to open a criminal investigation. Instead, its investigators are expected to pursue the same kind of background inquiry they have conducted on Kavanaugh in the past, focused on the new allegations.The nominee said in a statement released by the White House that he would go along. Throughout this process, I ve been interviewed by the FBI, I ve done a number of  background  calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me,  Kavanaugh said.  I ve done everything they have requested and will  continue to cooperate.  At least one key player in this drama also volunteered to talk: Mark Judge   a boyhood friend of Kavanaugh s who has been accused by Ford of being a bystander to her sexual assault and was named in other allegations   said in a letter to the Judiciary Committee that he would cooperate under certain conditions.Judge renewed his denials about being involved with any sexual misconduct and said that he would  cooperate with any law enforcement agency that is assigned to confidentially investigate these allegations. Why would the FBI make a difference?It s a crime to lie to Congress, but lying to the FBI is a whole other matter. And there is a practical difference between people in the Kavanaugh case issuing written statements   as Judge and others have done   and actually sitting down with human special agents.Investigators might glean details from people involved that aren t yet in the public eye. They might discover there are more people, including witnesses or others, than have been a part of the public accounting so far.But the FBI will not give its own determination about the truthfulness of what witnesses say   one reason Grassley and Kavanaugh both earlier said they opposed activating the bureau. Investigators probably only will conduct interviews and then pass them to the Senate, they said.Even if the bureau serves only as a gold-plated transcription service in this case, the completeness of those transcripts might exceed the body of evidence that now exists   and it would be evidence obtained from witnesses who could be prosecuted if they lied to the feds. Democrats and outside groups   and now, Flake   argue that the information that has surfaced recently means the FBI must look into Kavanaugh again. Ford told the Judiciary Committee she hadn t told anyone about her alleged sexual assault by the 1990s, when Kavanaugh was screened for a job in the Justice Department, or even by the early 2000s, when he was cleared to work in the White House of President George W. Bush.Many Republicans say the due diligence on Kavanaugh already was complete. Now that the Judiciary Committee has voted to recommend him to the full Senate, they argue, the full chamber must decide.NPR correspondent Tim Mak contributed to this report."

Jeff Flake, one of a handful of Republicans expected to decide the fate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, announced he would vote in favor of confirmation.Two women confronted the Republican lawmaker as he boarded an elevator, telling him they are survivors of rape and sexual assault. Their identities were not immediately available to NPR. I recognized in Dr. Ford s story that she s telling the truth. What you are doing is allowing someone who actually violated a woman to sit on the Supreme Court,  one protester said. I was sexually assaulted and nobody believed me. I didn t tell anyone, and you re telling all women that they don t matter, that they should stay quiet,  another woman said, as Flake stood by silently with a somber look on his face.The scene was captured by CNN on live television, adding to the drama of a remarkable and emotional week.Flake repeatedly said,  Thank you,  refusing to answer whether he thinks Kavanaugh told the truth when he gave a fiery defense before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, categorically denying the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford and other women that have beset his confirmation in the past couple of weeks.In a statement announcing his intent to support Kavanaugh s nomination, Flake said he  left the hearing yesterday with as much doubt as certainty,  and he cited  a presumption of innocence to the accused, absent corroborating evidence.

NPR,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/28/652524372/how-trauma-affects-memory-scientists-weigh-in-on-the-kavanaugh-hearing,"In Thursday s testimony at Judge Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation hearings, Christine Blasey Ford alleged Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party in 1982, when she was 15 years old and he was 17.Kavanaugh staunchly denied these allegations.But memory is fallible. A question on many people s minds is, how well can anyone recall something that happened over 35 years ago?Pretty well, say scientists, if the memory is of a traumatic event. That s because of the key role emotions play in making and storing memories.On any given day, our brains store or  encode  only some of the things we experience.  What we pay attention to is what s more likely to get encoded,  says Jim Hopper, a teaching associate in psychology at Harvard University and a consultant on sexual assault and trauma.A region of the brain called the hippocampus plays an important role in this process. Ford referred to the hippocampus when questioned by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., about how she was so sure that Kavanaugh was the perpetrator of the alleged assault.  The hippocampus certainly plays a role in taking things into short-term memory and then transferring them and consolidating them into long-term memories,  says Hopper. If an event elicits an emotional reaction in us, then it s more likely to make it into our memory.  Things that have more emotional significance tend to get more encoded,  he says.And when something elicits an intense negative emotion, like a trauma, it s even more likely to be encoded in the brain. The stress hormones, cortisol, norepinephrine, that are released during a terrifying trauma tend to render the experience vivid and memorable, especially the central aspect, the most meaningful aspects of the experience for the victim,  says Richard McNally, a psychologist at Harvard University and the author of the book Remembering Trauma.That s because a high-stress state  alters the function of the hippocampus and puts it into a super-encoding mode,  says Hopper, especially early on during an event. And  the central details [of the event] get burned into their memory and they may never forget them. Whether it s sexual assault victims or soldiers in combat or survivors of an earthquake, people who have experienced traumatic events tend to remember the most essential and frightening elements of the events in vivid detail for life, says McNally. However, this doesn t mean that these memories include every detail of the event. The brain holds on to the most important stuff at the expense of the peripheral details.Take, for example, a clerk at convenience store who gets robbed at gunpoint, says McNally.  The person may often encode the features of the weapon, the gun pointed at him, but not recall whether or not the person was wearing glasses, because their attention is focused on the most central features of the experience. McNally says this would explain why Ford says she remembers what happened during the alleged assault but she can t remember the date of the party or its location. They were forgotten because they were never encoded,  says McNally.  When somebody has an experience such as this, they re not necessarily saying,  I better get down the address.  They re preoccupied with trying to escape this terrifying experience. Also,  people in general are not good about dating events, whether they re traumatic events or nontraumatic events,  he adds. Unless there are other clues to the date, most people tend to forget when something happened.As for the memory of perpetrators of sexual assault, there s been little research on it, says Hopper. But what the research on emotions and memory suggests is the perpetrator s memory will depend on their emotional state, he says.  If holding someone down and trying to take their clothes off was an entertaining experience, or a routine, familiar experience you re less likely to store that,  he says.  It really depends on how the perpetrator is relating to things.   Another factor that affects how memories are stored is alcohol use. Generally alcohol can make people forget things,  says Mary Beth Miller, a clinical psychologist at the University of Missouri, Columbia who has studied the impact of alcohol consumption on making and retrieving memories.Earlier this month, Ford told The Washington Post that she remembers Kavanaugh being  stumbling drunk  whereas she recalls having one beer that night. Other accusers who did not testify Thursday have also suggested Kavanaugh was part of a group of friends who indulged in heavy drinking in the 1980s. In his testimony, Kavanaugh said he likes beer, but he denied ever drinking so much that he didn t remember things. Miller says memory loss from alcohol   blackouts    are very common among young people.  In a blackout, you re walking around, talking to people,  says Miller.  And a lot of times in a blackout people will be very coherent. You re just doing your thing, and people don t know, because it s hard to know if someone s in a blackout state. These blackouts are what scientists call  fragmentary  blackouts, where someone has partial memory loss, but  you can usually recall, if someone reminds you later.  These fragmentary blackouts can occur at low blood alcohol concentrations, as low as 0.06, she says. (For comparison, the legal limit for driving is 0.08 in all states except Utah.)Miller also says that animal studies suggest that  adolescent brains are actually more sensitive to the memory impairing effects of alcohol.  A permanent memory impairment, what scientists call  en bloc blackout,  has a beginning and an end, says Miller, and the person cannot remember anything that happened in between. She says these typically occur at higher blood alcohol concentrations, around 0.24. This is because higher amounts of alcohol prevent short-term memory from being converted to long-term memory, says Miller.  And people with a history of heavy drinking are more likely to have more memory deficits,  she adds. "
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/28/652492679/emotions-dominate-ford-and-kavanaugh-testimony,We review yesterday s historic testimony from Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/28/652486413/judiciary-committee-set-to-vote-on-kavanaugh-friday-with-eyes-on-undecided-jeff,"Updated at 4:50 p.m. ET SaturdayPresident Trump has ordered the FBI to conduct a limited  supplemental investigation  into his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, to update the judge s background check, following a deal struck by Senate Republicans to move the nomination forward. The move comes after Senate Republicans agreed to delay a vote on Kavanaugh s nomination to give the FBI one week to look into the allegation of sexual assault brought against him by Christine Blasey Ford, which the federal appeals court judge denies.The Senate moved ahead with a procedural vote on Kavanaugh s nomination Friday evening, but is expected to put off the final floor vote until the FBI finishes its review.As of Saturday, the FBI has begun contacting people as part of the background investigation of Kavanaugh. Deborah Ramirez, who came forward with sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, has been contacted by the FBI, according to a statement from her attorney, John Clune. Ramirez has agreed to cooperate with the investigation, according to the statement.Ramirez claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a dorm party while both were first-year students at Yale University, according to an account in The New Yorker. Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the accusations against him.In a statement released by the White House Friday, Kavanaugh said he will continue to cooperate in the confirmation process.  Throughout this process, I ve been interviewed by the FBI, I ve done a number of  background  calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me. I ve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate. It s only the latest unexpected twist that came after a long day of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday by an agitated and sometimes tearful Kavanaugh, who defended his honor and integrity, and an emotional Christine Blasey Ford, who fought back tears as she told senators how Kavanaugh allegedly sexually assaulted her in high school while he was drunk.Ford s attorney Debra Katz said in a statement that while Ford  welcomes this step in the process ... no artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on this investigation.  Ford had repeatedly asked for an FBI investigation during her testimony, which only Democrats on the committee then supported. Central to that investigation would be questioning Mark Judge   a friend of Kavanaugh s who Ford says was present during the alleged sexual assault more than 30 years ago.Judge told the Judiciary Committee Friday that he would  cooperate with any law enforcement agency that is assigned to confidentially investigate these allegations.  Republicans on the committee had defeated a motion from Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., earlier on Friday to subpoena Judge to testify before the committee. Judge has denied being involved in any such sexual assault or in actions alleged by other women that have also surfaced in relation to Kavanaugh in recent weeks.On Friday, the Judiciary Committee approved Kavanaugh s nomination along a party-line vote, but only after Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake proposed the weeklong FBI investigation that would be  limited in time and scope  to further look into the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh.That followed behind-the-scenes drama on the committee, which delayed a planned vote by about 30 minutes as Flake was huddled outside the room with both Democrats and Republicans to relay his concerns Friday afternoon.Flake then returned and announced he would vote to advance Kavanaugh s nomination to the full Senate with the understanding that his request would be honored.  I think that we ought to do what we can to make sure that we do all due diligence with a nomination this important,  Flake said. He noted he had talked with other Democrats who had been  justifiably uncomfortable  moving forward and that this proposal might help heal the country, which is being  ripped apart. After the vote, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, was overheard telling ranking member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that  this is all a gentlemen and women s agreement.  Ultimately, the decision whether to delay a floor vote for Kavanaugh rests in the hands of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.Flake and two other key Republican swing votes on the Kavanaugh nomination   Maine s Susan Collins and Alaska s Lisa Murkowski   will ultimately decide the judge s fate. Collins and Murkowski are undecided, along with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, one of the most vulnerable Democratic senators up for re-election in November. Both Collins and Murkowski backed Flake s decision to ask for an additional FBI investigation.Feinstein said that Flake proposed the week delay on his own independent of any Democrats. As to whether it could give them a path to defeating Kavanaugh s nomination,  this is the best we can do right now,  she said.In his first remarks about Ford s testimony, Trump said Friday the California psychology professor was  very compelling  and looked like  a very fine woman to me,  calling her  a credible witness.  Trump also said Kavanaugh s testimony had been  incredible.  He tweeted Thursday that Kavanaugh  showed America exactly why I nominated him. His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting. As to whether he had a message for undecided senators like Collins and Murkowski, Trump said  they have to do what they think is right  and be comfortable with themselves. But he reiterated he still believes Kavanaugh s nomination will ultimately be successful and said that he had not even thought about a new nominee if the vote on Kavanaugh fails.After listening to Ford and and Kavanaugh testify, Flake issued a statement earlier on Friday saying that he  left the hearing yesterday with as much doubt as certainty.  What I do know is that our system of justice affords a presumption of innocence to the accused, absent corroborating evidence. That is what binds us to the rule of law,  said Flake.  While some may argue that a different standard should apply regarding the Senate s advice and consent responsibilities, I believe that the Constitution s provisions of fairness and due process apply here as well. On his way to the committee vote on Kavanaugh s nomination, Flake was confronted by a woman who said she was the victim of sexual assault. Cable news cameras aired the confrontation live as the woman repeatedly told Flake that his vote made her think her voice and experience did not matter. Don t look away from me,  she said.  Look at me and tell me that it doesn t matter what happened. Flake did not respond to the woman in the moment.The Judiciary Committee vote was initially scheduled for earlier Friday morning, and after Democrats failed to force Grassley to call additional witnesses to testify, some Democratic members on the committee walked out of the hearing. This is a sham what s going on in there right now. Democrats are not being heard. They are pushing through this process,  said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., one of the members who walked out.Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., gave a lengthy speech to the committee underscoring his opposition to Kavanaugh and again pressing for a delay in a vote, but then joined other Democrats in walking out after he finished. This is not a partisan moment, this is a moral moment in our nation. ... This toxic culture, this pernicious patriarchy in this country has to stop,  Booker said.The Kavanaugh nomination process appears to have driven a deep wedge between members on opposite sides of the aisle. South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a normally lighthearted lawmaker with a reputation for bipartisanship, darkly warned that the process for assessing Supreme Court nominees would never be the same. This has never been about the truth. ... It s the beginning of a process that will tear this country apart,  Graham said.  And if I am chairman next year, if we keep the majority and Sen. Grassley moves over   and I hope he doesn t because I think he s done a great job   I m going to remember this. There s the process before Kavanaugh, and the process after Kavanaugh. Two vulnerable Democratic senators in the midst of tight re-election races   Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly and Montana Sen. Jon Tester   have both announced they would oppose Kavanaugh. I have deep reservations about Judge Kavanaugh s nomination to this lifetime position and, as I stated, we have been unable to get all the information necessary regarding this nomination,  Donnelly said.  While I would gladly welcome the opportunity to work with President Trump on a new nominee for this critically important position, if Judge Kavanaugh s nomination comes before the full Senate for a vote under these circumstances, I will oppose it. Tester also said he has  deep concerns about the allegations of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh. Unfortunately, Judge Kavanaugh couldn t find time to discuss these concerns with me in person, so the only information I have is from what he said in his hearings. I ll be voting against him. Donnelly voted in favor of President Trump s first Supreme Court nominee, now-Justice Neil Gorsuch, while Tester opposed him.NPR s Ayesha Rascoe contributed to this report. "

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he will  keep the process moving,  although a final vote won t be held until the FBI finishes its inquiry.Citing the ABA s  respect for the rule of law and due process,  ABA President Robert Carlson wrote in a letter to the Judiciary Committee,  The basic principles that underscore the Senate s constitutional duty of advice and consent on federal judicial nominees require nothing less than a careful examination of the accusations and facts by the FBI. Later, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley released a letter by the ABA s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which said its members were not told in advance of Carlson s letter, and the panel reaffirmed its well-qualified rating of Kavanaugh.The ABA committee is nonpartisan, its chairman, Paul Moxley, wrote. He noted that the nominee rating committee  acts independently of ABA leadership. Carlson sent the letter after the Senate committee heard testimony from both Kavanaugh and Ford   a hearing that gripped the nation on Thursday. The ABA had previously given a rating of  well qualified  to Kavanaugh when he was nominated in July. Each appointment to our nation s highest court (as with all others) is simply too important to rush to a vote,  Carlson told the committee, which voted along party lines on Friday to approve sending the nomination to the full Senate, although soon afterward it called for additional investigations.It is critically important, he said, that the Senate show it is committed to  a Supreme Court that is above reproach. While Thursday s hearing prompted the bar association to recommend an investigation, another group that had endorsed Kavanaugh went one step further: the editors of America: The Jesuit Review say his nomination should now be withdrawn.Even if the claims against Kavanaugh haven t been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the magazine s editors said,  this nomination is no longer in the best interests of the country. None of the potential outcomes from the hearings are good, the editors said. Acknowledging that their support for Kavanaugh was based in part on his standing as a  committed textualist  who might help rewrite the Supreme Court s Roe v. Wade decision, the editors said his nomination is now woven into the discussion of how to treat women who report harassment and abuse.Other candidates for the high court are available, the editors said, concluding,  in a world that is finally learning to take reports of harassment, assault and abuse seriously, it is time to find a nominee whose confirmation will not repudiate that lesson. The responses follow a tense day of much anticipated testimony before the Senate committee, in which Ford recounted the alleged sexual assault 36 years ago and insisted she was  100 percent  sure that Kavanaugh was the perpetrator.Kavanaugh proclaimed his innocence, denying Ford s allegation again and vowing defiantly:  You may defeat me in the final vote, but you ll never get me to quit. Never. He said the Senate s confirmation process was a  circus  and  a national disgrace  and that it had replaced  advice and consent with search and destroy.  For 12 years, everyone who has appeared before me on the D.C. Circuit has praised my judicial temperament,  Kavanaugh told the Judiciary Committee members on Thursday.  That s why I have the unanimous, well qualified rating from the American Bar Association. However, despite being pressed repeatedly by Democrats to call for an FBI investigation into the claims of Ford and others, Kavanaugh declined to do so, saying instead:  I welcome whatever the committee wants to do. The ABA s letter warned,  Deciding to proceed without conducting additional investigation would not only have a lasting impact on the Senate s reputation, but it will also negatively affect the great trust necessary for the American people to have in the Supreme Court. As the Associated Press notes,  Republicans are concerned, among other reasons, that further investigations could push a vote past the November elections that may switch Senate control back to the Democrats and make consideration of any Trump nominee more difficult. Following Thursday s testimony, Trump   who a day earlier had defended Kavanaugh but left the door open that he might reconsider his support   praised the nominee. His testimony was powerful, honest and riveting,  Trump tweeted.  The Senate must vote! "

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/28/652393909/latest-in-washington-s-new-normal-high-court-nominees-no-longer-need-to-play-nic,"Judge Brett Kavanaugh may take a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court as early as next week, but only after shattering a rule about the confirmation process that had been set in stone for decades.It was the rule that said you stood by your judicial record but held on tight to your judicial temperament. It was understood you had a party affiliation, but it shouldn t be worn on your sleeve. And above all, you were not to antagonize anyone.You could call this the latest in a list of Capitol Hill norms to be lost in the era of President Trump.Kavanaugh broke the pattern in defending his nomination against a charge by Christine Blasey Ford, who said he had sexually assaulted her when both were teenagers 36 years ago.While denying the charge, Kavanaugh was loath to attack Ford herself after her morning of earnest and vivid testimony. Instead, Kavanaugh expressed sympathy for her. She s a victim, he said, and so was he. Victims of  a frenzy on the left  that had betrayed her desire for confidentiality and put his family at risk. This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election,  the nominee said from a written statement.Repeated references to activists and advocates on a  search and destroy  mission made it clear he considered them all to be enemies and fighting dirty. His exchanges with Democratic senators quickly deteriorated into bickering and recrimination. When one asked if he had blackouts from drinking, he shot back:  No, have you?  With much of the national audience having just responded to Ford s performance on TV, something like this scorched-earth defense may have been Kavanaugh s only chance. It may have been the one way to prevent Republican defections. It may have been the one way to keep the White House on his side.So the long-term effects that such a confirmation conflagration could have for Kavanaugh on the court   or for the court itself   were subordinated.The process was a  national disgrace,  Kavanaugh said, despite the fact the process was being run by the majority party, the party of the president   the party of Kavanaugh himself.And that may have been part of the problem, or perhaps the root of the problem. Kavanaugh clearly believed he was being targeted for torture by Democrats resentful of his record not as a judge, but as a lawyer for the GOP   and not just any party lawyer, but a key player at moments of maximum sensitivity still raw in the memory.That was behind his remark about the  revenge of the Clintons.  He was not just referring to Democratic resentment of Hillary Clinton s loss in 2016, but also the bitterness from President Bill Clinton s impeachment in 1998. Kavanaugh worked for independent counsel Kenneth Starr, whose wide-ranging probe of the president exposed an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. As a young lawyer on Starr s team, Kavanaugh pushed for explicit inquiries about sex acts and urged Starr to author a tough report.Shortly thereafter, Kavanaugh worked for George W. Bush s campaign in the disputed Florida recount of 2000 and later as his White House staff secretary, reviewing a variety of sensitive issues and documents   another source of friction with Judiciary Committee Democrats who wanted to see these archival items.As a result, Kavanaugh s first judicial appointment by Bush in 2003 was held up for three years and needed special interparty negotiations to be approved in 2006. It s just possible the memory of all that has not left Kavanaugh s hippocampus, either.All judges have some political affiliation, of course, and always have had. But it had been something to play down   something to all but deny. In the not so distant past, nearly every nominee actively sought bipartisan love.When asked about contentious cases, such as the landmark abortion case of Roe v. Wade, nominees were expected to decline to indicate which way they would rule. They were to do so even if they had given strong indications of their view of the case in the past. And yes, even if those very indications were a big part of the reason they got nominated to the Supreme Court.They were to be judges first and last, and judicial to the bone. The preference was for veterans of law schools and appeals courts who had never run for office or been too sullied by those who had.But in the new age of judicial confirmation by simple majority, immune from filibuster, reaching across the aisle is no longer imperative; it s optional. Support from the minority party is nice, but no longer required.Last year, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell banned filibusters on appointments for the Supreme Court, extending the previous rule for presidential appointments established by Democrats in 2013. That made it possible to confirm Trump s first high court pick, Neil Gorsuch, with just a simple majority.So now, and presumably henceforward, there will be far less incentive to seek help from across the aisle   either as a nominee or as a Senate leader.And if this week s spectacle is a guide, the ease of the Gorsuch confirmation will be the exception.That had been the general presumption for 30 years, and it worked for nominees in both parties   with two egregious exceptions. The ghosts of both those exceptions were present in the hearing room this week.The first ghost was totally expected. It dates to 1991 and the hearings for Clarence Thomas. Thomas was pulled back from the brink of confirmation after charges of sexual harassment were lodged by his former subordinate, Anita Hill. The parallels between that confrontation and Ford s charge of sexual assault were widely noted and revisited in the media.Thomas fought back not only by denying Hill s stories, but by accusing the committee (composed of all white males) of a  high-tech lynching.  Although both Hill and Thomas are African-Americans, the race issue helped him hold enough Democrats to be confirmed.The other ghost that appeared was less immediately relevant, but Kavanaugh s strategy conjured its spirit before the day was out. This second apparition dates from 1987, when Ronald Reagan used his third Supreme Court vacancy to appoint appellate court Judge Robert Bork.Reagan s first two picks installed the court s first woman (Sandra Day O Connor) and the man who would become its conservative anchor (Antonin Scalia). Both were confirmed by the Senate unanimously.But Bork was a different kind of conservative. An originalist like Scalia, he was more openly combative in handling contentious issues. His cerebral performance in his hearings delighted conservatives but dismayed the Democrats, who had taken majority control of the Senate the previous year.Bork also had a far more political history than most court candidates. As the U.S. solicitor general in the Justice Department of President Richard Nixon, Bork played a pivotal part in the Watergate scandal saga. When Nixon s attorney general and deputy attorney general both refused to fire the independent counsel investigating Nixon s re-election campaign in the fall of 1973, Bork stepped in as acting attorney general and did the job.Although he did not remain long in the attorney general role, the memory of Bork s willingness to serve the embattled Nixon was, for many, a lingering stain.Edward Kennedy and other liberals on the committee hounded Bork in committee on civil rights, affirmative action, abortion and women s rights. Their media campaign demonized him as no Supreme Court campaign had before. He lost in committee and made an emotional, highly partisan appeal for reconsideration on the Senate floor. But there, too, he lost.Since then, presidents in both parties have sought nominees who, whatever their ideology, presented a less partisan profile. Even Gorsuch fit that description. And for a time it appeared that Kavanaugh might manage his own version of it.But in the end, the Kavanaugh who emerged late Thursday was more like the indignant Clarence Thomas and the unbowed Robert Bork. In the new environment, that may get him confirmed. And if he takes that seat on the high court, it may herald a new and difficult day for that institution as well as for the Senate."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/27/652330874/everyone-is-just-completely-captivated-americans-react-to-ford-and-kavanaugh,"Across the U.S., people spent the day rapt, watching or listening to the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.The proceedings were emotional throughout, as Ford told the story of the sexual assault that she alleges Kavanaugh made against her when the two were in high school, more than 30 years ago.Once Kavanaugh took the stand, the hearing became contentious and angry as well. The scene was intense: A single room on Capitol Hill was suddenly both the symbol and a microcosm of national divisions.Reporters for public radio stations across the U.S. spoke with people to hear their reactions to the day s dramatic proceedings. Here are perspectives from a few of those they spoke with.Boston I watched the clip of it on TV. [Ford] is totally believable,  said Ann Lynch, in Boston s Back Bay neighborhood.  She breaks my heart. But Lynch said she thought that Kavanaugh would still be confirmed:  It s happened before, with Clarence Thomas, and I don t think the world has changed that much. Derek Fortin shared that sentiment. I thought it was compelling and sad that someone ... had this trauma that s happened to her,  he said.  I mean, she s clearly credible, but then again I think no woman in their right mind would ever, ever make a lie like that. He also believes Kavanaugh will be confirmed:  Unfortunately, yes. I think we re at a point where it doesn t really matter what people say. But Alvero Farias thought it would be hard to see Kavanaugh on the bench now. Given that people probably lost a lot of trust in him,  said Farius.  And it would be hard to justify   these allegations are coming up about him, but not other people   how do they justify putting him in such an important role? So hopefully not, it wouldn t be him. I m sure they could find another Republican who doesn t have such a record. Boulder, Colo. Everyone is just completely captivated by it,  said Kelly King Joyce, a third-year student at the University of Colorado Law School.  Even with the election in 2016, I didn t feel that sense of captivation. Adrian Untermyer, a second-year student at the law school, is one of those who were riveted. I listened to the beginning of the hearing in my car, and then I frantically put on my headphones for the few seconds when I d be walking into the building,  said Untermyer.  It seems like a lot of the frustration in the country is bubbling over and being channeled into this confirmation hearing and it really pulls from every thread of the political discussion. PhoenixIn Phoenix, Kelly Moore said that she found Kavanaugh to be more believable. For them to wait this long, for them to come forward and these women to make these allegations ... it just is a huge red flag for me,  she said.  Because being a woman, if something gets done to me, or something negative happens to me, I m not going to be one that s going to keep my mouth shut, especially if this person is a public figure like he s been for all these years.  I think that he should probably withdraw his nomination, and then probably also resign,  said Sam Kacprowicz.  But at the very least, there needs to be an FBI investigation in the matter.  It s very important to get the right person,  said Kirk Nicodemus, in nearby Scottsdale.  If you look at Kavanaugh s history, in his voting and what he s done for the community, he s done a very good job. He s been pretty much a role model. But you know, you have stuff like this, and that doesn t mean it didn t happen, and that doesn t mean it can just go away.  Time will tell,  he said,  and I think it s important for people to hear both sides. Monica Nicodemus, his wife, said that watching the morning s testimony,  you could definitely tell that Miss Ford was going through a lot of pain and suffering. It was nice to see that the committee was treating her with respect and kindness.  I would like them to do an FBI investigation,  she added.  I m not quite sure what the holdup is about that. I don t understand why that hasn t already taken place. But for Jerry Hall, speaking to a reporter in Phoenix on Thursday afternoon, bigger doubts remain. I hope we get to the bottom,  he said.  I don t know if the process is strong enough to work for us. WGBH s Maggie Penman reported from Boston, Dan Boyce reported from Boulder, and KJZZ s Will Stone reported from Arizona."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/28/652239571/brett-kavanaugh-offers-fiery-defense-in-hearing-that-was-a-national-cultural-mom,"Across the country, Americans were transfixed Thursday by television coverage of Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh as they testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ford spoke of her allegation that the Supreme Court nominee had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers in 1982. Kavanaugh vehemently denied it.Such was the drama that President Trump put off a scheduled meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, with the White House issuing a statement that the president  spoke with Rod Rosenstein ... and they plan to meet next week. They do not want to do anything to interfere with the hearing. After hours of emotional testimony and sometimes fiery rhetoric, the day ended with a presidential tweet. Trump praised Kavanaugh, calling the federal appeals court judge s testimony  powerful, honest, and riveting.  While Trump s comment was meant as a positive review of his nominee s testimony, it also served as a succinct headline for the entire proceeding.The next step comes Friday when the Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court.Here are four takeaways from the hearing:1. A cultural, historical and legal momentSince the allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh were first reported in the media in recent weeks, comparisons with the 1991 Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings have been everywhere. The hearing Thursday delivered even more fodder for the conversation.At the start of the hearing with Ford, Sen. Dianne Feinstein recounted how 27 years ago she was passing through an airport when she  saw a large group of people gathered around a TV to listen to Anita Hill tell her story.  At the time Feinstein was a former mayor. Today she is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. In 1992, she was one of a record number of women elected in Congress in the  year of the woman. When Hill testified before the then-all male Judiciary Committee, there was no social media, no Twitterverse or Facebook friends. Thursday, there were four women on the Democratic side of the dais, and Americans were watching not just on TVs in airports and bars, but also in parks and streets and even subways on their smartphones.In 1991, there was also no #MeToo movement, the vast cultural and legal reckoning of the past year on the issue of sexual misconduct that has toppled several powerful men in media, entertainment and business   and even the onetime federal appeals court judge Alex Kozinski, whom Kavanaugh clerked for early in the 1990s.What will the long-term effects of Thursday s hearing be? Will history record the hearing as an inflection point that changed the Supreme Court confirmation process? Will it change how the public thinks about sexual assault allegations?2. Kavanaugh s opening: angry, fiery, emotionalBrett Kavanaugh, his nomination to the Supreme Court on the line, gave an opening statement of some 45 minutes in which he angrily denounced the charges against him, showing much more emotion than he did in the initial round of questioning earlier this month or during his interview on Fox News earlier this week. He not only denied being at a party with Ford, but blasted his confirmation process as politicized, declaring,    Advice and consent  has been replaced with  search and destroy.   What was also striking was his harsh and very un-Supreme-Court-like denunciations of Democrats on the committee and his assertion that the opposition to his confirmation  amounted to revenge on behalf of the Clintons.  Kavanaugh served as a staff attorney on independent counsel Kenneth Starr s investigation of President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.As with much of Thursday s proceeding, Kavanaugh s anger and defiance echoed with the 1991 confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas when Anita Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment. Back then, Thomas decried his situation as a  high-tech lynching. The defiant tone Kavanaugh set for his defense won praise from the president immediately as the hearing ended.  Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him. His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting,  Trump tweeted.  Democrats  search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist. The Senate must vote! 3. Ford s testimony elicits outpouring of #MeToo storiesFrom calls to C-SPAN from women who told their own stories of being sexually assaulted to a surge in calls to the National Sexual Assault Hotline, Ford s testimony evoked an outpouring of women telling their own stories of surviving sexual misconduct and sexual violence. As the Washington Post reported:It s a phenomenon that began last week, when President Trump seemed to question via Twitter why Ford hadn t reported her alleged assault at the time some 36 years ago.Responding to Trump, social media users flooded Twitter and other online platforms such as Facebook sharing their stories and using the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport.4. Did bringing in an outside expert to question Ford backfire?A bit of second-guessing that began early in the hearing was about the decision by Republicans on the committee to use an outside expert on sex crimes to question Ford. They were in a difficult position, in terms of optics, as the GOP contingent on the panel consists of 11 white men.The expert, Rachel Mitchell, sat behind a desk in front of the GOP side, the 11 men looming behind her. And from the start, she was faced with a difficult task. Her questioning of Ford was limited to five-minute increments, after which she would have to stop and interrupt her line of inquiry in order to allow a Democratic senator to go next and speak with Ford, as the Democrats on the committee used their allotted time to question Ford directly.At the end of the questioning of Ford, Mitchell, the head of the sex crimes unit at the Maricopa County Attorney s Office in Arizona, acknowledged what had become obvious: that there is  no study that says that this setting in five-minute increments is the best way  to question a victim of sexual assault.Beyond that though, it was not clear what Mitchell was trying to ascertain or accomplish. Ford s fear of flying was one area that Mitchell homed in on, getting Ford to admit that, despite her concerns and reluctance to fly to Washington for an interview by the committee, she had flown for vacations and professional conferences.There were also a number of questions to try to determine who paid for the polygraph test that Ford took, in what seemed to be an effort to find out if Ford had a financial backer. Ford s attorneys told the panel that they paid for the polygraph and that they were representing her pro bono.Mitchell began the questioning of Kavanaugh as well, but Republican senators soon decided to ask their own questions and use their time to defend Trump s high court nominee. It was a marked shift from Republicans  hesitancy to question Ford. Through the final stretch of the hearing, Mitchell was not given the opportunity to probe Kavanaugh s testimony as she was with Ford s."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/28/652203139/should-we-teach-about-consent-in-k-12-brett-kavanaughs-home-state-says-yes,"When the Access Hollywood tape of Donald Trump, along with sexual assault stories involving Brock Turner and Bill Cosby, hit the news back in 2016, a middle school student in Maryland named Maeve Sanford-Kelly was listening. I was frankly really distraught,  she recalls.  I felt powerless. I assumed that this was what happened, that sexual harassment and sexual assault was a thing in our society and it wasn t going to change because it was part of the power structure. Her mother had an idea that might help. Ariana Kelly, a Democrat, is a delegate in the Maryland state legislature, and she introduced a bill that would require the state to include consent in sex ed classes. Maeve and her friends, as well as student groups across the state, campaigned and testified for the bill. It defines consent as  the unambiguous and voluntary agreement between all participants in each physical act within the course of interpersonal relationships. Before they turn 18, about 8 percent of girls and 0.7 percent of boys experience rape or attempted rape, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the majority of these reported cases, the CDC says, the perpetrator is a peer: either an acquaintance or a current or former intimate partner.And yet few schools across the country are required to teach about consent or healthy relationships in sex ed classes.Currently, according to a report in May by the Center for American Progress, under a dozen states mention the terms  healthy relationships,   sexual assault  or  consent  in their sex education programs.But with the #MeToo movement, that might be changing. Since the beginning of 2018, five states besides Maryland have introduced bills to require the teaching of consent in sex ed.Amy Tiemann is a neuroscientist and educator and co-author of a new book on child safety, Doing Right By Our Kids. She works with KidPower, a child safety education group. She says the message of respect for others and your own body can be made simple and empowering even for young children. They can be 3 years old, they can be 15 years old, they can be in college, and we don t know who might be a potential perpetrator or who might be a potential victim someday,  she says.  And people can be both. In KidPower s training and materials, Tiemann adds, they emphasize a few key messages:Alan Berkowitz is a psychologist and expert on sexual assault prevention. He said that one approach to consent education, backed by a lot of research, is to use positive social norms. One of the most powerful ways of encouraging young people to make healthy decisions is to know the truth about their friends, because in fact most of their friends are healthy. He says that, for example,  Boys may think their friends enjoy hearing about sexual exploits and talking about girls and women s bodies,  but research shows, in most peer groups, a silent majority disapproves and is uncomfortable. For that reason, he says, effective consent education also focuses on the role of bystanders in speaking up.Kelly s bill failed the first time it was submitted. Similar bills have faltered recently in Massachusetts, Mississippi, Utah, and Virginia, with opposing voices, both Democrats and Republicans, arguing that explaining consent is tantamount to condoning sex, while others say the topic should be the province of families, not schools.But the Maryland law passed on a second try. Schools in Montgomery County, where Maeve is now in ninth grade, are now using resources like a viral video that compares consent to a cup of tea.Maeve and her mother Ariana Kelly both see reasons to hope for change in this generation   not just because of what teachers will be teaching, but what students themselves are saying. Kelly says she s found it especially heartwarming to see teenage boys speak up  passionately  about this issue.Teenagers like Matt Post, who at age 16 campaigned for the bill, and recruited friends to do so as well.  Guys cannot relegate themselves to the sidelines on this issue,  he says.  Ending misogyny starts with us.  Today, Post is a first-year at Yale University, Judge Brett Kavanaugh s alma mater   a place that s been under the microscope recently for the behavior of its male students. He says that while things seem to have improved somewhat from decades ago, what he calls rape culture is still around, and many of his peers have gaps in their understanding of healthy relationships. They don t understand the ongoing nature of consent. They don t understand that a incapacitated yes is not really a yes,  he says.  I think it s still sort of a mixed bag and I think it s because of when we were respectively taught these lessons. He hopes more education, starting as young as kindergarten, can help.So does Maeve Sanford-Kelly. Sexual assault is once again in the news, and it hits her close to home, with the Kavanaugh allegations set in suburban Maryland. She s seen many friends posting on social media about affirmative consent and with messages of support for survivors. It brings me joy to see that all of the kids who are my age, even the ones who could be seen as comparable to [Kavanaugh], go to the same schools, living in the same environment, are different. And I think that is positive change that we have seen. "

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/27/651913481/kavanaugh-and-ford-will-testify-today-heres-what-you-need-to-know,"Updated at 7:50 a.m. ET Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, along with the American public, are hearing, for the first time, on Thursday directly from Christine Blasey Ford, the university professor who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were both teenagers in high school.She and Kavanaugh will both testify under oath, in public. The stakes couldn t be higher; a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court may rest on whose account senators believe. Nearly 6 in 10 Americans say they plan to follow the hearings closely, with many yet to make up their minds, according to an NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll.Since Ford s accusation first came to light, two other women have come forward to accuse Kavanaugh of improper sexual conduct. And while the hearing will focus on events that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, it will be viewed through the prism of America in 2018 and the deep fault lines over gender, politics and culture in the era of Donald Trump and #MeToo.The Judiciary Committee released excerpts of Kavanaugh and Ford s prepared testimony Thursday. Ford will say,  I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school. In his prepared remarks, Kavanaugh admits,  I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now. But that s not why we are here today. What I ve been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior. I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes. President Trump has said that Ford s testimony should be heard and that he will be watching. He has also called the allegations against Kavanaugh  a disgrace to the country,  and  a big, fat con job.  Trump says it will be reflected in the upcoming midterm elections.How did we get here?When Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement shortly after the end of the Supreme Court s 2017-2018 term, Trump quickly nominated the 53-year-old Kavanaugh, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the post, praising him as  one of the finest and sharpest legal minds in our time. During his confirmation hearings earlier this month, the conservative Kavanaugh, who served as a top legal aide during the George W. Bush administration and worked with independent counsel Ken Starr on the investigation into President Bill Clinton s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, promised to be an independent jurist and  a team player on the Team of Nine.  Democrats tried without success to draw out Kavanaugh s beliefs on a range of issues from executive power to abortion rights.Kavanaugh, meanwhile, proudly pointed to the numbers of female court clerks he had hired, many of whom have gone on to clerk at the Supreme Court, as well as the girls  basketball team he coached and the influence of strong women in his life, starting with his mother, a retired judge.It seemed as though outnumbered Democrats could do little but watch as Kavanaugh s nomination sailed ahead, possibly reshaping the high court for a generation.But that all changed after the confirmation hearings, when reports surfaced that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., received a letter in July from a California woman who charged that she had been sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh in the early 1980s. Christine Blasey Ford had asked for anonymity in the letter that she sent to Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, through her congresswoman, Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif. Feinstein passed the accusations along to the FBI.As the press got wind of the letter, Ford revealed her identity by speaking to The Washington Post in a story published on Sept. 16.Democrats demanded the FBI investigate the alleged incident, but the White House has refused to ask for the bureau s help. The Judiciary Committee, however, did agree to allow Ford to testify before them and originally set the hearing date for Monday. But after Ford s lawyers said their client couldn t arrange her appearance on such short notice, they agreed to convene the hearing on Thursday.What are the accusations?There are currently three women on the record with allegations, including Ford, as well as two others without names attached that the Judiciary Committee has questioned Kavanaugh about. Ford is the only accuser who will testify, though Kavanaugh is likely to be asked about all of the accusations.Kavanaugh has categorically denied all the allegations, including while under oath while being questioned by Senate Judiciary Committee staff. What will happen at the hearing? The Senate Judiciary Committee has convened at 10 a.m. ET on Thursday, and they will first hear from Ford, who has requested that Kavanaugh not be present for her testimony, followed by Kavanaugh.At the start of the hearing, Grassley and Feinstein will each give an opening statement. Ford and Kavanaugh will each be sworn in under oath and give their opening statements.Next, the 21 senators on the committee   11 Republicans, 10 Democrats   will get five minutes each to question both witnesses.For Senate Republicans, questioning her was a problematic issue. There are no GOP women on the Judiciary Committee, and having 11 white men questioning an alleged victim of a sex crime presented an optics issue to say the least. So they went outside the Senate, and hired what Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called a  female assistant. She is Rachel Mitchell, who according to a statement issued by committee Grassley is a  widely recognized expert on the investigation and prosecution of sex crimes,  who has worked in the Maricopa County Attorney s Office in Phoenix.The Republican senators can defer to Mitchell in turn for their individual five minute questioning opportunities, but they can also decide to ask their own questions if they want.Democratic senators plan to conduct their own questioning of Ford and Kavanaugh. It s possible that some Democrats will yield their time to one of the former prosecutors on the panel, including Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.With breaks allowed upon requests from the witnesses, the hearing could go on for several hours.What happens after the hearing?Much will depend on the hearing itself.Grassley has already posted notice of a committee vote on the Kavanaugh nomination Friday morning, before the nomination would go to the full Senate for final approval or disapproval.Democrats are demanding they hear from other women who have stepped forward, including Ramirez and Swetnick, and have a fuller investigation involving the FBI before a vote. Grassley has cautioned the Friday vote is not certain to happen.  If we re ready to vote, we will vote. If we aren t ready, we won t,  he said on Twitter.Ultimately Kavanaugh s fate appears to sit in the hands of a trio of undecided GOP senators: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona.If they are convinced by Kavanaugh s testimony, Republicans will likely have the votes to confirm. If they are not, it s likely Kavanaugh s nomination would go down   either because it would be withdrawn or in a vote on the Senate floor."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/27/651133323/watch-live-kavanaugh-ford-testify-about-sexual-assault-allegation,"Updated at 8:47 p.m. ETJudge Brett Kavanaugh was defiant and visibly angry as he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday afternoon, rebutting earlier emotional testimony from the woman who has accused him of sexual assault, Christine Blasey Ford.Departing from his prepared statement he had submitted to the committee the night before, Kavanaugh cast himself as the victim of a political smear campaign driven by the partisan divide in the country. This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit,  Kavanaugh said,  fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record and revenge on behalf of the Clintons. Kavanaugh s decision to cast the accusations against him as a political gambit sounded downright Trumpian, and shortly after his testimony concluded just before 7 p.m., President Trump tweeted he was pleased with the way his nominee performed, while making no mention of how he felt about Ford s testimony.After a meeting Thursday night of the entire Republican Senate conference, committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the panel will proceed Friday morning with its planned meeting and the committee will vote then on Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court, according to multiple GOP congressional aides. Democrats on the committee have continued calling for a delay, seeking to have the FBI investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.Throughout Thursday s hearing, Kavanaugh vigorously denied the allegations and acknowledged that his nomination could be in jeopardy. But Kavanaugh said he was determined to press forward anyway. You may defeat me in the final vote, but you ll never get me to quit. Never,  he emphasized.Two other women have also come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct, and Kavanaugh said this has  destroyed my family and my good name.  He also pushed back against Democrats on the committee, arguing they have made a mockery of their responsibility in confirming Supreme Court justices. This confirmation process has become a national disgrace. ... You have replaced  advice and consent  with  search and destroy,    Kavanaugh said.At the end of his nearly 45-minute opening statement   twice the length of Ford s   Kavanaugh was emphatic again in his denial:  I swear today under oath, before the Senate and the nation, before my family and God   I am innocent of this charge. The high-stakes hearing will help determine whether President Trump s effort to remake the nation s highest court with the conservative jurist to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy is successful. The testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh   accuser and accused   comes after a year in which the rise and the cultural influence of the #MeToo movement has raised sensitivity to the accounts of sexual assault victims, a significant cultural shift since 1991 when Anita Hill testified before the Judiciary Committee about her allegations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas during his confirmation process.Speaking Wednesday during a news conference, Trump said the allegations against Kavanaugh  are all false to me.  But the president indicated he would be watching Ford s testimony to determine whether she is believable and even suggested he might withdraw the nomination based on what occurred Thursday. In those same remarks, the president also defended Kavanaugh and criticized the multiple allegations against the judge as a  big, fat con job  perpetrated by Democrats trying to stop the confirmation of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court.Kavanaugh s initial indignant approach stood in stark contrast to Ford s testimony earlier in the hearing. Fighting back tears, she described how Kavanaugh had allegedly sexually assaulted her at a house party when they were both in high school in the early 1980s. I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school,  Ford told the committee.During his testimony, Kavanaugh eventually choked up multiple times. One point where he was especially emotional was in talking about the toll the accusations have taken on his family, particularly his two young daughters. He teared up as he said his 10-year-old daughter, when saying her bedtime prayers, said they should pray for Ford.  We mean no ill will,  Kavanaugh said, and he said he believed Ford may have been a victim of sexual assault at one point in her life   just not by him.Ford said she didn t remember all of the specifics such as the date or place of the alleged attack, which has led some to question the veracity of her claims. But, with her voice cracking, she did recall certain vivid details, adding:  Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense. Ford also said the details she does remember  about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult. When she was 15 and Kavanaugh was 17, Ford said the two ended up at the same party. Ford said she had one beer, while Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge,  were visibly drunk.  When she went upstairs to use the bathroom, Kavanaugh and Judge pushed her into a bedroom and locked the door. Ford said Kavanaugh pushed her onto the bed and  began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me.  I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me,  Ford said.Kavanaugh admitted that he drank in high school    sometimes I had too many beers. I liked beer. I still like beer    but said he  did not drink beer to the point of blacking out, and I never sexually assaulted anyone.  If every American who drinks beer or drank beer in high school is suddenly presumed guilty of sexual assault in high school, it will be an ugly place in this country,  Kavanaugh said.He also presented calendars he kept during high school   a practice he compared to a diary that he modeled after his father s own habit   and said they showed he was often out of town during the summer in question when Ford alleges the assault occurred.Ford also insisted she had no political agenda in coming forward with her accusations, telling lawmakers,  I am an independent person and I am no one s pawn.  The hearing got off to a tense start, exposing the deep partisan divides that have colored the accusations from Ford and two other women. Grassley first acknowledged that Kavanaugh, Ford and their families have  received vile threats  since the allegations became public. What they have endured ought to be considered by all of us as unacceptable and a poor reflection on the state of civility in our democracy,  Grassley said.But then he went on to chastise the committee s ranking member, Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., for a delay in giving the full committee the private letter setting forth the allegations against Kavanaugh that she received back in July from Ford, who is a constituent of Feinstein s in California. Ford had first requested that her allegations remain private, but as she later told the committee, when it became clear her name would be public, she then told her story to The Washington Post. Grassley also pointed out that many of the witnesses Ford has identified deny that the party in question took place. He also defended hiring Rachel Mitchell, an outside attorney, to assist with questioning during Thursday s hearing, saying he saw  no basis for complaint [from Democrats] other than just plain politics.  Mitchell is a sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona who has pushed for best practices in investigations to protect and serve victims of assault.Feinstein pushed back during her subsequent remarks, pointing out that most sexual assaults go unreported and that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 6 men will experience some form of sexual violence in their lives.She warned colleagues that  the entire country is watching how we handle these allegations  and criticized a  rush to judgment  on the allegations and quick push for confirmation, calling it a  real question of character for someone who is asking for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court.  This is not a trial for Dr. Ford. This is a job interview for Brett Kavanaugh,  Feinstein said, asking,  Is he the best we can do? The hearing alternated somewhat awkwardly between Republican senators ceding their time to Mitchell   who questioned Ford about her past statements to the media and her specific memories about the circumstances of the alleged assault   and the Democratic senators speaking directly to Ford, mostly praising her courage. With her questions, the prosecutor tried to poke holes in Ford s fear of flying, which Ford said was triggered by PTSD following the alleged assault. And Mitchell pressed Ford about the polygraph she took to back up her claims   and which Ford revealed she took outside Baltimore just after she had attended her grandmother s funeral. Ford explained how the alleged incident had affected her throughout her life   from struggling academically during her undergraduate years at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill to difficulty in forming relationships and friendships and ultimately pressing for a second front door during a remodel of her California home.Near the end of her questioning, Mitchell reminded Ford that the other people she identified as being at the party have told the committee, under penalty of felony, that they did not remember the gathering or the incident in question. I don t expect that P.J. and Leland would remember this evening,  Ford responded.  It was a very unremarkable party ... because nothing happened to them that evening. Democratic senators used their time to largely reiterate their support for Ford, bemoan how she was being treated and criticize that a further probe by the FBI   as Ford has requested   was not undertaken.  You have given America an amazing teaching moment,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told the college professor.  You have inspired and you have enlightened America. You have inspired and given courage to women to come forward, as they have done to every one of our offices and many other public places. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., noted he was also in the Senate during hearings that have drawn obvious parallels to this one   Hill s testimony during the 1991 Thomas confirmation hearings.Leahy said the Senate  failed  Hill back then and  I am concerned we are doing a lot less for these three women today. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a former district attorney and state attorney general, told Ford,  I believe you, and I believe many Americans across this country believe you. When it was time to question Kavanaugh, Democrats pressed him about the contents of his high school calendars and yearbook quotations, which had references to drinking games and partying.Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., grilled Kavanaugh on whether he would submit to an FBI investigation into the allegations, as Democrats want. He said he would go along with whatever the committee wants   the panel s Republican majority does not think an FBI inquiry is necessary   but never said on record that he would call for an FBI investigation himself.When Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., pressed Kavanaugh about his drinking habits, he tried to turn the question back on the lawmaker and ask about her drinking. After a recess, Kavanaugh apologized for how he handled that line of questioning.Grassley ceded his questioning time to Mitchell, who forcefully pressed Kavanaugh on his denials and his drinking habits, but then several others   unlike with their opportunity to question Ford   took their allotted time to condemn how Kavanaugh has been treated. It was a marked shift from Republicans  hesitancy to question Ford, cognizant of how a group of men pressing a woman on her claims of sexual assault might come across. (There are six GOP women in the Senate, but none sit on the Judiciary Committee.) Through the final stretch of the hearing, Mitchell was not given the opportunity to probe Kavanaugh s testimony as she was with Ford s.South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham was the first GOP senator to use his time to address Kavanaugh, and he angrily lashed out at Democrats on the committee for stonewalling the nomination. You ve got nothing to apologize for,  Graham told Kavanaugh.  This is the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics. And if you really wanted to know the truth, you sure as hell wouldn t have done what you ve done to this guy.  Graham accused Democrats of simply trying to keep the vacant Supreme Court seat open until at least the midterm elections when they hope they might gain control of the Senate, exclaiming,  Boy, y all want power. I hope you never get it.  This is not a job interview. This is hell,  Graham said, riffing on an earlier comment by Feinstein.  This is going to destroy the ability of good people to come forward because of this crap. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn also used his time after Graham to talk to Kavanaugh, comparing the allegations and questions that the Supreme Court nominee has had to face to the infamous 1954 McCarthy hearings that were purportedly aimed at rooting out communism in the U.S.Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said,  this is worse than [failed Reagan Supreme Court nominee] Robert Bork and I didn t think it could get any worse than that. This is worse than Clarence Thomas, and I didn t think it could get any worse than that. Retiring Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake   a frequent Trump critic who has shown sympathy toward Ford   is a critical swing vote on both the committee and in the full Senate. The Republican s comments toward Kavanaugh were brief and he gave no hint of how he might vote, simply saying that,  In the end, there is likely to be as much doubt as certainty  about whether Ford or Kavanaugh is telling the truth.The Judiciary Committee released a timeline late Wednesday night that indicated it had interviewed two men who believed they, not Kavanaugh, were the ones in the episode described by Ford.Ford categorically denied that could have been possible, saying she was  100 percent  certain that it was Kavanaugh who allegedly assaulted her.The psychology professor explained clinically how what happened to her more than three decades ago was  seared  in her memory   especially the laughter as Kavanaugh and Judge allegedly held her to the bed, trapped. Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense,  Ford said.Thursday s hearing on Capitol Hill drew widespread, passionate interest. Both actress Alyssa Milano   who has been an advocate for sexual assault survivors after speaking up about her own assault   and New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand were in the hearing room in the Dirksen Senate Office Building as guests of Democrats on the Judiciary Committee .There were protesters and demonstrators next door in the Hart Senate Office Building   mostly women with some men, the majority of whom are opposing Kavanaugh s nomination.NPR s Scott Detrow and Art Silverman contributed to this report.

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/26/651941113/read-christine-blasey-fords-opening-statement-for-senate-hearing,"Christine Blasey Ford has accused Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school in the early 1980s. On Thursday the psychology professor is testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Read her opening statement below.Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, Members of the Committee. My name is Christine Blasey Ford. I am a Professor of Psychology at Palo Alto University and a Research Psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine. I was an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina and earned my degree in Experimental Psychology in 1988. I received a Master s degree in 1991 in Clinical Psychology from Pepperdine University. In 1996, I received a PhD in Educational Psychology from the University of Southern California. I earned a Master s degree in Epidemiology from the Stanford University School of Medicine in 2009.I have been married to Russell Ford since 2002 and we have two children.I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school. I have described the events publicly before. I summarized them in my letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, and again in my letter to Chairman Grassley. I understand and appreciate the importance of your hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact it has had on my life and on my family.I grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. I attended the Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland, from 1980 to 1984. Holton-Arms is an all-girls school that opened in 1901. During my time at the school, girls at Holton-Arms frequently met and became friendly with boys from all-boys schools in the area, including Landon School, Georgetown Prep, Gonzaga High School, country clubs, and other places where kids and their families socialized. This is how I met Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me.In my freshman and sophomore school years, when I was 14 and 15 years old, my group of friends intersected with Brett and his friends for a short period of time. I had been friendly with a classmate of Brett s for a short time during my freshman year, and it was through that connection that I attended a number of parties that Brett also attended. We did not know each other well, but I knew him and he knew me. In the summer of 1982, like most summers, I spent almost every day at the Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase, Maryland swimming and practicing diving.One evening that summer, after a day of swimming at the club, I attended a small gathering at a house in the Chevy Chase/Bethesda area. There were four boys I remember being there: Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, P.J. Smyth, and one other boy whose name I cannot recall. I remember my friend Leland Ingham attending. I do not remember all of the details of how that gathering came together, but like many that summer, it was almost surely a spur of the moment gathering. I truly wish I could provide detailed answers to all of the questions that have been and will be asked about how I got to the party, where it took place, and so forth. I don t have all the answers, and I don t remember as much as I would like to. But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult. When I got to the small gathering, people were drinking beer in a small living room on the first floor of the house. I drank one beer that evening. Brett and Mark were visibly drunk. Early in the evening, I went up a narrow set of stairs leading from the living room to a second floor to use the bathroom. When I got to the top of the stairs, I was pushed from behind into a bedroom. I couldn t see who pushed me. Brett and Mark came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them. There was music already playing in the bedroom. It was turned up louder by either Brett or Mark once we were in the room. I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on top of me. He began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me. I yelled, hoping someone downstairs might hear me, and tried to get away from him, but his weight was heavy. Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because he was so drunk, and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes. I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me. Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack. They both seemed to be having a good time. Mark was urging Brett on, although at times he told Brett to stop. A couple of times I made eye contact with Mark and thought he might try to help me, but he did not.During this assault, Mark came over and jumped on the bed twice while Brett was on top of me. The last time he did this, we toppled over and Brett was no longer on top of me. I was able to get up and run out of the room. Directly across from the bedroom was a small bathroom. I ran inside the bathroom and locked the door. I heard Brett and Mark leave the bedroom laughing and loudly walk down the narrow stairs, pin-balling off the walls on the way down. I waited and when I did not hear them come back up the stairs, I left the bathroom, ran down the stairs, through the living room, and left the house. I remember being on the street and feeling an enormous sense of relief that I had escaped from the house and that Brett and Mark were not coming after me.Brett s assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details. I did not want to tell my parents that I, at age 15, was in a house without any parents present, drinking beer with boys. I tried to convince myself that because Brett did not rape me, I should be able to move on and just pretend that it had never happened. Over the years, I told very few friends that I had this traumatic experience. I told my husband before we were married that I had experienced a sexual assault. I had never told the details to anyone until May 2012, during a couples counseling session. The reason this came up in counseling is that my husband and I had completed an extensive remodel of our home, and I insisted on a second front door, an idea that he and others disagreed with and could not understand. In explaining whyI wanted to have a second front door, I described the assault in detail. I recall saying that the boy who assaulted me could someday be on the U.S. Supreme Court and spoke a bit about his background. My husband recalls that I named my attacker as Brett Kavanaugh. After that May 2012 therapy session, I did my best to suppress memories of the assault because recounting the details caused me to relive the experience, and caused panic attacks and anxiety. Occasionally I would discuss the assault in individual therapy, but talking about it caused me to relive the trauma, so I tried not to think about it or discuss it. But over the years, I went through periods where I thought about Brett s attack. I confided in some close friends that I had an experience with sexual assault. Occasionally I stated that my assailant was a prominent lawyer or judge but I did not use his name. I do not recall each person I spoke to about Brett s assault, and some friends have reminded me of these conversations since the publication of The Washington Post story on September 16, 2018. But until July 2018, I had never named Mr.Kavanaugh as my attacker outside of therapy.This all changed in early July 2018. I saw press reports stating that Brett Kavanaugh was on the  short list  of potential Supreme Court nominees. I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh s conduct so that those considering his potential nomination would know about the assault.On July 6, 2018, I had a sense of urgency to relay the information to the Senate and the President as soon as possible before a nominee was selected. I called my congressional representative and let her receptionist know that someone on the President s shortlist had attacked me. I also sent a message to The Washington Post s confidential tip line. I did not use my name, but I provided the names of Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. I stated that Mr. Kavanaugh had assaulted me in the 1980s in Maryland. This was an extremely hard thing for me to do, but I felt I couldn t NOT do it. Over the next two days, I told a couple of close friends on the beach in California that Mr. Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted me. I was conflicted about whether to speak out.On July 9, 2018, I received a call from the office of Congresswoman Anna Eshoo after Mr. Kavanaugh had become the nominee. I met with her staff on July 11 and with her on July 13, describing the assault and discussing my fear about coming forward. Later, we discussed the possibility of sending a letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, who is one of my state s Senators, describing what occurred. My understanding is that Representative Eshoo s office delivered a copy of my letter to Senator Feinstein s office on July 30, 2018. The letter included my name, but requested that the letter be kept confidential.My hope was that providing the information confidentially would be sufficient to allow the Senate to consider Mr. Kavanaugh s serious misconduct without having to make myself, my family, or anyone s family vulnerable to the personal attacks and invasions of privacy we have faced since my name became public. In a letter on August 31, 2018, Senator Feinstein wrote that she would not share the letter without my consent. I greatly appreciated this commitment. All sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves whether their private experience is made public.As the hearing date got closer, I struggled with a terrible choice: Do I share the facts with the Senate and put myself and my family in the public spotlight? Or do I preserve our privacy and allow the Senate to make its decision on Mr. Kavanaugh s nomination without knowing the full truth about his past behavior? I agonized daily with this decision throughout August and early September 2018. The sense of duty that motivated me to reach out confidentially to The Washington Post, Representative Eshoo s office, and Senator Feinstein s office was always there, but my fears of the consequences of speaking out started to increase.During August 2018, the press reported that Mr. Kavanaugh s confirmation was virtually certain. His allies painted him as a champion of women s rights and empowerment. I believed that if I came forward, my voice would be drowned out by a chorus of powerful supporters. By the time of the confirmation hearings, I had resigned myself to remaining quiet and letting the Committee and the Senate make their decision without knowing what Mr. Kavanaugh had done to me.Once the press started reporting on the existence of the letter I had sent to Senator Feinstein, I faced mounting pressure. Reporters appeared at my home and at my job demanding information about this letter, including in the presence of my graduate students. They called my boss and coworkers and left me many messages, making it clear that my name would inevitably be released to the media. I decided to speak out publicly to a journalist who had responded to the tip I had sent to The Washington Post and who had gained my trust. It was important to me to describe the details of the assault in my own words.Since September 16, the date of The Washington Post story, I have experienced an outpouring of support from people in every state of this country. Thousands of people who have had their lives dramatically altered by sexual violence have reached out to share their own experiences with me and have thanked me for coming forward. We have received tremendous support from friends and our community.At the same time, my greatest fears have been realized ñ and the reality has been far worse than what I expected. My family and I have been the target of constant harassment and death threats. I have been called the most vile and hateful names imaginable. These messages, while far fewer than the expressions of support, have been terrifying to receive and have rocked me to my core. People have posted my personal information on the internet. This has resulted in additional emails, calls, and threats. My family and I were forced to move out of our home. Since September 16, my family and I have been living in various secure locales, with guards. This past Tuesday evening, my work email account was hacked and messages were sent out supposedly recanting my description of the sexual assault.Apart from the assault itself, these last couple of weeks have been the hardest of my life. I have had to relive my trauma in front of the entire world, and have seen my life picked apart by people on television, in the media, and in this body who have never met me or spoken with me. I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives. Those who say that do not know me. I am a fiercely independent person and I am no one s pawn. My motivation in coming forwardwas to provide the facts about how Mr. Kavanaugh s actions have damaged my life, so that you can take that into serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed. It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court. My responsibility is to tell the truth.I understand that the Majority has hired a professional prosecutor to ask me some questions, and I am committed to doing my very best to answer them. At the same time, because the Committee Members will be judging my credibility, I hope to be able to engage directly with each of you. At this point, I will do my best to answer your questions."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/26/651940992/read-brett-kavanaughs-opening-statement-for-senate-hearing,"On Thursday, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify on a sexual assault allegation by Christine Blasey Ford, who is also testifying. Read Kavanaugh s opening statement below, submitted to the panel on Wednesday.Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the Committee: Eleven days ago, Dr. Ford publicly accused me of committing a serious wrong more than 36 years ago when we were both in high school. I denied the allegation immediately, unequivocally, and categorically. The next day, I told this Committee that I wanted to testify as soon as possible, under oath, to clear my name.Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired. There has been a frenzy to come up with something anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious that will block a vote on my nomination. These are last-minute smears, pure and simple. They debase our public discourse. And the consequences extend beyond any one nomination. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination if allowed to succeed will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country.As I told this Committee the last time I appeared before you, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. That is the kind of judge I am and will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. This effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. I am here this morning to answer these allegations and to tell the truth. And the truth is that I have never sexually assaulted anyone not in high school, not in college, not ever.Sexual assault is horrific. It is morally wrong. It is illegal. It is contrary to my religious faith. And it contradicts the core promise of this Nation that all people are created equal and entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Allegations of sexual assault must be taken seriously. Those who make allegations deserve to be heard. The subject of allegations also deserves to be heard. Due process is a foundation of the American rule of law.Dr. Ford s allegation dates back more than 36 years, to a party that she says occurred during our time in high school. I spent most of my time in high school focused on academics, sports, church, and service. But I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now. But that s not why we are here today. What I ve been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior. I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes.The allegation of misconduct is completely inconsistent with the rest of my life. The record of my life, from my days in grade school through the present day, shows that I have always promoted the equality and dignity of women.I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford. I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford. I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time. But I have never done that to her or to anyone. I am innocent of this charge."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/26/651797758/judiciary-committee-review-new-sexual-misconduct-allegations-against-kavanaugh,"Updated at 8:59 p.m. ETThe Senate Judiciary Committee is reviewing a statement from a third woman who has come forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.The allegations, from a woman identified as Julie Swetnick, were made public by attorney Michael Avenatti on Wednesday morning. Avenatti posted Swetnick s three-page sworn declaration on Twitter.Hours later, the Senate Judiciary Committee released transcripts that revealed the panel also questioned Kavanaugh about two other accusations that were previously unknown.In the transcripts, Kavanaugh denies the allegations, which were made anonymously and without corroboration.On Wednesday, he also denied Swetnick s allegations. This is ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone,  he said in a statement released by the White House.  I don t know who this is and this never happened. NPR has not corroborated Swetnick s claims; attempts to contact her were not successful. The allegations further complicate a much-anticipated hearing scheduled for Thursday with Kavanaugh and another of his accusers, Christine Blasey Ford.Trump: New charges  ridiculous President Trump, who has been accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct, has strongly backed Kavanaugh even as more allegations have emerged against the high court nominee.Speaking to reporters in New York after a visit to the United Nations, Trump suggested he was open to changing his mind on Kavanaugh after Thursday s hearing, but at the same time he doubled down in his support for the federal appeals court judge. I m going to see what happens tomorrow. I m going to be watching. You know, believe it or not I m going to see what s said,  Trump said.  It s possible that they will be convincing. Now with all of that being said, Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been for many years, one of the most respected people in Washington. At the same time, he called the allegations  ridiculous  and repeated his counter-accusation that Democrats are playing a  con game. Trump also fired back on Twitter against Avenatti, who has become a political enemy since his suit against Trump on behalf of porn actress Stormy Daniels.Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court once appeared to be a sure thing. Those prospects now are left uncertain.New allegationsIn the sworn declaration posted on Twitter, Swetnick alleges that from 1981 to 1983, she went to several parties that Kavanaugh also attended.Swetnick writes that she observed Kavanaugh drunk, pressing himself against girls without their consent and engaging in other such behavior. Swetnick also writes that she was raped at one party that Kavanaugh attended.Judiciary Committee spokesman Taylor Foy said in a statement that the panel has received Swetnick s statement and is looking into the allegations. This morning Michael Avenatti provided a declaration to the Judiciary committee,  Foy said.  Committee lawyers are in the process of reviewing it now. The committee s minority Democrats, led by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, asked Trump on Wednesday to either direct the FBI to investigate the allegations or withdraw Kavanaugh s nomination.Two other allegations surfaced late Wednesday evening in transcripts released by the Judiciary Committee, which handles Supreme Court nominations. One accusation is anonymous and dates to 1998. A woman said in a letter sent to Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner that her daughter socialized with Kavanaugh at the time. She alleges that Kavanaugh shoved a woman against a wall after an evening of drinking at a bar.In the second allegation, a man accused Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge, of assaulting a woman in Newport, R.I., in August, 1985. The name of the man making the accusation was redacted. The transcript indicates that the accuser has an anti-Trump stance on Twitter.Kavanaugh addresses high school partiesThe Judiciary Committee posted a statement from Kavanaugh on Wednesday morning in which he acknowledged partying and drinking but denied any sexual impropriety. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends,  he wrote.  Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now. But that s not why we are here today. What I ve been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior. Those prepared comments to lawmakers echoed remarks that the federal appeals court judge made earlier this week in an interview that aired on Fox News. And yes, people might have had too many beers on occasion and people generally in high school   I think all of us have probably done things we look back on in high school and regret or cringe a bit, but that s not what we re talking about ...  We re talking about an allegation of sexual assault. I ve never sexually assaulted anyone. Some of Kavanaugh s classmates have said they remember him as a heavy drinker in high school and at college. Others have sprung to his defense: More than 60 of Kavanaugh s former classmates from high school signed a letter on Wednesday to the Judiciary Committee calling Swetnick s allegations  nonsense. A sure thing no moreSwetnick s allegations follow those of two other women who have said they were victims of sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh more than three decades ago, when they and he were in high school or college.The charges have disrupted what had appeared to be a sure confirmation for Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court following his hearings before the Judiciary Committee in early September, which took place before the sexual misconduct allegations became public.The allegations that appeared on Wednesday also further complicate a much-anticipated hearing scheduled for Thursday with Kavanaugh and another of his accusers, Christine Blasey Ford.Preparations continued for that session. An attorney for Ford sent the Judiciary Committee a report from a polygraph examination that Ford underwent in August.Later in the day, the Judiciary Committee posted Ford s prepared testimony. I am here today not because I want to be,  Ford plans to tell the committee, according to the document.  I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school. Opponents of Kavanaugh have called for the Judiciary Committee to hear testimony from the other accusers; Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has so far not agreed but he said on Twitter the committee is  talking to all witnesses & gathering all evidence. Grassley s post suggested federal investigators have been detailed to the committee from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The FBI, however   which Democrats say should investigate the claims by Kavanaugh s accusers   apparently is not involved.Another Judiciary Committee leader, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters at the Capitol that he d be open to Swetnick talking with the committee s professional staff, but it wasn t clear whether Grassley agreed or whether Swetnick might follow up with the committee in person.Partisan feud intensifiesSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he thinks Kavanaugh should bow out altogether. I strongly believe Judge Kavanaugh should withdraw from consideration,  he said.  If he will not, at the very least, the hearing and vote should be postponed while the FBI investigates all of these allegations. If our Republican colleagues proceed without an investigation, it would be a travesty for the honor of the Supreme Court and our country. Key Republicans said they thought the hearing scheduled for Thursday should go forward. It remains on the Judiciary Committee s schedule, as does a meeting scheduled for Friday at which the committee could vote on whether to recommend Kavanaugh to the full Senate.Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who does not sit on the Judiciary Committee but whose vote might be critical to confirming Kavanaugh, told reporters she wasn t familiar with Swetnick s allegations but that she thought Thursday s session should go ahead  because we ll find out some valuable information. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas agreed and called for the Thursday hearing to take place as planned. These most recent allegations don t have anything to do with Dr. Ford,  he said.Avenatti, a Trump antagonistIt wasn t clear how Avenatti had become involved with the Kavanaugh case, but he has spent months cutting out a role for himself as an antagonist of the president.He sued on behalf of Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, to escape a nondisclosure agreement she signed with Trump s then-lawyer, Michael Cohen. That kept alive Daniels  account of a sexual relationship with Trump in 2006, a story which Cohen has acknowledged paying her to not tell ahead of Election Day in 2016.Daniels also is telling her story in a book scheduled to be published in early October.Trump has acknowledged the payment to Daniels ahead of the election but denies underlying allegations about sexual relationships with Daniels and another woman, Karen McDougal.Avenatti also surfaced business relationships that Cohen forged with corporate clients early in the Trump administration. Trump s onetime personal lawyer was paid because he said he could provide access to Trump for companies such as AT&T and Novartis.NPR correspondents Scott Detrow, Kelsey Snell and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/26/651748988/white-house-spokesman-democrats-politicized-kavanaugh-hearings-from-the-very-sta,The White House is working with Senate Republicans to move Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court nomination forward. NPR s Steve Inskeep talks to White House spokesman Raj Shah about the process.
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/26/651735137/sex-crimes-prosecutor-picked-for-kavanaugh-hearing-brings-decades-of-experience,"The outside attorney who will be directing questions to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, is a prosecutor from Arizona who has dedicated her career to prosecuting sex crimes   and pushed for best practices in investigations to protect and serve victims of assault.Rachel Mitchell is head of the sex crimes unit at the Maricopa County Attorney s Office and has decades of experience prosecuting criminal cases of sexual assault and abuse.She ll be asking questions during a hearing on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will center on Ford s allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while they were in high school.Mitchell is a prosecutor, but in this situation, no criminal case has been opened   and the Senate is not a courtroom. Mitchell has been hired by the Senate Republicans who have staunchly defended Kavanaugh against allegations of wrongdoing.Ford says that when she and Kavanaugh were in high school in suburban Maryland in the early 1980s, he pinned her to a bed at a party, covered her mouth when she tried to scream, groped her while grinding against her body and attempted to remove her clothes as she resisted. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation.A second woman has accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her in college, which Kavanaugh also has denied.A third woman has come forward with further accusations from high school, which Kavanaugh again denies. The third woman says, among other things, that she saw an intoxicated Kavanaugh press himself against girls without their consent and that she was raped at a party that he attended.Kavanaugh has issued a blanket denial that he ever sexually assaulted anyone. He also denies drinking to the point of losing his memory.Decades have passed since the alleged assault of Ford, the topic of the hearing scheduled for Thursday. This is a familiar situation for Mitchell, who has prosecuted several sex crimes that reached the courtroom long after the abuse occurred, including cases of the abuse of children by Catholic priests. She is experienced at training detectives, prosecutors ... and others who work with victims [on] the best methods for forensic interviews of sex-crimes victims,  the Arizona Republic reports.It is unusual for the Senate Judiciary Committee to bring in outside counsel to conduct questioning at a hearing. Typically, senators ask the questions themselves.But all the Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee are male; they risked alienating or infuriating some viewers if they sat as a panel of powerful men and challenged a woman on her memories of a traumatic event. (This is, of course, not a new position for the committee to be in.)For days, the senators had been weighing the idea of bringing in outside counsel   a woman   to handle the questioning. Ford s lawyer said that her client preferred to be questioned by the senators instead.(Ford has also requested a full investigation by the FBI, which would include seeking interviews with people besides Ford and Kavanaugh, including a man Ford named as an eyewitness to her assault. The committee has denied that request.)A career spent prosecuting assaults and abusesSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, announced Tuesday that Mitchell was the choice for an outside interviewer, saying she  has been recognized in the legal community for her experience and objectivity. Earlier, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said a  female assistant  had been hired to  ask these questions in a respectful and professional way. Mitchell, who is in her early 50s, is not a legislative assistant. As the director of the Special Victims Division of the Maricopa County Attorney s Office, she supervises a team of prosecutors who handle sex crime cases. She has worked as a prosecutor since 1993.She is a graduate of Arizona State University s law school. She became interested in prosecuting sex crimes while she was a law clerk, waiting on her bar exam results, and assisted on a case that  involved a youth choir director as the offender,  according to an interview she gave in 2011. It struck me how innocent and vulnerable the victims of these cases really were,  she said.  When I became an attorney with the office I prosecuted other kinds of cases, but I was drawn back to this area. In 2005, in a closely watched case, Mitchell led the prosecution of a priest who was convicted of child molestation and sentenced to 111 years in prison. That priest, Paul LeBrun, was the eighth Phoenix-area member of the clergy to face charges as part of a wave of abuse prosecutions, but his case was the first to go to a jury trial.Mitchell said at the time that the 111-year sentence was  vindication for these victims, and they need that.  It also tells people who have been victimized by people in authority that someone is listening and will do something about it,  she added, according to a Reuters report.In 2011, her office was criticized after it brokered a plea deal with a Jehovah s Witness elder who admitted to sexually abusing a teenage boy   the deal called for just six months in county jail. Mitchell said it would be difficult to prove that the victim, now an adult, had been 14 or younger at the time of the abuse. Conscientious  and  competent Mitchell became head of the sex crimes unit in 2005 as part of a shake-up in the Maricopa County Attorney s Office   the previous head of the unit, Cindi Nannetti, was unceremoniously demoted after the election of a new top prosecutor. Nannetti s demotion was a  huge surprise,  Kimberly Yedowitz, the chairwoman of the Arizona Sexual Assault Network, told the Phoenix New Times.While the department shuffle raised eyebrows, Mitchell was hardly a controversial choice. Neither Yedowitz nor anyone else contacted for this story had anything negative to say about Rachel Mitchell, Nannetti s replacement,  the New Times wrote.  Mitchell worked closely with Nannetti in prosecuting numerous priests and other high-profile cases, and previously supervised the sex-crimes unit s East Valley bureau. During her time running the sex crimes division, Mitchell has commented to the press repeatedly about efforts to make criminal proceedings less harrowing for victims   including the addition of therapy dogs in court.Mitchell spoke to NPR member station KJZZ in January about the county s new protocol manual for handling sexual assault cases. She said it was helpful to have training requirements and written best practices so people responsible for investigations and prosecutions can  do the best we can for victims,  as she put it.The protocol manual includes both technical processes for handling evidence, as well as guidelines for how to treat and talk to victims.  Treat victims as human beings, not as pieces of evidence,  it says at one point.In a statement Tuesday, the Maricopa County Attorney s Office described Mitchell as someone who is  professional, fair, objective  with  a caring heart for victims.  County Attorney Bill Montgomery called her a  conscientious prosecutor, trained to seek justice, protect victims and pursue truth. Colleagues told the Arizona Republic that Mitchell is  clearly competent  and a  really good, solid prosecutor.  Children often keep this secret for years In 2011, Mitchell spoke to FrontLine, a Fundamental Baptist magazine, about child sexual abuse in religious organizations.She identified a number of misconceptions on the topic, noting that the vast majority of victims knows their abuser, that abuse often happens with other people present and that sexual abusers  are very similar to the general population. Economically, educationally, racially, religiously, they are demographically the same. She also said one common misconception has to do with when abuse is disclosed. People think that children would tell right away and that they would tell everything that happened to them,  she said.  In reality, children often keep this secret for years, sometimes into their adulthood, sometimes forever. Mitchell was specifically discussing the sexual abuse of children. But the passage is attracting new attention because of echoes in the Kavanaugh allegations.Ford, who was 15 at the time of the alleged assault, says she told no one at the time and only began discussing the incident as an adult. Some defenders of Kavanaugh, including President Trump, have criticized her for coming forward now and not at the time, saying it undermines her credibility.Other defenders have noted that Kavanaugh was young at the time of the alleged incident   17   and asked whether, even if it occurred, he should be held responsible now.Mitchell is familiar with that line of thinking, too. In 2006, she testified before the Arizona State Legislature   specifically, a committee on  youthful sex offenders    and explained there were many factors in determining the punishment for a minor who has committed sexual assault, including the number of victims and whether the act was impulsive.She also noted that her office requests lifetime probation for most sex offenders because probation can be shortened but generally cannot be lengthened even if more offenses are discovered later.The news of Mitchell s selection for Thursday s hearing has brought a flurry of politicized attention to a prosecutor who has, until now, maintained a low profile.The Washington Post reports:Maricopa County is home to Phoenix and the sprawling metropolitan area that surrounds it. It s the fourth-most-populous county in the United States   and has more Republican voters than any other U.S. county, according to the local GOP. In the 2016 presidential election, the county delivered more votes for Trump than any other county did, by a long shot.The county is known for its notorious former sheriff, Joe Arpaio, who led a program of racial profiling and continues to push a baseless conspiracy theory about former President Barack Obama.Arpaio was also harshly criticized for failing to adequately investigate hundreds of sex crimes between 2004 and 2007.Mitchell was with the county attorney s office throughout that time and head of the sex crimes unit for some of that period. A lengthy report by the Arizona Republic did not accuse the county attorney s office of misconduct; the failures occurred before the cases were handed to the attorney s office for prosecution, according to the newspaper s description of events."

And a plurality haven t made up their minds on who is telling the truth   about a third (32 percent) believe Ford, about a quarter (26 percent) believe Kavanaugh and 42 percent are unsure who to believe. The jury is still out in the court of public opinion about whether Judge Kavanaugh or Dr. Ford is more believable,  said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll. He added,  If they determine she s telling the truth, it s a big problem for him. The more evenly matched credibility contest between Ford and Kavanaugh as demonstrated in Wednesday s poll seems to be a cultural shift from 1991, when an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that far more people believed Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (40 percent) than Anita Hill (24 percent). Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment in the workplace.A plurality opposes Kavanaugh s nomination (43 percent oppose, 38 percent support). And an even bigger number (59 percent) thinks that if Ford s allegation is true, he shouldn t be confirmed to the nation s highest court. There have been many divisive Supreme Court nominations in recent years, but Kavanaugh s standing at this point is the worst of all of them.Kavanaugh categorically denies the allegations leveled by Ford and Deborah Ramirez, who accused him of sexual misconduct at a college party also more than three decades ago. I had never sexually assaulted anyone, not in high school, not ever,  Kavanaugh said on Fox News on Monday night.  I ve always treated women with dignity and respect. Kavanaugh s nomination is becoming a voting issue in November s midterm elections. More people say they are likely to vote for someone who opposes Kavanaugh s nomination than supports it by a 37 percent to 32 percent margin. A little more than a quarter (27 percent) say his nomination does not make any difference to their vote.A majority of Republicans (54 percent) say they think Kavanaugh should be confirmed regardless of whether Ford s allegations are true, according to the poll.While pluralities of both men (39 percent) and women (45 percent) are unsure who is telling the truth, among those who have an view on the question, there is notably a big gender gap. Thirty-two percent of men believe Kavanaugh and 28 percent believe Ford. Thirty-five percent of women believe Ford and 20 percent believe Kavanaugh. That s a 19-point gender gap, and the spread is even further apart by gender and party: Republican men overwhelmingly believe Kavanaugh (61 percent to 5 percent) and Democratic women believe Ford (56 percent to 4 percent).Democratic men believe Ford by a 54 percent to 16 percent margin, and Republican women believe Kavanaugh by a 57 percent to 6 percent margin. A plurality of independent women believe Ford (38 percent to 16 percent).More people now have an unfavorable opinion of Kavanaugh (37 percent) than a favorable one (31 percent). About a third (32 percent) have either never heard of Kavanaugh or are unsure of what they think of Trump s nominee. So, despite Republicans scheduling a possible committee vote on Kavanaugh s nomination for Friday morning, Thursday is a big test for the federal appeals court judge. The fact that people don t have a strong sense of who he is really makes the stakes on Thursday very high,  said Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll.Trump gets a boost, as Republicans come homePresident Trump saw his approval rating go up 3 points to 42 percent from a Marist poll conducted earlier this month, just after Sen. John McCain s funeral.In Wednesday s poll, 87 percent of Republicans say they approve of the job Trump is doing, up from 81 percent earlier this month.That has also helped Republicans on whom Americans prefer to control Congress. Democrats continue to lead on the question of which party s candidate people are more likely to vote for in their congressional district by 7 points, 48 percent to 41 percent. That s down from a 12-point Democratic advantage earlier this month.Again, Republicans appear to be closing ranks   93 percent of Republicans say they will vote for the Republican in their district, up from 88 percent.Democrats also continue to lead with voters in the Midwest, 48 percent to 43 percent, but by a narrower margin than earlier this month, when it was 51 percent to 37 percent.The poll surveyed 997 adults and was conducted Sept. 22 through Sept. 24. Respondents were contacted on landline and mobile numbers and were surveyed in live interviews. Overall results are statistically significant within 3.9 percentage points. The survey included 802 registered voters; for that subset, results are statistically significant within 4.3 percentage points."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/26/651545283/watch-live-trump-holds-press-conference-at-u-n,"Updated at 9:24 p.m. ETDuring a rare press conference Wednesday, President Trump sent mixed messages about the fate of his embattled Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh.At different points in the rambling, nearly 90-minute event, Trump said that the allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh were  all false  and that he  could be persuaded  otherwise.One thing was clear: There s a lot riding on Thursday s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Trump suggested that he could withdraw the high court nomination if he decides that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the first woman to come forward with allegations against the federal appeals court judge, is telling the truth about an alleged incident when she and Kavanaugh were in high school in the 1980s, and Kavanaugh allegedly sexually assaulted her.But the president also vigorously defended Kavanaugh, who s now been directly accused by three women of sexual misconduct   in all three cases the judge has denied the allegations. Trump bemoaned that men can be derailed by and presumed guilty when such allegations surface, saying he sympathized with the jurist because he s also faced similar accusations.At first, during the freewheeling questioning from reporters at the 2018 U.N. General Assembly, Trump painted the accusations against Kavanaugh as purely partisan and faulted Democrats that the allegations had come to the surface in the first place. [Democrats] are actually con artists, because they know how quality this man is and they ve destroyed a man s reputation, and they want to destroy it even more,  Trump told journalists in New York. And they know it s a big, fat con job,  he continued.  And they go in to a room, and I guarantee you, they laugh like hell on what they pulled off on you and on the public, they laugh like hell. Trump said the allegations of the three women  are all false to me,  bemoaning  what they ve done to these children   these beautiful children of [Kavanaugh], and what they ve done to his wife.  When I look at what s happened to the reputation of a great gentleman   a great intellect, a brilliant man, somebody that has a chance to be one of our great Supreme Court justices in history   intellectually, I think it s a shame,  Trump said.The president said it  wouldn t have mattered  to Democrats  if the FBI came back with the cleanest score  if they had investigated the veracity of the claims of sexual assault and more against Kavanaugh. So far the White House and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have declined to ask for the FBI to investigate the decades-old allegations against Kavanaugh.At one point, Trump even mused that  didn t George Washington have some allegations against him? But later in the news conference the president said he planned to be watching when both Kavanaugh and Ford testify on Thursday before the Judiciary Committee and would listen with an open mind. It s possible I ll hear that and say,  hey, I m changing my mind,    Trump said of the anticipated testimony. And if he believes the accusations against Kavanaugh are ultimately true, he would consider withdrawing the nomination.Trump declined to call the women who have made accusations against Kavanaugh liars, but said he empathizes with the judge given that multiple women came forward with allegations against him during the 2016 presidential campaign. I can t tell you whether or not they re liars until I hear them,  Trump said. But he did say that that attorney Michael Avenatti, who is representing Kavanaugh s third accuser Julie Swetnick, is a  low-life.  Avenatti also represents adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump and was paid by Trump s lawyer to remain quiet just ahead of Election Day in 2016. (Trump acknowledges the payment to Daniels but denies he had a sexual relationship as Daniels claims.)Trump also mischaracterized the accusations against him, falsely claiming only four women had made allegations (more than a dozen did) and said they had been paid to do so (there has been no evidence to support that). Well it does impact my opinion, and you know why? Because I ve had a lot of false charges made against me. I m a very famous person, unfortunately. I ve been a famous person for a long time. But I ve had a lot of false charges made against me, really false charges,  Trump said.  I know friends that have had false charges. People want fame, they want money, they want whatever. So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television where they say oh, Judge Kavanaugh this or that. By the end of the press conference, though, Trump had returned to a defense of Kavanaugh and didn t respond to a question about what kind of signal he was sending to young men by possibly dismissing Kavanaugh s behavior. Even if he nominated someone else, Trump claimed, they could be derailed by the same type of allegations. This is beyond the Supreme Court. This has everything to do with our country,  the president said.  When you are guilty until proven innocent, it s just not supposed to be that way. After Trump s remarks in New York on Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee released transcripts that revealed the panel also questioned Kavanaugh about two other accusations that were previously unknown. In the transcripts, Kavanaugh denies the allegations, which were made anonymously and without corroboration.Thursday was already shaping up to be a split-screen day in addition to Kavanaugh s testimony, with the president also set to meet with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and the possibility that Trump might fire the man who oversees the special counsel s Russia investigation. But Trump signaled that he was inclined to keep Rosenstein on board and may even delay that planned meeting.As he closed out his week at the U.N. General Assembly, Trump also disputed the fact that when he was addressing world leaders and top diplomats Tuesday, he had drawn laughter   when he boasted that he s accomplished more during his time in office than almost any previous administration.On Wednesday, Trump claimed that world leaders were laughing  with  him, instead of at him. I didn t expect that reaction, but that s OK,  he said at the time, pressing ahead undaunted."

As it stands now, the hearing cannot provide the senators  with enough information to reach a reasonable conclusion,  Hill tells NPR.On Thursday, Christine Blasey Ford is set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about an incident that she says happened when she and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh were in high school.She says that during a party, Kavanaugh drunkenly pinned her down in a bedroom and groped her as a friend of his looked on. I thought he might inadvertently kill me,  Ford, a research psychologist in California, has said.  He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing. Kavanaugh has categorically denied these allegations and a second accusation against him. In a Fox News interview that aired Monday night, he said:  I had never sexually assaulted anyone, not in high school, not ever. While some details of the hearing remain up in the air, the only people currently set to testify are Kavanaugh and Ford.Ford s lawyer   and Democratic senators   have called for an FBI investigation into the claims. The attorney has also proposed the committee subpoena Mark Judge, the other person Ford says was in the room during the alleged assault.So far, those requests have not been granted.A fair process would start with a  real investigation,  Hill tells All Things Considered, saying the absence of other witnesses raises concerns about a he-said-she-said situation. It s only that kind of a situation if it s set up as that kind of a situation,  Hill says.  In a real hearing and a real investigation, other witnesses would be called, including witnesses who could corroborate, witnesses who could explain the context of the experiences of Dr. Blasey Ford and Judge Kavanaugh during that period in their lives, as well as experts on sexual harassment and sexual assault. Hill, who is now a professor of social policy, law and women s and gender studies at Brandeis University, called for a  neutral body  to investigate the allegations. She says Senate members have already indicated  the presumptions they have about the claims that have been made. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced later Tuesday that a female staff attorney, not senators, would be questioning Kavanaugh and Ford. Fellow Republican and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley said it was an effort to  depoliticize the whole process. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer then stated that Democrats on the Judiciary Committee planned to ask their own questions at Thursday s hearing. Hill says there is going to be an inherent power imbalance in the hearing.  The very least we can do is balance it out through a fair process. She found herself in a similar position to Ford when, in 1991, she came forward with allegations against Thomas.Hill had briefly worked with Thomas at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission   but by the time interest in her story spiked, Hill had already left Washington, D.C., and was working as a law professor at the University of Oklahoma.According to Hill s congressional testimony, Thomas told her that he was likely to get a political appointment and that if he did, she could come work with him. She followed Thomas to the Education Department, where she worked for one year.When Thomas moved on to become EEOC chairman, Hill joined him as a special assistant. She held that post from 1982 to  83, when she moved back to Oklahoma.Hill initially refused to speak about what happened between her and Thomas. She was  torn between what she saw as her duty to provide information to the committee and her desire not to be publicly identified,  as NPR s Nina Totenberg has reported.An FBI inquiry into her claims began in late September 1991; on Oct. 7, Hill said she was willing to testify.She recalls a hectic journey from Oklahoma to Washington, where she says she had only about a day to confer with her legal counsel before facing senators.  Experiencing that was just as shocking as it sounds,  Hill tells NPR.Discussing her interactions with Thomas, Hill testified that their working relationship had initially been positive. But several months after she took the job at the Department of Education, she said,  He asked me to go out socially with him. Hill continued in her testimony:  What happened next and telling the world about it are the two most difficult things, experiences of my life. It is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration and a number of sleepless nights that I am able to talk of these unpleasant matters to anyone but my close friends. She declined his offer, telling lawmakers that she believed going out with Thomas might jeopardize their professional relationship. She said Thomas pressed her to explain why she said no and tried repeatedly to get her to change her mind. My working relationship became even more strained when Judge Thomas began to use work situations to discuss sex,  Hill said at the time. She added,  After a brief discussion of work, he would turn the conversation to a discussion of sexual matters. His conversations were very vivid. The topics ranged from pornography and bestiality to Thomas   own sexual prowess,  she said.Hill testified that the graphic conversations and pressure tapered off toward the end of Thomas  tenure at the Education Department, prompting her to accept his offer to join her at the EEOC.In the second half of 1982, she said, Thomas resumed making sexual overtures and pressuring her to go on a date. She began looking for another job and landed one in 1983.Hill told the committee,  When I informed him that I was leaving in July, I recall that his response was that now, I would no longer have an excuse for not going out with him. Thomas denied Hill s accusations and called the hearing  a high-tech lynching. On Oct. 15, 1991, Thomas was confirmed by the Democrat-controlled Senate, by a vote of 52-48.The personal cost of coming forward was substantial, Hill tells NPR. My family was threatened, along with me. My friends were threatened,  she says.  Anybody who dared support me were also threatened with loss of life, loss of jobs. You lose privacy. But, she says,  for me, what it does come down to is that I felt that I had an obligation to come forward. She says she doesn t regret it. Yes, it is true that it s redefined my life in many ways,  Hill says,  but in the end, I still have the power to define who I am and what my life stands for. The allegations by Hill and Ford both concern incidents that they said happened years prior to Thomas  and Kavanaugh s nominations. But Hill argues that for a Supreme Court nominee with a potential life term, incidents long past must be weighed. We re talking about an experience that is a reflection   potentially a reflection   on the character and fitness of a nominee,  Hill says.  And it has to be taken into account and it has to be taken seriously. And that is fair. "
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/25/651426798/white-house-open-to-hearing-from-second-kavanaugh-accuser,"Updated at 7:47 p.m. ETPresident Trump attacked Brett Kavanaugh s second accuser Tuesday, saying she  has nothing  on the Supreme Court nominee and was  totally inebriated and all messed up  during a college party at which, she said, Kavanaugh exposed himself to her.Trump, at a photo op during his visit to the United Nations, said the accusations were part of a  con game being played by Democrats. A woman who was a student at Yale with Kavanaugh, Deborah Ramirez, told The New Yorker that Kavanaugh exposed himself during a party the two attended there.Mocking her account, Trump said,  She said,  Well, it might not be him, and there were gaps,  and she said she was totally inebriated and she was all messed up and she doesn t know it was him, but it might have been him. Trump continued,  Oh gee, let s not make him a Supreme Court judge because of that. Trump then repeated his charge that Democrats were playing a con game, spelling  C-O-N  for emphasis.Kavanaugh has denied Ramirez s allegation, as he has with the charge by Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh groped her and tried to forcibly remove her clothes during a drunken party when they were in high school in the early 1980s.Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced hiring of a  female assistant  who will conduct the questioning on the Republican side at Thursday s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, at which Kavanaugh and Ford are appearing.Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, explained the move.  We have done it because we want to depoliticize the whole process, like the Democrats politicized the Anita Hill thing. The whole purpose is to create an environment where it s what Dr. Ford has asked for   to be professional and have it not be a circus. McConnell noted that  it s not uncommon  for staff instead of senators to pose the questions, noting that then-aide and later Sen. Fred Thompson queried witnesses during the Watergate hearings.The top Senate Republican predicted that after this week s hearing, Kavanaugh would be confirmed by the full Senate.  I m confident we are going to win,  McConnell said, adding the vote would come  in the very near future. Grassley has scheduled a vote of the committee on Kavanaugh s high court nomination for Friday morning, a day after the much-anticipated hearing where Ford and the federal appeals court judge are both set to testify.Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, slammed the decision to schedule a vote for Friday.  For Republicans to schedule a Friday vote on Kavanaugh today, 2 days before Dr. Blasey Ford has had a chance to tell her story, is outrageous,  Feinstein wrote on Twitter.  Seeming to anticipate the objections of Feinstein and her fellow Democrats, Grassley explained on Twitter that he was following  regular order  in giving three days notice ahead of a possible vote on the nomination Friday:   Judic Cmte noticed POTENTIAL exec mtg for Friday. Still taking this 1 step at a time. After hrg Dr Ford & Judge Kavanaugh s testimony- if we re ready to vote, we will vote. If we aren t ready, we won t.  Trump s characterization of Ramirez was in conflict with his press secretary s statements made hours earlier.Appearing Tuesday morning on ABC s Good Morning America, White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders, when asked whether the White House would welcome Ramirez s testimony, responded,  Certainly, we would be open to that.  Sanders added,  The president has been clear: Let them (the women accusing Kavanaugh of misconduct) speak. In a letter to committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, obtained by NPR, Ford lawyer Michael R. Bromwich criticized McConnell saying he  dismissed Dr. Ford s experience as a  smear campaign,  claiming mistakenly that the witnesses  statements to the Committee constitute  a complete lack of evidence,  implying that there has been a thorough investigation. McConnell spoke on the Senate floor Monday afternoon.In the letter, Bromwich also questioned the committee s intention to use an attorney to question Ford on Thursday, rather than the senators on the panel. This is not a criminal trial for which the involvement of an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would be appropriate. Neither Dr. Blasey Ford nor Judge Kavanaugh is on trial. The goal should be to develop the relevant facts, not try a case. Republican leaders, who found themselves an awkward position because all of the GOP members of the panel are men, would not identify exactly who has been hired to question Ford.Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made it clear that Democrats on the committee planned to ask their own questions at Thursday s hearing. Our senators are not afraid   as the Republicans seem to be   to confront this situation and deal with the truth,  Schumer said.  They are going to do it in a careful, dignified, respectful way in an effort to find the facts. Schumer reiterated his call for an FBI background investigation of Ford s allegations."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/24/651085275/trump-calls-kavanaugh-outstanding-dismissing-latest-sexual-misconduct-allegation,"Updated at 8:32 p.m. ETSupreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh says he isn t considering withdrawing following more allegations of sexual misconduct from decades ago, and he proclaimed his innocence in a new TV interview Monday evening. I m not going to let false accusations drive us out of this process,  Kavanaugh told Fox News  Martha MacCallum in an interview alongside his wife, Ashley. We re looking for a fair process where I can be heard and defend my integrity and my lifelong record of promoting dignity and equality for women, starting with the women who knew me when I was 14 years old. I m not going anywhere,  Kavanaugh said. I know I m telling the truth. I know my lifelong record, and I m not going to let false accusations drive me out of this process,  Kavanaugh continued.  I have faith in God, and I have faith in the fairness of the American people. The new interview with Kavanaugh comes after accusations surfaced Sunday night from Deborah Ramirez, who in a story published in The New Yorker alleges Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken party at Yale when they both attended college there in the 1980s.Thursday the Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing into the allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh groped her and tried to remove her clothes during a party when both were in high school in Bethesda, Md., more than 30 years ago.Ford and Kavanaugh have agreed to testify, although Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called for the panel to postpone the hearing following the allegation by Ramirez.Kavanaugh has denied the allegations leveled against him by both Ford and Ramirez, and in his interview with MacCallum said he has  never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise.  I am not questioning, and have not questioned, that perhaps Dr. Ford, at some point in her life, was sexually assaulted by someone in someplace. But what I know is I ve never sexually assaulted anyone,  Kavanaugh said.Kavanaugh said he  may have met  Ford   who went to a private girls school while he went to a private Jesuit boys school in suburban Washington, D.C., during the early 1980s   but that  we did not travel in the same social circles.  Ford is two years younger than Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh also said he was  never at any such party  back then like that Ford has described and that  I have never had any sexual or physical activity with Dr. Ford. Kavanaugh said that, yes, there were parties with alcohol that he attended while in high school, but there was never a time where he drank so much he couldn t remember his actions from the night before. I have always treated women with dignity and respect,  Kavanaugh repeated several times, and said most of his time in high school was spent studying, playing sports or going to church.  I m a good person. I ve led a good life. I ve tried to do a lot of good for a lot of people. I m not perfect. I know that. None of us is perfect ... but I ve never ever done anything like  either Ford s or Ramirez s accusations.Ashley Kavanaugh also said she believed her husband s denials and said the confirmation process had been hard on their family, including their two daughters. I know Brett. I ve known him for 17 years and this is not at all who [he is]. It s really hard to believe,  she said.  He s decent. He s kind. He s good. I know his heart. This is not consistent with Brett. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is among the Republicans calling for the committee to look into the allegations by Ramirez. Collins says she has not decided whether she will support Kavanaugh and she is looking to the upcoming hearing with Ford and the judge before she makes up her mind.  I think that the committee investigators should reach out to Deborah Ramirez in order to question her under oath about what she s alleging,  Collins said.  I m eager for the hearing to take place this Thursday and hear from both Judge Kavanaugh and from Dr. Ford. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters Monday that committee lawyers have been in touch with lawyers for Ramirez and they are talking. He would not say whether he expects a public hearing on Ramirez s allegations.President Trump reiterated his support for Kavanaugh again on Monday, telling reporters on his way into the United Nations on Monday morning that Kavanaugh  is an outstanding person, and I am with him all the way. He said the charges  could be one of the single most unfair, unjust things to happen for a candidate for anything.  The women making the allegations, Trump said,  were coming out of the woodwork  and, he said,  in my opinion totally political. And in a tweet to his more than 50 million followers Monday evening Trump touted the Fox News interview and added  This is an outstanding family who must be treated fairly! Kavanaugh told MacCallum that Trump had called him Monday afternoon to say  he s standing by me. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee released earlier Monday, Kavanaugh called the accusations attempts at  last minute character assassination :The committee also released a letter from Ford, dated last Saturday, in which she said coming forward with her charge was  something that a citizen couldn t NOT do. I felt agony yet urgency and a civic duty to let it be known, in a confidential manner, prior to the nominee being selected. She continued:Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also accused Democrats of a  shameful, shameful, smear campaign  against Kavanaugh and vowed he will receive an up-or-down vote on his nomination on the Senate floor on  in the near future. Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee met Monday evening in McConnell s office to discuss the Thursday hearing. Several members said there was clear agreement that the hearing will go forward. They also discussed the possibility of bringing in an outside attorney to question Ford for the GOP lawmakers.Cornyn said the committee is still deciding who will question Ford. I think we re leaning towards a staff lawyer, outside lawyer do it on our side for continuity,  Cornyn said.  Rather than have 11 people ask questions for five minutes each but I don t know what the Democrats will decide to do. Cornyn said the committee could vote as early as the end of this week on Kavanaugh s nomination   leaving little time between Ford s testimony and that possible vote."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/23/650979665/kavanaugh-denies-fresh-harassment-allegations-from-college-classmate,"Updated at 11:18 p.m. ETDays before the Senate is set to hear from a woman who alleges that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her while in high school, Kavanaugh is denying fresh accusations from a college classmate who also alleges he acted inappropriately toward her.In a story published Sunday evening by The New Yorker, Deborah Ramirez says Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken party while both were first-year students at Yale University. It was kind of a joke,  Ramirez told the magazine.  And now it s clear to me it wasn t a joke. Kavanaugh denied the allegation in a statement released by the White House. This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,  Kavanaugh said.  The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple. The fresh allegation comes as the Senate Judiciary Committee is preparing to hear testimony from another woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who alleges that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a high school party more than 30 years ago. The two incidents are alleged to have occurred within just a few years of each other.Kavanaugh denies those allegations as well.Ford is set to testify Thursday before the Judiciary Committee about her allegation. The politically charged hearing has already been criticized by Democrats who are calling for an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh s conduct.California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, sent a letter to committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Sunday evening asking that all proceedings related to Kavanaugh s nomination be suspended. I am writing to request an immediate postponement of any further proceedings related to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh,  Feinstein wrote.  I also ask that the newest allegations of sexual misconduct be referred to the FBI for investigation, and that you join our request for the White House to direct the FBI to investigate the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford as well as these new claims. Grassley spokesman Taylor Foy accused Democrats of withholding information about allegations for political reasons but said the committee will  attempt to evaluate these new claims.  The committee s majority staff learned the allegations made by Deborah Ramirez about Judge Kavanaugh from this evening s New Yorker report,  Foy said in an email sent to reporters on Sunday.  Neither she nor her legal representative have contacted the chairman s office. The article reports that Democratic staff were aware of these allegations, but they never informed Republican staff. The New Yorker article, co-authored by Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow, says  Senior Republican staffers also learned of the allegation last week  without specifying whom the staffers worked for.According to Democratic staffers, members of the committee have been fielding multiple tips about other incidents in the week since Ford s allegation became public and have been working to verify them.One Democratic aide on the committee said senators have heard many rumors but did not have details about Ramirez s specific allegation before the story was published. Now that the story is public, it will be looked into, the aide said.Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who is not a member of the Judiciary Committee, has been in contact with an attorney who then reached out to Ramirez, according to a spokesperson.Democratic staffers on the Judiciary Committee who did not work for Feinstein contacted Bennet s office asking for a connection for Ramirez should she decide to come forward with allegations about Kavanaugh, the spokesperson said. We reached out to former Boulder District Attorney Stan Garnett who then met with Ms. Ramirez to work through how to analyze and present her allegations,  the spokesperson added.  Judiciary staff reached out to our office and asked for a connection to someone who might be helpful should Deborah Ramirez decide to come forward with an allegation related to that made by Dr. Ford. High-stakes vacancyKavanaugh was nominated by President Trump in July to fill the vacancy left by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired. Kennedy was frequently the court s swing vote.Kavanaugh is considered more conservative than Kennedy, and liberals have feared that if he is confirmed, the Supreme Court will shift considerably to the right. His nomination is viewed by both parties as a critical fight ahead of the midterm elections in November.White House spokeswoman Kerri Kupec blamed Democrats for the latest allegation. This 35-year-old, uncorroborated claim is the latest in a coordinated smear campaign by the Democrats designed to tear down a good man,  Kupec said in a statement.  This claim is denied by all who were said to be present and is wholly inconsistent with what many women and men who knew Judge Kavanaugh at the time in college say. The White House stands firmly behind Judge Kavanaugh. One Republican close to Kavanaugh s confirmation process who wasn t authorized to speak on the record said  there s resolve in the White House. The source pointed to the timing, coming out after Kavanaugh s hearing and after a delay in the committee vote, adding that thus far the allegations are unsubstantiated and uncorroborated. The Republican viewpoint is that the left is trying to create a pattern of sexual misconduct in order to make him radioactive,  the source said.  It all boils down to how Sens. [Lisa] Murkowski and [Susan] Collins perceive these allegations. Murkowski and Collins, both Republicans, are considered relative moderates within their caucus and support abortion rights   one area in particular where the court is expected to shift further to the right.Progressive activist groups say the latest allegation adds to their efforts to derail Kavanaugh s nomination. Brian Fallon, the executive director of the group Demand Justice, which was formed in part to oppose Trump s Supreme Court nominee, said Kavanaugh should remove his name from consideration. Enough is enough,  Fallon said in a statement.  Brett Kavanaugh needs to withdraw immediately. Rachel O Leary Carmona of the Women s March echoed Fallon. Brett Kavanaugh s history with women shows he is 100 percent unqualified to serve on the Supreme Court, and he should withdraw immediately,  Carmona said in a statement.  His nomination was an affront to women from the start, and any continuation of these hearings will be seen by women as a war on survivors of sexual assault.

The terms of their agreement provide that Kavanaugh will also appear before the committee, but he will not be in the room while Ford is speaking or being questioned.Ford alleges that Kavanaugh attacked her at a high school party in the 1980s when they were teenagers. She says Kavanaugh was drunk at the time and forced her onto a bed and groped her before she was able to get away. Kavanaugh strongly denies the allegations and has said he is eager to speak to the committee. The two sides finalized the date and time of the hearing over email. Ford s attorneys say they are still negotiating  a number of important procedural and logistical issues.  The lengthy talks were hampered by a disagreement over who will question Ford at the hearing, according to an email exchange obtained by NPR.Republican committee staff told Ford s attorneys that they would be unwilling to accept what they characterized as a  demand  that only senators be permitted to ask questions of the witnesses.The staff wrote in one email that Grassley asked them to convey that  the Committee determines which witnesses to call, how many witnesses to call, in what order to call them, and who will question them. These are non-negotiable. Committee staff has agreed to several additional requests from Ford and her attorneys. They agreed to limit press access to the hearing, including allowing only one television camera in the hearing room. The two sides agreed to give equal time to all senators who wish to question Ford and to allow  adequate breaks  during the hearing. They also agreed to increased security for Ford and Kavanaugh. Both have received death threats that have grown more intense over time. "

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/23/650138049/a-timeline-of-clarence-thomas-anita-hill-controversy-as-kavanaugh-to-face-accuse,"Updated at 3:00 p.m. ET It is still unclear exactly how and under what conditions Christine Blasey Ford will testify Thursday on Capitol Hill. Ford has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of a sexual assault when they were in high school.But how all this is handled will have consequences, as it did 27 years ago when the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings dealing with sexual harassment allegations against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.Late in the summer of 1991, Democratic committee staffers began to hear rumors about Thomas sexually harassing one or more women who had worked with him. Anita Hill, who had worked with Thomas at the Department of Education and at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, eventually publicly accused him.Here s a look back at how it all went down:Sept. 6: Anita Hill, after twice refusing to discuss the matter with staffers, says she wants to think about it. Over that weekend, she mulls her options, torn between what she saw as her duty to provide information to the committee and her desire not to be publicly identified.Sept. 10: The previously scheduled Thomas confirmation hearings begin. They last 10 days and focus entirely on Thomas  legal views, as expressed in his speeches and writings, including the decisions he wrote in his brief 18 months as a federal appeals court judge.Sept. 20: The hearings end.Away from the cameras, Democratic senators begin to worry about ignoring Hill s charges. A small group led by Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts urge committee Chairman Joseph Biden to take action. Biden, following standard practice, asks the George H.W. Bush White House to authorize a further FBI investigation, this time focused on Hill s charges.Sept. 23: FBI agents interview Hill in Oklahoma. Hill also sends an affidavit to the committee.Sept 25: FBI agents interview Thomas at his home in Virginia.Sept. 27: The Judiciary Committee meets to vote on the nomination. While the Hill charges are still not public, Biden has kept the Republicans in the loop. And he makes this rather peculiar statement about Thomas, and his colleagues: I believe there are certain things that are not at issue at all. ... And that is his character. ... This is about what he believes.  Speaking in warning tones, Biden added,  I know my colleagues, and I urge everyone else to refrain from personalizing this battle. Up to that time, there had been no public suggestion that Thomas in any way lacked good character. That made this reporter, sitting in the press box, curious.Oct. 6: NPR airs this reporter s story, laying out Hill s charges, including an interview with her   and information from a corroborating witness.Oct. 7: Hill holds a press conference and says she is willing to testify.Oct. 8: This is the day the final vote on the Thomas nomination had been scheduled. But Republicans realize they do not have enough certain votes for confirmation. Republican leader Bob Dole and the Democratic leader George Mitchell huddle. With the Democrats in control of the Senate, Democrats have the upper hand, but they agree to a second round of hearings to begin just three days later.Oct. 11: Biden opens the hearings.  Professor Hill made two requests to this committee,  he says. First, that the committee investigate the charges and, second, that the charges remain confidential.  I believe we have honored both her requests,  he says, but  the landscape has changed, and we are thus here today, free from the restrictions, which had previously limited our work. All the witnesses who would appear before the committee were subpoenaed and sworn. That included four corroborating witnesses who testified about their contemporaneous conversations with Hill during the time she said she was harassed.But the main event was Hill versus Thomas: sex and lies, set to the tune of American racial stereotypes.Two African-American Yale law school graduates from poor rural backgrounds.She spoke with a quiet dignity, reciting the indignities she testified were visited upon her.  He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts, involved in various sex acts,  she said.  On several occasions, Thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess.  And he, denying the charges in a fury, called the hearing  a national disgrace ... a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves. Republicans went after Hill with vengeance. Sen. Arlen Specter accused Hill of  flat-out perjury  at one point. At another, he suggested her testimony was the  product of fantasy. Sen. Orrin Hatch, who is still on the committee, suggested that she got the idea for some of her charges from the movie The Exorcist.Democrats were sometimes flat-footed in their attempts to show that Hill had no motive to lie.  Are you a scorned woman. ... Are you a zealoting civil rights believer. ... Do you have a martyr complex?  asked Democratic Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama.Back then, Republicans like Hatch supported the FBI returning to its investigation and praised the committee s bipartisan leadership.  They immediately ordered this FBI investigation, which was the very right thing to do,  Hatch said, noting that Biden and the committee s ranking Republican Strom Thurmond  did what every other chairman and ranking member have done in the past. But having the FBI involved also frightened off some witnesses who were afraid that Thomas  supporters on the committee would use raw data from the files to harm their reputations.Oct. 14 at 2:03 a.m.: The hearing ends.Oct. 15 at 6:03 p.m.: Thomas is confirmed 52-48, the narrowest margin in more than a century.But female voters rebelled, ushering in what came to be known as  The Year of The Woman  in 1992. Elected were four new female   and Democratic   members of the Senate, including Dianne Feinstein of California, now the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.Republicans, and privately some Democrats, now blame her for keeping Ford s charges a secret since July. Feinstein says she was honoring Ford s decision to remain confidential."

If she did not comply, the committee would go ahead with a vote on Kavanaugh s nomination on Monday.In an email to the committee, lawyers for Ford said that while she has agreed to  provide first-hand knowledge of Kavanaugh s sexual misconduct,  they are disappointed  with the leaks and bullying that have tainted the process. The timing and terms of the hearing are still unclear, as negotiations continue between Ford s attorneys and the Senate Judiciary Committee, but in a letter, Ford s lawyers said they were  hopeful that we can reach agreement on details. The email also indicated that Michael R. Bromwich, former inspector general of the Justice Department, has joined Ford s team of lawyers. Bromwich currently represents former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired earlier this year. Ford alleges Kavanaugh groped her and tried to forcibly remove her clothes during a house party in Bethesda, Md., in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation and said he would appear before the committee next week. Brett Kavanaugh has been clear from the beginning he categorically and unequivocally denies this allegation and is eager to testify publicly to defend his integrity and clear his good name,  White House spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement.  On Monday, Brett Kavanaugh met with Committee counsels to answer questions subject to criminal penalties and offered to testify publicly Tuesday morning. Since then, we have heard about different dates, conditions, and ever changing schedules, but today we appear no closer to a fair hearing.  But one thing has remained consistent: Brett Kavanaugh remains ready, willing and eager to testify as soon as possible.  As the Saturday deadline approached,  NBC News reported that Garrett Ventry, a communications aide on the Senate Judiciary Committee who had been helping lead the response to Ford s claim against Kavanaugh, was stepping down after evidence surfaced that he was fired from a previous job partly because of sexual harassment allegations against him.Ventry denied any past  allegations of misconduct,  according to NBC News. He told The Washington Post that he resigned  in order to not be a distraction  as Republicans in the Senate continue to work on getting Kavanaugh confirmed.This abrupt resignation is one more point in the chaotic timeline of Kavanaugh s confirmation struggle."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/21/650420661/trump-attacks-kavanaugh-accuser-by-name-amid-negotiations-for-hearing,"Updated at 11:53 p.m. ETChristine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were in high school, rejected an ultimatum given by Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.Grassley had called for Ford s attorneys to respond by 10 p.m. ET Friday to a request for her to testify before the panel next week. If they did not reply, Grassley said, the committee would move ahead with a vote on Kavanaugh s nomination on Monday.An attorney for Ford called the deadline  arbitrary  and asked that Ford be granted an additional day to consider her options.  [The deadline s] sole purpose is to bully Dr. Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-altering implications for her and her family,  attorney Debra Katz wrote in an email to the committee s Republican staff.Shortly before midnight, Grassley tweeted that he had granted an extension, telling Ford he wants to hear her testimony. He directly addressed Kavanaugh in a tweet, too, saying,  I hope u understand. It s not my normal approach to b indecisive. The committee has asked Ford to testify about her allegation on Wednesday, Sept. 26. Ford s lawyers and Senate Democrats have pressed for more time, arguing the hearing should take place next Thursday, among other conditions.In a series of tweets earlier Friday, Trump cast doubt on Ford s charge, mentioning her by name for the first time:  I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place! But according to Department of Justice statistics, as of 2016 only 23 percent of rapes or sexual assaults were reported to the police.Speaking to All Things Considered host Mary Louise Kelly, Kirsten Leimroth, a close friend of Ford s, said:In another tweet, Trump said that  radical left lawyers want the FBI to get involved NOW. Why didn t someone call the FBI 36 years ago? Trump s tweets follow an interview he gave to Fox s Sean Hannity on Thursday night in Las Vegas, where he appeared at a rally, in which the president first questioned why the FBI hadn t been called at the time of the alleged assault (which would likely have been handled by local law enforcement). You say, why didn t somebody call the FBI 36 years ago?  Trump asked.  I mean, you could also say when did this all happen, what is going on? To take a man like this and besmirch   now, with that being said, let her have her say and let s see how it all works out. But I don t think you can delay it any longer. In an appearance in Portland on Friday, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she was appalled by Trump s tweet. First of all, we know that allegations of sexual assault   I m not saying that s what happened in this case   but we know allegations of sexual assault are one of the most unreported crimes that exist. So I thought that the president s tweet was completely inappropriate and wrong. Trump s tweets came amid ongoing negotiations over whether and how Ford and Kavanaugh might testify before the Judiciary Committee. The committee initially scheduled a hearing for Monday and had invited Kavanaugh and Ford to testify. In a letter to the committee, Ford s lawyers said that she would be open to appearing before the panel, but that an appearance Monday  was not possible.  Ford s lawyers and Democrats on the panel want the FBI to investigate the charges   a move Grassley and other Republicans have dismissed.Ford does not want Kavanaugh in the room when she testifies, and her team does not want an outside questioner on the Republican side to be brought in, a source in Ford s camp tells NPR s Nina Totenberg.On Friday, Grassley s camp agreed to the demand that Kavanaugh not be in the committee room but rejected her request to only allow senators to question the two witnesses, saying it was within committee rules to permit staff attorneys to conduct the questioning.Grassley s Friday night letter to Ford s attorneys setting a deadline also rejected two key requests discussed in a conference call with committee staff from both parties on Thursday   to have Kavanaugh testify first and for the committee to subpoena other witnesses like Mark Judge. Ford alleges Judge was there at the time the incident took place when they were in high school.Ford says that Kavanaugh groped her and tried to forcibly remove her clothes during a house party in Bethesda, Md., in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied the accusation.In another tweet Friday morning, Trump called Kavanaugh  a fine man,  who he said is under assault  by radical left wing politicians who don t want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay.  Trump continued,  I go through this with them every single day in D.C. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaking to conservative activists at the Value Voters Summit in Washington on Friday morning, expressed confidence Kavanaugh would be confirmed. You ve watched the fight. You ve watched the tactics. Here s what I want to tell you: In the very near future, Judge Kavanaugh will be on the United States Supreme Court,  he said.Trump also lashed out at Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., in his fourth tweet on the Kavanaugh nomination Friday, renewing his accusation that Feinstein and Democrats held a letter from Ford in which she first raised the accusation against Kavanaugh  only to release it with a bang after the hearings were OVER,  which Trump asserted was  done very purposefully to Obstruct & Resist & Delay.  Trump continued,  let her testify, or not, and TAKE THE VOTE! Feinstein tweeted this week that Ford had sought confidentiality and  I honored that. It wasn t until the media outed her that she decided to come forward.  "

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/21/650039170/how-to-talk-to-young-people-about-the-kavanaugh-story,"Young people around the country are among those joining the debate over Christine Blasey Ford s accusation of sexual assault against Judge Brett Kavanaugh in 1982, when both were teenagers.What are teens learning from all this? And how should adults be handling this conversation?One night during the summer of 2017, a teenager named Francesca in Virginia was assaulted by a classmate:  I was pinned down and he fondled my breasts and sexually assaulted me.  We re only using her first name because she s 15 years old.Francesca says she struggled at first with coming forward, but eventually became an activist and public speaker on consent and survivors  rights.Jules Spector, meanwhile, is an 18-year-old graduate of a private high school in Brooklyn, now taking a gap year before attending Wellesley College.Spector is also a survivor of sexual assault, and it took her years to come forward. She says she s willing to use her full name because she is a feminist activist who feels the importance of raising public awareness.The accusations against Judge Kavanaugh have reminded her of parties she s attended, and boys she knew in high school. A lot of boys that I ve grown up around have the thought that they can do anything,  Spector says.  And these decisions that they make, whether inebriated or not, won t follow them later in life because they can just forget about the horrors that they caused people and move on with their lives and become successful.  She says she admires Christine Blasey Ford for confronting the issue. The amount of strength it takes to come forward is unparalleled. And no one does it for attention, because it s the most painful thing you could possibly do, but also the strongest thing you could possibly do. For too many young people like Spector and Francesca listening to the news right now, they re not learning about sexual violation   because that s already happened, if not to them then to someone they know.What they are learning, educators say, is whether the adults in power will take these claims seriously, and whether speaking up results in harsher consequences for survivors or for those accused.So how are we supposed to talk to our children about all this? Here s some guidance from experts:1. It s your job.  As parents, you are the primary sexuality educator of your children   whether you re saying anything or not,  says Debra Hauser, the president of Advocates for Youth, a national nonprofit that works for honest sexual health education. Francesca works with the organization.When something like this is in the news, as it has been all too often lately, Hauser adds, it s  a great teachable moment.  Talking about a situation that doesn t personally affect your kids or someone they know can be a less threatening way to open up the topic.2. It s not too soon.Hauser says conversations about consent and bodily autonomy can   and should   predate any discussion of the mechanics of sex. You see two 4- or 5-year-olds, where one wants to borrow the other one s crayon and they just grab it,  she explains.  And the response that you have is,  You have to ask for it. And if that other child says no, you have to respect that and find another way to get a crayon.  That s the very beginning of consent education right there. 3. Give them the information.Karen Rayne is a sex educator with a nonprofit called UnHushed. She also has a daughter in middle school and one in high school. She says giving kids the facts they need is especially crucial for younger teens.  They re going to hear whispers and not really have access to full information or the skill set to find that information. 4. Be the  askable  parent.In other words, Hauser explains, be the one that your children can come to with questions. She says that, by bringing up tough topics even when they make you uncomfortable, you increase the likelihood that your child will do the same.Francesca says she confided first in her friends about her assault. It took her awhile to share the story with her mother. My mom was surprised and very upset as any mother would be, but she was very very helpful,  Francesca says. Her mother, sadly, had her own experience of sexual violence to draw on.  She knew the process and the importance of reporting the crime to the police. 5. Or designate someone else they can talk with.Each year, on their birthdays, Hauser would tell each of her children (who are now grown) to name a trusted adult outside of the family to share hard things with. Things they might be tempted to keep secret because of a fear of punishment, a fear of disappointing a parent, or for any other reason.   Let s agree on a couple other adults that you respect that you could go and talk to,    she told them.    And we ll go together and tell them that we have this agreement.   6. Talk to potential perpetrators, not just potential survivors.When talking about sexual assault and consent, we often focus on victims, and primarily on girls.But,  it s the people who are doing the sexual assaulting that need a different kind of education and a different kind of support starting from a very young age,  says Rayne.  About things like [what to do] when they re attracted to someone or interested in someone and that person rejects them.  With the right education, says Rayne, a young man might be able to say,    Oh, you know what? I ve been drinking too much and I feel like my capacity to make wise decisions is failing me.  Or,  Hey, you know, when someone s trying to push me off of them, that s something that I should take as a cue to get off.   Hauser says the landscape of consent is shifting for this generation, and not only with the #MeToo movement. Guidance issued under President Obama has led to a greater emphasis on sexual misconduct prevention and enforcement on campuses under Title IX. And, several states are working towards adding consent to their high school sex education standards.But, Hauser and Rayne say, there s a lot more work to do."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/20/649960272/kavanaugh-accuser-open-to-testifying-about-sexual-assault-allegations,"Updated at 8:20 p.m. ETAttorneys for Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a high school party in the 1980s, have begun discussing terms of her appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week. She wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety,  Debra Katz, Ford s lawyer says in an email to committee aides first reported in the New York Times and confirmed by NPR.Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, set a Friday deadline for Ford to respond to the committee in advance of a hearing he scheduled for Monday. Kavanaugh, who has strongly denied the claims, has already agreed to appear.But Katz says that a Monday hearing  is not possible and the committee s insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event. Grassley was forced to postpone a planned committee vote on Kavanaugh s nomination scheduled for Sept. 20 after Democrats and some of his GOP colleagues demanded the committee investigate the allegations. Ford initially sent the top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, a letter requesting anonymity in July. But when word leaked out that Feinstein had some information about an allegation regarding Kavanaugh, Ford detailed the incident in an interview with the Washington Post published online Sept. 16.Attorneys for Ford did a round of interviews after she went public and pledged that she was prepared to testify before the committee. But Democrats and Ford s attorneys pressed Grassley to first agree to an FBI investigation of the alleged incident and to invite other witnesses to appear at any public hearing.Katz added in her communication to the committee Thursday:  Dr. Ford has asked me to let you know that she appreciates the various options you have suggested. Her strong preference continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony. Thursday evening the White House released a letter from Kavanaugh to Grassley where the judge informed the committee chairman that  I will be there  at Monday s planned hearing.The high court nominee added:  I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name. Since the moment I first heard this allegation, I have categorically and unequivocally denied it. I remain committed to defending my integrity. "
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/20/649853869/fact-check-can-the-senate-enlist-the-fbi-to-reopen-a-kavanaugh-investigation,"Updated at 8:07 p.m. ETCan the Senate Judiciary Committee enlist the FBI to investigate the claims of sexual assault brought by an accuser against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, nominee to the Supreme Court?The short answer: No.The long answer: Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said on Wednesday that she thinks the committee must look into the allegations by Christine Blasey Ford, who says Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her three decades ago.Specifically, Collins told a Maine radio station that she believes in the Senate s responsibility to vet nominees for high office. If it needs more support, it should have it, she said. If we need additional help from the FBI, we could ask for it   the committee could ask for [it],  she said.Collins is an important player because she and a handful of other borderline senators could make the difference in the final vote on Kavanaugh in the Senate. But she doesn t belong to the Judiciary Committee.Even if she did, it doesn t have the authority to give an assignment to an executive branch agency such as the FBI.Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, could ask President Trump to instruct the FBI to become involved. The bureau reports to him in the organizational structure of the government, and for these purposes acts as a kind of  contractor  for the White House, as former FBI assistant director Ron Hosko told NPR. If the White House were to ask the FBI to reopen its file and go conduct the investigation, the FBI could do that,  he said.  I think they could do it swiftly, effectively and report back within days. That is what happened in 1991 when an attorney named Anita Hill brought allegations about sexual harassment against her former colleague Clarence Thomas, who was under consideration for a seat on the Supreme Court.Then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden, D-Del., asked then-President George H.W. Bush to involve the FBI in looking into Hill s accusations.Bush   a Republican who had nominated Thomas and wanted to confirm him   agreed. The FBI went to work questioning Hill and others, and ultimately the Judiciary Committee convened hearings at which she and Thomas appeared.The FBI conducted a background check on Kavanaugh as part of the White House s review process of vetting him for the Supreme Court. Over the course of his career in the federal government, he s undergone a total of six background checks.In July, Ford sent a letter to the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., in which she raised her allegations against Kavanaugh. Feinstein referred Ford s letter to the FBI on Sept. 12. The bureau then sent it to the White House to be added to Kavanaugh s background check file.White House counsel Don McGahn sent that updated file to the Judiciary committee the same day.That isn t clear. What Feinstein has said is that Ford asked her to keep the letter confidential. Then when a news report surfaced about the story, Feinstein said she decided to go public. Her colleagues and Republicans both have criticized her for the way she has handled this situation.So far he hasn t.Grassley says the right way to investigate Ford s case is with a hearing or an interview in which she tells her story and Kavanaugh then has the ability to respond. The Judiciary Committee reportedly also has volunteered to send investigators to Palo Alto, Calif., where Ford lives, to talk with her there outside the view of TV cameras.Ford s lawyer, Deborah Katz, wrote to the Judiciary Committee that Ford would be willing to testify on  terms that are fair and which ensure her safety.  All the same, Ford s  strong preference,  Katz wrote, is for the committee to permit a  full investigation prior to her testimony. The text of Ford s letter was obtained by NPR; it was first reported on Thursday by The New York Times.A number of Democratic senators signed a letter to Trump on Thursday asking him to direct the FBI to investigate Ford s allegation. We urge you to reconsider your decision and ask the FBI to take appropriate action in response to the claims that have been made, so that Judge Kavanaugh s nomination can be considered by the Senate in a manner that is both consistent with past practices and fair to the parties involved and the American people,  the lawmakers wrote.The letter was signed by Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kamala Harris of California, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Doug Jones of Alabama, Tom Udall of New Mexico, and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.The Senate Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, used a thread on Twitter to detail the steps it is taking to investigate Ford s story.It s against the law to lie to Congress, but lying to the FBI is considered really serious. The answers that people in this case might give to FBI investigators could be suggestive in terms of what they say they remember, what they deny and what level of detail they are willing to volunteer   mindful about the potential penalty for lying.Exactly. All this is also taking place amid a thick bramble of political maneuvering.Democrats want Ford s story to carry the imprimatur of the FBI, even if, more than 30 years after the fact, investigators might not be able to do much more than take the statements of people involved.This wouldn t be a criminal investigation, as Hosko said; it s part of the FBI s responsibility to conduct background checks on people who had become eligible for sensitive positions.Or as a Justice Department statement phrased it earlier this week:  The FBI does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation. Republicans, meanwhile, want to confirm Kavanaugh.They argue they ve given every opportunity for Ford to get her story directly to the Judiciary Committee without the involvement of the FBI   either to committee staffers or to members.But Grassley says that although Ford should have the chance to tell her story, he won t wait forever. He said that Ford and her attorneys have until Friday to commit to appear at a hearing scheduled for 10 a.m. on Monday.Katz, however, said in her letter that  a hearing on Monday is not possible and the committee s insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event. It wasn t clear whether Grassley might postpone his hearing to give Ford more time or whether Ford might give up her chance for a public hearing if she cannot make it to the Senate on Monday.In a letter released by the White House Thursday evening, Kavanaugh informed Grassley  I will be there  for the planned hearing Monday. The judge added,  I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name.  Since the moment I first heard this allegation, I have categorically and unequivocally denied it.  I remain committed to defending my integrity.  "

That it happened or not, I have no idea,  Cristina King Miranda told NPR s Nina Totenberg.  I can t say that it did or didn t. That s different from what Miranda wrote Wednesday in a now-deleted Facebook post that stated definitively,  The incident DID happen, many of us heard about it in school. Ford alleges that more than 30 years ago, when she and Kavanaugh were teenagers in high school, he sexually assaulted her at a party ñ holding her down, groping her, attempting to remove her clothes and putting his hand over her mouth when she tried to shout. He has categorically denied her allegations, which suddenly put Kavanaugh s nomination on hold, as lawmakers seek answers.Miranda s new comments are a significant development in what remains a largely  she said, he said  account of events between Ford and Kavanaugh. In my [Facebook] post, I was empowered and I was sure it probably did [happen],  Miranda told NPR.  I had no idea that I would now have to go to the specifics and defend it before 50 cable channels and have my face spread all over MSNBC news and Twitter. Miranda noted on Twitter that she did not have  first hand knowledge  of the incident.Miranda said staff from the Senate Judiciary Committee had reached out to her, something she was not expecting. She said she will not go through with a committee interview if asked.Miranda says she played soccer with Ford   whom she refers to as Chrissy   in high school and that she continues to support her. Miranda added that despite not knowing specifics of what went on at the party three decades ago, she remembers that there was a  buzz  that went around possibly on a weekend about the party where an alleged incident involving students from her school and Kavanaugh s took place.It is something, she said, that was not surprising to hear given the culture of drinking and partying, but she remembers being struck by the  gravity  of what was being talked about.Miranda said she believes Ford, noting that it is unlikely that someone would put herself and her family through such scrutiny if it wasn t true.Ford s lawyers continue to say that they want a full FBI investigation to take place before Ford will testify. Republicans in the Senate are insisting she testify Monday   either publicly or privately. Democrats have objected to the deadline, not wanting to let the hearing degenerate into Kavanaugh s word against Ford s. They fear that without a shared set of facts, Republicans would simply move quickly after the testimony to confirm Kavanaugh.The FBI has already conducted a background check on Kavanaugh and added Ford s letter to Kavanaugh s file. Despite Republican claims that investigations into these matters are the sole responsibility of the Senate, the FBI could open a more extensive investigation. But the White House would have to ask for it. At this point, though, that has not happened and is unlikely to.  It would seem that the FBI really doesn t do that,  Trump contended Wednesday.  They ve investigated about six times before, and it seems that they don t do that. Asked if he would ask the FBI to open a deeper investigation, Trump said he was content to  let the senators do it.  He then added that he thinks it s  very unfair  what s happening to Kavanaugh. It s very unfair, I think, to   as you know, Justice Kavanaugh has been treated very, very tough, and his family,  the president said.  I think it s, a, very unfair thing what s going. "

Claire McCaskill says she will vote against Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court, but the Missouri Democrat, who is facing re-election in November, says it is not because of allegations of sexual misconduct swirling around the nominee.In a statement posted to Twitter on Wednesday, McCaskill says the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford   the professor who says Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when the two were teenagers   are  troubling  and need to be examined.Kavanaugh says the allegation is false. [My] decision is not based on those allegations but rather on his positions on several key issues, most importantly the avalanche of dark, anonymous money that is crushing our democracy,  McCaskill wrote. He has revealed his bias against limits on campaign donations which places him completely out of the mainstream of this nation,  she wrote, adding that she was  also uncomfortable about his view on Presidential power as it relates to the rule of law, and his position that corporations are people. Ford s accusation has caused a delay in the committee s vote on whether to recommend Kavanaugh, whose nomination would then need to be approved by the full Senate.McCaskill is in a tough re-election fight in a state that has gone Republican in the last five presidential elections. In several recent polls, she is in a dead heat with her opponent, Josh Hawley.As The Associated Press notes:"

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/19/649481501/trump-says-he-wants-to-hear-from-kavanaughs-accuser,"Updated at 6:08 p.m. ETPresident Trump says he hopes the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her will appear at a hearing next week before the Senate Judiciary Committee.Speaking to reporters as he left the White House for a trip to visit flood damage in North Carolina, Trump said he  really wants to see  Christine Blasey Ford testify on Monday.  If she shows up and makes a credible showing,  Trump said, referring to Ford,  that ll be very interesting, and we ll have to make a decision. Trump repeated his support for Kavanaugh, calling him  such an outstanding man, it s very hard for me to imagine anything happened. But he said it s not the FBI s job to conduct an investigation of her claims, saying,  It s up to the Senate and I really rely on them. Ford s lawyers have asked the FBI to investigate her charge   that a drunken Kavanaugh groped her and tried to remove her clothes at a party when they were both teenagers more than three decades ago   before she agrees to appear at the hearing, but Republicans have refused to go along.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has offered to allow Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University in California, to speak either in private or in public before the committee but has made it clear that her only opportunity will be Monday.Ford s lawyers say she has been subject to death threats as a result of her allegations against Kavanaugh.In a letter to Ford s attorneys released Wednesday, Grassley said  no one should be subject to that behavior.  He said the committee is investigating Ford s accusation against Kavanaugh, but that  we have no power to commandeer an Executive Branch agency into conducting our due diligence. Grassley also said that Ford has to submit any testimony and her biography to the committee by Friday morning if she plans to testify.He followed up later in the day with a letter to committee Democrats refuting their requests for a delay and criticizing their conduct during the confirmation process. This is but the latest   and most serious   of your side s abuse of this confirmation process,  Grassley said.  There has been delay and obstruction of this process at every tum and with every argument available. Therefore, I will view any additional complaints about the process very skeptically  Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has been seen as a key GOP swing vote on Kavanaugh, because of her support for abortion rights. She told WVOM Radio in Maine it would  not be fair to Judge Kavanaugh,  if Ford does not come forward and testify. Both of them need to testify under oath next Monday before the Judiciary Committee,  Collins said.  And if the professor is more comfortable that that be in a closed session where it would be videotaped and that videotape be released later that would be fine. That s an option that the committee has given her. Collins, who is not a member of the Judiciary Committee, contradicted Grassley, saying  if we need additional help from the FBI we could ask for it the committee could ask for it. Collins said she pressed Kavanaugh on Ford s accusation in a phone call with him last week,  and he was categorical and emphatic in his denial. In a tweet Wednesday morning, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said requiring an FBI investigation of a 36-year-old allegation  is not about finding the truth, but delaying the process till after the midterm elections.

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/18/649209595/hearing-with-kavanaugh-and-accuser-alleging-sexual-assault-in-turmoil,"Updated at 11 p.m. ETThe Senate Judiciary Committee will move forward with a hearing scheduled for Monday on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, despite a request for further investigation from his accuser.The decision follows the release of a letter sent to Senate Judiciary Commitee Chairman Chuck Grassley from attorneys representing Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her more than three decades ago when they were teenagers. In the letter, Ford s attorneys said an FBI investigation should be  the first step in addressing her allegations. Ford s attorneys argue that an investigation is necessary so that  the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions.  Ford s attorneys also say that since she went public with her allegations  she has been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats.  They also complained that the committee scheduled Ford to  testify at the same table as Judge Kavanaugh in front of two dozen U.S. Senators on national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident. Grassley declined Tuesday night to delay the hearing. The invitation for Monday still stands,  Grassley said in a statement.  Nothing the FBI or any other investigator does would have any bearing on what Dr. Ford tells the committee, so there is no reason for any further delay. Grassley s decision echoed the sentiment of Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  The FBI does not do investigations like this. The responsibility falls to us,  Hatch tweeted, adding  We should proceed as planned. And retiring Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., suggested that if Ford did not appear at Monday s hearing, Senate Republicans should proceed to move forward considering Kavanaugh s nomination.   If we don t hear from both sides on Monday, let s vote,  Corker posted on Twitter late Tuesday night.The letter from Ford s attorneys and Grassley s response capped a day of uncertainty about the next step in the Kavanaugh confirmation process, which has spiraled into turmoil in recent days.Ford s attorneys stopped short of saying Ford will refuse to appear before the committee while objecting to the rushed timeline and comments from Republican senators who seemed to question her accusations. The hearing was scheduled for six short days from today and would include interrogation by Senators who appear to have made up their minds that she is  mistaken  and  mixed up,    the letter reads.  While no sexual assault survivor should be subjected to such an ordeal, Dr. Ford wants to cooperate with the Committee and with law enforcement officials. Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, issued statements supporting Ford s concerns about the hearing. I strongly support Dr. Ford s call for an FBI investigation before a hearing is held,  Schumer said.  Dr. Ford s call for the FBI to investigate also demonstrates her confidence that when all the facts are examined by an impartial investigation, her account will be further corroborated and confirmed. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, also weighed in to support Ford. We should honor Dr. Blasey Ford s wishes and delay this hearing,  Feinstein said in a statment.  A proper investigation must be completed, witnesses interviewed, evidence reviewed and all sides spoken to. Only then should the chairman set a hearing date. Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate Judiciary Committee would offer Ford the opportunity to testify in either an open public session or behind closed doors about her allegation. She could do it privately if she prefers, or publicly if she prefers,  McConnell said, adding,  Monday is her opportunity.  He stressed that Kavanaugh is eager to provide his testimony.Democratic aides have privately floated the possibility of boycotting the hearing if Republicans choose to proceed without Ford present.Grassley s committee staff has already begun conducting preliminary interviews by phone with alleged witnesses related to the incident that Ford described to the Washington Post as having happened in the early 1980s when she and Kavanaugh were teenagers living in the Washington, D.C., suburbs. Aides plan follow-up sessions as needed to obtain additional information ahead of Monday s planned public hearing.Ford named Mark Judge, a classmate of Kavanaugh s, as a witness to the incident at the high school party, but Judge told the Weekly Standard earlier this week he doesn t recall the episode.Grassley s office released a letter from Judge s attorney on Tuesday with a statement from him saying he has  no memory  of the incident. He also says,  I have no more information to offer the Committee and I do not wish to speak publicly regarding the incidents described in Dr. Ford s letter. Democrats have rejected the GOP process and are refusing to participate in any committee phone interviews. They are insisting that the hearing be delayed to further explore the allegations. They want additional witnesses beyond Kavanaugh and Ford to be added to the planned hearing Monday.But their primary demand is one that Ford asked for her in her letter Tuesday night   that the FBI conduct a full evaluation before any hearing is held.That s a proposal President Trump himself rejected earlier Tuesday prior to the release of the letter from Ford s attorneys. That s not what they do,  Trump said.  They have done now, supposedly, six background checks as Judge Kavanaugh has gone beautifully up a ladder. On Monday a spokesperson for the Justice Department indicated that the FBI does not get involved in matters unless a federal crime is alleged and that it had completed its work related to Kavanaugh s background check.Speaking at a joint news conference with Polish President Andrzej Sebastian Duda, Trump said Tuesday he feels  so badly  that Kavanaugh is going through the ordeal of the accusations. I feel terribly for him, for his wife and for his beautiful young daughters,  Trump said.  I feel terribly for them. Washington state Sen. Patty Murray, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, told reporters that an FBI investigation is necessary to ensure a full and impartial assessment of the accusations. Scheduling a hearing for Monday, a week from when Dr. Ford made her accusations public, is a shameful attempt to jam this through without giving anyone the time they need to investigate and put together the questions that need to be asked,  Murray said.  This is a test for the United States Senate on how we handle accusations of sexual harassment and assault. Murray and other Democrats are drawing a direct parallel between the claims against Kavanaugh and those raised in 1991 when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment during his confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court. At the time an all-male Senate Judiciary Committee aggressively questioned Hill in televised hearings, cast doubt on her accusations and ultimately voted to move Thomas  nomination to the full Senate which confirmed him to the court.That incident inspired a record number of women to run for federal office that cycle, including Murray, who was elected the following year. Murray told reporters America   and women in particular   will be closely watching how Ford s case is handled. If Republicans attack Dr. Ford and this turns into anything like what we saw in 1991, women across the country are going to rise up and make their voice heard and Republicans will pay a very huge price,  Murray said.  I am here today to say, once again, women are watching, we are not going allow that to happen again. Before Ford asked for an FBI investigation, McConnell and other leaders said they wanted to hear directly from Ford but were standing firm on their expectation that she appear before the committee on Monday, blaming Democrats for creating a disorderly examination of Kavanaugh s record. Next week Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh will testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath,  McConnell said Tuesday.  We should not have gotten to this point. That this process has played out with so little order and so little sensitivity lies solely at the feet of Senate Democrats. Republicans have accused Feinstein of concealing details of Ford s accusation for several months after it was sent to her office in July.Feinstein referred the information to the FBI but did not discuss it until Ford went public over the weekend. She defended her decision to keep the letter private Tuesday, saying she was respecting Ford s own request for anonymity and following procedure for working with federal investigators. What we were trying to do was get an investigation,  Feinstein said.  We were going through all of that process. Some Republicans are warning that the Judiciary Committee has to tread lightly and handle the accusations with respect, regardless of their timing. Retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., told reporters that there is a risk in being too aggressive or appearing to bully Ford. McConnell and other top GOP leaders repeatedly stressed that Ford deserved to be heard and they hoped she would agree to testify.Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who is one of just a handful of Republicans who have not said whether they plan to support Kavanaugh, proposed calling both Kavanaugh and Ford to testify and allowing their attorneys to question them both as witnesses.  I believe that would elicit the most information,  Collins said."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/18/649131634/president-trump-to-hold-news-conference-with-polands-president,"Updated at 6:05 p.m. ETPresident Trump issued his most forceful defense yet of his embattled Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday.Speaking to reporters during a press conference with Poland s president, Trump called Kavanaugh  a great man  and said that he feels  terribly  for the federal appeals court judge and his family.Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford, a 51-year-old California professor, who said that when they were both teenagers more than three decades ago Kavanaugh allegedly tried to grope her and take off her clothes.The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for Monday at which Kavanaugh will testify. The panel has also invited Ford, who has yet to respond to the invitation from senators. I feel so badly for him that he s going through this,  Trump said during the joint news conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Trump blasted Democrats, and in particular Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., for not raising the accusation against Kavanaugh sooner.  She had this meeting, (with Kavanaugh) why didn t she bring it up?  Trump asked.Democrats have said that Ford asked for anonymity in a letter she sent to her congresswoman, Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., detailing the incident. Eshoo passed the letter to Feinstein, who turned it over to the FBI.But Trump said he supported the additional Judiciary Committee hearing, saying  there shouldn t even be a little doubt,  about Kavanaugh s nomination.  They will look at what she had to say from 36 years ago,  he said,  and we will see what happens.  Honestly, I feel terribly for him,  Trump said of Kavanaugh,  for his wife, who is an incredible, lovely woman, and for his beautiful, young daughters. Trump also spoke about trade and military matters in his press conference with the Polish leader. It was Trump s first formal question-and-answer session with reporters since July.Duda and Trump held private talks prior to the press conference Tuesday at the White House. In a photo-op earlier in the Oval Office, Trump also said he supported the planned hearing next week. A delay is certainly acceptable,  Trump said in his Oval Office remarks.  We want to get to the bottom of everything, we want to let everybody to be able to speak up and to speak out. He added,  It s a terrible thing that took place, and it s frankly a terrible thing that this information wasn t given to us a long time ago. On trade   a day after imposing 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, to which China retaliated with $60 billion in additional tariffs on U.S. goods   Trump said  we ve just started.  He repeated his frequent assertion that the U.S. has been the victim of unfair trade practices, saying  we ve been ripped off by China, we ve been ripped off by...the European Union, we ve been ripped off by everybody. The two leaders also discussed a possible U.S. military base in Poland. Trump said Poland offered  much more than $2 billion to do this, and so we re looking at it,  for security reasons and for economic reasons.Duda joked that such a facility could be called  Fort Trump.  The U.S. currently rotates troops into Poland. A former lieutenant general in the Army who commanded forces in Europe wrote in June that establishing a U.S. military base in Poland would be viewed by U.S. allies as  unnecessarily provocative.  NPR s Tom reports that view was echoed Tuesday by a senior Defense Department official who questioned the notion of a permanent Polish base. "
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/18/649085712/democrats-want-fbi-to-investigate-kavanaugh-allegations-it-likely-wont,"When Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, announced a hearing for next Monday to air a decades-old sexual-assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, it didn t end the debate over how the Senate should handle the charges.It intensified it.Democrats are calling for a full FBI investigation of the allegation before a hearing, saying Monday is too soon. I d have the professionals go in there, seek corroborating evidence, talk to the people involved, certainly talk to the third person who they claimed was there, and that hasn t been done,  Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, a longtime member of the Judiciary Committee and a former chairman, told NPR s Morning Edition.  This might take a week or two to get all of this together, but what difference does one or two weeks make when you re talking about a lifetime appointment. Republicans and the Trump White House argue that isn t the FBI s role. The Justice Department seems to agree. In a statement, a Justice Department spokeswoman said the FBI   which has added a letter from Christine Blasey Ford to Kavanaugh s already completed background report file   had already done all it was going to do, because  the allegation does not involve any potential federal crime.  The FBI does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation,  the statement reads.  The purpose of a background investigation is to determine whether the nominee could pose a risk to the national security of the United States. The allegation does not involve any potential federal crime. The FBI s role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers. Grassley was more definitive in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Tuesday morning. The FBI investigation of Judge Kavanaugh is closed,  he said.  The FBI is not doing any further investigation. Blasey Ford has accused Kavanaugh of a sexual attack when they were both in high school. She sent a letter to her congresswoman, Rep. Anna Eshoo, in July, which made its way to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Blasey Ford asked for confidentiality, and the allegation was not made public   until this past weekend.That s when she came forward for the first time publicly in an interview with The Washington Post. She detailed her memories of the incident, saying that Kavanaugh pulled her into a bedroom along with another boy, then allegedly groped her, trying to remove her clothing, and put his hand over her mouth to muffle her screams.Kavanaugh responded through the White House with a categorical denial. This is a completely false allegation,  he said.  I have never done anything like what the accuser describes   to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. I am willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the Committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity. He will do that in a scheduled hearing Monday, in what Democrats worry will be a replay of another he-said, she-said exercise in 1991 when Anita Hill came forward with sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.Democrats complained that there was not a thorough FBI investigation of the allegations that took place, and no major witnesses other than Hill and Thomas who were called. Monday s planned hearing seems to be following a similar pattern.Grassley told Hewitt Tuesday that,  Yes,  there will only be two witnesses Monday.  We ve got two people involved,  Grassley said,  and two people ought to be able to present their stories and then we ll have to be the jury. Grassley added,  Accusers deserve to be heard and, after they re heard and we also have a responsibility to hear Judge Kavanaugh, and I want to hear from Dr. Ford, and she deserves to be heard, because these are serious accusations. Grassley said it isn t even 100 percent certain at this point whether Ford or Kavanaugh will testify first, though he is inclined to have Ford go first.On Morning Edition Tuesday, Leahy suggested that another man who was allegedly in the room at the time of the encounter be called before the committee.There were other potential witnesses who came forward before the Hill-Thomas hearings, and then-Chairman Joe Biden declined to let them testify, something he now has said publicly he regrets.Democrats argue that other witnesses could provide context and verify or refute parts of the stories that either person tells. For example, a friend and neighbor of Blasey Ford s told the San Jose Mercury News that Blasey Ford told her of the incident in 2017 before Kavanaugh was nominated.The paper reports:Grassley told Hewitt that he has not heard from Blasey Ford yet, saying the committee has reached out to her. We still haven t heard from Dr. Ford, so do they want to have the hearing or not?  Grassley said.Blasey Ford s attorneys told NPR s Morning Edition and other outlets that Ford is willing to testify.Grassley told Hewitt he hoped the hearing wouldn t devolve into a circuslike atmosphere. The days of Kavanaugh confirmation hearings were often interrupted by protesters, and Republicans accused Democrats   especially those possible 2020 presidential candidates   of grandstanding. I d like to see 21 members of our committee listen patiently to both witnesses,  Grassley said,  and kind of act like a jury and then wait until you hear all the evidence, and then make your mind up afterwards. And I m going to be respectful, and I hope my colleagues will be too. Grassley also couldn t answer whether each senator will get one or two rounds of questions. He said that hasn t been worked out and pointed to the Democrats, noting that there hasn t been a lot of cooperation from Democratic staff.Hewitt asked whether there was any thought of having a female lawyer or someone like former Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire come in to do the questioning since there are no Republican women on the Judiciary Comittee. You re raising legitimate questions that are still on our mind,  Grassley said,  and so these details are still being worked out. All that s certain at the moment is that a hearing is scheduled for Monday, and that both Kavanaugh and Blasey Ford have been invited and have expressed an openness to participating to publicly tell their side of the story.For Republicans, who wanted Kavanaugh confirmed in time for the start of the new Supreme Court session beginning Oct. 1, a week or two would throw that timeline off. More important, Republicans want him confirmed before November s elections in the off chance that Democrats take control of the Senate.Then again, this new allegation has already cast a massive shadow over Kavanaugh s nomination. Kavanaugh s supporters in the Senate and the White House question Democrats  motives, suggesting all they really want is to delay a confirmation vote. He wasn t going to vote for Brett Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court in the first place,  Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said of Leahy, who appeared before her on the PBS NewsHour Monday night.  A lot of people in the Senate weren t going to vote for him anyway. Still, Conway and other Republicans are going out of their way to say they want Ford and Kavanaugh to be heard. It s good to hear from both the accuser and the accused here,  Conway said,  and allow the Senate to weigh what they learn in those exchanges, along with the mountain of other testimonial evidence and other statements of support and endorsements of Brett Kavanaugh by the women he s known all throughout his life.

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/18/648923950/battle-for-the-senate-candidates-in-key-races-respond-to-kavanaugh-allegations,"Updated at 7:30 p.m. ET As the confirmation vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh neared, both parties had seen potential political benefits for them in the upcoming midterm elections.For Republicans, it was a chance to energize the base by putting another conservative justice on the court, potentially reshaping it for a generation.For Democrats, the specter of rolling back abortion rights, the Affordable Care Act and more was a way to further energize an already engaged liberal base to go to the polls.But with Kavanaugh now facing decades-old allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman while in high school, his once-assured confirmation has been upended and the process is being pushed back with little time   just seven weeks   before Election Day.Both Republicans and Democrats in high-profile Senate contests are calling for more investigation into the matter, with an open hearing featuring Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, now scheduled for next Monday. However, some candidates have cast doubt on the timing and motivation of the allegations.Republicans only have a slim 51-49 advantage in the Senate. Democrats are largely playing defense this cycle, but they now have a narrow but not completely implausible path to reclaiming a majority, which would hamper the massive reshaping of the federal judiciary that President Trump has been able to execute with a GOP-controlled chamber.NPR sought out comment from every major candidate in competitive Senate contests being decided in November. In some of the tightest races there was a cautious tone. For instance, in the open Arizona Senate contests, where two women will face off   Republican Rep. Martha McSally versus Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema   both said the allegations against Kavanaugh were serious and merited further investigation. McSally said that hearing testimony from both Kavanaugh and Ford was a  sensible way forward.  Sinema said that judicial nominees  should be carefully vetted and judged without partisanship. Democratic incumbents in states that Trump carried are already top GOP targets and were under pressure to cross the aisle and vote for Kavanaugh. All of them said that the accusations merited further investigation. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp underscored that it takes  courage for any woman to speak up about sexaul assault,  while Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said she was  deeply troubled by these allegations.  West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said that  Professor Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard and Judge Kavanaugh deserves a chance to clear his name. But some GOP challengers suggested that there were partisan motivations behind Ford s accusations. Rep. Kevin Cramer, who is challenging Heitkamp, said that  it is hard not to be skeptical considering the timing and history of the allegations  and that while it should be taken seriously,  absent significant evidence being brought forth immediately, I feel Judge Kavanaugh s confirmation process should proceed. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, who is running against McCaskill, said in statement that while he believes both Ford and Kavanaugh should  be heard immediately and under oath,  the timing of the  30-year-old allegation  was suspect.  The Democrats have played politics with this entire process and were opposed to Brett Kavanaugh before he was even nominated. They don t care about the truth,  Hawley said. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging Manchin, said that the  allegations should absolutely be taken seriously, but Senate Democrats have done a disservice to the accused, the accuser, and the American people, by politically waiting until the 11th hour to bring forward these allegations. In the Tennessee Senate race, GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a fierce Trump defender, took one of the hardest lines. She pointed out that Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has known about these allegations since this summer (although Ford only came forward publicly this weekend), and called it a  delay tactic  and that Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa,  should proceed with the vote.  Her Democratic opponent, former Gov. Phil Bredesen, responded that  Ford should be heard. If U.S senators are not going to give a careful and thorough consideration of Supreme Court nominees, then I don t know what they think their job is. Both parties are already running ads about the allegations. The conservative Judicial Crisis Network announced a $1.5 million ad blitz with an ad featuring Louisa Garry, who has been friends with Kavanaugh for 35 years.  He s dedicated to his work. He s dedicated to his family. He is of the highest integrity as a person and I believe that he would be a great Supreme Court Justice,  she says in a direct-to-camera ad.Meanwhile, the liberal group Demand Justice is launching a $700,000 digital and TV campaign targeting Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, who s the most endangered GOP incumbent up for re-election in 2018; Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, who is up for re-election in 2020; and moderate swing votes Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski.Below are full statements, tweets or other public comments from Senate candidates in competitive races, along with their ratings by the Cook Political Report. If a candidate has not responded to a request for comment, it is noted, and we will update if they make a statement.Republican Rep. Martha McSally:  This is a very serious allegation. Senator Grassley said he s reaching out to both parties for more information, and Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford have said they are willing to provide testimony on this matter. That is a sensible way forward. Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema:  The allegation is concerning and the Senate should conduct a thorough investigation before voting. Judicial nominations, especially to the highest court in the U.S., should be carefully vetted and judged without partisanship. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, via Twitter:  I m still waiting for a meeting with Judge Kavanaugh I ve requested four times. I have a number of questions for him. Meantime, I agree there should be an investigation of the new allegations against him. I believe the people involved should appear before the Judiciary committee. Republican Gov. Rick Scott: No response yetDemocratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, via Twitter:  The allegations made against Judge Kavanaugh are serious and merit further review. Given the nature of these allegations, and the number of outstanding questions, I believe the Judiciary Committee should hold off on Thursday s scheduled vote. - Joe Republican nominee Mike Braun:   I support Senator Grassley s decision to have these 11th hour allegations thoroughly reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and weighed against Judge Kavanaugh s decades of public service, sterling record on the bench, outstanding personal reputation, and his unequivocal denial of the allegations. Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, via Twitter:  This is serious. Christine Ford should be heard before the Judiciary Committee moves forward on a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. Republican nominee John James: No response yetDemocratic Sen. Tina Smith, via Twitter:  These are very serious allegations. Both Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford have agreed to testify in front of the Judiciary Committee and that needs to happen. And we must have a full and thorough investigation before anything else can happen with this nomination. Republican nominee Karin Housley: Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith:  Having met with Judge Kavanaugh, I found him to be imminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, and remain confident of his confirmation.  I have serious reservations regarding the questionable timing and handling of this last-minute allegation.  The Democrats knew about this months ago and chose to wait until now to release it.  The Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on the allegation.  This process should go forward so both sides can be heard. GOP challenger Chris McDaniel, via Twitter:  The same talking heads who protected Bill Clinton are the very ones destroying Brett Kavanaugh. Let that sink in. Democratic former Rep. Mike Espy:  I agree with Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee that these allegations are serious and troubling. This matter must be fully investigated before the Senate moves forward with the lifetime appointment of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, via Twitter:  On Judge Kavanaugh: I am deeply troubled by these allegations. They should be examined thoroughly and fairly by the Judiciary Committee without any artificial timeline. Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley:   I m concerned that Senator Feinstein and the Democrats waited until the last hour to bring this 30-year old allegation to light. The Democrats have played politics with this entire process and were opposed to Brett Kavanaugh before he was even nominated. They don t care about the truth. I believe allegations of sexual misconduct should never be disregarded. That s why it s important that both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh be heard immediately and under oath. Democratic Sen. Jon Tester:  I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we need to get the facts about these serious allegations. I take my Constitutional duty to screen Supreme Court nominees very seriously, and I ll keep trying to get a meeting with Judge Kavanaugh to ask him tough questions about this lifetime appointment. State Auditor Matt Rosendale: Rosendale spokesman Shane Scanlon:  Matt agrees with President Trump that we should have a full process and hear from both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. This is a serious accusation, which is why it remains deeply concerning that Dianne Feinstein and Senate Democrats sat on this information for so long and then leaked it at their convenience, right before an important vote. Republican Sen. Dean Heller: No response yetDemocratic Rep. Jacky Rosen:  Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s account is credible, it should be taken seriously, and I agree with the bipartisan calls for an immediate and thorough investigation before the Judiciary Committee moves forward. If Senator Heller still has  no reservations  about confirming Judge Kavanaugh to a lifetime appointment on the nation s highest court, then he isn t listening to Nevadans. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez, via Twitter:  This is exactly why we can t rush nominations. How can we vote on Kavanaugh when disturbing, credible allegations of sexual assault have been made? Even Republican Senators Jeff Flake & Bob Corker want to delay the vote. I agree. #DelayTheVote. Republican nominee Bob Hugin, via Twitter:  An allegation this serious in nature should be fully investigated. I am hopeful that Senators in both parties will ensure that happens immediately. Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp: Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer:  It is hard not to be skeptical considering the timing and history of the allegations. Of course any allegation of this nature should be taken seriously, but absent significant evidence being brought forth immediately, I feel Judge Kavanaugh s confirmation process should proceed. Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown:  I agree with Senators on both sides of the aisle that the Judiciary Committee should take the time it needs to investigate. Republican Rep. Jim Renacci:  The allegations against Brett Kavanaugh are serious and should be thoroughly examined, and by the same standard, anyone who calls on Kavanaugh to step aside based on these allegations must also call on Sherrod Brown to resign given the substantial evidence and affidavits detailing Brown s history of domestic violence.  (Note: The Columbus Dispatch has more on the decades-old allegations against Brown, which his ex-wife refutes)Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, via Twitter:  Dr. Christine Blasey Ford has bravely come forward and deserves to be heard. What she describes in her interview is a violent sexual assault, which should be disqualifying for a nominee to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. The Judiciary Committee should postpone Thursday s vote and conduct a full review of this matter. Republican Rep. Lou Barletta:  We should take allegations of this nature seriously. It is unfortunate that Senate Democrats waited until the 11th hour to bring to light information they have had in their possession for months, leaving little option for giving Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser a fair hearing. Ranking Member Feinstein and her colleagues have played politics with both Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser on one of the most sensitive issues our society deals with. That is unacceptable and beneath the jobs they were elected to do. In light of the recent allegation, it would be best for Judge Kavanaugh, his accuser, and the American people to hear testimony immediately from both sides in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, on the Hugh Hewitt radio show Monday morning:  I have to tell you, after all the vetting that Judge Kavanaugh has been through to be a judge, a federal judge, and then the fact that this letter is something that Sen. Feinstein has had since July, I think that this is a delay tactic, and I think that Sen. Grassley should proceed with a vote. Former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen, via Twitter:  Dr. Christine Blasey Ford should be heard. If U.S senators are not going to give a careful and thorough consideration of Supreme Court nominees, then I don t know what they think their job is. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz:  These allegations are serious and deserve to be treated with respect. Professor Ford should have a full opportunity to tell her story before the Judiciary Committee, and Judge Kavanaugh should have a full opportunity to defend himself. That hearing should be sooner, rather than later, so the committee can make the best assessment possible of the allegations. Democratic Rep. Beto O Rourke: No response yetDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin, via Twitter:  Professor Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard and Judge Kavanaugh deserves a chance to clear his name. Both have said they are willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and I hope they will be given the opportunity to do that as quickly as possible. Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey:  I have full confidence in the Senate Judiciary Committee and President Trump s team to handle these allegations in an appropriate and timely manner, allowing both sides to be heard. It is disappointing, however, that Senate Democrats held this information for weeks only to drop it on the eve of the Judiciary Committee vote. The allegations should absolutely be taken seriously, but Senate Democrats have done a disservice to the accused, the accuser, and the American people, by politically waiting until the 11th hour to bring forward these allegations. Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, via Twitter:  I have read Dr. Ford s letter and I find the allegations deeply disturbing, serious and credible. There should be no vote on this lifetime nomination for our highest court until this matter is fully investigated and Dr. Ford and the nominee appear before the Senate Judiciary Cmte Republican nominee Leah Vukmir:   These are serious allegations and both the accuser and Judge Kavanaugh should have an opportunity to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Additionally, while the Senate continues to evaluate Judge Kavanaugh, it s disappointing Senator Baldwin has been unable to do her job and meet with him. "

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/17/648803684/who-is-christine-blasey-ford-the-woman-accusing-brett-kavanaugh-of-sexual-assaul,"Updated on Sept. 20 at 5:20 p.m. ETThe woman who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault revealed her identity Sunday in an interview with The Washington Post.Christine Blasey Ford, a 51-year-old California professor, accused Kavanaugh of groping her and trying to take her clothes off when they were both attending suburban Maryland high schools in the early 1980s.In July, Ford reached out to her congresswoman, Rep. Anna Eshoo, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein with her account of the incident, but requested confidentiality. Feinstein acknowledged her knowledge of the accusation last week but kept Ford s identity private until the Sunday Post article. Feinstein said she passed Ford s account on to the FBI.Who is the accuser? Ford is a professor and research psychologist in Northern California at Palo Alto University and the Stanford University PsyD Consortium, a clinical psychology program where she teaches statistics, research methods and psychometrics. She has been widely published in her field and, according to a 2016 book she co-authored, her consultation area of expertise is the interaction between pharmaceutical companies and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Ford received her Ph.D. from the University of Southern California, master s degrees from Stanford University and Pepperdine University, and her bachelor s degree from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.In 2002, she married Russell Ford, in Half Moon Bay, Calif., according to a marriage announcement from the time. Russell Ford is a mechanical engineer and has worked for pharmaceutical and medical research companies. The Fords live in Palo Alto with their two sons, according to the San Jose Mercury News.Christine Blasey Ford grew up in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., and attended Holton-Arms School, a private preparatory school in Bethesda for girls in third through 12th grade.The school s head, Susanna Jones, released a statement Sunday calling it  imperative  that Ford s story be heard.  As a school that empowers women to use their voices, we are proud of this alumna for using hers,  Jones said.A draft letter, appearing to be signed by more than 200 Holton-Arms alumnae from 1967 to 2018, called for an investigation into the allegation and said Ford s experience is one that is  all too consistent with stories we heard and lived while attending Holton. Many of us are survivors ourselves. Jim Gensheimer, a friend of Ford s, told the San Jose Mercury News that Ford has been  trying to forget about this all of her life, basically  and that she has told him that she is afraid to sleep in bedrooms that do not have a second way out.What does Ford say happened? The alleged incident happened at a small party the summer before Ford s junior year, Ford s lawyer, Lisa Banks, said in an interview with Morning Edition s Rachel Martin. Kavanaugh was attending Georgetown Preparatory School, a private school in North Bethesda, Md., at the time. At one point she walked away to go to the bathroom and went up a small flight of stairs, at which point she was pushed into a bedroom. The door was locked behind her,  Banks told NPR.  And Brett Kavanaugh got on top of her on the bed, pushed her down on the bed on her back, began groping at her, trying to take off her clothes. Ford described Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, a second boy in the room, as  stumbling drunk  in her interview with the Post.  When she tried to scream, he put his hand over her mouth to silence her. Mark Judge was in the room, egging him on. They turned up the music very loudly and at some point Mark Judge jumped on the bed, they all toppled off, and she was able to escape,  Banks told NPR. I thought he might inadvertently kill me,  Ford told the Post.  He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing. The alleged incident happened more than 30 years ago, but Banks says Ford s recollection of the event is  crystal clear.  I would also note that she has medical records that corroborate these allegations that far predate Mr. Kavanaugh s nomination,  Banks added in her Morning Edition interview, referring to notes from a 2012 couples therapy session, which the Post reviewed. In the session, Ford described an attack during her high school years, although she did not name Kavanaugh explicitly. Ford told the Post that she did not tell anyone, including her husband, about the incident until 2012.In a statement, Kavanaugh denied the allegation: This is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes   to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. I am willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the Committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity. Mark Judge also denies the accusation that he witnessed the assault.Why come forward now?Banks said Ford struggled  mightily  with the decision to alert lawmakers to the alleged incident. She was weighing her desire and her belief that she had a civic duty to provide this information to those making the decision about Brett Kavanaugh with, frankly, her fear about coming forward,  Banks told NPR.  And there was going to be great personal risk to her and her family in doing so. And given the political environment, and given how the nomination process was rolling along, she made the calculation that she did not want to come forward publicly. Ford is a registered Democrat who has made small political contributions to Democratic organizations. In April 2017, she attended a March For Science in San Francisco, which was held to protest Trump administration cuts to research, and she signed a letter in June 2018 condemning the Trump administration s policy, since abandoned, of separating immigrant children from their parents at the border.Banks said Ford was not motivated by politics but ultimately decided to provide her account  so that those making a very important decision can make an informed decision with all the facts. When Anita Hill accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in 1991, there were four women in the Senate and none on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Thomas went on to be confirmed.But Ford s accusation is coming to light in a different era. Now, with 23 women in the Senate   including four on the judiciary committee   and the backdrop of the #MeToo movement, Kavanaugh s future as a Supreme Court justice is in uncharted territory."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/17/648783307/from-anita-hill-to-christine-blasey-ford-the-similarities-and-differences,"Professor Christine Blasey Ford came forward on Sunday for the first time telling her story alleging that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually attacked her 35 years ago when the two were both in high school.So how is this different from the sexual harassment allegations made against now Justice Clarence Thomas by law professor Anita Hill in 1991 at his confirmation hearing?I know because I was there. I broke the story and then watched in amazement as events unfolded.There are big differences and similarities in these two events.Hill and Thomas were adults: Hill s accounts involved events that she said took place over a prolonged period of time in an employment setting when she worked for Thomas at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.While there was no touching involved, Hill said Thomas had eight years earlier first tried to date her, and when she declined, he subjected her, over a long period of time, to sexually explicit and sometimes bizarre sexual comments.Physical attack: Ford s allegations, first reported with her name attached to them by The Washington Post, involve a single sexual attack   a very physical attack   that she said took place at an unsupervised teenage party, where high school kids were drinking.Ford charges that a  stumbling drunk  Kavanaugh, who was 17 at the time, attacked her 36 years ago, when she was 15. She said Kavanaugh was one of four boys at a private party of teenagers with no parental supervision.She alleges that when she went upstairs to go to the bathroom, Kavanaugh and another boy, Mark Judge, pulled her into a bedroom and locked the door. According to Ford, Kavanaugh then jumped on top of her, tried to take her clothes off, and when she tried to scream, put his hand over her mouth and turned up the music. She said was able to free herself when Judge jumped on the bed, too, sending the three tumbling, giving her a chance to run into the bathroom and lock the door.Both Hill and Blasey Ford took professionally administered polygraph tests and passed. But while Hill told several friends contemporaneously about what was happening to her on the job, Ford said she told nobody. She told The Washington Post she was terrified to tell her parents that she had been at a party where teenagers were drinking. I m not telling anyone this,  she recalled thinking.  This is nothing. It didn t happen, and he didn t rape me. But after going through psychotherapy, she came to understand the events that night as trauma with lasting impact on her life. She did not tell anyone the details of that night until 2012.The #MeToo movement: Hill s allegations occurred in 1991, when there was no #MeToo movement and, indeed, sexual harassment claims were often not considered serious matters. When I first learned of Hill s charges back then, most of the Democratic senators I talked to did not want a public airing of her charges, believing that, as one put it,  This is not a silver bullet. The makeup of the Senate: At the time of the Hill allegations, there were no women on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and only two women in the U.S. Senate   Republican Nancy Kassebaum and Democrat Barbara Mikulski.When my story broke, a group of female House members marched over to the Senate to urge their colleagues in  the other body  to investigate, but they were, as one put it to me,  totally dissed  by the senators.Today there are no female Republican members of the Judiciary Committee, but there are four Democratic women, including ranking member Dianne Feinstein, who was elected the year after the Hill-Thomas hearings, in what came to be known as  The Year of the Woman. Moreover, today there are 23 female senators, nearly a quarter of the Senate. And there is an activist #MeToo movement.Desire to avoid the spotlight: In both cases, the women did not initially want to go public or be identified by name as an accuser. Ford first reported her charges to The Washington Post tip line in July and to her congresswoman, Anna Eshoo, and to Feinstein. She signed the letter, but asked for confidentiality. She did not want to go public with the accusation and be the focus of public attention.Feinstein honored Ford s desire for confidentiality and did not inform other senators about the allegation. But last week The Intercept, an online magazine, printed some details of her allegation, without naming Ford, and the hunt was on to find her.At that point, Ford decided she was losing the privacy she had sought to protect and that it was time to go public, which she did in an interview in the Post. She has also said she is willing to cooperate with the Judiciary Committee.Both Hill and Blasey Ford are professors: Both Hill and Blasey Ford have advanced degrees and are well-respected by their colleagues. Hill was a professor at the University of Oklahoma law school (and is currently teaching at Brandeis).Blasey Ford is a psychologist and biostatistician affiliated with Stanford and Palo Alto universities. She earned her master s degree from Stanford and her Ph.D. from the University of Southern California.Both told the committee of their allegations in advance of the nominees  hearings: Like Ford, Hill first informed the Judiciary Committee of her charges well before the hearings on Thomas  nomination were to begin in 1991. But she didn t want her identity revealed, and then-Chairman Joe Biden didn t pursue the matter. Some of his Democratic colleagues, however, urged him to at least send the FBI to interview Hill and Thomas, which he did.The matter seemed to end there, but was quickly revived.On Oct. 1, 1991, the Judiciary Committee voted 7-7 on the nomination but reported it without recommendation to the Senate floor. And I, after a lot of tire-kicking, finally learned of Hill s identity. After checking out her reputation and background, I contacted her, but she didn t want to talk   unless I got a copy of the affidavit she had given the Judiciary Committee.By Oct. 4, I had the story, but I couldn t get Biden to call me back. I did something then that I would never do today in the era of instant communication: I waited, still trying to reach him, to no avail.Finally, on Oct. 6, with a detailed Hill interview in hand, corroboration from some of her friends, and at least one senator on the record, the story aired on NPR.Two days later, with fax machines virtually vaporizing on Capitol Hill, Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas decided to cancel the vote scheduled for that day. He no longer had the certain votes to win confirmation, and he and Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine agreed to a postponement and a second hearing to begin three days later.The hearings lasted for three days, often into the very late hours of the evening. They were brutal for both the accuser and the accused. But because they were scheduled so quickly, there was not enough time for the usual investigative work that might have been done.And at the end of the day, the country was divided along he-said, she-said lines.There were three corroborating witnesses the Democrats had, who would have testified about conduct similar to what Hill alleged. But Biden did not call them to testify, a step he has now said publicly that he regrets.Categorical denials of the allegations: Both Thomas then, and Kavanaugh now, vehemently denied the allegations against them. Thomas called the second hearing on his nomination  a high-tech lynching. Kavanaugh has flatly and categorically denied Ford s allegations.  I have never done anything like what the accuser describes   to her or anyone else,  he said in a statement. But he said he is  willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the Committee deems appropriate,  to  refute  the allegation that he said  never happened. The Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have now asked the White House to have the FBI investigate Ford s charges. Last week, the FBI said it had simply referred the matter to the White House, as an update to Kavanaugh s background check.Democrats want more now. They want the FBI to question Ford, Judge and others at the party that night. They want an examination of Ford s psychiatric notes that the Washington Post has reported corroborate that she discussed the alleged attack in couples therapy with her husband in 2012. And they want time to pursue other leads, if they exist.Confusion about how to proceed: The Ford allegations, like the Hill allegations, have caused great angst among senators about how to proceed. The pressures are different today than they were 27 years ago when Thomas was ultimately confirmed by a two-vote margin.Republicans, who accused Hill of everything from  erotomania  to just being a liar, this time don t want to look insensitive and incurious, but they want their nominee confirmed quickly. And they see a very big difference between a drunken teenage party, where memories are dim if they exist at all, and sexual harassment charges on the job.As for Democrats, well, they wish things had been done a little differently this time, too, and that all this were not occurring at the eleventh hour."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/17/648663337/kavanaugh-vote-could-face-delay,"Updated at 6:26 p.m. ETSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accusing him of sexual assault more than three decades ago, Christine Blasey Ford, will both testify publicly before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 24. The committee was supposed to vote on the nomination this Thursday but faced pressure after Ford went public with her allegation over the weekend.  Ford and Kavanaugh both agreed to testify under oath before the committee.  Judge Kavanaugh looks forward to a hearing where he can clear his name of this false allegation. He stands ready to testify tomorrow if the Senate is ready to hear him,  White House spokesman Raj Shah said in a statement on Monday.  Her recollection of these events is crystal clear,  Ford s attorney, Lisa Banks, told Morning Edition.  She will agree to participate in any proceedings that she s asked to participate in. Kavanaugh was scheduled to speak by phone with Republican staff on the Senate Judiciary Committee late Monday. Democrats on the panel refused to take part, arguing that the FBI should investigate the allegations stemming from an incident Ford says happened at a party in the early 1980s when they were both students in high school. The assault accusation, made privately in July, took on new weight over the weekend when Ford went on the record with The Washington Post.She described a high school party in the early 1980s at which a drunken Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, attempted to pull off her clothes, and covered her mouth as she tried to scream. She said she escaped after Kavanaugh s friend, Mark Judge, jumped on them.Kavanaugh, who was at the White House on Monday, continues to vehemently deny Ford s account.  This is a completely false allegation,  he said in a statement issued through the White House on Monday morning.  I have never done anything like what the accuser describes   to her or to anyone. Kavanaugh had issued a similar statement on Friday, before the identity of his accuser was made public. I am willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the Committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity,  Kavanaugh said.President Trump defended his nominee, noting that Kavanaugh had been vetted by the FBI on half a dozen occasions. Judge Kavanaugh is one of the finest people that I ve ever known  Trump told reporters at the White House Monday.  Never had even a little blemish on his record. Trump expressed regret that the allegation against Kavanaugh had surfaced so late in the process but said he wants the Senate to satisfy any lingering questions. If it takes a little delay, it will take a little delay. It shouldn t certainly be very much,  Trump said.  I d like everybody to be very happy. Most importantly I want the American people to be happy, because they re getting somebody that is great. While the president stood behind his nominee, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway also took pains to display concern for Kavanaugh s accuser. This woman should not be insulted and she should not be ignored,  Conway told Fox News.  This woman will be heard. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Monday that Ford   deserves to be heard,  but he complained that Democrats failed to share information about the allegations when Ford sent a letter to the committee s top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, in July.  It s unclear whether phone interviews would be sufficient to address questions from some of Grassley s GOP colleagues. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, tweeted Monday that Kavanaugh and Ford  should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee.  As one of only a handful of GOP women in the Senate and a key undecided vote on Kavanaugh s nomination, Collins  views may carry outsize weight with Grassley.Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who sits on the Judiciary Committee, joined Democrats in saying the vote on Kavanaugh s nomination may have to be postponed. I ve made it clear that I m not comfortable moving ahead with the vote on Thursday if we have not heard her side of the story or explored this further,  Flake told The Washington Post.  For me, we can t vote until we hear more. Earlier on Monday Feinstein pressed for a hearing before any committee action on the nomination. I agree with Sen. Flake that we should delay this week s vote,  Feinstein said.  There s a lot of information we don t know and the FBI should have the time it needs to investigate this new material. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he was open to hearing from Ford, while resisting calls to delay the vote. If Ms. Ford wishes to provide information to the committee, I would gladly listen to what she has to say and compare that against all other information we have received about Judge Kavanaugh,  Graham said in a statement.  If the committee is to hear from Ms. Ford, it should be done immediately so the process can continue as scheduled. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who is not on the committee but is a key undecided vote on Kavanaugh s nomination, told CNN a delay may be necessary. If there is real substance to this, it demands a response,  Murkowski said.Republicans, who hold a narrow majority on the committee and in the Senate, are eager to confirm Kavanaugh in time for him to join the high court when it begins its fall term in two weeks. But faced with a growing #MeToo movement, they are also sensitive about appearances. To railroad a vote now would be an insult to the women of America and the integrity of the Supreme Court,  said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other GOP leaders complained that the allegation was made public just days before the committee was set to vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation. Unfortunately, committee Republicans have only known this person s identity from news reports for less than 24 hours and known about her allegations for less than a week,  Grassley said.  Sen. Feinstein, on the other hand, has had this information for many weeks and deprived her colleagues of the information necessary to do their jobs. Ford initially contacted both Feinstein and The Washington Post in July, but at the time, she was not willing to make her allegation publicly. Victims of sexual assault have the right to decide whether and when to come forward,  Banks said about her client.  It was something that she struggled with mightily. She was weighing her desire and her belief that she had a civic duty to provide this information to those making the decision about Brett Kavanaugh with, frankly, her fear about coming forward, and there was going to be great personal risk to her and her family in doing so. Ford decided to go public after reporters began contacting her last week. Her attorney said Ford is  not motivated at all by politics. "

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/16/648535858/democrats-calls-to-delay-kavanaugh-vote-after-his-accuser-goes-public,"Updated at 9:41 p.m. ETA vote on Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court was at risk of delay on Sunday as members of the Senate Judiciary Committee from both parties said allegations of sexual assault from 35 years ago may require additional review.  A vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee was scheduled for this week, but Democrats on the committee called for the delay shortly after The Washington Post published a story naming the woman who says that Kavanaugh tried to sexually assault her when they were both teenagers. Democrats were joined by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who said the committee needed to examine the claims before moving forward. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), while expressing concern about the motives of committee Democrats, said he too was open to hearing more.The woman, Christine Blasey Ford, spoke to the Post on the record and confirmed details that had previously been reported in other outlets, including The New Yorker.Ford said that one night in the 1980s, when she was in high school, a drunken Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, attempted to pull off her clothing and covered her mouth as she tried to scream. She was able to flee after Kavanaugh s friend, Mark Judge, jumped on them. I thought he might inadvertently kill me,  Ford told the Post.  He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing. At first, she vowed to never speak of the incident, she said. But the trauma eventually drove her to seek therapy. She brought the incident up at a couples therapy session in 2012, she said. I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time,  said Kavanaugh in a statement issued by the White House last week when the allegations began to surface.But his words have not stemmed a wave of Democrats who are calling for his nomination to be delayed.Calls for delay I support Mrs. Ford s decision to share her story, and now that she has, it is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation,  the committee s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in a statement.  This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nominee. On Friday, after the contents of the letter were first reported, an FBI official said the agency had not opened a criminal investigation.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called on Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to postpone the vote  until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated.  He added,  To railroad a vote now would be an insult to the women of America and the integrity of the Supreme Court. A spokesman for Grassley said the allegations should have been brought up earlier. Their timing and nature  raises a lot of questions about Democrats  tactics and motives to bring this to the rest of the committee s attention only now rather than during these many steps along the way. One of Grassley s Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee left the door open to further hearings about Ford s allegations. If Ms. Ford wishes to provide information to the committee, I would gladly listen to what she has to say and compare that against all other information we have received about Judge Kavanaugh,  said Sen. Graham in a statement.  If the committee is to hear from Ms. Ford it should be done immediately so the process can continue as scheduled. Sen. Flake, who also serves on the committee, told the Post that a vote on Kavanaugh needed to wait until senators had the opportunity to hear from Ford.  For me, we can t vote until we hear more,  Flake said.NPR has reached out to Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska   both key votes on Kavanaugh s nomination in the narrowly divided Senate   but neither responded with any comment on the allegations by Ford. Collins spoke with Kavanaugh for an hour by phone on Friday after the then-anonymous allegation surfaced, but her office declined to provide any details on their conversation.A Grassley spokesman said leaders on the Judiciary Committee  routinely  hold bipartisan staff calls with nominees when updates are made to their background files.  Given the late addendum to the background file and revelations of Dr. Ford s identity, Chairman Grassley is actively working to set up such follow-up calls with Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford ahead of Thursday s scheduled vote,  the spokesman said.Feinstein said a call by committee staff would be unacceptable. I agree with Senator Flake that we should delay this week s vote. There s a lot of information we don t know and the FBI should have the time it needs to investigate this new material. Staff calls aren t the appropriate way to handle this. Polygraph, therapist notesDuring the judge s hearing, Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) asked Kavanaugh if he had ever made unwanted sexual advances, or been verbally or physically since becoming a legal adult. Kavanaugh replied  no  to her questions. The allegations made against Kavanaugh would have taken place while he was still a minor. It took a lot of courage for Christine Blasey Ford to come forward to share her story of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh,  Hirono said in a statement on Sunday.  This development is yet another reason not to rush Brett Kavanaugh s nomination. Before Ford broke her silence, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Sunday on Fox that Kavanaugh s nomination process was an  intergalactic freak show  and that  I don t know what our Democratic friends expect us to do  about the sexual assault allegation because of its secrecy. He predicted that every Republican would vote for Kavanaugh.The Post reported that Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist and professor, contacted the paper in early July   after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his intention to retire and Kavanaugh was shortlisted as his potential replacement.On the advice of civil rights lawyer Debra Katz, who specializes in sexual harassment cases, she even took a polygraph test, which reportedly demonstrated that her allegations were accurate. There are also therapist s notes that describe the incident.She said,  Now I feel like my civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation. "

Feinstein has referred to the FBI."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/14/647864457/kavanaugh-denies-allegation-of-sexual-misconduct-during-high-school,"UPDATED 6:46 p.m. ETSupreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh strongly pushed back on an allegation of sexual misconduct from more than 30 years ago. The allegation was made in a letter by a woman who said the incident took place in high school. I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time,  Kavanaugh said in a statement.On Thursday California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary committee, released a vaguely worded statement indicating she referred information regarding Kavanaugh s nomination to federal authorities.A report published Friday in the New Yorker revealed that the woman, who did not want to be named, said in a letter that Kavanaugh  attempted to force himself on her  at a party when they were teenagers. She described that Kavanaugh and another classmate, who were drinking, turned up music to cover up her protests and she freed herself and left the scene. All three were minors at the time. The woman declined to be interviewed by the New Yorker.NPR has not independently confirmed the contents of the letter, which the woman sent to her representative, Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., after Kavanaugh was nominated to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. The letter was also shared with Feinstein in July.A separate report in the New York Times said people who described the letter told the publication that the woman  considered the incident an assault. The New Yorker story quotes a classmate of Kavanaugh s saying about the incident in the letter:  I have no recollection of that. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, released a letter on Friday signed by 65 women who said they knew Kavanaugh in high school and defended his character. The letter noted that the signatories included women from  a broad range of political views.  Through the more than 35 years we have known him, Brett has stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity. In particular, he has always treated women with decency and respect. That was true when he was in high school, and it has remained true to this day,  the letter states.Feinstein called a meeting on Wednesday at which she disclosed the contents of the letter to committee Democrats, but did not show the letter itself, according to a source familiar with the discussions.Questions swirled on Thursday when Feinstein declined to explain what information she was provided about Kavanaugh that she decided to share with authorities. Sources told NPR that the California senator felt pressure to put something out publicly after a report indicated she had not briefed fellow members of the panel on a document. Democrats were concerned that if they failed to pass along any information about the allegation, they would be accused of a cover-up.Shortly after Feinstein s statement was released, White House spokesperson Kerri Kupec criticized the timing. Throughout his confirmation process, Judge Kavanaugh has had 65 meetings with senators including with Senator Feinstein sat through over 30 hours of testimony, addressed over 2,000 questions in a public setting and additional questions in a confidential session. Not until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new  information  about him,  Kupec said.On Friday Feinstein s spokesman issued a statement that didn t detail the contents of the letter, but acknowledged it was about a claim of sexual misconduct. Senator Feinstein was given information about Judge Kavanaugh through a third party. The Senator took these allegations seriously and believed they should be public. However, the woman in question made it clear she did not want this information to be public. It is critical in matters of sexual misconduct to protect the identity of the victim when they wish to remain anonymous, and the senator did so in this case,  the spokesman said.Before details of the allegation surfaced on Friday, Senate Republicans pointed out that an extensive background check was already completed by the White House and reviewed by the committee.A spokesperson for the FBI said when the letter was received from Feinstein it was incorporated into that file. Upon receipt of the information on the night of September 12, we included it as part of Judge Kavanaugh s background file, as per the standard process. Grassley s office says it will proceed with the planned Judiciary committee vote on Kavanaugh s nomination next week. A spokesman for the chairman said Kavanaugh has completed six FBI background checks between 1993 and 2018, and that Feinstein, who obtained the letter in July, did not raise the issue during the hearings or attend a closed session on the nomination where the information could have been discussed. The aide also said Grassley only learned about the allegation from news sources this week and that the FBI sent the Senate the updated report on Thursday.Senator Susan Collins, R-Maine, a moderate who is undecided on Kavanaugh s nomination and a key vote in the narrowly divided Senate, held an hour-long phone call with the nominee on Friday. The call was already scheduled before the allegation emerged and Collins  office declined to provide any details about their discussion.  A full vote by the Senate is expected by the end of the month.NPR s Ryan Lucas contributed to this report"
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/13/647511365/democrats-refer-kavanaugh-allegations-to-fbi-deepening-divide-over-his-nominatio,"Updated at 6:20 p.m. ETThe White House is accusing Senate Democrats of an unfounded  11th hour attempt to delay  a vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a statement Thursday afternoon disclosing that she had referred  a matter  involving Kavanaugh to  federal investigative authorities. Democratic sources said the  matter  involved allegations against Kavanaugh  made by a California woman about conduct that allegedly occurred in high school.Feinstein said the individual  strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision.  Feinstein had initially planned to keep the matter private, Democratic sources said, and did not disclose the allegations to other Democratic senators, but when word of the allegations began to leak out, she decided to turn the matter over to the FBI.Sources added that Democrats feared that doing nothing would open them up to accusations of a cover-up.White House spokesperson Kerri Kupec dismissed the episode as an obstructionist tactic. Throughout  his confirmation process, Judge Kavanaugh has had 65 meetings with senators   including with Sen. Feinstein,  Kupec said, adding that Kavanaugh sat through 30 hours of testimony. But, she said,  Not until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new  information  about him. Kupec pointed out that throughout his 25 years of public service, Kavanaugh has been vetted by the FBI  repeatedly.Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, drove home that point with these tweets:The Feinstein kerfuffle capped off a day of bitter partisan exchanges at a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, with Democrats repeatedly seeking access to further documents from Kavanaugh s six years in the Bush White House, only to be shot down on repeated party-line votes. I don t understand the rush to judgment,  said Feinstein, observing that when President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court,  99 percent  of the documents  from her White House years  were turned over to the Judiciary Committee, compared with 7 percent of the Kavanaugh documents. Feinstein charged that Republicans who head up the committee had repeatedly refused her offer to work on a bipartisan basis to help the National Archives so that more documents could be made available. After a Feinstein motion to subpoena more documents failed on a party-line vote, there were five more party-line votes on various document questions. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, for instance, noted that the White House has invoked an unspecified constitutional privilege on 100,000 documents from Kavanaugh s two-plus years as associate White House counsel. Klobuchar proposed that at the very least the White House should supply the traditional  privilege log,  listing what privilege is being invoked for each document, and why.Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa said there was precedent for invoking executive privilege, that President Ronald Reagan invoked it on the nomination of William Rehnquist to be chief justice. But Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, a Democrat and past chairman of the committee, rebutted that argument, noting that he, along with a bipartisan group of senators, met with Reagan to object to the executive privilege claim and that Reagan then withdrew it. Nonetheless, even the motion to subpoena a privilege log was voted down, along party lines. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., accused the Republicans of compromising the Senate s constitutional duties for short-term political gain. Without access to this information, he said, the committee was setting a  damning precedent,    leaving itself  neutered  and unable to perform its confirmation duties in a responsible way.Republicans viewed such complaints as nothing more than an attempt to delay. Following committee rules, Grassley held over the committee vote on the Kavanaugh nomination for one week.But he then announced the vote would take place Sept. 20 at 1:45 p.m. ET. That prompted an uproar from Democrats, who read out loud the committee rule requiring that committee debate on a nomination cannot be cut off without a majority vote that includes at least one member of the minority party. Grassley overrode the objection, saying that his GOP colleague Orrin Hatch of Utah, another longtime committee member and former chairman, had once done something similar   and that was  precedent. There was little mentioned in the public session Thursday about Kavanaugh s written answers to more than 1,000 questions posed by committee members, mainly the Democrats. Most of Kavanaugh s answers simply reiterated his answers from last week s hearing, answers that Democrats had already complained were unresponsive. But there were some nuggets in the written answers. Responding to Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Kavanaugh said he had contacted Judge Alex Kozinski last year after Kozinski resigned from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Kavanaugh said he contacted Kozinski because he was  concerned about his mental health.  In response to a question from Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., Kavanaugh said he did  not remember  receiving inappropriate emails of a sexual nature from Kozinski when he clerked for him. And in response to another question from Hirono, Kavanaugh said he  did not communicate with Judge Kozinski very often  after his clerkship, though he worked with him and 10 other judges on a book about precedent and also helped screen law clerks for the man both clerked for, Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kavanaugh s answer to questions from Whitehouse also seemed to resolve what has been something of a mystery: Kavanaugh s credit card debt. In 2016 he listed debt accrued over two credit cards and a loan, listing the debt as being between $15,000 and $80,000; and in 2017 he listed further credit card debt of between $60,000 and $200,000. This year, however, all the debts disappeared. At the time of his nomination, the White House attributed much of that debt to baseball season tickets that Kavanaugh purchased for himself and  a handful of friends,  but there was no explanation for the persisting debt over two years, nor did the numbers add up. In his written answers this week, Kavanaugh seemed to attribute much of his debt to his home, which, by his account, was falling apart and required replacing the heating and air conditioning, painting the house exterior and interior, roof repairs, new kitchen appliances, basement flooding problems and waterproofing, and so on. No dates are given for any of these  unanticipated repairs.  Maintaining an old house like ours, can be expensive,  he wrote. And in response to a question about whether he ever had gambling debts, he said no, adding that he had not participated in  fantasy  leagues. His debts, he said, were not near the top end of the range reported on his judicial financial disclosure form. Moreover, he said,  We have not received financial gifts other than from our family,  and disclosure of those gifts, Kavanaugh observed, is excluded from the financial disclosure form. The clear implication here is that Kavanaugh s father, a retired lobbyist, very likely helped out. As to the baseball tickets, Kavanaugh said that he bought four season tickets in his name every season from 2005 to 2017, plus playoff packages for the four years that the Washington Nationals made the playoffs. He said he divided the cost of the tickets among the friends who participated in the  ticket draft at my house.  No one overpaid or underpaid me for tickets, he said.  No loans were given in either direction.  And his friends reimbursed him  to the dollar. He said that he and his wife paid the full entry fee to the Chevy Chase Country Club, reported as $92,000, and that they pay regular dues, reported to be $9,000, without any discount.  We joined primarily because of the ice hockey program that my younger daughter participates in, as well as the gym,  Kavanaugh wrote. "

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/11/656486091/a-womans-rage-songs-about-being-fed-up,"Some anniversaries are hard to celebrate. How should we greet the arrival of October, a year after the stories broke initiating the reckoning that soon became known as #MeToo? Since The New York Times and The New Yorker published their exposÈs   on Oct. 5 and Oct. 10 of last year, respectively   of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein s long career as an alleged serial rapist, a new nationwide discussion has formed about sexual assault, abuse and harassment. Often, this ongoing reckoning feels like not a dialogue, but a war. It has upended lives   most of all, the lives of the women who ve come forward with their stories for the first time. It s brought to light the horrific misogyny that some men hold within their hearts, as they have smeared their hateful words all over the Internet. At the same time, it s torn friends and families apart as part of the frightening process of dismantling fundamental ideas about what it even means to be a  man  or a  woman,  about what constitutes intimacy and violation and about who deserves protection when the ground of our assumptions is slipping out from under us. The process often feels exhausting, liberating, urgent, impossible   and impossible to ignore.In what felt like an almost unbearably cruel case of cosmic timing, the spirit of #MeToo surged again as its one-year mark coincided with the Senate Judiciary Committee s hearings around Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court. Millions heard the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh described an attempt to sexually assault her when they were in high school, and we witnessed this singular women become a symbol right before our eyes ñ a hero and a pariah, a flag in a battle waged over mothers  fears, watered by a man s tears and obscured by the smoke of each witness s own beliefs and illusions. It has been deeply disheartening to confront, yet again, the ways in which the same culture that engendered some of our most familiar and treasured ideals   of teen romance, or masculine authority, or feminine openness   serves the power of some at the expense of others. And it has been necessary, but so painful, to hear more and more women s voices amplified, speaking about what they have endured so that those ideals can be maintained.Anyone who calls herself a feminist knows, however, that this is just life ñ- the experience of going on, of even finding ways to be strong and kind and free, when the world is burning around you. (And, in your mind, might even deserve to burn.) It s something women have been talking about in songs since the dawn of popular music.This weekend, I needed some edification within what was starting to feel like an unbearable struggle. So I did what I always do: I turned to music. I made a playlist. I called it  fed up,  and started seeking out songs of women saying they d had enough, that from this moment on things would be different. And if they couldn t be different, then just listen to this.I began at one of popular music s beginnings: the women s blues of the 1920s, in which, as Angela Y .Davis writes in her great study of the genre,  the problem of male violence is named, and varied patterns of implied or explicit criticism and resistance are woven into the artists  performance of them.  Ma Rainey s  Cell Bound Blues  starkly outlines one such encounters, which lands the woman, whose resistance involves a gun, in jail. Country music s beginnings also highlight women s resistance: in  Single Girl, Married Girl,  a folk song notably recorded without the presence of the family patriarch A.P. Carter, his bride Sara sings of the limits imposed by the ring on her finger. And then there s vaudeville great Sophie Tucker, totally owning the lyrics written for her by Billy Rose in  I m Not Taking Orders for No One.  Moving toward the mid-20th century, I discovered the beautifully cynical  This Will Make You Laugh,  written by Irene Higginbotham   one of Tin Pan Alley s few African-American songwriters   and revisited Billie Holiday s stark declaration of independence,  God Bless the Child. My search for women s angry or stone cold self-assertion yielded even greater results as I moved forward in time. Some songs I found were hits, like  No More Tears (Enough is Enough),  the firestorm of duet between Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer; others, like X-Ray Spex singer Poly Styrene s scream of self-definition,  Oh Bondage! Up Yours!  Then there are the forgotten gems, sometimes taking on not just individual men or even the strictures of romance, but the larger culture that continually puts women at risk. Dory Previn s amazing  Obscene Phone Call  and  Conversation With a Cop,  by the all-woman band Fanny, exposed how the authorities can alternately ignore and harass women. Martina McBride s  Independence Day  and Rosanne Cash s  Rosie Strike Back  opened country fans  eyes to domestic violence. By the time we get to the 21st century, Alynda Segarra of Hurray for the Riff Raff is calling out the American songbook itself, rewriting the soul-damaging script of the murder ballad in  The Body Electric. Some of the songs on this playlist use the language of failing romance to express the bigger need for personal agency and freedom. Others confront harassment or other ways women have been treated as less than human. Some are funny; others tap into anger so hot it s hard to listen to them. Many were written or recorded by young women finding their power in the moment. Others come from weathered voices, sharing wisdom. At four hours, I stopped compiling, but I could have kept going indefinitely, I think. What would you add? We need this soundtrack: a way of saying  no way  that s really inspiration to keep going on."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/10/656396084/republicans-seize-on-angry-mob-mantra-to-keep-their-midterm-base-fired-up,"President Trump warned at his rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday night that if his party loses in November s midterm elections, the  radical Democrat mob  will take away everything he has achieved since his election, while encouraging crime and socialism.It was an echo of something he s been saying a lot lately, including at rallies in Iowa and Kansas in recent days and on Twitter   a line that Republicans have been quick to seize upon as they try to sustain a newly-enthused GOP base in the wake of the divisive confirmation battle for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  You don t hand matches to an arsonist, and you don t give power to an angry left-wing mob. Democrats have become too EXTREME and TOO DANGEROUS to govern,  Trump tweeted Saturday.  Republicans believe in the rule of law - not the rule of the mob. VOTE REPUBLICAN! Republicans argue top Democrats have only been fueling that characterization, signaling lately that they won t abide by the mantra that former first lady Michelle Obama famously used in the 2016 campaign    when they go low, we go high.   When they go low, we kick them. That s what this new Democratic Party is about,  former Attorney General Eric Holder said over the weekend while campaigning in Georgia.  We re proud as hell to be Democrats. We re going to fight for the ideals of the Democratic Party.  Holder, who s mulling a 2020 presidential bid, later clarified that he wasn t advocating for outright violence.  When I say we, you know,  we kick  em,  I don t mean we do anything inappropriate. We don t do anything illegal,  said Holder.  But we got to be tough, and we have to fight for the very things that [civil rights leaders] John Lewis, Martin Luther King, Whitney Young ñ you know, all those folks gave to us. And 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also had harsh words for the GOP in an interview with CNN on Tuesday, saying,  You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.   That s why I believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and or the Senate, that s when civility can start again. But until then, the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength,  Clinton said. She bemoaned the treatment of the woman who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, Christine Blasey Ford, whom Trump openly mocked at a rally last week. Republicans have used Clinton and Holder s remarks as further justification for their  mob  characterization and the suggestion of violence or any confrontation in very personal ways, describing threats they received after they voted for Kavanaugh.Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee tasked with protecting the GOP s Senate majority this cycle, tweeted Wednesday,  Just before I voted to confirm Justice Kavanaugh, my wife received a text message of a graphic beheading. We now have public officials saying you should be uncivil to each other - a call for incivility....We have our political disagreements and we should cherish the rights to express our disagreements. But when it comes to calls for violence and attempted murder and assassinations this country has gone too far and it s time we step back from that brink. Kelley Paul, the wife of Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, released a letter via CNN to New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker about how fearful she was after her family s home address and information was posted during the Kavanaugh debate.  Earlier this week, Rand was besieged in the airport by activists  getting up in his face,  as you, Senator Booker, encouraged them to do a few months ago. Preventing someone from moving forward, thrusting your middle finger in their face, screaming vitriol   is this the way to express concern or enact change? Or does it only incite unstable people to violence, making them feel that assaulting a person is somehow politically justifiable?  Kelley Paul asked. Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster and messaging guru, said that the  angry mob  description was apt and that he had told GOP candidates to use it when talking about protesters and those who opposed Kavanaugh in the wake of sexual assault accusations and testimony from Ford.  It is essential that [senators] are authentic and that they are accurate in their communication. When you see the video, that is exactly what it is,  Luntz said.  I have advised them not to overstate, but when you have videos of people chasing after senators and screaming at them, it really is an angry mob. It is accurate and it accurately describes what happens. Luntz said it wasn t necessarily a  turn-out mechanism,  but was simply  a description of what happened. GOP strategist Ken Spain, who was communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2010 when his party won back the House, said he thinks use of that term will escalate even more over the next month as Republicans try to sustain the enthusiasm bump they got in the wake of the Kavanaugh fight.  The Kavanaugh debate clearly fueled Republican intensity over the course of the last few weeks. The question is whether that can be sustained in the final month of the election. Four weeks is an eternity in campaign politics, so Republicans are likely looking for a way to maintain the existing intensity level,  Spain said.Meanwhile, some endangered Democrats are eschewing the pushback that Holder and Clinton are calling for. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp said on CNN that Clinton s comments were  ridiculous. ... I mean I can t imagine how you get anything done if you don t bring civility back into politics, and that goes for both sides. However, Lawrence Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said what Republicans are pointing to, such as the protesters in the Capitol during and after Kavanaugh s confirmation, weren t really unruly mobs.  There were protesters in the Capitol who were making their voices heard, which is protected by the U.S. Constitution and something Republicans do all the time. That s hardly something I would describe as a mob. I would describe that as noisy democracy,  Jacobs said. And, Jacobs added, such strong language to appeal to your base is nothing new in American history.  The specific language about mobs and lawlessness and chaos is something we heard from Republicans in the 1960s and 1970s. Some of it was in response to riots in cities. Republicans put a spotlight on it and used it as a way to say that Democrats were soft on crime, that they were encouraging chaos. It was very effective in the hands of Richard Nixon,  he recalled.  It speaks to this idea of insecurity, of anxiety, that we are at the point of this shift in our country. For Donald Trump s core base, this is something he has skillfully mined for support. Could that rhetoric work? In parts of the country   particularly deep red states that Democrats are defending in the battle for the Senate   it could. But, as Republicans struggle to hold onto the House   which is in danger of flipping in large part because of energized female voters in suburban districts that have turned on Trump   it could have an adverse effect.  It will work in some parts of the country. I think of these red states where Democrats had shown some promise like Tennessee and Texas. ... I think it is going to bring out Republicans,  Jacobs said.  On the other hand, there are parts of the country where you have competitive districts, you re going to see a high turnout among Democrats. I think what the president has done is energize women. I think it s going to be a mixed bag.  NPR s Domenico Montanaro contributed to this story. "
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/10/655899756/the-reckonings-examines-what-it-means-to-have-justice,"When writer and poet Lacy M. Johnson was in her 20s, a man who she had recently broken up with kidnapped and raped her.She wrote about her escape and recovery in the 2014 memoir The Other Side. As she began speaking about the book in public, a pattern emerged: Readers she encountered suggested that Johnson must want her rapist killed, or imprisoned, or tortured. You probably want him dead, strangers tell me,  Johnson writes in the essay that opens her tour de force follow-up, The Reckonings.No, Johnson says. She wants a reckoning.What does that mean? In the first essay, Johnson describes what she wants:  I want him to admit all the things he did, to my face, in public, and then to spend the rest of his life in service to other people s joy.  Her reckoning, then, is a transfer of happiness. In the collection s last pages, Johnson returns to this idea:  I like the idea that justice is anything that makes way for joy, that makes the condition of joy a possibility again. This sounds utopian, and it might be, but The Reckonings is not a book about changing the world. It s philosophy in disguise, equal parts memoir, criticism, and ethics. It has bits of Eula Biss, Leslie Jamison, and Simone Weil, but its patron saint is Grace Paley, whose essays are much too infrequently read. Like Johnson, Paley was committed to bearing witness and, like Johnson, she believed, stubbornly and eternally, in joy.In the essay  Six Days,  Paley wrote that all prisons should be in cities. Otherwise,  the population that considers itself innocent forgets, denies, chooses to never know [about that] whole huge country of the bad and the unlucky and the self-hurters.  In The Reckonings, Johnson tries in every essay to show  the population that considers itself innocent  that innocence doesn t exist. Writing about topics as diverse as race, sexual assault, Hurricane Harvey, and art history, Johnson demonstrates repeatedly that any adult who considers herself innocent has failed to reckon fully with the world around her.This idea is strongest and most personal in  Against Whiteness,  an essay about American constructions of race, which is to say an essay about white supremacy. Johnson opens by describing a long-ago class in which a guest lecturer, a tenured white poet, embarked on a racist diatribe at her professor, a female poet of color who Johnson admired. I said nothing,  Johnson writes,  because I had never known what to say when watching a man explode under the pressure of his own narcissism, not even when he is attacking the people I love.  Later, she understood that not knowing what to say was no excuse. She might not have succeeded in stopping the tenured poet, but she could have tried. Her silence was  a failure to reckon with the fact that my struggle was not the only one that mattered. There s another essay in The Reckonings about silence.  Speak Truth to Power,  it s called. It s about the epidemic of sexual assault against women, which Johnson calls  the problem that has no language.  She traces her own path to speaking publicly about her rape, and writes with empathy, anger, and respect about the many women who report rape and are never believed. Speak Truth to Power  is an act of homage to those women. It s also a call to arms, or to speech.  I understand the fear of breaking a long-held silence,  Johnson concludes.  It is a fear that holds tremendous power. But if there is any hope for justice, we must speak truth to that power.  We must give the problem of violence against women its language.I re-read  Speak Truth to Power  the week Dr. Christine Blasey Ford stepped forward to accuse Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Since then, I have thought about the essay every day. I have thought particularly about Johnson s response to the Muriel Rukeyser line,  What if one woman told the truth about her life? /The world would split open.  No, Johnson writes.  Many women have told the truth about their lives, however impossible that may seem at the time, and the world has gone on pretty much as before. I wonder often whether the Me Too movement is a reckoning, or whether it will become one. The country seems not to contain much  service to other people s joy.  But the utopianism of that idea has a practical counterpart. Service to other people s joy is unending. It can never be finished. A reckoning can t be done. It can only begin, over and over and over.The 12 essays in The Reckonings are 12 beginnings. Each one deserves great consideration, while you read it and long after. Each one leaves the work up to you.Lily Meyer is a writer and translator living in Washington, D.C."

Everyone s pumped   from white men over 60 to white men over 70. Kate McKinnon was back as Sen.

Listen, I think it s important to believe women, until it s time to stop,  she adds.Later in the scene, McKinnon s Graham alluded to the protesters that have gathered in Washington, D.C. in the past few days to oppose Kavanaugh s nomination.

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/06/654993350/after-one-year-of-headlines-metoo-is-everywhere,"This week marks the one-year anniversary of the reporting, in The New York Times and The New Yorker, that led to the fall of movie producer Harvey Weinstein.From that point on, the hashtag #MeToo was catapulted into a national movement. The #MeToo conversation now seems to be everywhere.Oprah Winfrey at the Golden Globe Awards:  Take us to the time when nobody ever has to say  me too  again. Janelle Monae at the Grammy Awards:  We come in peace, but we mean business. At Dunbar High School in Washington, D.C., psychology teacher Sarah Soileau wants her class to consider some of the questions raised by the #MeToo movement   questions like verbal consent. What did we learn?  says student Marcus Bright, 17.  Each base. Each base. First base. Second base. Third base. Each base, I m asking.  That is a good rule to live by,  Soileau says.  Each base you better ask, all right? Sarah Soileau says #MeToo has been an opportunity to talk about serious and relevant issues like consent and sexual harassment. It s important to teach our students when they re younger so they don t grow up in a culture where they think it s OK,  she says.  I m just trying to give these girls and boys the voice to say,  This is not OK, and I m not going to tolerate it.   More money, more problems reportedWomen in general aren t tolerating it either, and the results are measurable. This year, sexual harassment reports to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have gone up 12 percent, after years of remaining steady. The EEOC is the government agency that handles workplace discrimination cases including sexual harassment.The vast majority of those claims do not go to litigation. But the number that did doubled this year.EEOC Acting Chair Victoria Lipnic says the interest generated by #MeToo   from both individuals and employers   has been enormous. We ve had a fivefold increase of hits to our website of people looking for information about sexual harassment,  Lipnic says.  We ve done hundreds of training sessions for employers. Here s something else that has changed as a result of #MeToo: There s real money available for women to get help. I have been a civil rights lawyer and a women s rights lawyer for the last 20 years,  says Sharyn Tejani, director of the Time s Up Legal Defense Fund.  And if you had told me at any point in those 20 years that there would be money available to help people come forward, to help people with their cases, I would have told you,  That s just never going to happen.   The Time s Up Legal Defense Fund covers legal fees for alleged victims of sexual harassment. With big donors like Shonda Rhimes and Meryl Streep, the fund reached $21 million in just two months. Time s Up also started giving away grants to nonprofits working in poor communities.At the same time, there s only so much lawyers can do. Of the thousands of sexual harassment reports that come in, only a fraction get funded for legal help. Some people are coming to us, you know, two years after this has happened to them, five years after this has happened to them, 10 years after this has happened to them, because they never felt comfortable coming forward before,  Tejani says.  And the way the law is, you have to report or bring a case within a certain amount of time. So some of those women are out of time. Some of those women who are coming forward are independent contractors, and unless you live in certain states, you re not covered by discrimination law. Some of those women work for very small employers   in some states, those are not covered. And so it s a matter of people coming forward, and we can we connect them to lawyers and the lawyers help them when they can. But sometimes there isn t something that can be done. The surgesJo Freeman has written books on women s liberation and other social movements. To put #MeToo in context, she points to the fight against racism. A hundred years ago, the culture condoned white supremacy,  Freeman says.  We ve been fighting that one for a hundred years, and I think we ve made a lot of progress, but it ain t done yet.  You gotta plow the ground and plant the seeds before you can reap the harvest,  she adds.Freeman says social movements need both the high profile  surges  like speeches and marches. But they also need the behind-the-scenes work like the Time s Up Legal Defense Fund. That underneath-the-radar, behind-the-scenes organizing is extremely important,  Freeman says.  Well you know, what you see are the surge parts. What s catching our attention now is the vast turnout of people in the Kavanaugh thing. Freeman is referring to Christine Blasey Ford s allegations that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were in high school. Hundreds of people protested Kavanaugh s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court this week.One of the protesters, Laura Miranda-Browne, came down from New Jersey. She says her feelings have been all over the place these past few weeks:  appalled and demoralized,  yet  hopeful and motivated. Miranda-Browne believes that without the support of the #MeToo movement, Ford might not have come forward at all. I really think that without the cultural conversation that s taking place at this moment, she wouldn t have had the courage to come forward   and knowing she would have the support of millions of Americans,  Miranda-Browne says.The backlashBut #MeToo also terrifies people. Allegations alone can get men fired.Many critics find that the #MeToo movement has resulted in outsized punishments for small offenses like inappropriate flirting. This week President Trump said that  it s a very scary time for young men in America.  My whole life I ve heard you re innocent until proven guilty,  Trump said to reporters outside the White House.  But now you re guilty until proven innocent. That is a very, very difficult standard. The #MeToo backlash isn t just about the fear of false accusations. Heather Mac Donald, a Manhattan Institute Fellow and author of the book The Diversity Delusion: How Race and Gender Pandering Corrupt the University and Undermine Our Culture, says the movement assumes women in America have no voice. We live in a very tolerant society,  Mac Donald says.  This is not Afghanistan. This is not Iran with the Revolutionary Guard. For American females to complain that they re in a rape culture or a patriarchy, to me is   is extremely deluded and and ignorant about what those things really look like. Facing inwardWhatever your point of view, there s no denying the #MeToo movement has ignited a feisty cultural conversation. It has disrupted ideas about what women should put up with at work, and divided people along gender and generational lines.Jenny Lumet is a screenwriter and TV producer. In an open letter in The Hollywood Reporter, she alleged that hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons sexually attacked her. He has denied it.Lumet has thought a lot about what #MeToo means   how it forces people to face their own beliefs and behavior. What is the most uncomfortable for people is ... you have to turn your gaze upon yourself,  Lumet says.  Or you re forced to sometimes, in moments, and even if it s just for a second.  Lumet believes this year of the #MeToo movement will forever be a reference point."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/10/04/654151008/building-strength-and-resilience-after-a-sexual-assault-what-works,"The wrenching testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, who is accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of a sexual assault years ago, raises questions about the long-term emotional and physical toll this kind of trauma takes on survivors and how our society responds to those who come forward long after the assault.Emily R. Dworkin, a senior fellow at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, studies how the social interactions of trauma survivors can affect their recovery. She was also the lead author of a paper published in the journal Clinical Psychology Review in 2017 that looked through more than 100,000 studies conducted in the last 50 years and found nearly 200 relevant ones on the relationship between sexual assault and mental health to analyze.What she found, Dworkin says, is strong evidence that sexual assault is associated with an increased risk for multiple forms of psychological harm  across most populations, assault types and methodological differences in studies.  Too many survivors still face stigma and internalize that blame, and that can make it harder to seek help. And while some types of therapy have been shown to be helpful, she says, more information on evidence-based treatments for survivors  is critically needed. Dworkin talked with NPR about her research findings and offered her perspective on where society and science need to go next to prevent assaults and help survivors heal. Our interview was edited for length and clarity.You looked at a lot of studies about the mental health impact of sexual assault, but it s not an area as well-studied as say, heart disease. So what do we know?Sexual assault [any type of sexual activity or contact that happens without the consent of both people] began getting research attention in the  70s as society as a whole was going through a feminist awakening, and it kind of developed at the same time as PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder], which was then known as  combat trauma.  Many things can lead to depression or anxiety. People with PTSD relive the trauma in the form of intrusive memories, nightmares, or even flashbacks. They avoid things that remind them of the trauma.The symptoms that people were showing when they were coming home from war were the same as victims of rape trauma   recurring memories and a wish to avoid triggering them.These days, lots of people are doing research, but there s still a lot left to understand. What we do know is that sexual assault is associated with a higher risk for a lot of different mental health problems, including PTSD [and depression, anxiety, substance abuse and suicidality] ... especially PTSD.What do we know about how ethnicity and education affects the mental health of survivors of sexual assault? We need to know more. Some of my past research on queer women shows that ongoing forms of stress can compound stress. And we know that people from marginalized groups are just at greater risk for sexual assault [and a number of other health problems]. So it s likely that these groups experience more trauma   but I don t think we can completely say for sure.How does sexual assault compare with other forms of trauma, in terms of effects on mental health?We never want to have the Olympics of trauma. But compared to other types of life-threatening trauma, survivors of sexual assault do seem to be more likely to get PTSD. In my preliminary look at the data from 39 studies on this topic, it seems like 36 percent of survivors meet criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD in their lifetime, versus 12 percent of people who don t have a history of sexual assault.My thinking is that sexual assault is a unique form of trauma. It is highly stigmatized, and when people go to seek help for it, unlike in a car accident   well, the police are not going to ask you if you ve really been in a car accident.Also, people don t always do the most effective job of supporting sexual assault survivors. Sometimes they do things that can actually compound the trauma. In the  70s it was known as  the second rape  when you tell the police, undergo a rape kit exam and explain it to family and friends. They don t always know how to help.What can survivors who are feeling overwhelmed, depressed and traumatized do to recover, and how can friends and family help?It s important for survivors to know that they can regain a sense of power over those triggers, and that the most natural response is to push away the triggers. Self-care isn t about turning off those bad feelings, but feeling those feelings so that they can subside naturally.It s kind of a counterintuitive idea, and it s not what we usually think to do for our loved ones. When somebody s in pain, all you want to do is to take that pain away. It s understandable to try to distract them, take them out for a drink, but it s better to be a shoulder to cry on. You don t need to cheer somebody up in the moment. Be there for them as a witness to their pain.What about the professionals   the police, the lawyers, the therapists   that survivors need to talk to? How can they do a better job?This all comes back to ... dealing with the false beliefs we have around sexual assault   blaming the victim, challenging the victim s choices. Changing these cultural norms is important.One of the evidence-based treatments for PTSD is overcoming the trauma by sharing the story. That s a very different thing than being forced to tell it in public.I don t want to imply that it s the survivor s fault they have PTSD. And they feel like they don t want to relive it again, which is totally natural. But our bodies can t sustain that intense emotional response for long   those feelings come down naturally.In my clinical work, a woman came to me with her story of sexual assault. The first time she told it, she was crying. By the fourth time, she was almost yawning. Her story is not one that has power over her anymore. She has the control over whether she s going to have her life altered.Has the public s perception of sexual assault changed since the Kavanaugh hearings?I think about this stuff every day. I ve been thinking it about every day since I was 18 and beginning my research. It takes me awhile to catch up and realize that everyone else is thinking about it now.My hope is that we re changing some of the cultural conversation around this.It s important to know that most of the disorders are very treatable conditions. I do feel like if survivors can get connected to evidence-based treatments, they can be helped   even years later.What are the resources and treatments that work best for survivors who are experiencing PTSD or other mental health symptoms?First-line options should be things that we know work well. What I recommend is prolonged exposure therapy [helping people gradually approach trauma-related memories and feelings] or cognitive processing therapy [a specific type of cognitive behavioral therapy that helps patients learn how to challenge and modify unhelpful beliefs related to the trauma]. Both have been around since the  80s and were developed to treat survivors of rape. They have really strong evidence of reducing symptoms or eliminating the diagnosis [of a mental health disorder].For resources, look for a good therapist who offers cognitive processing therapy. Also, you can check out the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies [for more information about the treatment].As a society, what should we focus on to help survivors of assault?Ending some of our stigmatizing beliefs about sexual assault and our mistrust for people that come forward is huge. It s always up to survivors as to whether they disclose. The fact that we re having these conversations in the public sphere gives me hope.In schools, [to prevent unwanted sexual advances and sexual assault in the first place] we can teach respect for others and their autonomy. We re not comfortable with the idea of hearing about these sorts of assaults. Our cultural norm is to avoid uncomfortable experiences. ... But we need to keep talking."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/10/04/654107109/you-dont-have-to-pass-out-to-be-blackout-drunk,"Sign up for the CommonHealth newsletter to receive a weekly digest of WBUR s best health, medicine and science coverage. Unless you ve been blissfully unplugged, you must have come across the term  blackout  lately. And you may have thought it means inebriated to the point of unconsciousness. Falling-down drunk. Blotto.Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh appears to think so, based on this exchange last Thursday during his fiery self-defense before the Senate Judiciary Committee:But that notion of an alcohol-induced blackout is wrong.A less confusing term might be  alcohol-induced amnesia.  It can be total. Hours of experience and events can be totally missing from memory. Or it can be spotty. Either way, it can be hard to impossible for a bystander, or even the inebriated person, to know when it has happened.Misunderstanding blackouts has big implications. The phenomenon could reconcile the disconnect between what psychologist Christine Blasey Ford says she remembers so indelibly about an alleged sexual assault by Kavanaugh one summer evening 36 years ago and Kavanaugh s categorical denial that it ever happened.To understand the phenomenon, I talked with Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of Boston University School of Public Health s Department of Community Health Sciences, a veteran researcher of alcohol abuse and an addiction medicine specialist. Our conversation, edited:There s been recent confusion about alcohol-related blackouts   what they are and what they aren t. What s been your reaction to the use of the term lately?Many people confuse the idea of a blackout with someone who s had so much to drink that they are unarousable   they re not awake and they don t know what s going on. That s not at all the case. A blackout is when you don t remember what happened. You can appear to be completely awake. An observer can t tell when someone is in the midst of not forming a memory.The second common misconception is that having a blackout is characteristic of an alcohol use disorder more commonly called alcoholism   that you only have blackouts if you have an alcohol use disorder. And that s just not true.It s a curious phenomenon   a very selective kind of temporary memory impairment. What s going on in there?It involves those parts of the brain that are required to take in what s happening and allow you to remember it later. You might remember it two or three minutes later but not 10 hours later or two days later or ever again, because it didn t get permanently encoded by the brain. It probably happens in the hippocampus and it involves the frontal lobes of the brain as well.What touches it off?If you drink a substantial amount quickly, you might experience a blackout. Drinking games would be an example of that because that s the point of the game.How common are blackouts?We don t have great epidemiologic data about this. I ve seen the prevalence of blackouts ranging anywhere from 10 percent to up to 50 percent of young people who drink. It s fair to say it s not rare.Does blackout seem to explain, at least potentially, the great divergence we heard last week in the testimony of  Ford and  Kavanaugh?It s plausible that if he were drinking heavily and rapidly that he might have a blackout. So it s possible he might have no recollection of what happened.What do you think when you hear Kavanaugh say, in response to a question about whether he s ever  passed out from drinking,  that he s  gone to sleep, but ... never blacked out ?I have no knowledge of what Judge Kavanaugh knows about the definition of  blackout  versus  passing out  versus  falling asleep after drinking.  Passed out is not a clinical term and usually people use it to mean that they drank so much that they ended up falling asleep. I m not sure if he could say that he had a blackout or not. The only way he would know is if somebody later told him that something happened while he was intoxicated and he didn t remember it, and then he believed they were telling the truth. So it s not a particularly easy question to answer unless you know the definition of blackout and your memory has been questioned, or somebody told you about it.Ford placed Kavanaugh s companion, Mark Judge, in the room where the alleged assault occurred. If he also was drinking heavily and also had a blackout, neither of them would remember and nobody else would be in a position to call their attention to it.Sure. It s conceivable they both could have had a blackout about the same event, although that begins to get a little bit less likely. If there was someone there to say that something happened, that s the only way you could come close to knowing.If you were consulted by the FBI, which is trying to unravel all this, what would you advise them to consider in light of the blackout phenomenon? What should they be alert to?They need to be aware that it s certainly possible there could have been something that happened that [Kavanaugh] might have no memory of. So if he says something didn t happen and it was supposed to have happened during a heavy drinking episode, then it s possible he has no memory of it. And so therefore they need to find other evidence or ask someone else, because his denial is questionable.I would also tell them that it s unlikely, at that age and in that context, that this would have happened only once. It s likely he d have had a blackout on some other occasion. And so there might be evidence of that.It seems as though this whole phenomenon of blackouts is a really big public health issue. Because people may do things in that state, such as committing sexual assault, that they don t feel personally responsible for later.The real problem with blackouts is that you don t remember. And so you can t learn from your behavior unless someone tells you that you did something terrible.Shouldn t public health educators and message-makers address blackouts? Don t teens and young adults need to understand more about this phenomenon? That it s not simply a question of moral failure but it s the way the brain acts in some people, in certain situations?You re absolutely right. This is not a moral judgment about whether people are drinking too much or not. This is a toxic biological effect of something that you re taking in that affects your brain in this way and makes it so that you can t remember what happened.This afternoon our school of public health is having a conversation with students and faculty about sexual assault. So it s a teaching opportunity for that. And more broadly, it s a teaching opportunity around alcohol use and heavy drinking.A version of this story originally ran on WBUR s CommonHealth. "

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/03/654030995/one-abortion-clinic-remains-open-in-missouri-following-new-state-requirements,"Women seeking abortions in Missouri have just one clinic to turn to, after another Planned Parenthood facility that performed the procedure couldn t meet newly imposed state requirements.It comes at a time when abortion rights activists fear the 1973 landmark ruling Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion, could be nullified if President Trump s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, is confirmed.In 2008, Missouri had five abortion clinics, according to Planned Parenthood. The Columbia Health Center in central Missouri on Wednesday became the latest to stop providing abortions.Under the new requirements, abortion providers must secure admitting privileges at hospitals located within about 15 minutes from their health centers. The idea behind that restriction is that it somehow makes patients safer if they experience complications from the abortion,  Planned Parenthood Great Plains spokeswoman Emily Miller tells NPR.  But in reality, abortion is already incredibly safe, and a patient s ability to access help at the hospital is the same, whether or not the provider has admitting privileges. Miller says that Columbia Health Center s physician had her privileges revoked in 2015 by University Hospital and has been denied privileges by the other surrounding hospitals.  They won t offer her admitting privileges because she s an abortion provider,  Miller says.NPR requested comments from two nearby hospitals that did not immediately respond.Only Planned Parenthood s St. Louis clinic currently provides abortions. For some patients, that means they may face up to 400 miles round-trip to seek abortion services,  Miller says.  We re helping them understand what their options are, whether to pursue care in St. Louis or cross state lines. In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that similar restrictions imposed in Texas were medically unnecessary.Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit against Missouri s requirements in November 2016 and a legal battle has ensued. A federal appeals court ruled in September that Missouri could enforce state laws. The judges issued a mandate for the requirements to take effect Monday.Missouri is not the only state where a single facility provides abortions to women. Other states include Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota and Mississippi, according to a 2014 report by the Guttmacher Institute. Nor is 2018 the first time that Missouri fell into this category.Columbia Health Center remains open and still provides other health care services. Staff is waiting for the state to renew the clinic s one-year abortion license, which expired Tuesday.According to a court document, economics professor Jason M. Lindo argued that if the clinic stopped providing abortions in Missouri,  we should expect to see at least a 22% annual reduction in abortions among women currently served by that facility. Meanwhile Mary Kogut, the president and CEO of the branch that oversees Missouri s only abortion clinic, will step down later this month, after more than 38 years with Planned Parenthood.Attorneys representing the organization are seeking to block the state s requirements in federal district court.  We are hopeful that the Court will rule promptly, because women will be impacted immediately   and their constitutional rights ultimately violated,  Dr. Brandon J. Hill, president and CEO of Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a statement.Samuel Lee, a lobbyist who has spent years campaigning for abortion restrictions in Missouri, said he thinks  when the district court looks at it again, they will uphold the law because it protects the health and safety of women who are seeking abortions in Missouri without imposing an undue burden on them,  according to The Kansas City Star.Planned Parenthood said Wednesday that 20 states are  poised to ban abortion  if Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court   and that 13 abortion cases are  one step away  from the country s highest court."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/01/653318005/california-becomes-1st-state-to-require-women-on-corporate-boards,"California will be the first state to require publicly traded companies to have at least one woman on their board of directors.The law, signed by Gov. Jerry Brown on Sunday, requires public companies whose principal executive offices are located in California to comply by the end of 2019. The minimum is two female directors if the company has five directors on its board, or three women if it has seven directors by the close of 2021.The bill was sponsored by state Sens. Hannah-Beth Jackson and Toni Atkins.  We are not going to ask any more,  Jackson said in August in a floor speech on the bill, the Los Angeles Times reported.  We are tired of being nice. We re tired of being polite. We are going to require this because it s going to benefit the economy. It s going to benefit each of these companies.  It s time that we burst that man-cave and put women in the boardrooms,  she said. A quarter of the 445 publicly traded companies in California don t have a single woman on their boards, KQED reports.Brown acknowledged that that have been  numerous objections  and  serious legal concerns  to the bill.California s Chamber of Commerce and 29 other business groups opposed the it, sending a letter to the state senate arguing that the measure is unconstitutional, that it takes into account only gender and not other diversity, and that it seeks to manage the directors of companies that are incorporated in another state. Such confusion and ambiguity will only lead to costly fines as proposed under the bill and potential litigation,  the business groups complained. Companies that don t comply with the law will be fined $100,000; subsequent violations will draw a $300,000 fine.Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles wrote that  the bill specifically creates a classification based on gender, and therefore it raises questions of equal protection under both the U.S. Constitution and the California Constitution. When the government legislates on the basis of gender, courts typically subject that legislation to a heightened scrutiny. This basically means the government has to prove it has a really good reason for doing what it is doing, and that there isn t a better way of accomplishing that goal. Just 5 percent of the companies on the Standard & Poor s 500 (which includes only publicly traded firms) have female CEOs. According to The New York Times, women who have served as chief executive are far less likely than men to go on to be CEO at another company, and less likely to serve on corporate boards.In 2008, Norway instituted quotas requiring women to make up 40 percent of directors at listed companies, and many countries in Western Europe soon followed, as The Economist reported in February.  In every country business leaders protested when the idea was floated,  the magazine noted. But ten years on,  the worst fears have not been realised.  One concern ñ that a small group of women would end up on many boards ñ turns out to be an issue with men on boards, too. The Economist also found that some of the benefits touted for increasing the number of women on boards ñ such as closing the wage gap between men and women, or having an effect on company decision-making ñ haven t necessarily come to pass.The bill was one of Brown s last opportunities to approve or veto before he leaves office due to term limits, The Associated Press noted. The approval also took place against the backdrop of the controversial Supreme Court confirmation process of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault more than 30 years ago. In his statement on signing the bill into law, the California governor pointedly cc ed the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and wrote:  I don t minimize the potential flaws that indeed may prove fatal to [the law s] ultimate implementation. Nevertheless, recent events in Washington, D.C. and beyond make it crystal clear that many are not getting the message. He noted that as far back as 1886, corporations have been considered persons as far as the 14th Amendment is considered.  Given all the special privileges that corporations have enjoyed for so long, it s high time corporate boards include the people who constitute more than half the  persons  in America,  Brown wrote.Jackson, the bill s co-sponsor, told USA Today that the law is  a giant step forward not just for women but also for our businesses and our economy.  It s my hope that corporations, rather than fight this, will acknowledge its value and take the lead on pulling together and bringing greater diversity into their boardrooms,  she said."

Kanye West may have announced a name change to Ye this week, but he was up to his old shenanigans as the musical guest on the season premiere of Saturday Night Live. True to form, he closed the show with a MAGA-inspired monologue defending President Trump.It was a symbolic cap to the political spectacle of the past week: Another man in a position of privilege felt threatened enough to unleash a rant over his perceived freedoms under attack. They bullied me backstage, they said don t go out there with that hat on,  Ye said. His rant came at the close of the show, as West was joined onstage for a final performance, with collaborators Kid Cudi and 070 Shake, of  Ghost Town  from his 2018 solo album ye. With the credits rolling and some cast members visibly shaking their heads in disagreement, Ye continued as the show cut off. Video footage recorded by audience members, including Chris Rock who can be heard laughing in the background, made it to Instagram. It s the only performance of Ye s three on Saturday s show that NBC hasn t uploaded to its SNL YouTube account. This means you can t tell me what to do,  Ye continued, tugging on the brim of his hat.  Follow your heart and stop following your mind. That s how we re controlled; that s how we re programmed.  He espoused love as the answer before thanking SNL for the platform.  I know some of y all don t agree, but y all be going at that man neck a lot and I don t think it s actually that helpful. The man in question, of course, was President Trump, who got a rare reprieve from SNL s cast on the season opener in favor of Brett Kavanaugh. Trump s Supreme Court Justice nominee got raked over the coals in a portrayal by actor Matt Damon during a spoof of the emotional Senate Judicial Committee hearing over Kavanaugh s sexual assault allegations.It s hard to imagine Ye even being cognizant of what was happening in the world last week, as he prepared for his SNL performance and the release of Yandhi, his second solo LP of 2018. The album still has yet to appear on streaming sites, but SNL viewers may have gotten a tease with the debut performance of a new song titled  We Got Love,  featuring Teyana Taylor. It was the second of three performances during the show, the first being a juvenile rendition of Ye s recent hit  I Love It,  featuring he and rapper Lil Pump dressed respectively in full-body costumes of Perrier and Fiji water bottles.Kanye s SNL rant was not the only news he made in last week s rollout for the recently-announced LP, that has more people buzzing about his controversial statements than the music. During a stop at the New York office of music magazine The Fader, he reportedly referred to Trump and Alex Jones, founder of the right-wing conspiracy theory site, as  matrix-breakers.  (That quote, initially reported in The Fader s recap of his visit, was deleted later, leaving outlets like Spin to speculate on the reasons why.) He also espoused his love of alt-right personality Candace Owens, and claimed admitted sexual assault perpetrator Louis C.K. was his preference for SNL s season premiere hosting duties. His attire during that visit was equally problematic. He wore a Colin Kaepernick sweatshirt and a MAGA hat that he claimed to have  put positive energy into,  with a redesign that failed to alter the message. Kaepernick has faced some of his harshest criticism from Trump, making Ye s outfit an outward display of cognitive dissonance if ever there were one.In line with his embrace of questionable figures, Ye also came to the defense of fashion designer A$AP Bari, of hip-hop collective A$AP Mob, who also faces sexual assault allegations, and deceased artist XXXTentacion, whose short career was defined by allegations of physical and sexual abuse against a former girlfriend. The only thing missing from Kanye s rollout was an endorsement of Kavanaugh. Considering his recent streak of aligning himself with divisive figures, it would ve been totally on-brand."
NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/30/653086817/molly-ringwald-on-80s-movies-and-sexual-assault,"Last Thursday s hearings on the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh brought up, among other things, the high school party scene in the 1980s and the films that glorified it. Kavanaugh mentioned those movies when he defended some of the crude references in his high school yearbook.During the hearing, Kavanaugh said he thought  some editors and students wanted the yearbook to be some combination of Animal House, Caddyshack, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which were all recent movies at that time.  Filmmaker John Hughes  famous teenage comedies   like Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club   fall under the same category of coming-of-age classics.Molly Ringwald starred in many of those movies. But now that she has a teen of her own, she has reassessed the way those films perpetuated sexual assault as a norm of teen life. In the film Sixteen Candles, for example, Michael Schoeffling plays the teenage dreamboat Jake Ryan. In one scene, Schoeffling s character casually suggests taking advantage of his passed out girlfriend.  I ve got Caroline in the bedroom right now passed out cold,  his character says.  I could violate her 10 different ways if I wanted to.  It s scenes like that, Ringwald says, that are troubling.In April, she wrote an article for The New Yorker about looking at the films through the lens of today s #MeToo movement.  If attitudes toward female subjugation are systemic, and I believe that they are, it stands to reason that the art we consume and sanction plays some part in reinforcing those same attitudes,  she writes in the article.Ringwald currently holds a recurring role in the CW s Riverdale   the teen soap that has tackled the issue of sexual assault in a way that empowers young women   where she plays Archie s mother, Mary Andrews.In an interview with NPR s Lulu Garcia-Navarro, Ringwald discusses  80s teen films and the culture they reflected.On viewing her films more criticallyYou know, when I made those movies with John Hughes, his intention was to not make Porky s or Animal House. But I think, you know, as everyone says and I do believe is true, that times were different and what was acceptable then is definitely not acceptable now and nor should it have been then, but that s sort of the way that it was ... I feel very differently about the movies now and it s a difficult position for me to be in because there s a lot that I like about them. And of course I don t want to appear ungrateful to John Hughes, but I do oppose a lot of what is in those movies. On watching Sixteen Candles with her daughter  I do see it differently. I mean, there were parts of that film that bothered me then. Although everybody likes to say that I had, you know, John Hughes  ear and he did listen to me in a lot of ways, I wasn t the filmmaker. And, you know, sometimes I would tell him,  Well, I think that this is kind of tacky  or  I think that this is irrelevant  or  this doesn t ring true,  and sometimes he would listen to me but in other cases he didn t. And, you know, you don t want to speak up too much. You don t want to cross the line. Or at least that s the way that I felt at the time. On  80s teen films reflecting  80s teen cultureI know what my own experience was. I feel like the movies that I made then were very much representing the culture at the time. And I feel like that is why they resonated with people, because it was their experience and they did feel that they had these films that were real. They didn t have that sort of  After School Special  feeling where somebody was teaching them a lesson, you know. It didn t feel like that.On how those films should be viewed today I believe that there is still a lot of good in the films and there s a lot that I m proud of. And I feel like in a lot of ways they ve touched teenagers and sparked a conversation that is important. And having a teenage daughter myself, I know that it s not always easy to get teenagers to talk. But these films sort of break through that. You know? There s something that really touches teenagers, especially The Breakfast Club I feel like sort of gives them permission to talk about their feelings   says that teenagers  feelings really matter. And I think that s a really powerful message and for that reason I really love it. Pretty in Pink, I love my character. I think that she s a strong woman and I m proud of the choices that she makes. On films that are handling difficult conversations the right way todayOne comes to mind which is Eighth Grade. I thought it was a beautiful movie. And it also seemed very true. I mean, raising a teenager who just graduated from eighth grade   she just started ninth grade   you know there s a lot that really rang true for me. And it seemed to borrow a lot from John Hughes, but for me it sort of borrowed the best parts from John Hughes.Cameron Jenkins produced this story for digital."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/sections/publiceditor/2018/09/28/652538222/npr-doesnt-confer-dr-on-ph-d-s-heres-why,"Longstanding NPR policy is to reserve the title of  Dr.  for an individual who holds a doctor of dental surgery, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatric medicine or veterinary medicine.That excludes those with other types of doctoral degrees, including Christine Blasey Ford, who testified this week before the Senate Judiciary Committee about her allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in 1982 (Kavanaugh has emphatically denied the allegation). Ford, according to an NPR profile, is a  professor and research psychologist in Northern California at Palo Alto University and the Stanford University PsyD Consortium, a clinical psychology program where she teaches statistics, research methods and psychometrics.  She holds a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology from the University of Southern California.For some listeners, the disparity of hearing Kavanaugh called  Judge Kavanaugh,  at times, and not hearing Ford referred to as  Doctor  rankled. One called it  offensive,  saying it showed how women are disrespected in relation to men. Another called it an  insidious bias.  An explanation of the policy on 1A (which NPR distributes but does not produce) provoked complaints to the Ombudsman Office. As NPR s standards editor Mark Memmott told me,  the idea is that for most listeners a  Dr.  practices medicine.  The language policy is based on the standard laid out by the AP Stylebook, which many news outlets, including NPR, follow. (One notable exception: The New York Times.)The AP guidance adds: NPR s policy is not a case of gender bias; it also applies to men. Memmott told me NPR has  at times referred to her as  Professor  Ford. We have identified her specialty. And I m sure we have referred to her as Dr. at least a few times. NPR should consistently include that information, where it s relevant. As for the  Dr.  policy, it exists to provide clarity, which is what a newsroom should strive for.

Rosenstein s reprieveThe president s comments appeared to be good news for Rosenstein, who has been a political target of Trump and his allies in Congress for months. They have scourged Rosenstein over his role supervising the ongoing Russia investigation, which Trump also broached in his press conference on Wednesday.The president repeated there had been  no collusion  between him or his campaign and the Russian attack on the 2016 election and  no obstruction  of that investigation   which Rosenstein appointed special counsel Robert Mueller to lead after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017.Trump acknowledged that he speaks out and takes other actions in response to events, but said that isn t against the law. There s no obstruction except for the fact that I fight back, if you call that obstruction,  he said.The investigation of Russian election interference is a  witch hunt,  as Trump repeated, but he also said he would  much prefer to keep Rod Rosenstein  as the second-in-command at the Justice Department.The question now is for how much longer. Discussion has swirled about Trump replacing Rosenstein or Attorney General Jeff Sessions, another favorite presidential political punching bag, on or after Election Day in November.The leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who at one time said they would not entertain a potential replacement for Sessions, now have softened that stance and signaled that they might be open to a new attorney general. It isn t clear what the congressional response might be to vacancies in both of the top two Justice Department positions."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/20/649721806/anita-hills-challenge-to-clarence-thomas-a-tale-of-2-lives-and-3-elections,"Brett Kavanaugh is not the first presidential nominee to have his run to the Supreme Court frozen at the finish line by a woman s accusations.Throughout this week of turmoil in Washington, the historical backstory has been the 1991 confrontation between Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas and a former colleague named Anita Hill.The classic clash of his and her testimony forced the reopening of Thomas  confirmation hearings and mesmerized a national TV audience for days. Hill won many believers with her powerful narrative of sexual harassment when she and Thomas were both lawyers at the Department of Education (and later at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission).Thomas came back with a spirited defense, accusing  white liberals  on the Judiciary Committee of  a high tech lynching  to put  uppity blacks  in their place if they chose to be conservatives.Both Hill and Thomas were African-Americans, but Thomas  defense was an acknowledgement of race as a factor in the entire process. Indeed, race had been a factor in the Supreme Court process even before President George H.W. Bush chose Thomas to fill the vacancy left by Justice Thurgood Marshall   the only African-American who had ever served on the nation s highest court.Thomas became the second. His nomination was confirmed by the full Senate 52-48, the closest such vote since the 1800s. He is now the Supreme Court s longest-serving active member.But the repercussions of his confirmation fight roiled the next election   helping to make 1992 the  Year of the Woman    and they ve continued to roil the politics of race, gender and partisanship in America ever since.The electoral connection was critical throughout the Thomas nomination process, and not only in terms of female voters. Two elections that took place in the 1980s were not only preludes but determinants of the drama that would unfold.The first was the midterm of 1986, when several Senate Republicans who had been swept into office with President Ronald Reagan in 1980 were denied re-election. The Senate Democrats regained the majority largely by flipping nine seats the GOP had held, including five below the Mason-Dixon line. They also held seats in Arkansas and Kentucky. And in all these states they won on strong turnout among African-Americans.That reliance on black voters would be widely noted the following year, when Reagan tried to fill a Supreme Court vacancy with an appeals court judge named Robert Bork. A hero to many conservatives, Bork had questioned liberal landmarks such as the Supreme Court s decision in Roe v. Wade (which legalized abortion nationwide) and legislation considered vital to the civil rights movement. The head of the NAACP vowed to fight the nomination  until hell freezes over, and then we will skate on the ice. In a famous denunciation of the nominee, Sen. Edward Kennedy said  Robert Bork s America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions [and] blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters. Rejected in committee, Bork insisted on a floor vote and lost badly. Most of the Southern and border state senators were still Democrats at that time, and all but two joined their colleagues from the North and West in rejecting Bork.The sense that black voters mattered had never been stronger than in the fall of 1987.One year later, when the first President Bush was elected, he received just 11 percent of the vote among African-Americans, according to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. That was barely better than Reagan s 9 percent in 1984. Bush had always considered himself a moderate on race   if not a progressive   and he wanted to do better.In 1990, Bush got his first high court vacancy to fill and Thomas was on his short list with the sponsorship of Missouri Republican Sen. John Danforth, for whom Thomas had worked. Bush had already put Thomas on a federal appeals court months earlier and by some reports was ready to promote him. Advised that there would be other opportunities and that Thomas at 41 would be around a good long while, Bush named David Souter of New Hampshire instead.That did not please conservatives, who suspected (correctly) that Souter might prove unreliable (he eventually became part of the liberal wing). So pressure on the right converged with Bush s original inclination when the Marshall vacancy gave him the ideal moment in 1991.Democrats, for their part, feared Thomas would be as conservative as Bork on abortion, police powers and a host of other issues. But he was far more careful than Bork had been in the confirmation process, especially in his public hearings before the Judiciary Committee. So despite their frustration at Thomas  answers about Roe and other matters, Democrats on Judiciary were loath to oppose him.In truth, it seemed every bit as improbable that the Democrats would reject a black nominee as that Bush would replace Marshall with anyone else. Despite his strong Republicanism and conservative views, Thomas had robust support in polls of African-American voters. And it was lost on no one that the same cohort of Democratic senators who had been elected in 1986 would be on the ballot again in 1992.And then Hill spoke up.Suddenly there were bumperstickers that said,  I believe Anita.  Women s organizations were incensed at the Democrats  weak defense of Hill in the face of scathing Republican comments about her veracity. But the conflict for the majority party was rubbed raw by Thomas   high-tech lynching  remarks, and the polling among black voters remained supportive. Polling overall also favored Thomas  version of his relationship with Hill.In the end, the Judiciary Committee Democrats could not bring themselves to reprise their rejection of Bork. They sent the nomination to the Senate floor without a recommendation. He prevailed with 52 yea votes, including from 11 Democrats   all but a few from the South.One who was not from the South but had many African-American constituents was Sen. Alan Dixon, a two-termer from Illinois who had been in statewide office for more than two decades. The following year he would lose in the Democratic primary to Carol Mosely Braun, a relative newcomer from Chicago who ran against his vote for Thomas.Braun was not alone. The Senate s handling of Hill   and its cavalier dismissal of women from the House of Representatives who tried to show their support for her   became a flashpoint. Other targets of the backlash, such as Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, barely squeaked by in 1992. Specter had been the harshest of Hill s interrogators.Over time, the wounds of the Hill-Thomas hearings have faded but never healed. Both of the principals wrote moving autobiographies in which they stood by their testimony and criticized their antagonist. Thomas proved to be as conservative a justice as Bush or Reagan could have hoped, anchoring that wing of the court along with the late Antonin Scalia. Some have argued that Thomas  record is even more consistently conservative, as he crossed the aisle less often on specific cases.Hill continued her career as a legal scholar and professor, teaching at the University of Oklahoma and other schools. She is now university professor of social policy, law, and women s, gender and sexuality studies at Brandeis University in Massachusetts.This week, in the midst of the meltdown over Christine Blasey Ford s allegations, Hill published an op-ed in The New York Times. There is no way to redo 1991, but there are ways to do better,  wrote Hill.  To do better, the 2018 Senate Judiciary Committee must demonstrate a clear understanding that sexual violence is a social reality to which elected representatives must respond. The committee should serve as  fact-finders to better serve the American public, and the weight of the government should not be used to destroy the lives of witnesses who are called to testify. If lessons have not been taken from the experience of 1991, Hill writes, then the committee should learn from the #MeToo movement of the present day. The spectacle of powerful men brought down when their abuse of women has been brought to light in the past year has already led many to compare the 2018 elections to those of 1992.With all the primaries concluded, a record number of 257 women are still in the running for Congress this fall.And it can scarcely be lost on the present Senate majority that the majority of voters in American elections are women."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/17/648883919/trump-orders-declassification-of-documents-about-fbi-sought-by-house-republicans,"Updated at 7:43 p.m. ETPresident Trump has ordered the intelligence community to  provide for the immediate declassification  of several documents related to the FBI and the Department of Justice, the White House press secretary announced Monday.The documents in question are specific pages of the June 2017 FISA warrant application related to onetime Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page, all FBI interview reports prepared in connection with all FISA warrant applications in connection with Page, and all FBI reports of interviews with Justice Department lawyer Bruce Ohr prepared in connection with the FBI s Russia investigation.Additionally, Trump has ordered the DOJ and the FBI to release all text messages related to the Russia investigation   in unredacted form   of former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, former FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, former FBI attorney Lisa Page and Ohr. When the President issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House Counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America s national security interests,  a spokesperson for the Department of Justice said in a statement.  The Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President s order. One of Trump s allies in the House cheered the president s decision.  I commend President Trump for his decision to declassify numerous documents, including several redacted pages of the Carter Page FISA application and important messages relating to the Russia investigation,  Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., said in a statement.  My colleagues in Congress and I have requested these documents for months, but have faced lengthy and unnecessary delays, redactions, and refusals from officials at the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Gaetz, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, added that he looks  forward to the forthcoming release of these documents, and reviewing them closely. But the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee criticized Trump s move.  President Trump, in a clear abuse of power, has decided to intervene in a pending law enforcement investigation by ordering the selective release of materials he believes are helpful to his defense team and thinks will advance a false narrative,  Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in a statement that also raised concerns about the possibility that intelligence sources and methods could be compromised by the release ordered by Trump.It is not clear from the statement when the declassification and release of the documents will occur. But when it does it would be the latest move by Trump and his administration to release previously secret documents at the heart of claims by the president s allies on Capitol Hill. Those allies, particularly conservative Republicans in the House, contend that the FBI s Russia investigation is biased against Trump at its core and from its early stages.In July the administration released the previously classified warrant application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court made by the FBI in 2016 seeking permission to surveil Page s communications. But those documents were heavily redacted, with entire pages blacked out. Earlier this year, in February, a memo by House intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., was also declassified and released. And later that same month, a countermemo by Democrats on the same committee was declassified and released in redacted form.Although Monday s announcement had been anticipated, the news comes as the Trump administration is grappling with sexual-assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.A month ago, the president made headlines when he revoked the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan, a persistent Trump critic on TV and on Twitter, who played a role in referring information to the FBI that would spark the bureau s Russia investigation. The revocation of Brennan s clearance and the release by the White House of the names of a number of other individuals in federal law enforcement or the intelligence community whose clearances might also be in jeopardy occurred as prosecutors were wrapping up the presentation of their case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and as former Trump aide Omarosa Manigault Newman was on a media tour promoting a new book critical of Trump and his administration.In another headline-grabbing move Monday that had likewise been anticipated, the Trump administration announced it was imposing 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports, the latest salvo in the president s escalating trade dispute with China."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/24/650447848/the-womens-wave-backlash-to-trump-persists-reshaping-politics-in-2018,"Editor s note: NPR is examining the role of women in the 2018 midterm elections all week. To follow upcoming coverage and look back at how the role of women in the 2014 midterms was covered, click here.More than a year and a half ago, the day after Donald Trump was inaugurated, millions of women worldwide took to the streets in fury over his election. It was a massive show of resistance   likely the largest protest in U.S. history, as the Washington Post reported at the time.One of the biggest questions that loomed over the demonstrations that day: could the energy last?Amy Chomsky, an ophthalmologist from Nashville, attended the demonstration in Washington, D.C., and she wanted to make it clear that she and her fellow marchers were serious in their anger. We re not just crazy protesters,  she said the day of the march.  It s a shame that we have to still be fighting for women s rights or saying that we have a right to decide on our own reproductive health. We have a right to equal pay. It s a shame that we re still doing this. And for Chomsky, that energy has lasted, making her more politically active than ever before. I really in the past was kind of like,  Eh, the right person will win, I m sure,   she told NPR last month.  I voted probably in several presidential elections. I rarely voted in either local or midterm and things like that. Now I really try to vote on all of those. In addition to that, she says that for the first time she has yard signs, is making political donations, and helping put on a fundraiser for a Democratic Senate candidate.And that makes her a prime example of the surge in energy among Democratic women this year. What you re seeing is just this harmonic convergence where women are running, women are volunteering in campaigns, women are making record numbers of contributions,  said Celinda Lake, Democratic pollster.  And women are voting for Democrats, especially women Democrats. A record number of women have run and won primaries for the U.S. House, U.S. Senate, and governorships this year, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, and a record number of women have also won nominations for state legislatures; the vast majority are Democrats.Women turn out   and this year, they re very DemocraticIt s nothing new for women to be politically active   women s turnout rate has outstripped men s in every presidential election since 1980, and in every midterm election since 1986. (In terms of raw numbers, women have outvoted men in every national election since at least 1964. These days, that gap is several million every election year.)In that sense, every year is the  year of the woman. But in 2018, polls show women have swung even more Democratic than usual, while men remain nearly evenly split, or leaning slightly Republican. According to an NPR analysis of recent likely-voter polls, this year s gender gap could be even bigger than those in 2014 and 2016, with women far more Democratic than in either of those years. Republicans heading into the midterm need to be concerned about the gender gap,  says Republican pollster Christine Matthews.Expanding the gap: Education and raceThat larger gap may be here to stay, Matthews says, in part because it s inseparable from other longer-term political trends. Whereas the Republican Party used to primarily be comprised of college educated voters, college educated voters   particularly college educated women   have been becoming more Democratic,  Matthews said.  What happened is the 2016 election sped that up. Among the most energized of Democratic voters are women of color, says Aimee Allison, president of Democracy In Color, a group that does multiracial organizing among progressives. We have the possibility of women of color for the first time getting recognition for Democratic Party successes out of the midterms, and people taking a good look at those numbers and saying,  Oh my goodness, women of color made the difference,   she said.In particular, Black women have relatively high turnout rates, and they vote heavily Democratic.Black women in Alabama propelled Democrat Doug Jones to a Senate seat   a remarkable political upset   in a December special election, and they also helped push Ralph Northam to a win that was larger than predicted in most polls in his 2017 election for the Virginia governorship.In Allison s opinion, that kind of energy among progressive voters of color   especially women   should be enough to get some Democrats who might be tempted to see moderation as a winning strategy to change their minds. I don t know how many losses political consultants need to have in order to say we re going to stop chasing Trump voters, or white moderates, and start looking at the math that says we actually don t need them in order to win,  she said. The new coalition that is part of the playbook includes white voters, but it doesn t center on trying to attract moderate white voters,  she added.Republican women sticking with TrumpWhile many women are swinging Democratic, women who supported Trump when he first took office stuck with him over the long term.Women voters who voted for Trump largely maintained their  warm  feelings toward him as of March 2018, according to an August study from the Pew Research Center.Cindy Moser is one woman who has stuck with the president. The retired teacher from North Carolina attended Donald Trump s inauguration, and she stressed then that she s not alone in being a woman who supports Trump. I was on his train from day one,  she said then.  One by one, all my family and friends hopped on. My mother was the worst. Now she looks at me, she says,  I told you he was going to be good.  I just have to laugh. And she s still on that train. I absolutely adore him,  she told NPR recently.Moser added that she doesn t really empathize with women who dislike Trump. I ve always been a strong woman. If I wanted something I found a way to get it. Nobody has stopped me,  she said.  It s just the way I am. I don t feel victimized by Trump. That sets Moser apart from many American women, 62 percent of whom disapprove of Trump, and half of whom strongly disapprove, NPR and Marist found in a recent poll.And that may affect how they vote in November. For her part, Amy Chomsky is hoping that means they ll vote. I think this is a pivotal time,  she says.  I just feel like we need to get as much Democratic vote as we can. And I think the more people who can get out and vote in these midterms is gonna make a difference. And that intensity is coming from a woman who doesn t remember voting in a midterm before."

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/01/653193096/author-of-the-apprentice-talks-of-getting-trolled-and-sourcing-stories,"These are highly charged times for politics reporters. Just ask Greg Miller, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post journalist who has broken a number of stories related to the Trump administration s ties to Russia.Miller says that he s been  trolled a lot  because of his work. But after revealing that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions with Russian officials prior to Trump s inauguration, Miller experienced something new: notes from grateful readers. Weird things happen that had never happened to me as a reporter,  Miller says.  Several of us started getting cards, actual letters in the mail, thanks from readers from faraway places, notes even on my doorstep at home. Ultimately, Miller s story about Flynn contributed to Flynn s ouster from the administration   a fact Miller says brought him  no pleasure.  But, Miller adds,  at the same time, as a reporter, there is nothing better than to be able to get to the bottom of a complex story that there are so many people who are trying to prevent you from getting at. Miller further investigates the links between Russia and the Trump administration in his new book, The Apprentice.On deciding to publish the story that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn lied about his conversation with Russian ambassador Sergey KislyakThat was, sort of, one of the more fascinating and interesting episodes I ve ever lived through as a reporter. When we write stories like this, you know, basically accusing a very senior government official of not being honest with the public   and there s a very high bar there before you can publish something like that   you want to have everything locked down.And, in fact, in this case, we had a colleague, Karen DeYoung, who had a previously scheduled interview with Flynn in his office in the West Wing of the White House, and so we huddled with her before she went over. She was going to talk to him about the foreign policy objectives of the new administration and so forth and [we] asked her to   at the very end of her interview with him   raise this question with him one last time, to tell him,  Look, the Post is close to publishing a story saying that you did discuss sanctions with Kislyak. How do you respond?  In that moment, he doubles down, and tells her  No, no.  And he repeats it several times.  No, no, no.  Basically did not happen. ...We were ready to publish that story that night. But the strenuous denial, the nature of the denial from him, made us think, OK we we need to double check. We need to we need to hold off and make double sure that we re right on this.That night we talked about it in The Post newsroom the next morning I went into a meeting with [executive editor] Marty Baron, [managing editor] Cameron Barr, other senior editors at The Washington Post and laid out our sourcing. ... I said,  We have nine different sources telling us this is true.  And [I] described that sourcing to those editors and came out of that meeting with a green light. ...So we called the White House, we say,  We have the denial. We re going to use that on the record. We re going forward with the story anyway. We re confident in our sources.  And then the White House blinks. Flynn blinks, comes back to us, calls me through a spokesman, calls me and says for the first time,  Mr. Flynn is no longer certain that those sanctions were not discussed in that call. He can t be sure that the subject didn t come up,  and that was just so different from the categorical denial we had gotten, I don t know, 16 [hours] earlier that we knew that we were right. And that s when we published.On his use of anonymous sources These sources are not anonymous to us. These are sources that we know who they are. In many instances, they re sources we have known for many years and have developed trust in because of how reliably they have given us information. ...There s no magic number. Nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the publication of [the Michael Flynn] story. It could have been two or three. It s more about the caliber of the sources, their positions, whether they have access to the information that they are providing, how trustworthy are they? How much do we know about them? ...The stories that we ve written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources have almost all proven over time to be accurate. There might be mistakes at the margins here, news organizations aren t perfect and we do make mistakes, but boy, we ve gotten a lot right. ... The Post and other news organizations are always trying to get it right, but at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time, and accusations of fake news, there is extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right.On the usage of  lie  or  lying  in reportingWe don t throw that word around lightly. We often get criticized at The Post for being too reluctant to use that word, and I think that s true in other news organizations as well. But at the same time, I mean, we re here at this moment we have a fact checker at the Washington Post who has documented 5,000 or more falsehoods from this president since he s taken office. Many of them are falsehoods that he repeats despite repeated corrections, public corrections, repeated efforts   even by his own staff   to correct his misstatements.There is an intent. I don t think there s any doubt that there is an intent, that it is part of Trump s very complex personality. It traces back to his origin as a public person. We have run fascinating stories here at The Post about times earlier in his career when he would adopt phony personas and call reporters for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for the magazine s annual rankings.On Trump officials signing non-disclosure agreements I can t say I ve ever encountered somebody who has signed such an agreement. I know that they exist in this White House. I know that they ve tried to offer financial inducements to those who would be willing to sign them, as they leave the administration and move on. ...I just think that s such a bizarre approach. These are these are supposedly public officials. They are our public servants they are not President Trump s public servants. The idea that anybody would be required to sign any kind of loyalty oath to him personally just goes against the grain of so many principles that it s hard to fathom.On reading a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey in which Comey describes President Trump s reaction to stories Miller wroteAs I read this memo, I realize [Trump s] talking about me. He s talking about the stories that I had written for The Post. Comey is talking about,  Yes, I agree with you. Sometimes it s great to put somebody s head on a pike,  as an example. Trump goes on to joke to say he believes a reporter should be put in jail, and jokes about how once a reporter spends a little time in jail they make a new friend suddenly they re willing to talk.It s a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism   or anybody who cares about journalism   but for me it was just eerie to think that he s talking specifically about stories I had written for The Washington Post. They re talking about heads on pikes, reporters in jail chasing down sources. It was unnerving.Sam Briger and Mooj Zadie produced and edited the audio of this interview.
