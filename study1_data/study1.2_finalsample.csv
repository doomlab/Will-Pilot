A woman has the right to control her body If a woman were to become pregnant, and it would effect her life in a way she wasn't ready for, who are we to tell her that she has to carry it anyways? Also, say she got raped? Forcing her to carry a child that she might not even love is cruel, both for the mother and the child.

I think there should be fines and punishment for people who violate rules, like littering and dump toxic chemicals. On the other hand, I also believe that people have the freedom to whatever they please when it comes to the environment. This means that I feel that people have the choice whether they want to recycle or not. Although, in my opinion, recycle and throwing away aren't that much different. It only takes a couple of seconds to separate trash from recycle. As for clean energy, much like of the rest of the world, we are moving in a progressive way, so it's not a matter of if this will happen, but when. I feel the government should be involved in environmental policies only if they are impactful to humans and society as a whole. For example, big companies can't just dump their waste into a lake and expect not to be fined for it. Overall, I think environmentalism can be a good thing as long as it does no encroach on the rights of people."

I think that if we took more time recycling and finding new ways to recycle things then our environment could make a huge change, if the government worked to create regulations like everyone must recycle at least 10% of their waste annually or something the over time we could progress toward a huge environment change. If everyone could find something that he the environment that they are passionate about or we could make a bigger stance on waste and pollution the maybe more people would try a little bit harder.

If you look at every other species on Earth, not a single one extracts things from the Earth that are not reusable or replenishable. As humans, we too most follow this obligation to protect the only Earth we have. Issues that have been appearing such as ice caps melting causing sea levels to rise are a serious concern. It is true that it may be a natural process. However, the question should be: What if it is not? This means it is up to humans to attempt to solve this problem. Right now the best solution we have for solving this problem is more pro environmental policies and attitudes. We are also becoming an increasingly wasteful society.

McCain was quoted as saying that he agreed that the use of chemical weapons would be a red line, as Obama had stated, but that isolated strikes were not enough of a response. Given that Rumsfeld and the Bush administration seemed to have had many problems with Bashar al Assad, I think it's safe to say many Republicans have wanted a war with Syria for a long time and wanted to take advantage of the opportunity for armed reaction that the use of chemicals weapons could have provided. 

Obviously, the use of chemical weapons is completely unacceptable and warranted a response, but I think the Obama administration jumped the gun when they stated it would be a ""red line"", because, as we all know, they did back-track. The solution reached in the end was a peaceful, diplomatic solution that did not involve military forces of any kind. I do believe this was the right approach."

There is ample evidence supporting the assertion that humans have at least somewhat been factors in climate change which in itself is reason enough to support pro-environmental action. As far as government intervention goes, there is definitely a vested interest of the United States in both subsidizing and encouraging clean energy programs and in regulating the amount of pollutants output by various entities. My reasoning for this is that there is literally no incentive for profit-driven companies to attempt to protect the environment, especially when there may be associated costs with it. The free market is not an ethically driven idea, it is driven by growth and profits alone, ideas that do not often align with the betterment of the population or the world. The reasons for environmental regulation are ultimately the same as the reasoning for any other government program: government policies would look out for the betterment of the entire population rather than the betterment of corporations. As far as personal responsibility goes in regards to the environment, it is the duty of every citizen to monitor consumption of energy and to recycle whenever possible. This individual approach coupled with governmental enforcement of the actions of business would ultimately lead to a more sustainable future for everyone."

While I never researched that, just knowing that it is a possibility to be true quickly changed my mind about abortion. While some choose to terminate the pregnancy before the baby begins to looks like a baby, there are many abortion where the baby is big enough to have to be dismembered. I can not even begin to fathom how that is seen as okay. If the person were outside the womb, the murdered would be thrown into jail for life. Yet it is okay to do that to a helpless, unborn child. Also, we are the start of a culture who does not value babies as a source of life, no matter the situation. We are also on the track to not viewing sex as something sacred as well. This leads to unplanned pregnancies and no value of the life growing inside of them. I used to be pro choice-that the woman has a right to choose-but then after thinking long and hard about it, I realized that neither does that innocent baby. There are other options besides violently killing a baby with the mom left to pick up the pieces once she realizes what she did. So many parents that do not have the ability to have children, yet enough moms that are not willing to sacrifice nine months of their life for the benefit of other. I personally feel it all stems around the 'all about me"" narcissistic attitude that pervades this culture.

With 15,000 times the energy consumption of the entire world produced in a one-year period, solar power has the ability to supply an unlimited amount of energy with no continuous environmental downsides.  Like wind power, solar power will stimulate the economy, and also will provide jobs in the manufacture, the construction, and the maintenance of solar panels.  With negative local ecological effects, artificial dams lack the environmental benefit to justify further research and development.  However, with the harvesting of energy from waves under current research and development, hydropower has great potential and should be monitored as a possible renewable energy source. Nuclear power lacks any beneficial qualities in general. Economically speaking, the carbon emissions created in the production of the plants vastly outnumbers the carbon emissions of fossil fuels, and the radioactive waves make the surrounding environment uninhabitable. Economically speaking, it costs more to produce than many of its counterparts; therefore, there is no justification in furthering any research and development. Similar to nuclear energy, geothermal energy lacks the justification to further any development of the source. When a geothermal cavity is successfully discovered, there is a high chance that toxic gases can leak at a slow release, thus damaging the ozone and causing health problems for its consumers. Economically speaking, it costs millions to drill for the hot pockets of earth with no guarantee that the drilling will lead to a success.  Altogether, there and many sources of renewable energy that are being promoted to take the place of burning fossil fuels; however after this research, it has been found that solar energy and wind energy hold the greatest potential to produce an unlimited, clean source of energy for the future.  The burning of fossil fuels needs to come to an end, or the whole earth may find itself consumed by smog."

It is not natural but our society has made it acceptable, causing more and more people to want to try it out.  Our nation has put in many new laws that support it and I completely disagree with it.  In America, people used to get made fun of and persecuted for it and that is the way it should be.  People have to be taught that it is wrong.

But on the flip side I also think there should be a limit to the amount of abortions you can have in a certain period of time.

I believe that many people are very mislead in terms of what abortion consists of. Many anti-choice ads employ the use of already birthed babies to deter people from considering abortion, while nearly all abortions are completed before the fetus even really takes a baby-like form. For instance, there is a commercial from the American Life League that shows a baby bunny rabbit being put into a blender and insinuated to be ground up. They then compare this to aborting a child, even though that process is often completed by taking a set of medication.
I also think it?s wrong to tell people what they can and can?t do with their bodies. There are so many people who base their abortion concerns off of their religion while completely disregarding the fact that others might not hold those same views. One person may believe that life begins at conception while I believe that life begins at birth, but if that person has more power than me in society, I likely have to follow the rules that they make on the subject. It is an entirely unfair situation to put (mainly) women into and should not be something that the government is concerned with aside from making sure the processes are safe.

In conclusion, more people should learn and take notice into our environment and what could happen if we don't flourish it. I used to not know much about our environment but now since I took the time in getting knowledgeable on it, all I want to do is help out in making this world brighter.There are so many easy ways to become more sustainable. We are all creatures of habit, and changing our behavior takes some time. Small steps are key, and once you find how easy each is, you will be surprised how quickly you can make a positive difference in protecting our environment for your family and the planet."

America is a country known for its equality. The American Dream, while possible dead, is based on the equal opportunity for success and happiness provided to all American citizens. Furthermore, the Declaration of Independence eloquently states that all citizens should have the right to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" In my opinion, it is absurd to refuse a couple the right to happiness due to sexuality. Religious difference is a vital component to the broth in the melting pot that is America. It is preposterous for someone to take offense from someone holding a different believe than themselves. Denying the right to marriage for same-sex couples is in the same boat as denying medical care to someone because they are an Atheist. While some would not equate medical coverage to marriage, both play important roles in a person's happiness and well-being and should thus be treated with the same respect, regardless of what one religion may have to say on the matter. This is especially true since marriage provides not only qualitative benefits, but quantitative as well in the form of tax breaks and additional income. It is unjust to deny these rights to same-sex couples and it goes against what America stands for - freedom and equality. My last point is a bit more of a subjective opinion, but is perhaps the strongest. The hypocrisy in many people wanting to deny same-sex marriage stands in the way over half of marriages are treated today. The divorce rate now stands at over 50%. If over half of marriages are being tossed aside, how can our society really consider marriage sacred in the religious sense anymore?, "

I can see both sides of this argument and have had the opinion of each side at one point or another. Some people think that marriage should be traditional and kept between a man and a woman. Others think that as long as two people love each other, their is no issue why they should get married. This issue seems to be a hot button topic as more and more states legalize gay marriage. It seems to me that eventually states that are opposed to gay marriage will cave in because it is becoming commonly accepted. It's 2014 and I think people are starting to realize how much time and energy we are wasting by focusing on such a silly issue as to whether or not two people can get married or not. Personally, I don't care, gay marriage doesn't bother me at all. Even if it is illegal, people will still be in relationships regardless. I think we need to move on as a country because there are much greater issues we need to deal with like war, the economy, and climate change. Same sex marriage reminds me of the civil rights movement of the 1960's, we look back see how far we have come since then. I think in the future people will view this issue as a no brainer. So in my opinion, yes, same sex couples should be able to marry. , "

We're the ones who have to live on this Earth. It's like our own body, we must take care of it, nurture it, clean it and so on. Recycling is such an easy task and saves so much pollution from being put into our air, water and other places that we live in and around. It helps animals and humans alike. It provides for better use of materials being able to reuse them again.  

I feel this is necessary because like I mentioned before, we're the ones living here and if the human population feels the need to continue reproducing, then we need to make a conscious effort to maintain this planet for our offspring, as well as teach them good habits to maintain it as well. 

Government regulations are necessary, as well, being that the material we utilize everyday that can be recycled must be sorted. These regulations ensure for the most part that all citizens will make it their duty to assist in the separation of material to ensure it's being recycled properly. This will make the recycling process much more efficient and allow more time to be dedicated elsewhere from the workers that are running the recycling plant. "

I like the idea of clean energy.  I think  more of it should be available and used.  Overall, unfortunately, most people are lazy and don't do their part.  It's sad, but true.  I hate to relate it this way, but as a personal trainer and health professional, the idea of laziness is in line with the obesity epidemic.  People won't typically do more than required to survive.  Going above and beyond is a trait found less often amongst our society.  If everyone would pitch in and do their part, perhaps future generations including our kids, grandkids, and their children would have a brighter and healthier future.  I believe tax dollars should be spent to increase overall education regarding these topics.  Education is key to improving the problems we face today.  Many people don't pay attention to their actions and how they effect the rest of us.  Imagine how much pollution would be avoided if just 10% more effort was put in by everyone.  This also leads back to the health discussion.  The obesity, heart disease and diabetes epidemic is completely avoidable.  Two of the leading causes of death in this country could be nearly eradicated if people would simply care.  McDonalds, Taco bell and the like are killing us.  It's easier to find a Big Mac than an apple in our world.  I had a professor that told us he used to visit urban schools to educate the children.  2/3 of the children had never tasted a strawberry.

I also feel that animals are a huge part of the environment and we need to respect and protect them as well. We need to work harder to protect endangered species and even plants for that matter. Clean energy is also very important. Windmills for example are a good idea, but I have read that building and running a windmill can take like 3 life times to actually save money and help make free and clean energy. I believe that government regulations are too strict and that there are too many of them. The government does not need to as involved in our lives as it is and I think that the government should really think more about the environment and less about their paychecks.

The major thing that makes chemical weapons a more potent threat is that they kill indiscriminately and they leave the infrastructure intact. Which means you can clear an entire neighborhood of people you want, but don't have to rebuild anything. Super powers like the United States should hold a firm standing on chemical weapons, but it doesn't necessarily mean we should go to war any time a chemical weapon is used across the globe. Honestly a pinpoint assassination or regime overthrow could easily be worked without all out war. Let other countries know that if they as a leader use chemical weapons... They will personally be killed. There is a large amount of immorality and gray area there, can we kill a leader and just leave a country? Shouldn't we have to help it rebuild, or else it will get into the same issue all over again? You can't make a country be a better country by will.

Well, on the subject of recycling, I never considered it be such a big deal until I arrived at college. Our rooms come with a recycle bin that I never use even when I did have things that needed to be recycled. That was until, one day my friend made the argument that If I can take the steps to throw the garbage in the trash can, then I should be able to put the same amount of energy into putting recyclable items in the recycle bin. I think its important to recycle because it can reduce the amount of plastic bottles and waste that goes into the water supply. I do not think that as a teenage American we take recycling as serious as we should because we have so many different water filtration devices that can remove any waste or toxic things from the water. We we have to remember is that animals do not.   Animals have to live in the water that we dump waste into and they can not leave it without dying. I take this stance and or opinion on recycling because everyone and every living thing deserve the opportunity to live in a clean and safe environment and the only way that is going to happen is if we recycle and keep the land and water clean.

It should be part of our own conscience to recycle, avoid littering, and doing other things that are not an inconvenience to us. Although I am against many governmental regulations in most aspects of my political views, I am not against it when it comes to protecting innocent people. I do believe the government has some responsibility to monitor corporations and other entities' output of pollution in to the environment and even set caps where necessary. I do also think some sorts of incentives, or tax cuts, should be available to companies who provide clean energy. Governmental regulations should never be too big or to specific across the board, but it is necessary to have some set of guidelines in place when it involves the health of the population, as well as the plants and animals within it. Additionally, a large reason why people do not recycle enough is because they see no tangible incentive to do so. While recycling should not be required by law, it would be understandable for the government to again offer a small financial incentive, or tax relief, to households and businesses that reach certain thresholds of recycling. The amount, obviously, must not be too much, because that government spending could be used elsewhere.. I also do not think green initiatives or environmental preservation or restoration is the direct responsibility of the government. Their job is to monitor it, not take charge of it. Studies have shown that it takes over $300 million dollars of government spending on the environment to save money. And studies by the same groups have also shown that approximately every $8-9 million of government spending kills one life indirectly. So the government must way the positives and negatives of environmental policies."

I feel that when the fetus begins to form, it is considered alive, but the first five days that the morning after pill prevents are merely sperm and egg and not actually a life form. These stipulations can account for situations like rape. If the morning after pill is taken then the cells are removed and a baby cannot be conceived. While these are my opinions on abortion that does not mean that I would enforce those beliefs on someone else. I may not think that they have made the correct decision, but I would never think that someone should be imprisoned or punished for making their own decisions.

I am a Christian, but I do not believe that same-sex couples are sinning. I believe love should be between anyone who is in love. Christians are shown in this world that people of same-sex marriage are sinning, and it is wrong. Although I do believe in God, I do not believe everything that organized religion has to say. It is ridiculous that people frown upon people for being different. Homosexuals are obviously like from birth, in my opinion, it is not a learned thing, it just happens. People just fall in love.

If I want to throw my coke bottle away in the trash instead of recycling, that is my choice.  It shouldn't but a forced act, but rather something that is an alternative to the act of throwing something in the trash.  It isn't required to recycle anything, so it is still my choice.

Civilian targets are off-limits. 

     Secondly, I have to condemn President Assad for his use of chemical weapons. They're banned by the U.N. for a very good reason. It doesn't matter if the target is civilian, military, infrastructure, or anything else one might seek to destroy during war. Chemical weapons are not to be used. Obviously it would be preferable that no weapons were used, and that conflicts like this one didn't exist. But since that isn't going to happen, at least boundaries can be set. 

     And third, I have to support the reactions of both President Obama and President Carter. The use of such weapons by any government or faction is not something that should be allowed for any reason, but rushing in without U.N. support is a very bad idea and has gotten the U.S. and its leaders in trouble before.

What surprises me is the fact that scientist and military forces still take interest in the weaponry. Syria should have known that once they fired off the chemical weapon that some other nations would feel endangered and engage them. I guess Syria probably thought that the world had moved on from being bother by chemical weapons since nobody had used any in so long.

I feel like in this situation there really is not right answer. However the way  I feel towards Syria using chemical weapons on their own people is appalling. I don't understand how a government could do such a thing to its' own people. Those are the ones they are supposed to be protecting, but instead they are harming them. I guess this is where I feel like it is the US's duty to step in, because I feel since we are such a strong global power that it is our duty to help and defend those who are fighting for their freedom and cannot defend themselves, such as the people of Syria. Overall I have mixed feelings when it comes to the US dealing with Syria's use of weapons, but as far as them using them on their own people my opinion stand firm. "

It seems that the world has forgotten that our earth is not some large trash can. We have to properly preserve it, and it can be done in so many simple ways. With some research I was able to find out some simple ways to recycle and conserve energy. Some of these ideas include turning off your computer at night, do not rinse your dishes, use both sides of paper, wash clothes in cold or warm water, and pay your bills online. These ideas are so easy to do and can really make a huge difference. I also found some reasons on why we should recycle. These reasons include creating jobs, it is good for our economy, it reduces waste, saves energy and prevents global warming. If everyone did their part in recycling, our world would be such a better place.If we did not recycle the world would be in great danger. Without recycling, there is the risk that our homes and habitats could be destroyed, we may not have any more everyday resources, and people could die of toxic gases and even the horrible stink of trash. The most important reason to recycle is most probably because if people don?t recycle, everyday resources will soon disappear. If everyday resources become scarce, prices for the products would go up."

I was raised in a christian home where same sex marriage is not allowed. I was taught that being gay is like a disease to be ashamed of, and that you are not born that way but instead choose to be that way. I was also raised to believe it goes against the bible and it is also an insult to other people.
As an adult I can see how some people believe they are born gay and that is their only option.But I also think some people choose to become gay because they were abused or a victim of an adult who has emotionally hurt them so bad that they are afraid of the opposite sex intimately so they become gay. I also think these people are weak because they allow an experience to control and run their lives instead of taking control and saying, ""wow, this bad thing happened to be, but guess what, I am alive and have the opportunity to change the world and make a difference by sharing my story and will not let this experience cripple me.""

I think our society allows people to become weak and hide from their fears by avoiding them. Society teaches that if we avoid it it will not happen.  But i also feel that people should do what they want to do and take care of themselves, often referred to as ""you do you"" and as long as I don't see it or hear about it, its okay. This is an example of avoiding gay marriage: by not knowing about it, one can believe that it doesn't happen.

Now lets be real, it happens and Do i think it is a crime? No, but I do think it is a sin-- but I was raised in a christian home where this kind of behavior is not allowed. I was taught that if you were gay you should be ashamed of it and you are choosing to be gay. , "

It is one hundred percent up to the person considering getting an abortion whether or not she can get one. I feel very strongly about this. My reason for this stance is because I believe it is the reasonable stance to take. It is horrifying and ridiculous to force a woman to carry and deliver a baby she has no desire to have, for whatever personal reason that may be. It is not up to me to decide her life for her. There are many legitimate reasons for a woman to have an abortion but people who are ""pro-life"" do not take any of this into consideration. There is a reason that it is called ""pro-choice"" and not ""pro-abortion"". I may not agree one hundred percent on abortions but the fact of the matter is that it is not up to me to decide that, it is up to the woman. If a woman was raped and she wants nothing to do with the baby growing inside of her, then it is her choice to get an abortion. To force that woman to endure nine months of pregnancy with a baby that reminds her every day of her rapist is cruel. I don't understand why people who call themselves pro-life are so quick to defend an unborn fetus but will not stand up and defend the women they are hurting. There are women who would die if they attempted to carry a baby to full term, and yet pro-lifers are trying to tell me that the unborn baby's life is more important than the woman? Who got to decide that? I won't buy any of that. Women have a right to their own bodies., , "

Recycling is a very important thing, whether people realize it or not. Landfills all around the United States are being over filled and are often times completely toxic areas of land that could be used for much greater things than our garbage. A single person can make a large difference just by recycling plastic, glass, cardboard, metal and paper. Clean energy is also very important in today's society. With the amount of energy that people use on a daily average increasing it is essentially important that humans utilize clean energy. Coal and other types of fuel are not only bad for the environment but also for humans. Another thing that would tremendously help the environment is more strict governmental regulations. The government has the authority to issue different rules that will help not only our country, but our entire world. We are constantly putting the place that we call home in danger and ourselves and it can easily be either prevented or slowed down if everyone made a few subtle changes in their daily lives. My reasons for this stance is that I want to be able to grow up and live in the same beautiful world that I thought I was when I was a child, before I realized how much we trash our own environment and other animals environments. Humans take what we have for granted. "

Also, there are many cons to same sex marriages, such as diseases, and population decline. I believe that people have free will, and therefore are entitled to their own opinions, however, i feel uncomfortable with gay marriages. It makes things uncomfortable for me as a woman to see a woman and another woman showing affection towards each other in the sense that a man and woman normally would. I also think it is not beneficial for the (adoptive) children in the homes where there is not a mother and father, but rather, two mothers or two fathers. These kids are subject to different types of ridicule than other children are. It also can cause confusion in the kid as to how a ""normal"" family runs. In my own family, my dad is the main authority. I think it would be hard if I had two moms, or two dads, because of the fact that there would not be a natural authority present. I believe there is a reason that men are men and women are women, and it is a natural way of life to be attracted to members of the opposite sex. If everyone married people of the same sex, eventually, there would not be any more population, because there would be no means of reproduction in our society. However, if things remain as they should, (man and woman) then the population can continue to flourish.    , "

On the other hand we cannot just sit by and let the Syrian government do this to their people. Innocent people should not be dying at the hands of their own government.

My justification for this is because I believe everyone is entitled to equality and fair treatment under the law. However, I disagree with the definition of marriage when used to define a homosexual couple because of the definition of the word. Marriage was a term coined first in 1200 C.E. to describe a contract amongst spouses. Spouse implies the opposite sex of the other, for example if Individual A were male, under the textual definition his spouse would be a female. I have no moral quarry against same sex marriage, just a definitional one. I strongly believe that if a same sex individual makes someone happy then we should not hinder that individual?s pursuit of happiness. This because it does not violate or deface other morals. Thus leading into my counter point to this is, I believe the term ""Same Sex Marriage"" should be coined civil union. Thus alleviating the religious fallout and giving a proper name on this quagmire. Also I do not believe laws should hinder this ability to have a civil union. The separation of church and state is something I see as a positive and would like to keep it that way. , "

This a huge undertaking for many reasons including the number of people that are participating and where all of these resources actually go and end up. One important feature to maintaining an clean environment is recycling. Recycling is everywhere now if its at a local restaurant, school, or public building. Many companies around the world have implemented themselves in reusing resources that we produce and consume in everyday life. Clean energy is making the world not just a cleaner place to live in but also a safer place. With solar panels, we are not having to use of coal and gasoline as much, which can cause pollution. I am not aware of the government regulations on environmentalism, but what I do know is that if everyone takes the time to put a soda can into the recycle bin instead of the trash can or people decide to ride their bikes to work than drive their car, it only helps the environment out a little each day, making our world a safer place for future generations that will soon enter this world. The government should make it mandatory to recycle everywhere around the United States so our prospering country will be a clean as possible. A suggestion might be putting a recycle bin in every home around the country. Gas wise, it is very difficult right now to force people to drive electric cars with the prices these days, but maybe send out a message stating that citizens should walk and ride bikes more to save pollution a bit a time."

I have a couple of reasons why I lean towards pro-life instead of pro-choice, these are my religious point of view, how my parents raised me, and the ethics behind what I believe myself.  First off my religious point of view, I am a Catholic, and in the Catholic Church the majority consensus is that pro-life is right.  It's right because killing a human being (God's people) is considered a sin and is just morally wrong.  Secondly my parents,  they taught me that the killing of someone is a bad thing and they brought me up in an ethically sound family, and that was one of the points taught to me.  Lastly my own Ethics, I believe that it is morally wrong to kill a helpless baby that didn't do anything wrong.  I also think it is ethically wrong, because it is the murder of another human being.  It is just like the holocaust in a sense that you are killing a helpless human being (not just killing, but murdering innocent civilians).  Many people would argue that you are killing someone that isn't even alive yet, but do you really think killing a precious baby is a morally and ethical right thing to do.    The other side would also argue that I have no right to force someone to keep a baby that is unwanted, but I say that the baby is a living thing, and killing a living thing should be killed in cold hearted death.  I want you to imagine something, every single person in the world that has been impactful on the structure of culture and society was alive, they weren't aborted. I say to the people that argue that you can't make up their minds for them, you never know if the baby inside their stomach is the next Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr, or Thomas Jefferson.  You shouldn't just give up on something unwanted, you should try and find the positive out of every single thing in life.  , , "

I should be thinking more about others and the future of the earth if we do not think about environmentalism right now. Recycling is very important to me because I hate to waste. When you waste full plates of food or continue to by everything new it just makes our community/where we live seem more spoiled and selfish. People around the world have little to nothing and here we are wasting. I do not know much on clean energy so I can not speak as to weather or not I am a strong believer for it or against it. Having a clean environment is important for many reasons. One reason being that having a clean environment is much more sanitary and keeps people from getting sick and or injured. Another reason that having a clean environment is important is for image. Walking around with garbage left and right is not the kind of place that I would want to live and be around.

In my own personal opinion, I am indifferent.

While I am not completely for same-sex marriage I do not judge two people of the same sex for being together and loving each other. This is their own personal choice or feeling and I should not have a say in how they decide and wish to live their life. I have family members who are in same-sex marriages and I do not judge them for being together. It does not even seem different for me anymore. I still love them both the same as I would if they were in heterosexual relationships. They have been together for so long that it just seems normal. I could not picture it any other way. While I may not exactly support their relationship, I do not look down on them because of their lifestyle. If they are happy that is what matters. If my own child were to be in a same-sex marriage, I think I would have a very difficult time accepting it at first, but after a while it would just be fine.

I believe that abortion is killing an innocent life, and that is why I do not believe that it is a good solution to an unwanted pregnancy. If you are mature/old enough to be involved in sexual activity, then you are mature/old enough to deal with all possible consequences. Birth control exists for this very reason, and it is selfish to end a life because you do not like the consequences. I understand that it is unfortunate when you take all possible precautions and still end up pregnant, but sometimes unfortunate things happen that are out of our control. For example, you could be a safe driver who follows all traffic laws, but you could still end up getting in an accident even though you are careful. But that doesn't mean you can just avoid the concequences of the accident. As I stated previously, if someone believes they are mature enough to have sex, they are mature enough to deal with the consequences. Many will argue that in cases of rape, abortion should be allowed to not force the victim into having to raise her rapist's child. I do agree that it would be awful for a woman to have to raise her rapist's child, but still don't believe that abortion is the answer. It's still a child, no matter who the father is. If the mother does not want to raise the child, there are other options, like adoption. It would be very difficult to go the 9 months with the constant reminder of the rape, but bad stuff happens to good people all the time, that's just how life works. People have to live with constant reminders of bad events, and while it would be nice to have less reminders of it, killing a baby should not be an option., , "

We had a recycling club and our classes started showing documentaries about solar power and electric cars.  At some point while living with my parents, we were required to start using a separate recycling bin for our trash, even though we had to purchase the bin and pay for the services.  While we generally disagreed with this, I fully support recycling and using clean energy as much as possible.  While I do believe people have a tendency to go overboard with it, it is still a good cause that will help us greatly in the future.  If everyone started separating their garbage from their recycling every day, it would be incredible to see how much we could re-use.  The majority of the things I throw away are plastics, papers, and cans that can all be recycled.  And I am just one person!  I also think finding a different way to power cars will not only keep our environment cleaner, but will be cheaper for us in the future as well.  When people hear ""environmentalist"" they tend to think ""tree hugger"" or something similar, but in reality I just want a better and cleaner future for me and the generations to come."

I do not think it is right for Syria to use chemical weapons, especially on their own people. This is a crime against humanity. I think Syria should be punished for using chemical weapons.

Although I do not like that United States gets involved with other countries affairs, I think if this could potentially be a threat to the U.S. then I do think the U.S. needs to respond with a military move. I would hope the U.S. first tries to solve this issue peacefully by one of the U.S.'s diplomats going to talk to Syrian officials. If this does not work, then I think the U.S. needs to send the U.S. military over to solve this solution in what ever way possible if this is a threat to the safety and security of the U.S. 

U.S. Reaction: I think President Bush was right to not like the president of Syria. He was wise to mistrust him, especially because of the allegiance between Syria and Iran. I know Bush was concerned with the war in Iraq during his time of presidency, but wish he could have done something more to end the war more quickly. Senator McCain's view is understandable;  I agree with him. I am not clear if McCain meant we should do something or only do something if this behavior by Syria continues. The wording, to me, was unclear. I do agree with McCain that the U.S. does need to something because it is not right for Syria to do this and it could be a threat to our safety. Obama seems against anything that may lead to military involvement, so I hope Obama listens to members of other parties such as Senator McCain. "

Also, even though it sounds like horrible reason to get married, married couples do get certain benefits that a single or nonmarried couple would get like tax deductions, being able to claim each other on their insurance, etc.  I believe that they should have those same rights because who are we to judge whether they do not love each other, do not deserve the same respect that a straight couple would, or even in the religious stand point of if they are living in sin because it is not our job to judge them but the Lord's.  I had a gay family member and have always been open minded towards the subject of same sex couples so that heavily influences my attitude and beliefs.  I also grew up in a small, country town that was heavily religious so I was always around the negative view of same sex couples but my mom always taught me and my brother to not judge someone because of who they love, how they look, or what they feel which greatly helped in my views on the subject.  But another reason I am such a strong supporter for same sex couples and marriage is that I have been discriminated against before because I am a woman, and I hate to see or hear about anyone being bullied or discriminated against just because of something so trivial like because of who a person loves or wants to be with., "

Obviously, it is sad for everyone involved and a lot of thought should be put into an action as important as this. On one hand, you have the idea that it is up to mother because it is her body and logically should be her choice. But what would a father think if he wanted his unborn child to be alive? On the other hand we have to think that a life form, no matter how early it has been conceived is still alive. Some people might think that because a fetus isn't fully developed that it doesn't matter because they see it as a cell that's not a developed human being. If abortion is a major issue I think the use of birth control might be effective in eliminating unplanned pregnancies. But what about rape? That's a tricky topic and I still don't know how I feel about it. It seems to me that in 2014, abortion is not a hot button topic like it used to be. I never here anything about it in the news. Personally, I think it would be useless to try and outlaw abortion because people would continue to do it in private and no one would ever know about it. The key seems to be education, if we can teach young people about sex and it's consequences, that might defer some but not all unplanned pregnancies. , , "

If the United States were to act out against Syria's government for this war crime and then find out that the Syrian government was not responsible for the attack, there could be serious repercussions.

Though there are some exceptions for abortion, most of the reasons for it are selfish and unreasonable. Exceptions include: a victim of rape, a child who was not aware of the risks that cannot physically hold a baby, and a person who is at risk of dying while being pregnant. However, most women use abortion, because they are not ready to take on such a time consuming task. Whether it be they are in school or too young, they have no excuse to choose abortion considering they knew the risks of getting pregnant while sexually active. This is not an acceptable form of choice for ""getting rid of a child"". This is a human being we are talking about; not some unimportant lifeless thing. 

Many people consider abortion a way out of their mistakes. They like to take the easy way out out of selfishness, because they are either fearful of what people will think of them, or the father is out of the picture. Either way, a normal, healthy teenager who becomes pregnant needs to face her fears and take on the challenge of having a child. They do not have to raise the child if they feel like it is best for the child, but killing it is just a way for them to get what they want. Wanting something and doing what is morally right are two different things, and a woman, knowing the risks of sexual activity, should own up to the consequences and take a stand. 

There are many creepy people in the world nowadays though that take advantage of young girls, teenagers, or even grown women. Circumstances like this call for abortion if the woman becomes pregnant as a victim of rape. This was something they were not giving consent to, therefore they had no control over whether they would become pregnant or not. Also, if a young child, old enough to be sexually active, becomes pregnant, they should be able to have an abortion if their body cannot physically support a baby. Certain situations place women in awkward positions, but if they did not have a say in what their bodies went through, they should have the choice of what they further allow their bodies to deal with. , , "

He helped make the child so he should also get a say in whether or not she has it, but he should not get final say if she is extremely opposed to having it. I believe this because I dislike the way the Catholic church views abortion as a sin, I wouldn't go so far as to say that. Its a choice, it should be treated like one. 
I also believe that people should not have them unless they really need to. If it will endanger the woman for having it, then she should not have it. If she was raped, then I believe she shouldn't have to have the rape baby. However, I know that most do choose to have the child anyway.  I believe that if you have unprotected sex you should be able to assume the responsibility to have the child that you created. You should be able to take responsibility for what you created.

In my opinion, if everyone did not make such a huge deal about this ""issue"", then it would've just slipped on through unnoticed and everyone would be much happier. However, there are many religions and political views that directly oppose same-sex couples and marriage, and religion and politics are basically what the world runs on. I am well aware that the Bible (in certain versions) goes against homosexuality ""If a man practices homosexuality, having sex with another man as with a woman, both men have committed a detestable act. They must both be put to death, for they are guilty of a capital offense."" - Leviticus 20:13 I also know, however that the bible also states that adults who get a divorce have committed adultery and deserve to be stoned to death, people seem to pay less attention to that verse, don't they?

Just because someone may love another from the same sex, it does not mean they are an awful person. I think I feel uncomfortable about the idea because of the backlash from my community. Same-sex marriage is really looked down upon in my circle, but I still do not think a person should be judged based off of one sin. Another contributing factor for my attitudes on same-sex marriage would come from the state I am from. Down in the south, homosexuality is frowned upon while I think it is more acceptable the further north and west you go. When I think back to middle school, there was a boy that everyone accused of being homosexual because of the way he dressed and talk. The more I relive that, the more disgusting of an act I see it as. He was bullied to the extreme and he eventually had to change schools. He handled it well and is now going to college back home and has a good paying job. An experience like that could have really messed a kid up for a lifetime.

However if, for instance, a recycling bin is given to me in an easy form like the recycling bins in our dorm rooms that I just have to fill up then empty in the trash room, I will take part but other than that I do not go out of my way to be concerned with these issues. Also is the fact that environmentally safe items always seem to cost more money and I like all other college student have an education to pay for. This is also because I feel that those who do concern themselves are working very hard to get nowhere so pretty much what?s the point. They work so hard to have a better world and spend so much of their lives just pushing slightly back on huge oil companies and other things that won?t budge.

The US response is wholly unsurprising given international treaties, and our own interventional tendency after World War II. The news article itself is a bit more interesting, as it is largely egocentric in regards to the US with its only token reaction from a non-US entity being the Pope, but I suppose that is to be expected as the majority of American readers would not recognize, nor care about the opinion of, most foreign officials."

However, I know I am guilty of not making the best decisions when it comes to environmentalism and it is something that I need to work on. If we do not work to improve it, the condition of our planet will only get worse and in the future, the air quality, availability of resources, as well as the overall quality of life will decrease and we should not let that happen. If need be, I feel that the government should be able to regulate issues dealing with environmentalism because it is important and people may not realize it or may just not be concerned. In this day and age, people are so wasteful without even thinking of the effect they could be having in the world. We carelessly throw things away, burn things that are bad for the environment, use huge factories that emit harmful chemicals into the air, and so much more. Some people may not be aware of what they can do about it but really every little bit helps. Just by simply recylcing in your house, you can have a bigger impact than you realize.

Although I am a Christian and there are many religious views against this issue, I believe that we as a society have no right to take someone's freewill away and tell them that they cannot marry the person of their choice based on each person's gender. Everyone should be entitled to make their own choices and I fail to see how allowing same-sex marriage would affect anyone directly and in a negative way. It is not our place to judge someone because of the choices they have made either in their sexuality, the person they choose to marry, or any other aspect of their lives. In the Bible, God allows mankind to have freewill so that they will choose to follow him because they want to. In addition, the most important commandment is about loving God and loving each other. The Bible also states that God is the only judge so we cannot condone another person's actions, whether we believe they are sins or not, because all of us are sinners. With all this in mind, I fail to see how religious viewpoints have any foundation in condemning same-sex marriage. I believe that same-sex marriage should be allowed because everyone is entitled to freewill and equality. No person should judge another simply because they do not hold the same views as that person., "

The United States does have many interests in the region and it is important that stability is reached. But more important than the economic and military interests that the United States has is the irrational and inhumane use of chemical weapons on civilians.

Recycling is not a new concept. In the past it was necessary to survival. People would use things until they were useless. They would reuse things for different purposes. They used all of what they had. It hasn't been until a recent time that this attitude has changed. Along with an attitude of wastefulness has come environmental damage. Clean energy is, again, a new concept. It hasn't been until recent years that the types of energy we use has been so harmful. 200 years ago the only energy used was clean. If our attitudes could just somewhat return to an old way of thinking we might not have the issues we have now. I believe that governmental regulations are necessary to make this change. People won't change unless they are forced to on issues, like this, that dint necessarily affect the individual, but society as a whole. There should be stricter regulations on car emissions, gas mileage that cars must get, and the materials they are made of. Recycling should be regulated and mandated in every city. The government should invest in research on clean energy. I think one of the biggest things is that people are misinformed about environmental issued and the simple ways that they can do a part in reversing the effects of humans on the environment. I believe that it is up to the government to also inform people on these issues. A class should be required for all high school students to take on the environment and the simple things they can do to help. If everyone does a small thing to help with the issue it would have a big impact on the environment."

Using chemical weapons crosses a line. No one can protect themselves from them and most times don't see it coming.

Society as a whole needs to be as green as possible because we only have one world, if we destroy it we dont get another one. We need our environment to thrive because if all of the plants and animals struggle then we will end up struggling also. I believe in this because i was raised in an environmentally friendly family and I agree with how my parents raised me. The world as we know it is suffering from pollution and if the people of the world dont do anything about it soon then the world will suffer some major consequences. I absolutely hate seeing animals and the vegetation of the world suffer because humans do not care about their environment. Animals and plants are absolutely harmless and can not really do anything to defend themselves against this terrible act of pollution that us humans are doing. I think the government is trying to keeps  the United States of America environmental friendly but I honestly believe they need to enforce more rules.

I am a Christian and God says in the Bible it is not ok for a man to lie with another man. I take this very seriously. Its unhealthy and not something people were ""born with"".

We have control over our emotions and even though it may not feel like it we really do. Its a matter of control. So morally I think it is very wrong and do not support it. However in the area of government I think that government should not dictate what marriage entails and that is up to the couple. So government should keep out of that and allow it because it is a right but by no means do I support it. Its really something that should not be mandated in such a strict way by a government who prides itself on freedom. Government should only be involved in legal issues and though you get married under the legal system there isn?t anything that says it has to be a man and a woman. Personally I find it odd but try to be loving to those that are. Although I don?t understand it, that doesn?t mean that they don?t desire the same things I do. To fit in, to belong, and to be loved.

I think it is stupid to think that someone who likes the same sex can change how they feel towards their sexuality. It's not like they woke up one day deciding to be homosexual. That is part of their personality and they should be free to express that through marriage. It's not like there is any thing that could go wrong. Same-sex marriage isn't harmful or morally wrong. Same-sex marriage should be allowed and people should stay out of their business and worry about themselves. The only reason same-sex marriage isn't allowed is because people have religious views against same-sex marriage, but not everyone has those religious views and it's wrong for the government to act upon religious views because america doesn't have a national religion.

And since these products are already made, something must be done with them. Recycling is the obvious answer. If we just threw out plastics into landfills it would sit and do nothing for hundreds of thousands of years, and it might even harm animals which upsets the balance of nature and makes things difficult for everyone. Clean energy- like solar power- is, to my knowledge, actually ready to go whenever and i personally don't understand why everyone isn't using it. it's safe and clean, which means that nobody will get sick or die because of it. As for governmental regulations, endangered species should be protected because a large majority of endangered species are endangered because humans tried to wipe them out. since this is something humans have done, it should be up to humans to protect the last of these endangered species. I believe that if a human caused a problem, a human should be the one to fix it. There's no good to be gotten by just letting things sit, someone should be doing something to fix a problem, it doesn't matter what that problem is.  Plastics were made by humans, so humans should be the one to solve the problems plastic creates. humans damaged the air quality of Earth, humans should be doing something to fix it.

People are becoming more and more accepting of the fact that people are different. This is very similar to the way that the United States treated the African American community in the 1960s. They were oppressed the same way that they gay people are. Ultimately, the only person or people that should make the decision is the same sex couple that is getting married. I feel that people should not be allowed to dictate the details of peoples personal lives. Opposite sex couples split up all the time and many of the same sex couples have been together for years and they cannot get married because the law does not allow. Everyday more and more gay couples can get married freely and states are starting to make same sex marriage legal.

In that case, the mother should be more important than the baby and her life should matter more. On the other hand, I don't think women who just ""do not want the baby"" should have the right to an abortion. Babies are humans at conception and not at birth. From the moment the egg is fertilized, they are a person. If women and men have sex, they should take responsibility for the consequences. Everyone knows that when you have sex, there is a chance of pregnancy. Whether it be adoption or keeping the baby, there are other solutions than abortion. 

In addition, the process of abortion is super cruel. There are so many different procedures women can choose from, especially depending on what term they are in. The process not only hurts the mother, but obviously, it kills the baby as well. The process leaves mutilated baby parts as well as fertility problems for the mother, which sounds disgusting and murderous because it is.

It's an important topic that too often people mock and are quick to dismiss. It's easy to scoff at those who want to protect the environment because the effects on the planet aren't immediately observable; however, I have heard time and time again that our planet is in a dire condition and facing unprecedented damage. I don't believe that it's okay to throw trash wherever you are. I don't believe that cutting down all trees has no consequences for us as humans. And I don't believe that as an intelligent species, we are justified in our gross consumption of what the planet has to offer. In the short time that we have existed, we have hurt the environment more than any other living species in history. I think that it's extremely important for people to be concerned about our environment; so many are willing to take from our planet and convince themselves that Earth will sort things out. But in reality, Earth needs our help. I don't expect everyone to begin recycling or to start planting trees on their property. I simply wish that it was normal for a society to marginalize those that believe we should put into the Earth more than we take out; To simply see those that want a habitable environment for our future generations as people with morals instead of bums. The damage to the Earth is real. The effects may not be as sensationalized as movies like The Day After Tomorrow, but they are serious and need to be addressed."

I feel that abortion is sometimes the easy way out people take just because they messed up in life. The only reason i feel that a women should get an abortion is because she has been rapped and don't want to have to deal with the hurt and pain. Children are a blessing and we need more blessings in this world. My reason i feel so strong with my answer is because many girl in today's society will just have unprotected sex with a lot of guys and once she is pregnant she don't want to have to deal with people looking down on her because she don't know who her baby father is . I also feel that abortion should be taking away because its a lot of women who cant have kids and who would love to adopt an baby  when they are first born , so there is no reason why we should still have abortions pills , some women wish they could carry a baby full term , while somebody that is healthy can carry a baby but whats to get an abortion because of the wrong choices they made. I understand if an women or a child has been raped and wants to get an abortion because if i was in their shoes i would because you would have to live with a child that you didnt want and hate the person who rapped you . That will drive you to take it out on the child , so i feel like if you have been rapped that the only reason why you should get an abortion .

I have always recycled along with my family and encourage others to do the same.  I think we should have more biodegradable products instead of using so much plastic, this would eliminate a lot of unneeded waste in the landfill for those who do not recycle. Clean energy also is vital in order for environment to stay reasonably clean. I believe this because we have to preserve our environment for our future and our children's future as well. Teaching children and showing how to help the environment by recycling, planting trees, car pooling and using less water can make an impact for the future. The conservation of water I feel is also a big concern.  We often waste water without realizing it, showing children what an impact it can make can help them try to conserve and use less water. I feel like educated those of this issue with the environment would help it dramatically. The environment is slowly becoming a victim of society with our new technologies. People need to open up their eyes and look at what they are doing to the beautiful world they live in.  We all need to do our part in preserving what we have left or else we may end up with nothing at all. I hope to see a change in our future where every one will do there part in helping the world which can truly make a big difference.  So let's make a difference!"

I understand that people make mistakes and that people don't want to have to go through the long process of pregnancy when they didn't plan on getting pregnant or whatever reason they may have. But I think abortion should be illegal because in my eyes..you are killing a human being. Some may say it is not alive yet but it is in the process of growing which means that it is alive. If something is growing, it is alive. A plant may not be a human, but it is alive and when you don't feed it then you are killing it. Same with a baby, when you have to do something to your body to stop the growth of what it inside of you, that is killing it. I understand that it may be hard for people in the case of rape of something, but it is better to have the baby and put it up for adoption for someone else to love them than for their life to completely end for no reason when they didn't even have the chance the live. I think that abortion is wrong in every way. It should not be legal because you are killing someone. There are many options for therapy and guidance to help people through times like this. It is sad to see so many cases of abortion especially when I see some people having an abortion just because they didn't like the gender of their baby, or because they messed up and weren't trying to get pregnant. In my eyes, it is your fault that you didn't use protection or you weren't being 100% preventative and you messed up so you should pay the price., , "

If they were to keep that child in any of those instances then their life is already aborted, meaning they have lost the life they could have had if they had not had a child at that time. I don't believe that women should be frivolous with abortion, but most women cannot afford that anyway. I think that people that are ""pro-life"" are generally very religious and very in your face about what they think is right. In the case of abortion there is no murder involved, but say an avoidance of an outcome in which both woman and child would have suffered. Then there is the topic of adoption which most pro-life activists praise. I think adoption is a much worse route for almost everybody involved. The parent(s) will forever be scarred and the child may end up in an orphanage/home. The adoption agency is one of the most corrupt institutions in America and if I had to choose to not bring a life in to the world over any of those options I most definitely would not., , "

In my personal preference i believe that abortion is actually a good thing because it allows for people that may not be able to afford a baby, or that do not want a baby for certain reasons to be able to not have to deal with the crisis so they may live a happy life. It is hard for some people to see that abortion is actually a good thing because they view it as killing a life tat has not had a chance to fight for themselves. My primary reason why I believe that abortion should be allowed in todays world is because it allows people to live their lives as they want to without having to bring a child that needs love and caring. Its hard to raise a child when the family cannot give proper care to the child. I feel as if the world needs to come to a better understanding of why abortion is actually a good thing and why it should not be viewed by people as killing a life. It makes no sense to bring a child into the world that does not have the proper family care that involves things such ass food, time, and money to support the child. This would just bring up the child into a horrible family that should not have the child. A child needs all of these things and a poor family cannot give this too the child. Abortion is a viable option for families that cannot provide the proper care to children or to families that do not want these children because they have more important things to take care of such as school and their social lifes. This is why abortion is a viable option for all., , "

The person or people using the chemicals for weapons are basically saying that they do not care at all what happens to all the innocent people. As long as they get their message across of accomplish their designed task, they are okay with killing people in a horrible manner. Many chemicals do not kill people right away. It would be bad enough if they did, but many times chemicals have long term effects that people have to suffer from before they die. The pain that these people feel must be so great before they are finally blessed with relief in some way. Chemical weaponry is a horrible thing. People fighting with guns and bombs are bad enough. So many are wounded and dead from that alone. When you add in chemical wars the list worsens even more. People should not have to die, but in reality they do. If the simple fact is that in this day and time someone has to die, then at least let them die with dignity and as quickly as possible. Not through suffering. The United States' reaction to wait until further information was given was both good and bad.

I don?t know why recycling is just now becoming popular. We should have been doing it from the get-go. For tons of years we?ve been just dumping trash out in a landfill, when we should have been reusing our resources. We only have a limited amount of resources; why not maximize them? It is extremely wasteful to only use things once. Clean energy is also important, however, I do not have the means to go out and buy an energy efficient car that is better for the environment. Governmental regulations are an absolute must. I know some people believe the government has too much control over our actions but I think when it's in the country's (or in this case) world's best interest, it's okay.

We have began losing allies such as Great Britain due to disagreements with the new administration, which hurts us greatly as far as gaining respect from other countries.  The U.S. used to be the most feared country and the strongest, we are slowly losing both of those attributes.  Because of this decline in worldwide respect, we need to gain back our power to decrease possible threats against national security. It's just that simple, if other leaders know that we will not stand for blatant disregard for human rights, such as in Syria, we decrease our chances in being targeted for future attacks.

You chose to have sex with someone. You know that you have a chance of getting pregnant each and every time you have sex. Abortion is a way of getting out of your responsibilities. People will jump at any chance to shirt their responsibilities if it inconveniences them. People should step up and take responsibility and raise their children to do such. There are some exceptions to every rule. If someone is raped then they shouldn't have to take responsibility for the child as they were not part of the decision making process.

A sin is a sin, and that means that homosexuality is no different then cursing or pre-marital sex. Are there any laws against cursing or pre-marital sex? No, there are not. After all, one's choice to curse or have sex before marriage doesn't really affect any other person. Neither does same-sex marriage, so how does it make sense to have laws banning it? 
The core believe of Christianity is to love one another. There is no way that discriminating against homosexuals and denying them certain rights can be considered ""loving."" There is no reason to treat a fellow human being with hate and discrimination, and to do so only creates more of a problem. If Christians were more accepting toward same-sex marriage, tensions would drop and some of the homosexuality might actually decrease. Same-sex marriage should be legal throughout the United States because it would show that the large majority of Christians in this nation are loving, understanding, non-judgmental people. Accepting homosexuals for who they are, without passing judgment or trying to ""cure"" them, would ease the tensions in our country and perhaps eliminate the negative attitudes toward American Christianity. , "

As a species, we need to protect our home before our resources run out, just like any other kind of biological population. If a pack of wolves eat off all of the ducks in an area, the wolves won't survive because the ducks haven't. If we can't access clean water for example, whether it is all polluted or simply used up, we can't survive either. Humans and everything else on this planet need water. If we destroy everything around us, we essentially destroy ourselves. That's why I believe that we need to replant anything we deforest, have stricter pollution laws, and make an effort to empty landfills and make things that decompose on their own. Let's be natural. 
	If we use biodegradable products, then the landfills that we are so worried about getting rid of wouldn?t be there anyway. There are toxic products buried, leaking their contents into the ground around them. I?m not entirely sure about the statistics, but I know most of our fresh water isn?t available to us because it?s frozen in the polar ice caps (which are melting anyway), and the rest is groundwater. What if the water we are pulling from wells becomes toxic? Seriously. This is all nonsense. People need to throw away their traditional way of thinking and look around them, seeing the trash littering the sides of the road and all of those terrible pictures of animals caught in six-pack containers. If the animals don?t affect humanity, then maybe humanity will. Maybe awareness should be raised by showing just how many chemicals seep into our water supply and from landfills every day, just how many carcinogens there are, before the world begins to see a real issue.
	And to think, now global warming has been a proven phenomenon, and people still don?t see an issue. It appalls me.

Men can marry other men or women can marry other women and their marriage has just as much potential as a heterosexual marriage. I do believe that marriage is a union centered around love. It is something that humans aspire for. I  believe in love. I believe that two people of any gender can fall in love. They deserve to be able to marry each other no matter the circumstance.

This meant that we couldn?t go outside because of the amount of pollution the air was dangerous to our health.  The smog was going to kill us if we spent too much time out in it.  That was over 15 years ago.  To this day, it has only gotten worse and nothing it being done about it.  In fact, it has spread to more cities across the US because of the population and the demand for fossil fuel. 

With that said; I believe that everyone should make a conscious attempt at environmentalism.   We only have one plant that we can live on, and currently we are slowly killing off our resources and eventually our planet.    Without clean energy we are polluting the air that we breathe, without recycling we are wasting valuable land that we can use to benefit our plant, and governmental regulations should be mandatory.  Businesses are only out to make a profit on the cheapest dime, even if it means destroying our planet.  

 If we don?t change our current behaviors then we are going to wipe out our resources, eliminate our planet and the human race.   We as a human race has gotten this far, you?d think we would help protect our most precious resource? earth.

I am not an all-out, go green fanatic however I recycle anything I can and I encourage the people around me to do so as well. The reasoning for this is strictly for the health of our planet. I see the Earth as something we should be taking care since we will be living here for many years on out. However, if we do not take care of the Earth by doing something as simple as recycling, it will go to waste much quicker than normal. Even if you see recycling something as small as a plastic wrapper to be pointless, every little item makes a difference not only to the environment's health but for the animal's health as well. Animals are seriously impacted by items such as the plastic bottle wraps with the handles without society even realizing it.  As far as government involvement in regards to recycling, I think there is more they can do although they do a good job as it is. The city governments do a fine job making sure there are recycling bins and services available to the public, however I think they could emphasis recycling  a little more to the public through PSA's or anything of that sort to make people more aware of it. Even though cities have clubs and fan groups that publicly show their support for recycling, I think if the government would take it a little more serious than the public would too."

I love animals and I'm a vegetarian, so I like helping them in any way that I can and I know recycling helps save lives.  I wish that our government was more environmentally friendly and that as a country we could work harder on solar power energy and wind energy.  I would not say I'm an environmental activist, but when possible I recycle.  I love that Missouri State's campus now has many trash/ recycling receptacles placed all over.  It's especially helpful in the PSU and right outside of class rooms. Honestly, I don't see why more people don't recycle or even make an effort to, it helps the environment and in turn helps us.  Another reason to recycle is to reduce landfills and save energy.  Also, global warming is becoming a huge issue.  A lot of people still don't believe global warming is real or they just don't want to see it because it would mean that they would have to make changes in their daily life.  Large cities like San Diego, New York, Hong Kong, and Tokyo have extremely high pollution rates and this could be due to not recycling or being environmentally conscious.

Every time I drive my car, I'm not constantly worried about how big I'm making my carbon footprint, but I am consciously aware that carpooling is good and when I don't need to drive I should just walk, or take public transportation.  I think it is great that companies are finding ways to reduce their carbon footprint to make for a healthier Earth, I also think that the increase of solar power and wind power is awesome. a factor of nonrenewable resources that I don't really think about too often, but I probably should is oil. When I'm filling up my car I don't think about trying to conserve the amount of gas I use, but frankly I should because it's scary to think that we could use up all of the oil supplies some day. This doesn't directly go with environmentalism, but I think that is disgusting how people treat the earth as their own public trashcan. It's really not that difficult to clean up after yourselves people! It's bad enough that we already have large landfills where our trash goes, but to make roads, parks, rivers, oceans, and beaches your own garbage can is gross and I highly disapprove of people littering.

If there is a situation that causes the pregnancy or birth to be harmful to the mother and/or baby abortion is okay. A mother should not have to be put into harm for the baby if she does not want to, but she should have that choice. A close friend of mine had an abortion due to a condition she had. She was told from a young age that she would never be able to get pregnant and give birth. Last year she got pregnant and the doctor told her that there was a very large chance that out of her and the baby only one would survive. 
	If the pregnancy does not present a threat to the mother or child I do not think it should be okay to have an abortion. If you feel like you are not ready or not able to raise and provide for the child you can put it up for adoption. Couples that are not able to have their own child would provide and give your child a great life. If you do not want to give it up for adoption you can raise the child yourself. Every child or possible child deserves the opportunity to live. You make the choice to be sexually active or not and you know the possible repercussions of this. Whatever happens because of this choice is something you have to live with. 
	Another reason I believe that abortion should not be allowed if it does not put the mother or child in harm is the emotional aspect. Women who have abortions have a large amount of emotional pain to work through after and it is not something you will forget. My friend that received and abortion due to her medical issue suffered from a severe depression afterwards., , "

By recycling, we eliminate a few factors which are a) no plastic ending up in the ocean and fish accidently eat it and die b) the amount of trees that are being cut down will decrease. Clean energy is health and cost effective. It will not cause people to have an increased risks of respiratory issues (i.e. asthma). Clean energy will also save on money. A person's electric bill and gas bill may cost $600. By using energy efficient appliances (i.e washers, dryers, dish washers), one can cut the cost of their bill. People will like to save money anywhere they can. For energy efficient appliances, an excellent brand to use is Energy Star. Governmental regulations I feel are not strict enough. You will see signs saying ""No littering or pay a fine and/or 1 year in jail"" when driving down the street but people are still going to litter. I have been in areas where there was a ""No Littering"" sign and people did not care; they just threw their trash on the ground as if it were a trashcan. I asked myself ""could they have just waited until there was a trashcan near?"" "

I believe that it is unnatural, as man and woman must be together to pro-create. However, the driving force behind my stance is that it is unbiblical.

I do not feel, however, that my views give me the liberty to insult or be to rude to people of opposing viewpoints. All persons deserve respect, and although I would like to be able to share my views with others, I will not force it upon others or be callous enough to call them out (especially in public) on this issue. I also will not protest in public, as it seems to be pointless, unprofessional, and casts a negative glare on the people with the same belief as I. I also believe that the law should prohibit same-sex marriage and that it shouldn't be legally acceptable for/ on various types documentation. I see the country's degradation towards the acceptability of same-sex marriage, and it makes me very sad. It seems to me that our country is more worried about following the current trend than doing what it right. I don't know how many other people feel the way I do, but I hope that any progression of the complete legalism of same- sex marriage is not just halted, but reversed. , "

How are his people behaving to warrant such behavior? Indeed, the article stated that ""innocent men"" are dying, in which case we can assume the worst about Assad's regime, although further research into the actions of these ""innocent men"" may provide reasoning to such behavior, or may be it will not and will prove that the terror and violence Assad inflicts is unnecessary.

Because there is no distinct, legal definition to when the embryo is ""alive"" there is not  a point when we can say that it is dead or being killed.  We are considered dead by a coroner when our heart stops. Therefore, I consider this to be the point when we decide something is alive. Abortion then in my mind would be when we take the child in the womb that has a heartbeat is given a condition in which the heart stops beating. How is less important than what.

A common argument I hear is what about rape. Well I am a victim of rape. I don't think abortion is an answer to getting pregnant from rape. There are tons of people that would love to have children and are incapable. Many of them will even pay all the medical costs to ensure the child is safe during the pregnancy. Give the child for adoption if you don't want it but don't blame the child for what a jerk did to you. 

Another common argument I hear is what if the child has a deformity. 30% of our children have Autism. Millions of children are born with cleft palates. Turns out we have amazing medical science now. If the child has a deformity, how about you do what parents are suppose to do. Take care of your child! They have a deformity, they are hurt you make it better. That is your job as a parent. Don't want that job? Don't become a parent. 

Birth control failure? Okay, that isn't your fault. See the prior rant about adoption. Don't believe in birth control or it is against your religion? Give me a break! Okay so you want to limit me on my nudity despite being pagan and my beliefs being to present myself to the Earth the way Mother Earth presented me but you can have 8 children you don't take care of, raise or teach manners to. You can't feed that many children? Stop sucking up welfare because you can't hold that aspirin between your knees. Use birth control.

I believe that marriage is between a woman and a man, just as God intended it to be.  I do not feel that it is right, or natural, to have sexual relations with someone of the same sex.  God condemns homosexuality, and as a Christian, I believe that as well.  That being said, I believe that God does not condemn the person who identifies as a homosexual, only the actual sin of homosexuality.  The sin of homosexuality is a classic example of the phrase, ""hate the sin, not the sinner.""  I can dislike the lifestyle that a homosexual chooses, but that does not necessarily mean that I dislike the individual.

I feel that by allowing same-sex marriages to occur, we are teaching people that nature doesn't matter, and that the way humans are made is something as insignificant as a speck of dust. Anatomically speaking, a male has his designated sex organs for a reason--to reproduce with a woman.  Men and women are made to fit together. If they weren't, God would not have made them this way.

I applaud people who are trying to legalize same-sex marriage,s for standing up for their beliefs. This is me standing up for mine.  Everyone has a right to their own opinion.  I just happen to disagree with same-sex marriages.

If you have a feeling towards the same sex as you, it is okay to have those feelings, but it's not okay to act upon those actions. God does not hate the gays and doesn?t send them to hell, he just wants them to understand that they cant act upon those feelings. A man and women should be able to get married, not a women and a women and a man and a man. God did not create Adam and Steve, he created Adam and eve. I have lots of friends who are gay and I don't hate them for being gay, I just don't support their decision. God also made a hole for a woman's vagina for a man to use. If God did not want man and women having sex and producing babies, he would have never created that hole. If everyone turned gay for each other, we would not be able to reproduce and our world would become extinct. Yes, I know a gay couple can adopt babies and raise them but it's not the same. Our world today is more accepting of the gays and legalizing gay marriage is becoming more popular all over the world, but it still doesn?t mean its right. I also do not believe that you are born gay. I think that the society that we live in controls how we think and act. If a boy likes playing with Barbie?s and not trucks, that does not mean he is gay. But if our world and society keeps telling this poor innocent kid that he is gay because he plays with Barbie?s or wears pink clothes. Women who play in the NBA or any other sport, are they considered gay because they like to get down and dirty and play basketball? No. I liked playing sports in high school and I wasn?t considered a lesbian, so then why is that little boy who likes to play with Barbie?s gay and will grow up to be gay?  I know that not everyone shares the same feelings that I do, but that okay because we all need to have different opinions about these types of topics.

According to my religion Islam, abortion is unacceptable in any way. It goes against all what Islam stands on which is God and only God has the right to take the life of another human being. In the case of rape as well, the woman had no choice to the appalling act being done to her and would rather continue her life without a constant reminder of that awful incident. Creating a new life is always a blessing and should be a happy memory and should never be taken for granted. I also believe putting up the child up for adoption in the case a woman finds herself pregnant and not wanting it is a far better choice.

Chemical weapons are much different than other kinds because they usually cover big spaces and are uncontrollable, which makes it clear why international laws forbid the use of such things. If Syria makes a point that they used them, without consequence then other war-minded people will see that and think its okay to use them. The problem with this is obvious, if every country that is in a war uses chemical weapons, ranging from small to large, the worlds population will shrink if not disappear due to the casualties involved. I believe that the United States had a right to react to this event, for the reason that it puts our nation in danger.

The only stance I really see against it is the fact that it is against some people?s religion, but the United States of America has no established national religion. There is supposed to be a separation between the church and the state; however, religion ? Christianity specifically ? is so prevalent in American society, that people often assume that Christianity is the national religion.

Same-sex marriage is slowly being allowed in more and more states, but I feel that the fact that it has to be debated is ridiculous. If you do not want same-sex marriage, do not marry someone from the same sex. It is that simple, really. Someone else?s marriage does not directly affect someone else?s life in any way, shape, or form. Stopping someone from getting married simply because of who they are marrying is not right. Allowing a consenting man or woman to marry another consenting person of the same sex will not lead to individuals wanting to marry within the family (marriage between cousins is already legal in over 50% of the states, actually) or for individuals wanting to marry an animal (that would still be illegal, even if it did, because animals are neither consenting nor able to sign a marriage document)., "

I think it is senseless to force a woman to have a baby that: 1) they cannot financially support,  or 2) was conceived as a result of rape, or 3) the child has serious deformities and/or endangers the life of the mother. 

According to a quick Google search, most abortions are performed within the first 12-13 weeks of pregnancy but some states allow up to 24 weeks. I think abortion should be limited to a certain number of weeks into the pregnancy, but I don't know enough about pregnancy to determine just how many weeks it should be. I don't understand how it could take someone six months before they decide that they want an abortion, but I guess it's silly for me to judge without knowing the full circumstances.

Abortion wouldn't even be that big of an issue if we just prevented pregnancy in the first place. I remember in the sixth grade that there was an extra credit assignment for signing an ""abstinence agreement."" I thought that was completely absurd at the time and I still do. I think it's silly to campaign for the full removal of abortion without following up with effective sex-ed (not abstinence).

Regulations keep big corporations from dumping large amounts of harmful chemicals and waste wherever they please without a thought for the surrounding ecosystems.

Clean energy excites me more than recycling.  The idea and execution of solar panels, wind turbines and water mills is just incredible.  We get the energy to live from the environment, why didn?t we think about getting the energy to power our luxury devices from our environment sooner?  If every house and business had its own way to productively make use of the excess energy surrounding it, the world would be a much cleaner, happier place.  Imaging effective solar cars zipping around on the streets.  No more nasty exhaust, and no more need for gas stations on virtually every street corner.

Marriage is no longer an issue solely governed by the Church, when we as a society attach financial benefits (married people have lower tax rates) to marriage, we secularize the issue.  As a secular issue, and a contract between two people (one could go to a judge and be legally married, circumventing the Church entirely), it is unjust and unconstitutional to deny a subsection of the population access to the tangible and financial benefits that have been attached to the institution of marriage.  This iniquity renders claims of religion invalid, as we have made Marriage a secular entity as well.  Despite the aforementioned as a political leaning, dealing with the issue of Same-Sex marriage within the church is vastly different and incredibly more complicated.  So let us step into the realm of theology for a moment, and into a theology that poses a conflict in my mind.  I understand agree with the more conservative, legalistic approach to the issue, if we assume that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, then the entire Bible must be the inspired Word of God.  Therefore we can't pick and choose parts to abide by (though as a culture, we are often guilty of this).  Contrary to that though are the numerous other strictures within Leviticus (the primary text quoted in the Church's crusade against homosexuality), such as a prohibition against wearing clothing made from two-types of cloth (I am as I type this an ""abomination unto God""), as well as prohibitions against pork, and an exhaustive list of rules and regulations to ensure the health and righteousness of the Ancient Israelites.  My beliefs tend to be, that if we acknowledge God as Love, which I do, a God that loves us so much that he gave his Son to die for us, which I do.  And we believe that God desires a relationship with us, a relationship that closely mirrors the marital relationship.  How could we as a community of people who proclaim ourselves Christians, deny a subsection of the population (also equally loved by God) the opportunity to enter into that intimate relationship?  The apostle Paul said that it is better for people to get married than to burn with lust.  How dare we say that God's love isn't good enough for everyone?  However, with all of that said, within the Church, I have no right to entreat for sweeping and universal reforms, regarding the just treatment of others.  Within our government, I have both that right and that responsibility., "

One may believe in God or one may not, irregardless, LIFE is not something that would should take lightly. What if WE would have been aborted? It doesn't matter what stage the baby is in. A baby is a baby, no matter how small. 

It is completely unnecessary especially when adoption is possible. Many women and men are unable to have babies due to fertility reasons, and they are longing for a baby to adopt. I feel that nine months of inconvenience for a mother is completely worth a LIFETIME of existence for another human being. 

There are so many stories and studies done that show women who do have abortions suffer! They think there problems will all go away and they are so, so deceived. They usually regret the decision the next day. And then they suffer from anxiety, guilt, and depression. Some of them even have health complications. They think it will make their relationships and jobs better and it is not true. 

There are plenty of support centers that women can go to and get FREE help. The Pregnancy Care Center is one good example. So if the mom is having any financial trouble or simply needs help finding jobs, they can help women do that. They also have parenting classes for moms and dads! Did I mention it was FREE!? 

I understand that women may not want to have the baby for whatever reason, but the greater good of the baby being born outweighs the baby being aborted. It is absolute murder when a baby is aborted!

Life starts at conception. All of the DNA and chromosomes are in place at conception. In the 5th week of pregnancy, the heart starts beating. And everything with a heartbeat is considered to be alive (animal or human). 
The argument, ""a baby doesn't become a human baby until the second or trimester"" is completely ridiculous. Just because it's the size of a grape doesn't make it any less human than a baby post birth. The ""blob"" of cells are actually cells dividing, causing this ""blob"" to develop into a bigger baby. So at one point, we were all a ""blob"" but that is completely normal. If the fetus is really just a bunch of cells, one has to define when life does start. 
It should also be noted that women who have received abortions usually become depressed, anxious, and guilt-ridden later on in their lives. Also, complications and fertility issues in later pregnancies typically occur. 
During the abortion process, the abortion doctor uses forceps, chemicals or some other device to crush, burn, etc. the baby. There are video footage of the ""blob of cells"" moving away in pain, and trying to escape the device. 
The main reason why women get abortions is usually for the sake of convenience. People should exercise responsibility when having sex, and if an accidental pregnancy happens, it is never the baby's fault -it's always the couple's fault for not using good protection or not abstaining from sex. In cases of rape, it is a terrible experience, but again -it's not the baby's fault. If anything, put the baby up for adoption -but there is never a reason to kill it. 
In cases of a baby with a disability, it is very difficult on a family, but every married couple before they have children should discuss what happens in the case of a disabled child. If one allows the birth of a normal child, but aborts a disabled child, that is like saying the disabled child is not as important or valuable as the normal child. So what happens to the saying ""everyone is priceless?"" 
In conclusion, I believe that abortion is wrong because life begins at conception, and every life is valuable. If (and when) accidents do happen, it is never the child's fault. It is time to be responsible for our actions. , , "

I am not one that stands pro-abortion, because I feel that once there is a chance of having a pregnancy it is wrong to stop it.

If my baby was dead inside of me, I would feel the need to remove it but this is still considered abortion. This example may not be the same kind of thing as what abortion is usually thought of as. But I think that once the egg and the sperm meet there is a chance of life and I think its only right and moral to keep the fetus and not extinguish it. I don't necessarily judge people that are pro-abortion, but it isn't something I could ever do nor would support others to do. I see this argument as being unjust because in majority of cases it was a choice to have sex, and to me it seems like pregnancy is something that can be prevented if you don't want to have a child. The reason for birth control and condoms and things like that are for the prevention of pregnancy!! Although birth control may be a totally different issue it is still one thing that can be used so that abortion doesn't have to exist. The struggle and argument that most people make is about rape babies. This is a tough subject to approach, because this topic makes the abortion way harder to figure out.

The first of these is last names. In the case of a man and a woman getting married, both the man and woman take the family name of the man. Children of this couple also take the man's last name. In the case of same-sex marriages though the many couples keep their original last names. The next difference is that fact that opposite-sex marriages have the ability to reproduction. While a same-sex couple can adopt children they cannot actually have them, unless a female same-sex couple gets medical assistance. Also right now there are many issues that same-sex marriages face in the state governments. Some states have allowed same-sex marriages while others do not. This has created many legal problems in our court systems. Besides these three reasons I also have my religious beliefs that are against same-sex marriage. While I am personally against same-sex marriage, I won't force my beliefs on others. I feel like forcing my beliefs on other is not an ethical practice.

This did cross a red line I believe, and there should be consequences for those who used and ordered chemical warfare. On the other hand I believe that the United States is taking safe measures regarding this incident. I feel that the UN should investigate the whole situation before any allies or helping country's enter this problem. I do not think the United states should just jump into all of the worlds problems, but if innocent civilians are in danger then action is necessary. So in the end I agree with Former President Carter and President Obama on their reactions and believe we give other country's hope and justice. "

I think it all depends on the situation and I think the woman has a right to choose what to do with her body. There are certain cases where an abortion may be the smartest choice for example a 14 year old who is raped by her father? Having to see a product of a memory that girl would like to forget would affect the girl and the child. 
I think the baby should grow into the stages where it is a human. If it is still not developed I believe it is okay. Especially if the child will be growing in a unsafe or unhealthy environment with for example unfit parents who are not ready for a child. Adoption can be a smart solution but there are many children who do not get adopted and spend their lives in fosters home, etc. However, I don't like to speak about this issue because I have not fully had to experience it. It's very easy for total strangers to tell you that having an abortion is wrong or right, and it's ok for them to feel that way. But no one should make that decision for someone else. Having an abortion is never a easy decision. And no one should try to force a big decision on someone based on their religious, economic, or social views.

If two people are happy together, why take that away? That is like taking away somebody's best friend just because you don't like it. I don't have anything against gay/lesbian people and I don't believe they should be scrutinized for finding someone in this unfriendly world that they want to be with forever. Every person on this earth deserves to have someone. Nobody wants to be alone. I honestly believe if everyone would just look past the sexuality aspect and just look at people for how they are as a person, this world would be a whole lot better.
Discriminating against homosexuals seems to be a modern version of the issues white Americans had with African Americans years ago. Disliking someone purely based on their beliefs/sexuality is right along the lines of racism. The only difference is the term ""negro"" is switched out with ""homo."" It is very disappointing that as Americans we haven't gotten over the fact that even if a person is different from you, that person is still a PERSON. Being gay, black, white, tall, short, ugly, fat, skinny, etc, doesn't change the human aspect whatsoever. People are people and we all need to understand our differences and overcome them in order to make a better world in which we live., "

I try to recycle when I can but I do not make it a high priority or even a priority. The school has trash cans and they have recycling bins too. My roommates and friends use the recycling bins often but I never think about it. If I am in the hall way or something that has a recycle bin around then I will probably throw plastic in the plastic bin but if the trash can is closer than then the recycle bin,  I will most likely use the trash can instead. I do not really think about it as being a big deal because I am use to throwing things away but I know other people do and wouldn?t be very happy with me. 
Clean Energy is important because sooner or later we are going to run out of the things we use for energy now. Using those tall white windmills that spin when the wind is blowing is a good idea because there will always be wind and we are not harming anything by making a windmill spin. Also the solar panels are good too. If they were not so expensive and they were more affordable I feel like more people would buy them and use them instead of the normal ways everyone gets electricity.

The fact that the government is regulating who can get married and who can't is kind of disgusting. Marriage is kind of religious, and therefore should not be a matter of the government. Also, I don't understand why people feel the need to interfere in other people's live, by allowing gay marriage it isn't hurting anybody. Marriages cost a lot of money as well, so getting that money into circulation helps the economy and also helps out all of the businesses that are associated with weddings. Adopting children is also easier when a person is married because then the adoption agency will see that the couple is really committed and the child has a better chance of living in a good home. The reason for my stance on this topic is that I have many gay friends and I know that if I ever wanted to marry somebody and they happened to be the same gender as me, than I would want that right. I also have an aunt that was bisexual and if she would have continued on dating her girlfriend, than I would have wanted them to have the right to be able to get married. , "

On one hand that is wise of them to be heisted before getting involve once more in another counties business after we have been in a war for over ten years when we when in to fix another country problem after they posed a security risk to the U.S. However, not taking action when numerous others lives are at stake daily is the wrong answer.

Therefore if both parties in the U.S. can agree that action should be taken then it should happen as soon as possible to not risk more innocent lives lost.

I do not think that the government should be making requirements and rules regarding environmental practices.  That should be up to each individual to make their choice.  I'm not a huge fan of the new light bulbs that replaced the classic incandescent bulbs.  In my opinion, there are too many risks associated with the contents of these new bulbs.  I don't care that they are cheaper in the long run or supposedly ""greener"".  What I care about is the fact that I would have to call a hazmat team if one of them broke and the contents spilled out.  Is there anything wrong with these bulbs being sold?  Not really, AS LONG AS classic incandescent bulbs are an option too.  People should be able to pick which type of bulb they feel is best for them.  I don't like the fact that the new bulbs are the only bulbs being sold now- I would much rather use old incandescent bulbs.

Upon getting to the part about Syria interfering with the United States' war in Iraq, it made more sense. However, I feel as if the war in Iraq was a huge mistake anyway, because the man who ordered the attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon was a Saudi Arabian that they later found being housed in Pakistan. Saddam Hussein and Iraq didn't have anything to do (as far as I know, I could be very mistaken) with 9/11. I'm not sure why America's leaders are concerned with Syria right now, as America has plenty of domestic issues that need to be solved, because as far as I can see, America shouldn't have a dog in this fight. Of course, I say ""shouldn't"" the way things ""should"" be and the way things are, are often two very different things. So in order for me to make a good judgment on the way this situation has been handled, I'm going to need more background information as to why we were even in Iraq in the first place, and why we care about Syria other than them interfering with the War in Iraq. Although I disagree with the use of chemical weapons on your people, if that is the case, I would like to know his reasoning behind it. If he is just crazy and likes hurting people, I still don't see why that is America's problem. I know as the most powerful country in the world, many people feel as if we need to step in where there are people being suppressed, but that is the reason why the people over there hate us so much.

Still, we have many years to make up for the poor decisions that humans ignorantly made for many  years in the past. There are many things we did not know hurt the environment until more recently in human history. The active role people are taking to increase awareness and action is beginning to make some big progress. 
My hope is that eventually the ""green"" path is the less expensive one to take. I, for one, would love to have things like solar panels for my house or a more environmentally friendly vehicle, but the fact that these resources are relatively new and still not majorly owned by individuals makes it rather expensive. It is unfair to ask people to purchase and utilize these items if they are above a comfortable price range for their budget. It is up to businesses take the immediate initiative to increase the use of renewable resources, eventually causing a trickle effect, until the supply and demand of the objects decreases their value. Though their monetary value will decrease, their functional value will remain high.
If said resources do take off, the effort to be environmentally friendly will increase, causing our use of resources to be exponentially more efficient. We are well on our way to that point. I believe that this process will occur, it will just take some time for it to fully circulate. For now, I will stick to the good old act of recycling and hope that one day I can take bigger action on a daily basis."

Although, I do not believe that it is the biggest issue that our government has to deal with at the moment, but as far as if we should care about our environment, yes. Our children and grandchildren won?t be able to breathe if we keep polluting the air. Not only is it creating problems with our air, but also with the atmosphere. We need protection from the sun?s harmful rays, and we are attacking the very thing that is protecting us from this. We have simple steps that we can take to eliminate this, but Americans alone cannot make restrictions enough to solve this problem. It is an issue, but we need everyone in the world to be fixing it not just us. How are we supposed to make all the other countries in the world obey our requests without having a major war? How do we expect china to stop some of their factories and lose money without forcing them to? American government may be strong, but it isn?t our place to make other countries do things, especially when we don?t have everything fixed at home. Maybe we could regulate some of this issue at home though, but where is the funding coming from to fix everything? American tax payers can?t afford to convert everything. I think what we have right now will have to due until it becomes a more pressing issue. Right now I believe that fixing our economy should be our main focus as well as dealing with the ?wars? we already have in place"

I do not know why societies deem these necessary other than they can be cheaply made any can be used as a fear factor to keep the local populace from rising up against them.

So I see people who struggle with same sex attraction as a sin that needs to be overcome, which can only be done with the help of God. People who actually follow through with this sin of attraction and get married is still just a sin. I am never rude or judging of anyone that is married to someone of the same sex, since I sin just as much as they do, but in different ways. I think that a lot of people think we try to condemn the person, but it's nothing against the person, it's the behavior being portrayed. Also, I that in no way shape or form was same-sex marriage wanted by our founding fathers in the constitution. Of course the argument to that is that ""times are changing"" and we must adapt to the culture we're becoming. However, I think it is going to eventually lead to destruction. It is turning a moral wrong into a civil right. Same-sex marriage denies someone either a father or a mother. Maybe I am bias, because I was raised with both a father and mother, but I have learned so much from having both, that I wouldn't want it any other way. , "

I believe that a man and women should be the way people are but for what ever reason, Some people prefer the same sex. What if it was wrong for men and women to be together? How would we want to be treated?Those who are straight would then be looked at like gays. Most people say it's because they cant regenerate. What about the men and women that can't have kids because they are inferential Should we tell them they are an abomination to God or whatever. No they can't control the fact that they were having premarital sex and were on birth control so long that it made them inferential, just as much as having feelings for the the same sex is not gays fault. Honestly, I don't know why it's such a big deal. God did say that a man should lie with a women or whatever but He also gave us free will for a reason and by not letting same-sex marriage. people are hindering the free will and the right to pursue happiness. I was raised in a baptist home, and my parents best friends are a gays. They don't tell them they are wrong but simply be their friend. Most people believe that it's so weird when teens get curious, It's going to happen. Also, parents, why is it so bad for your kid to be gay? He/She is still you kid. Does it really matter that much who they love? It does not change the person. People have such a strong bias on what their children can watch because it make gay look okay. What is wrong with that? Sponge bob does not run around shouting I'm gay the last time i watched that show. He simply has a best friend that happens to be a guy and they say that they love each other. Yet he also says he loves you to Sandy who is a girl. I guess I must have missed something. My point is kids need to know its there regardless if you believe in it or not and if you are that afraid of you kid being gay, don't have kids. More so if you think you are going to love them less. Gay or not that kid needs parents there to support them. Probably more if they are gay because they need the support they are not getting from the other people because so many people are going to look at them the same way I did when I was younger., "

Saying this, I do not particularly enjoy seeing people of the same sex engaging in public displays of affection, but for that matter, I don?t enjoy it with two opposite sexes either. Not allowing same-sex marriage is against human?s civil rights and is discrimination. I come from a religious background, and I was taught that marriage is between a man and a woman, but with the bible I was also taught to love my neighbors as myself.

But this issue is one I honestly can not take an extremely strong stance on. Simply put: I just don't know. Early pregnancy termination is not murder; of this I am sure. Thus, women should certainly have access to it. But many people who care strongly about women's rights want unfettered access to abortion at any stage in pregnancy. THAT is not is not a decision I feel I can take lightly. The equality-minded person in me says if men gave birth to children, abortion would be a constitutionally-enshrined right, as so many people want it to be for women. I can say this for absolute certain: those who preach about 'personal responsibility' have not a moral leg to stand on. 

Thus, my attitudes toward abortion can be stated thusly: I feel women should have access to it. There are innumerable health-concerns to consider, as well as the sovereignty women should be afforded to make their own choices about their own body.

Referencing to the Bible, God created a man and a woman, Adam and Eve. There is a reason there are MEN and WOMEN and they marry the opposite sex. The Bible states that it is a sin to be gay and gay is wrong and will not be supported but will be understood and not have excuses made and I back that completely. I feel that females should not be married to other females and males should not be with other males. It is disturbing and flat out disgusting. I don't want to see gay couples when I'm enjoying my lunch and I don't want to hear about it. Although it is becoming a more socially acceptable situation, I think it should still be banned and illegal. It just is not right.

One reason I believe this is because they are marriages between two people, not between two people and the rest of the world. Which is the same as a marriage between a straight couple, a marriage between two people. If a person is not the one personally entering into a union with someone who is gay, then it is not their problem.  Also, we have a constitutional right to the pursuit of happiness. As long as their marriage is not causing harm to others, then it is perfectly acceptable. Likewise, if a straight couple's marriage causes harm to others, I would not support it. Another point, those who are gay cannot have children unless through adoption or surrogacy. Homosexual people are not giving birth to more homosexual people, straight people are. The final reason I believe this is that we are all people, all human beings created the same. Each person is equal, with equal rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  To me, that means if one person is allowed to marry someone else then another person should not be kept from doing that for reasons so insignificant as gender. , "

I think people put themselves in business they don't belong in. How is it affecting them at all? Why would people not want their fellow citizens to be happy? Not letting homosexuals get married is basically saying it is completely fine to discriminate against them and not give them equal treatment. A lot of people argue that the Bible clearly says man and woman. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that marrying someone of the same sex is a sin. People need to separate church and state and just quit caring. To those people I would say to let other people do what makes them happy, and worry about yourself. They need to put themselves in the shoes of those who are homosexual. They have probably been ridiculed all of their lives and have always felt like they are unwanted.

To explain, love is not wrong.  We as humans were created to love all things and people around us, but it is very clear in multiple passages of Bible that people of he same gender are not to be intimate with each other.  A good thing that I must admit comes from same-sex relationships is that more children are adopted due to the fact that conception is impossible between the couple, but doesn't that also add to the case of same-sex marriage being wrong?  The relationship is unable to expand biologically without assistance from others.  The children whom are adopted by same-sex couples do have the same chances of experiencing love that children of heterosexual couples do, but whether there is love or not, children were intended to be raised by a father and a mother. In saying all this, it is important to mention that simply disagreeing with same-sex relationships does not mean I condemn those who do condone them or practice same-sex relations themselves.  We are all people with different lives, views and understandings, and we all deserve to be loved the same.  God loves all those on the earth no matter the sin, we should do our best to do the same.  , "

In regards to the most basic of environmental problems is recycling.  Recycling is very important in society and the world because it allows people a way to help the environment in a simple way of getting rid of the level of waste.  When a person recycles they are helping not only remove that waste but save cost on things such as paper or plastic.  But there are many other ways to practice environmentalism like using clean energy.  Clean energy is one of the most important practices of environmentalism because it helps reduce pollution in our atmosphere which is important whether one believes it to be helping decrease the risk of the destruction of our ozone layer or simply because of the effects it can have on the health of the people living with or in a city that has an abundance of gas fumes in the air.  The main reasoning I have to explain my stance on environmentalism is that it does help our society become aware of problems that if not talked and solved now could lead to very dangerous risks and problems in the future."

Because of all of the attention that same-sex marriage is getting makes people think that is isn't as bad as it is brought out to be. People can see it everywhere they go, so the more they see or hear about it, the more they become accustomed to it and think nothing of it. I was born and raised in a catholic household so I get my views of same-sex marriage from my religion. My religion teaches people that same-sex marriage is bad and it goes against our values. I think that humans were made in this world to like someone of the opposite sex, not the same sex. I know people say to do whatever makes you happy no matter what others say or think about you, but im not one to approve of two people of the same sex marrying because it is what makes them happy.

On one hand I think the woman's right to choose is important.  However, in this day and age with the options available for contraception or even the morning after pill there is no reason unplanned pregnancies should happen (with the exception of rape of course).  I am also concerned with the rights of the unborn baby.  My personal definition is that if there is a heart beat it's a life and why would one person's rights supersede another's.  
I have a neurological condition that causes debilitating pain.  The medications for my condition would cause birth defects and I simply can not forgo my medication.  My husband I take precautions however my medication can also reduce the effectiveness of birth control.  We have plans for my husband to have a vasectomy but in the interim if I were to become pregnant I would be very upset for the government to tell me what I could or could not do regarding my health.  
There is of course the issue of rape and incest.  I can?t fathom telling someone who has lived through such a terrible ordeal that they must give birth to the rapist?s child as well. 
I recall when I was pregnant with my daughter (before I was diagnosed with my neurological condition) and receiving an ultrasound very early on.  I could not only see her heart beat but she was literally doing summersaults.  They had difficulty measuring her because she wouldn?t sit still.  Now that she is 5 I believe that was part of her personality already shining through.  The teachers at school call her Tiger because she?s so bouncy.  I couldn?t imagine her right to live not being respected.  
I don't have a definitive answer as to if I am for or against abortion.  It?s a difficult multifaceted issue.  Ultimately the best balance in my eyes is to allow abortion throughout the 1st trimester but not beyond. At some point we have to take responsibility for our actions.  If you don?t use protection and you don?t get an abortion during the first trimester at that point your inaction has made the decision for you.  You have to at some point be capable for your actions.

We are in an age where this is a good way to move forward into the future and create a cleaner more sustainable planet. The short term gain does not outweigh the long term effect. It may for the individual in some cases but to consider the effects it has will definitely increase the awareness of most people. I tend to forget about recycling myself but I really wish that more people were aware of ways to recycle and it was much more of a common practice. The government in my hometown of Baton Rouge, LA is a place that does get ample opportunity to recycle but I'm not sure if the city follows through on their end or not. I really hope that they do because it basically a promise they have made to themselves and most importantly its citizens. It?s their responsibility to provide a safe and clean environment for its inhabitants and they should be doing absolutely whatever it takes to do so. Recycling and clean energy could change the world. Without a clean world we could not live much longer than we do and at some point our society will start to fall out and many things in our eco-environment would start to go absolutely wrong. We cannot allow it do so and let our planet become a huge dumpster. It may not be an extremely fast process of cleaning up the planet but at least attempting to do something could definitely change the game into the future if the awareness and action continued to increase.

As the slogan goes, love is love; it doesn't matter if it's between a male and a female, or two males, or two females. the only reason same-sex marriage is banned in certain states is because of radical religious groups, i.e. Westboro Baptist Church, who whole-heartedly believe it's a sin and should not be allowed. I was raised a conservative Christian, so I can understand where these claims are coming from, although I don't have the same views on it myself. The Bible has been proven time and again to have multiple different meanings, depending on how people interpret it. But the first thing you're taught in Sunday school is God loves everyone, no matter what, and people should not judge others and treat them like you would want to be treated. So it boggles my mind how some people can contribute and spread so much hate to same-sex couples, literally defying the main principle of Christianity, and call themselves Christians.

I believe the debate is very generational though. Most of the people I've talked to who are around my age have no problem with same-sex marriage. I have no exact data to back this up, but most of the people who you see protesting it look to be in the 30+ age range. I think this is because of how people were raised. For example, in the civil rights era, the adults of that generation were raised to look a certain way at social order, which wasn't questioned when they were growing up. Therefore, they inherited their prejudiced ways from the generations behind them. Today, we look at them as being very prejudiced and discriminatory people. I think it's the same with same-sex marriage today, and years down the road people will look at same-sex marriage protesters as being very prejudiced people., "

I think all womens should have the right of abortion before the fetus is created. When you have a little kid inside your body it is sad to let him die, and lose a life. If a teenager get pregnant and wants to abort, she should do it, just because of her happiness and because she's too young to take care of a child, but if she's decided to go on with it, no problem. The fact is that if, after a few weeks, the fetus has been created and there's a life inside your body, one should not abort and should have thought about that before, not now, in the point of killing a life. Besides this, abortion implies a mental component because you have to be prepared of the fact that some human person would have had the possibility of living a life and you have delete that possibility.
All in all, I believe that abortion is a difficult matter that depends on each culture, nation and political issues of each territory. People take different positions in relation to this topic but I really think that it shouldn't be banned, just because people has to live their life happy, and if they want to abort, they should do it, but first, be firm in your decisions and not regret about them.

It was never one of those issues that caught my attention. Now that I am thinking about it I can see the issue. Being environmentally friendly is really important to the earth and to us.  Without clean energy and recycling we wont be able to preserve the earths? ecosystem. Environmentalism is there to help us protect the earth for further generations. We want people after us to be able to see the earth as we see it. As a population, we need to make sure that we leave the earth in better condition than we found it. 
Recycling is a very important concept in environmentalism. Recycling does a lot of things that help the earth. It saves energy and prevents pollution and helps conserve natural resources.  It also decreases greenhouse gases, which help contribute to global warming. I think that recycling is an easy way that everyone can help out the earth. It only takes two extra seconds to put something in a recycling bin. Recycling shouldn?t be something that people think isn?t important in the long run. Recycling things now can help the earth and the people living on the earth in the future. Without us helping to save the earth, it wont be here to use for the future generations. 
Clean energy is another thing that environmentalism is trying to preserve. The need for clean energy and clean air is sentential. Every time I go to St Louis I can smell the air outside and it doesn?t smell clean at all. The air that some factories produce does not help the environment. There is many ways to use clean energy and reduce the energy that you use everyday. Switching light bulbs is an easy and fast way to conserve energy. Using florescent light bulbs compared to regular ones can help save energy.  Turning down your water heater to warm instead of hot is also an easy and fast way to make sure you?re helping conserve energy. I think that using clean energy and preserving the energy we do have is an important component in making sure the earth is in a good place. If you only take out a small amount of time out of your day, you can make sure that you are helping conserve the earth. 
I never thought about environmentalism being a big deal because I was always thinking about the issues that were going on in the foreground. I guess it doesn?t take long to look in the background at the long running issues that can affect the earth down the road. I think environmentalism is an easy thing to do and everyone can take a small amount of their day to help preserve our earth.

From what I have read I understand that Syria is using chemical weapons on their own people and obviously that is frowned upon.

I'm not sure how the army/military would be able to handle this or what rights they have to put a stop to this particular situation. Sounds to me like the United States wants allies to join in to help ""fight the cause"" and attempt to put an end to Syria's leader al-Assad or whatever. Which is understand able I suppose, but what are they supposed to really do? invade the country and kill the guy? Aren't we already over there fighting for whatever reason? I honestly have no idea why we have troops out fighting in a war, I've been blind to the whole conflict ever since 9/11 terrorist attacks. I know ""what"" happened, but have no idea why. Also, didn't we find and kill some other guy too shortly after Barack Obama went into office?  Sounds like good news for the United States, but apparently we're still fighting so I guess that didn't solve the conflict. I definitely think the conflicts and reasons for war should be explained on the news or the internet so people like me who have zero clue can have opinions or AT LEAST insight on these war-related conflicts and not be so oblivious. All in all, I don't really know what can be done about the chemical warfare.. it's not like a leader of a completely different country can have any terrible repercussions unless ALL other countries come to some sort of agreement that chemical weapons are not to be used flat out. Even then, who's going to be the one to monitor this and who would be able to keep that type of situation under control if someone were to disagree? That's my two cents."

It is no different than a heterosexual marriage. I do not think someone should be told who or who they cannot love. I do realize most of the laws made were religious based however if there should be a separation between church and state, states should not define marriage ""between a man and a woman"". Honestly I am not quite sure why people care so much on the topic. Why does it matter to you what other people do sexually or who they decide to love. I truly believe that people are born gay. Even with toddlers you can see more ""feminine"" traits or such. On the religious side of the topic I do not think same-sex relationships are an abomination. If you are the type of person that believes God does everything for a reason then wouldn't that mean that God made that person gay? There was actually a study in mountain voles where they are monogamous, they normally have one mate their entire lives. Well once a specific receptor in the brain was blocked they became very promiscuous and even courted voles of the same sex. So can that be said about humans as well? If that is true than what is the difference between homosexuality and say down syndrome or even depression. But the public and religious groups have made such a big deal about the idea of giving same-sex couples the same ""benefits"" of a man-woman couple such a controversy nothing can be researched or questioned about the topic. It seems that you are either for or against it. There is no grey area. However in the real world there is a grey area. A pretty damn big one actually. But people are too absorbed in their homophobia to consider the other answers. , "

First being that recycling and reusing items cuts down on harmful waste that would go into the landfill.  These landfills Emit harmful gases that affect the environment, not to mention they take up copious amounts of land that could be used elsewhere.  Also, recycling cuts down on the need for our raw materials such as (coal, trees, etc.).   Eventually our nonrenewable resources will be depleted.  Trees provide oxygen for humans, with out that we can not survive.  Lastly, the use of clean energy and recycling may save you money in the long run.  Setting up your home with solar panels is very expensive initially; however, the cost quickly pays for its self when you are able to breeze through months without paying an electric bill.  
It's important to note that recycling not only helps out the environment, but your pocket, too.  Landfills are regulated by the United States government.  If a states landfill surpasses the set limitations, they will enforce a tax that is pushed onto the citizens of that state.  So, less waste equals more money.   
All of that being said, trash helps create jobs.  Men and women who pick up trash/ drive garbage trucks or work in the landfill make a living off of others trash.

Abortion is taking a human life, that is a fact and that is wrong. However, certain tragedies such as rape do happen, and too frequently for comfort. So I believe that in order to compromise abortion should only be legal within the first month/ couple months of becoming pregnant. In my opinion, this covers both pro-life and pro-choice. Because while it is still a child, in the first couple of months the embryo is unable to smile, move it's fingers and toes, etc.. Once a baby gets to this point in their growth, it is wrong to take their life. With this put in play, America can expect to see a lot less unwanted pregnancies for woman who have been raped, or young girls. This may even decrease the amount of children in orphanages across America. Along with these abortion laws set, It would be wise for America to thoroughly stress the importance of safe sex, and the real consequences of teen pregnancy. While in high school, girls should be strongly recommended to take a course on being safe with sex, as well as a self defense course training them to know what to do if they are attacked. I have taken the SHARP (sexual harassment and rape prevention) course and I now feel fully equipped to protect myself, and avoid rape and/or unwanted pregnancy. , , "

It takes very little extra effort to separate recyclable materials from compostable trash, and it makes a measureable difference in both landfill space and oceanic cleanliness.  I personally recycle through my trash hauling company, and they don't even ask me to separate paper, plastic, cardboard, and metal.  Green energy sources seem to be the next major trend, as Germany has very recently pledged to eliminate older ""dirty"" technology and has accomplished near complete success over the course of just a few years.  Many noted investors chose this very week to begin selling off their fossil fuel investments and reinvest in future energy technologies.  I feel the United States has really taken a weak role on this issue, as we have the wind and the desert space to power everything with a relatively modest investment.

If you find the one person you want to spend the rest of your life with, you should be able to marry them and have the same rights as any other couple. This applies to a man and a woman, two men, two women, and any other combination of sexes and genders. Same-sex relationships are not a new thing, either. I think it is past time for all love to be treated equally.

I believe that gender does not play a big part in physical and emotional attraction since I am personally demisexual and need to first form an emotional bond with a future partner before committing myself to a relationship. It is very hard for me to be civil to anyone who is aggressively intolerant with non-traditional sexual orientations and actively protests same sex marriage.   
      Sexuality is a deeply personal experience and the views of people and the society whether religious or moral should not impede on the sexual preference of individuals. I understand why religious sects would frown upon same sex marriage because the system of marriage in most religions is sacred to a man and woman but in this modern society, one can get married in the courthouse. So why have a problem if the ceremony is being held in a state building and not a church? I honestly cannot comprehend why an act of love and commitment should be considered illegal and disgusting when acts of violence demonstrated in war times are revered.  
      Overall, I want the option to make a lifelong commitment to someone regardless of their gender because it should be my legal right to do so.

When you have roughly 2,5 million refugees and a death toll over 100,000 people, the use of a particular type of weapon that killed 1-3% doesn't seem right. I do not believe intervention in a civil war should be taken lightly, but if it weren't for the French the United States  might not have obtained independence, if it weren't for the British, Greece would not have obtained independence, so on and so forth. Outside influence is sometimes necessary.

Getting involved in an armed conflict is always a difficult choice. It seems as if the US, the UN, and NATO get overly entangled in political games. While I believe that President Obama has the purest intentions on the matter, it being a difficult conflict to engage in, the ""red line"" seemed like an excuse not to get involved earlier. Waiting for the use of chemical weapons to make it a hard line issue doesn't seem right.

Most definitely, certain types of weapons receive a different level of attention. I couldn't agree more with the statements both Jimmy Carter and President Obama made regarding the use of chemical weapons. I simply disagree that the other 100,000 that were killed prior did not justify the same attention. The mass exit of over 2,5 million refugees due to the conditions of the civil war should be enough of a sign for the need for intervention. 

The reasons we get involved in international affairs, and the means of how we chose to get involved seem to be a political chess match, and if there is not enough gain on our behalf, we let innocent people die.

It is a difficult choice to get involved in any way in any manor, but I think our government, the UN and NATO have failed the Syrian people in allowing President Bashar al-Assad to slaughter his own people. 

We fear aiding the ""wrong side"" but if we truly believe in democracy, we should want the people to have the right to have the leaders they wish in place. President Bashar al-Assad has overstayed his welcome, and the ""red line"" should have been drawn sooner. "

If everyone in the world recycled at least a few items, then it would be a much better place to live and the garbage that keeps piling up would be virtually nonexistent. Using clean energy is best for human's sake as well as plant and animal life. The other means of energy that are used harm humans by having us breathe the toxic air that is filled with fumes, this goes for animals as well. When plants are harmed by the toxicity it can cause them to die, and without plants we wouldn't be able to have oxygen, and without oxygen we wouldn't be able to breathe, in turn that would kill us as a human race. If animals die off because of this toxicity that is occurring in the world now, then we as humans will not get the nutrients from those animals that we need to survive.

To not perform acts like simply putting cans and glass or cardboard in recycle containers or not making sure your community leaders are doing all they can for clean energy and reasonable environmental regulations is wrong I think.

The idea of conservation being that we must use the natural resources we have effectively, nothing is wasted and to ensure that future generations have what they need. So with this in mind anything environmentalism has to contribute to conservation would be good, such as recycling and clean energy. By developing clean energy through solar power, etc. then we can create a sustainable future for mankind. I think some people let emotion dictate their feelings about the environment rather than reason and logic. This can be dangerous because people will be biased and choose to ignore facts. This would only hurt the future of mankind. Governments should balance the rights of its citizens with the necessity of caring for the environment. I have heard ideas of making wild life refuges across entire US states and banning human habitation of those areas and forcing people to live in large cities. This is foolish and does more to hurt the environment than to help it. There is a real problem in countries such as China and India where the population is over 1 billion people. That is a tremendous amount of people living in a relatively small area. Environmentalism and conservation must be taken very seriously in these countries otherwise they will end up stripped of their natural resources and living in pollution for generations."

If a child is going to come into the world with very little or bad parenting then the child should not of been born anyways. The child would be born into a crappy situation because the parent was dumb and was not responsible to be able to raise a child. Abortion is not always wrong in my opinion but it is not right in anyway. Also, I believe that the parents that have an abortion should definitely have to take a class on making the right decisions. A teenager that is just having unprotected sex should not have the idea that they can just go get an abortion if something happens. Then there is another side of me that says killing an unborn child is wrong. I am not going to go into detail but things like that should not happen and is wrong.

I think everyone should have the right to marry whomever he or she wants. There are a lot of issues that come up when talking about same-sex marriage, for instance, religious matters, family and friends, society, and the individuals? themselves. Happiness should be more important than reputation. 
I have a very diverse background and I think it is a benefit because it gives me different perspectives to view things. Parents always want their children to have what they never had or what they wished they had. It doesn?t matter what it someone?s ethnic background, parents want their children to be happy. When the topic of same-sex marriage shows up in the family most of the family think about their reputation. Parents should not think about their reputation in this matter because people did and will talk about others behind their back. Reputation is not more important than the happiness of their children. 
Everyone has different point of view, not everyone will agree with each other about the same-sex marriage. There are different people in society; some who are very religious, open-minded people, and who just don?t care what others do. Religious people restrict same-sex marriage because it is against their religion. That is their point of thinking they shouldn?t force it one someone else.
Also, people move to America because of freedom. Freedom is the word that shows up when people about America. If same-sex marriage isn?t allowed than how is freedom practiced in America. The first amendment in the US Constitution states the freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and petition. Now, restricting someone denies the first amendment. 
In conclusion, right to express and freedom are the common basic rights that everyone should have and that everyone should practice. Sometimes ignoring the same-sex marriages can affect the individuals and cause them to commit suicide or depression. Past is the past, there is more diversity in the world and equal rights than there were in the past, so why not move forward accept that not everyone is same. Everyone has a different approach to value of Life, so why not left people decide what they most value in life and decide their own future.

The Bible clearly states that it is wrong and immoral. (Leviticus 18:22, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, 1 Timothy 1:10, 1 Corinthians 7:2, Romans 1:26-28, Leviticus 20:13, Romans 1:32, Isaiah 56:3-5, James 4:12, Matthew 13:1-25, Romans 1:27, 1 Kings 14:24, Genesis 19:1-38, 1 Corinthians 7:7-9.. I could go on) It is not how God planned for His creation to be. He made man and woman to be together. When man and man or woman and woman come together it is them shaking their fist in Gods face, trying to control that which God controls. 

 That being said I do not act out against the homosexual. I am a sinner just like them. Although I do recognize it as sin, that does not give me the right to judge. Judgment is God's alone. I have been commanded to love my neighbor and I try to do just that- including those who practice homosexuality and all sinners for all have fallen short of the glory of God *and* have access to the complete forgiveness He offers. 

Also, I do not judge the homosexual because it would be hypocritical for me to do. All sin is the same; I am to same lost human being as the gay or lesbian in need of a Savior. In God's eyes all sin is the same, He forgives one man's lie as he forgives another's murder. It doesn't seem fair in human logic but God's logic isn't the same. Aren't we grateful though. Because of His enormous love for His people He forgives us our every sin when re repent. Therefore, if I were to look down upon those who are immoral in their sexuality I would be folly of the same sin and pride as the man in Jesus' parable in the Gospel Luke chapter seven. The King forgives one of His servants of an enormous debt but upon leaving as a debtless man, he runs into a man who owes him a smaller penance and immediately demands he is thrown in jail for his debt. The first man who's debt had been forgiven would not forgive his neighbors debt. Therefore, if I were to act out against a homosexual person I would be disregarding my own sin that has been forgiven.

I also hope that in befriending a homosexual Christ will be able to shine through me and show this person the error of their ways. If Christians sneer at and treat homosexuals like dirt, what would that say about Christ? I want to be able to show these people, and all people, that God so loved the world that  He gave His one and only son to die for them so that whoever believed will have eternal life with Him.

 That is what matters in this world; preaching to sinners the Good News of Jesus Christ. Jesus went to the sinners; those who are well are in no need of a doctor. 

I believe same sex marriage is a sin, but I also believe that I have been commanded to love my neighbor and to tell him or her, gay or lesbian, brethren or foreigner, about Christ's undying love for each one of us and the free and complete forgiveness He offers to everyone.

Some women though don't have the same views as me and I respect their beliefs because I would want people to respect mine also. I think that there should still be a choice for women because of many reasons. A person could be mentally unstable, financially unstable, or a victim of rape. Women who are mentally unstable sometimes just cannot take on the responsibility of another life that they have to take care of. A lot of young people who end up getting pregnant also just don't have enough money to raise a child. The child might face many challenges in life because of this like lack of food, clothes, and shelter. The main thing though that sways me to pro choice is victims of rape. Women who are victims of rape and are impregnating by their rapists are then reminded everyday they are pregnant of the act. I think that when someone goes through a traumatic situation like that they should have the choice to keep or to not keep the baby. Also I believe that if it was illegal women who were desperate enough would use the black market to still get an abortion. Using the black market to get an abortion is very unsafe for the women to.

If adoption was chosen this would give the child an opportunity to life for one, with a possible family, and even a possible promising future.  Some find abortion to be the easiest way to deal with the ""problem"" by simply getting rid of it since it was something they never desired at that point in their life.  When couples engage in sexual activities they know what the possible outcomes are for such actions so why not take responsibility for something that was of no surprise to them?

However, the current mentality of government issued marriage licenses has led to extreme inequalities in our society.

In addition to the current same-sex marriage discrimination, our government has used the marriage license restrictions to prevent inter-racial marriages in the past.

    In my opinion, the best way to resolve this issue, and probably the only way to truly end marriage contract's discrimination, is to discontinue the issuing of more government licenses, and allow all competent and consenting adult individuals to create their own social contracts.

This is the equivalent of somebody standing trial for the death sentence with tape over the mouth of the defendant, unable to give his or her input in the matter.  Minus the less controllable situations involving rape, the mother and father of a potential child should not be having sex if they are not ready to take on the responsibilities of a child.  No child should ever have to pay for the consequences of ignorant parents that can not save their physical pleasures until marriage.  In situations involving rape, the child still deserves a chance to live, even if that means being adopted.  Even though adoption may seem like a cruel solution by creating isolation from his or her parents, I guarantee adopted children would choose to be adopted rather than killed in the womb.

I believe that if you take the option to have sex then there should be no route to take away your pregnancy that you knew could happen when you agreed.

When you take the action you should have a plan if you do not want the kids that could come from this action. If that is true then you should protect yourself. If you say yes to having sex then go out and get protection. When adoption is an option you have a life in you and you took it away from them. Some say that there is not a baby at 24 weeks which is the stopping point of abortion but I believe it to be a human life way before that. At week 9 they start to get the formation of eyelids, fingers, shoulders and earlobe. Then during week 10 they have the formation of a brain which is what I have and everyone in this world has. That is a life in there. By week 15 they have a face, they have another thing that everyone in this world has and it shows the features that it could start to have when it is born.

Then just the next week this baby will get the hair he will have when he is born and the fat that will also be on its body when it comes out. The main point that needs to be made is this baby has a heartbeat just in the first 5 weeks. This is what we find when looking to the health of ourselves, the ones actually in the world. This tells us that we are living still and I don?t see the difference if it?s just in the mothers body. It proves that it?s still alive. 
At the beginning of these weeks the woman had the option to not have sex and had the option to use protection. If the guy did not want to use it then you should not join. Many people feel like since the option of abortion is there now they do not need to spend the money on protection when they can just get an abortion. There are so many places that do it that just makes it seem okay to people. Even here at Missouri State University there are coupon given out where you can get a free pregnancy test and that send out the message to some that it is okay to have sex. Shows that it is that easy to get help when you are pregnant. Not everyone is having sex so people should not give that message off. 
The other side I have is if you are raped and I see that as a situation that you could have options open that they could get the help they need and if it so  happens to make them pregnant then they should be able to take care of that. The only way I would see this to pass would be if they reported the rape because then there would be a document to say that it happened. This would also make these incidents get reported.  It was not their choice to have that done to them.

 I stand in this position because I choose to not participate in sexual activity and I do not find it hard to do. I feel like you should wait until you ready because there is always that chance you could have a child come out of it. I also believe that it is not my opinion that will change the opinions of others that will participate in those actions. If the person can live with the fact that they just killed a life inside them then they can live with that but personally I could not do so. The rates of abortion have only grown in the past years and I could just see it to continue to climb. I feel like it will never be taken away from the United States but the women should also be informed what the abortion does have the possibility of doing to them besides just taking what they call a ?problem? away. This could present problems with future pregnancies. , , "

I strongly believe that abortion is an individual choice. I do not think that someone has the right to tell a pregnant woman to kept or to not kept her baby, especially in the case of rape. We cannot pretend to know and understand every case out there because every case is different. There are so many factors that play into a how a woman feels about being pregnant. Whether the baby?s father is in the picture or not plays into the choice. I believe that pregnant women who are supported by the baby?s father to some extent, whether that be physically, emotionally, or financially, are more likely to kept their babies. In addition, age and health of the pregnant woman are significant factors. Teenagers, who are practically still children themselves, and young women, who are just starting out on their own, get pregnant on accident and not having planned for bringing another human being into the world and raising that child at that point in their lives may lead them to choose abortion. At risk women, either because of old age or poor health, may choose this as well. Furthermore, I believe that the state of life a woman is at in her life attributes to this choice. For example, if a pregnant woman could not afford or manage to provide the basic essentials for her baby, then she may decide not to subject her baby to a life surrounded by daily struggle to survive. Another significant factor worth noting is the circumstances under which the woman becomes pregnant. Unfavorable circumstances such as if the woman was under the influence of drugs or alcohol or if she was raped may lead a woman to choose abortion., , "

I don?t really recycle or anything like that.  I don?t keep up with how the ozone layer is. I honestly think it?s pointless. No matter how hard you try to keep the planet clean, there are always going to be people to mess it up again. There are always going to be at least one person that wants you to fail. I feel like the government should be more involved with it, but they are not really at all. So why should I be concerned if our government isn?t? Why waste your time on stuff like this when people are starving, homeless, sick with disease? There are far worse things to be concerned with. I would rather concern myself with feeding the homeless. I probably should start recycling and doing more stuff to help save the planet. We could take the cardboard boxes and give them to the homeless for them to use. I?m just whatever about this entire subject. So if you like to recycle and stuff like that, good for you, and if you don?t, then cool. To me it really doesn?t matter either way. I?m not going to dislike anyone for how they feel about it. It is one of those things that are just like, okay. In conclusion, I don?t think environmentalism is a big deal. "

Imagine not having any say in whether or not you want to have a life. Well, babies do not have a choice in their mother?s womb. My opinion concerning the controversial debate discussing abortion is that it is wrong. The reasoning for my belief is you are killing an innocent child. As an almost aborted baby I feel very strongly about this subject. If you are mature enough to have sex, then you are mature enough to care for the baby you created.  There are many other safer, more reasonable solutions other than abortion. There are approximately two million infertile couples waiting to adopt, and putting your baby up for adoption will give them a better chance at a happier life if you are unable to provide it. The solution for the new creation should not be death. Abortion also can harm the mother as well. Statistics show that 65% of women who abort suffer symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder after undergoing the procedure. Once you are pregnant, there is already life. The opposing side believes that in the first few weeks of pregnancy, there is no human life which is incorrect. The baby actually begins its life in the first week after conception. , , "

I do believe that once a child is conceived, then that egg becomes a human being regardless of it being just a cell. If a woman wants to have an abortion, then that decision is up to her and no one else; not her parents, the baby?s father, or any peers. Sure, her actions may have implications on her family, herself, and the baby?s father, but it is, after all, her body; and she can do with it what she wants. Some that are pro-choice believe the same as I do. The people that are pro-life believe that all life is sacred, that abortion is a sin. Of course, I do not believe that to be all pro-life believers but that is what I believe to be the major reasoning behind their views. If a woman was raped and the result was not only lowered self-esteem but a pregnancy, and wanted to get an abortion; I sure will not stop them. If I got pregnant and I knew I was not ready to have a baby and it was early in the pregnancy, I would, personally, still keep the baby and then find the best option for her/him. Whether the option being to give the baby up for adoption (closed or open) or keeping the baby and doing everything I can to provide for him/her.

The importance of things such as recycling and clean energy can never be underemphasized. So many things are effected by not recycling, such as wildlife and air and water pollution. I do not see the down side of environmentalism. Environmentalism can only help and improve everyone's living conditions, as well as plants and animals. Recycling is a simple way to help improve the environment. Not recycling can lead to a build up in landfills as well as pollution in water. It may take a little extra work but the extra work is worth it. It really isn't that hard to just throw your plastic bottle in a different trash can or throw your used paper into a separate bin to be recycled. Recycling can help keep the animals in the ocean, such as dolphins and penguins, safe from being strangled by the plastic bottle holders. Recycling is something everyone can do. No one wants to breathe in nasty air or drink nasty water. Who wouldn't want to keep our water and air clean? Many people believe very strongly in things such as the preservation of trees. Many have felt so strongly about this that they have tied themselves to trees to protest. I believe that if everyone makes a conscious effort to recycle and keep the earth clean, the world will be a better place."
"R_0ib78gyWwaZvePr",5,5,5,4,5,5,4,5,5,6,4,5,6,6,6,6,3,6,4,2,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,"Woman",21,NA,"65","christian",4,"fashion design ",6,6,", , I believe that it is highly important to take care of our environment. The environment matters because as humans, the Earth is obviously our home. It is where we live, breathe, eat, raise our children, etc. Our entire life support system is dependent on the well being of all of the species living on earth. The food chain is an example of this. Everything works together from the sun down to the insects.  Within the overall biosphere, when even the smallest ecosystem is off balance it impacts the entire planet. The deterioration of the environment threatens the earth?s natural resources such as our clean water supply, fossil fuels for energy and food supply. Many of these resources are nonrenewable so when they run out we will be forced to find new alternatives. I think that especially in America, between our excessive nature and carelessness, we have been impacting the environment in a very negative way and some things need to change. I am not educated enough on the subject to know specifically what we are able to change while still maintaining our quality of life, but I am in favor of more clean energy, recycling, and eco friendly things. I feel like the quality of life for human beings and other living things is declining and that is partially because of the way we have been abusing our environment for a long period of time. I feel like we are pushing its limits to the max and expecting it to uphold a standard that we created for it that it was never intended to meet in the first place.  I definitely believe that some of the damage that has been done is reversible or can at least be improved upon. Unfortunately, I do not think that the extreme amount of change that we need can come about without some type of governmental regulation simply because of the greedy excessive nature that we have developed and our unwillingness to change. I am personally not in favor of more governmental regulation, however given the track record of our society; I just do not feel like we would make the necessary changes without being forced.  In some ways I believe the government would need to be more involved and in some I believe they should actually be less involved. For example, I think they need to get their hands out of the water supply. Who on Earth made the executive decision to ?enhance? our public water supply with harmful additives such as fluoride? I mean no disrespect, but clearly the government does not always have our best interest in mind, nor do they always know how to fix the problem. Their area of involvement in these issues should be to simply enforce regulations and guidelines. Coming up with the regulations and guidelines however, I think the best method would be to collaborate with the experts on the issues such as environmentalists, farmers, and others.  Ideally, to avoid having to involve the government I think it would be great if the environmentally focused non-profit organizations would really step up in what they do, weather that be promoting a product, creating awareness, or simply expanding.  One huge issue I believe is the lack of completely organic and natural substances. In the grocery store the ?organic? section is very limited and on top of that it is expensive.  Since the food we eat (or should eat) comes from the earth I do not see any reason why there should be a lack of such food. I know that in combatting this, many organizations have turned to using pesticides and GMOs which does sustain the life of the plant or animal or allow for mass quantities of production, but again, this means that the quality of the product has drastically decreased. I think it is very important for people to consume natural and organic foods because that is our main source of energy and how we obtain vitamins and nutrients. The use of pesticides I think is extremely harmful because it can have damaging effects on humans that consume it, and it is harmful to the area in which it was sprayed. I mean think about it, it is a poison. The plants are being sprayed with poison that is designed to kill. It kills the pests, but then lingers on the food that it was sprayed on that will soon be in the hands of the consumer, and it also has been released into the air. It could effect other living things that is in the same area and also goes into the air supply that people breathe. Where GMOs are concerned, I think that becomes an environmental issue too because we are planting unnatural things, consuming them, and then even by waste the environment is still effected by them. Because of these methods used in production, the lack of natural food/plant based products is more common then not anymore. These pesticides and GMOs are harmful to living things, but especially the human body. They cause disease and defects. This is awful because plants are primarily what we use to combat such  things, seeing as nearly all of our medicines come from plants and eating healthy natural foods is what we do to maintain our health. It does not make sense to put something  so harmful into our bodies and it is a shame because that is not the way it should be. And the really disgusting thing is, is why is this even an issue? Why is it so hard to produce a product that naturally comes from the earth? And why are we so unsatisfied that there is not enough of it to be distributed to the entire planet or it is not as big as we wanted it to be. To be completely blunt about it, I think it is really stupid. Also, I think the main reason for it is simply for profit. Again with America?s excessive nature and greediness, can we not just be satisfied with what we have where we have it as long as the quality is up to par? If some places can?t have banana?s I think they should deal with it, and if some places can?t have grapes I think they should deal with it too. It would be better than consuming mass quantities of empty non-living food everyday. I wish that we would focus more on enhancing the quality of life around us in our own environment instead of making money the top priority. There are obviously many environmental issues but the good news is that each individual can help reduce problems in the environment little by little by doing their bit. These can include unplugging electronics that are not being used, turning off lights when leaving a room, not leaving the refrigerator door open, and converting to using solar panels.  I am clearly no expert on the subject of environmentalism, but I do believe in improving the quality of life and know that a huge part of that is going to depend upon improving the quality of our environment. Other than that, from a spiritual standpoint, I also do believe that God created the earth, and out of sheer honor for him, we should also treat his creation with honor. "

It would certainly take a huge toll on her young body, her social life, her relationships, her emotions, her future. Nothing could be the same. Although I believe that a human being is created at conception, it is the mother who will nurture and care for that child inside of her body for 9 months.  It is the mother who has to live with her decision if she births the child or aborts it.  Personally, I would be overcome with the guilt of killing a child before it even has the chance to live. My morals would direct me to the longer, more difficult path to travel. However, going through the process of having a baby when caught completely off guard in a bad situation to raise a child, could prove to be worse for the child's wellbeing. Ultimately, it is the mother who is providing this child with the gift of life, and it is her choice whether or not to take it away. , , "

There are too many issues happening right now in foreign affairs, the economy, and in healthcare. These things should be legislative member?s top priority. However, I do encourage others to recycle, waste less, and conserve water and energy. I do think these simple tasks should be incorporated into an everyday life to help save the planet.  ""Saving the planet"" is something we should always keep in the back of our minds. There are just too many things going on right now in America that are far more important than going green. If we do not handle the important things first, they could potentially bring down our country which could lead to the collapse of the rest of the world. Then, what good is a lower electricity bill or recycled water bottle going to do us?  If congress was to pass any law concerning the environment, it should not only help the planet, but also the citizens and the economy. If the economy is hurt by any environmental law, then it should not be passed. I think smart cars are a good investment. The price of one is pretty steep. But the money pumped into the economy from smart cars only helps. The individual will save money in the long run on gas."

We have to look at their situations before we judge, especially in the extreme cases such as rape, incest, and to save a woman's life because of pregnancy. It is completely their choice since it's their body. Now, I don't mean to say that abortion should be completely legalized. I support the first trimester abortion, but I'm totally against the second and third trimester.

Every time I hear a someone talking about abortion, I picture their situation in life, if they're financially struggling, not having any support after the birth, their risk from giving birth, and other tragic cases.

The price of gas was a major concern so my dad would always talk about the new ethanol option for cars. I believe the ethanol option was made from corn so my father believed that it was cleaner and would last us long than how long we have with the fossil fuels such as petroleum. Unfortunately where we live there is no possibility of wind mills or water energy to be stored so we use gas and coal products to get the job done. One thing my dad always said was that the government was too involved but now that I look at it the government regulations over environmentalism isn?t very strict. I know that the use of petroleum and other clean sources of fuel are considered but I do not believe that it is a major issue for our government.

I realize that in the event of a contemplated abortion, it is not an easy decision, but taking a life should never be the answer.
