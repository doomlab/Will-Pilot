It would be bad enough if they did, but many times chemicals have long term effects that people have to suffer from before they die. The pain that these people feel must be so great before they are finally blessed with relief in some way. Chemical weaponry is a horrible thing. People fighting with guns and bombs are bad enough. So many are wounded and dead from that alone. When you add in chemical wars the list worsens even more. People should not have to die, but in reality they do. If the simple fact is that in this day and time someone has to die, then at least let them die with dignity and as quickly as possible. Not through suffering.

Chemical weapons are much different than other kinds because they usually cover big spaces and are uncontrollable, which makes it clear why international laws forbid the use of such things. If Syria makes a point that they used them, without consequence then other war-minded people will see that and think its okay to use them. The problem with this is obvious, if every country that is in a war uses chemical weapons, ranging from small to large, the worlds population will shrink if not disappear due to the casualties involved.

I couldn't agree more with the statements both Jimmy Carter and President Obama made regarding the use of chemical weapons.

I respect our stance presently, helping those in Syria who have been attacked and resisting Syrian government officials and military for the sake of the people. I will say that many Syrians protested, and in the wrong way, acting very violent and deviant in nature.

Upon getting to the part about Syria interfering with the United States' war in Iraq, it made more sense. However, I feel as if the war in Iraq was a huge mistake anyway, because the man who ordered the attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon was a Saudi Arabian that they later found being housed in Pakistan. Saddam Hussein and Iraq didn't have anything to do (as far as I know, I could be very mistaken) with 9/11. I'm not sure why America's leaders are concerned with Syria right now, as America has plenty of domestic issues that need to be solved, because as far as I can see, America shouldn't have a dog in this fight. Of course, I say ""shouldn't"" the way things ""should"" be and the way things are, are often two very different things. So in order for me to make a good judgment on the way this situation has been handled, I'm going to need more background information as to why we were even in Iraq in the first place, and why we care about Syria other than them interfering with the War in Iraq.

All of these are things to think about before we advance into another war. The US is in major debt and another war will only sink us deeper into that hole. On the other hand we cannot just sit by and let the Syrian government do this to their people. Innocent people should not be dying at the hands of their own government. If we do let this continue on Syria could think that they have the power to do whatever they want and they could start using their weapons elsewhere.

Syria could have done many other things besides using chemical weapons. You could have just sent the troops in instead and found the rebels.

I feel like in this situation there really is not right answer. However the way  I feel towards Syria using chemical weapons on their own people is appalling. I don't understand how a government could do such a thing to its' own people. Those are the ones they are supposed to be protecting, but instead they are harming them. I guess this is where I feel like it is the US's duty to step in, because I feel since we are such a strong global power that it is our duty to help and defend those who are fighting for their freedom and cannot defend themselves, such as the people of Syria. Overall I have mixed feelings when it comes to the US dealing with Syria's use of weapons, but as far as them using them on their own people my opinion stand firm.

If nothing else they're effective. I think the use of them is an atrocity, but so is bombing, shooting, exploding your civilians.

Which means you can clear an entire neighborhood of people you want, but don't have to rebuild anything. Super powers like the United States should hold a firm standing on chemical weapons, but it doesn't necessarily mean we should go to war any time a chemical weapon is used across the globe. Honestly a pinpoint assassination or regime overthrow could easily be worked without all out war. Let other countries know that if they as a leader use chemical weapons... They will personally be killed. There is a large amount of immorality and gray area there, can we kill a leader and just leave a country? Shouldn't we have to help it rebuild, or else it will get into the same issue all over again? You can't make a country be a better country by will.
