We are in an age where this is a good way to move forward into the future and create a cleaner more sustainable planet. The short term gain does not outweigh the long term effect. It may for the individual in some cases but to consider the effects it has will definitely increase the awareness of most people. I tend to forget about recycling myself but I really wish that more people were aware of ways to recycle and it was much more of a common practice. The government in my hometown of Baton Rouge, LA is a place that does get ample opportunity to recycle but I'm not sure if the city follows through on their end or not. I really hope that they do because it basically a promise they have made to themselves and most importantly its citizens. It?s their responsibility to provide a safe and clean environment for its inhabitants and they should be doing absolutely whatever it takes to do so. Recycling and clean energy could change the world. Without a clean world we could not live much longer than we do and at some point our society will start to fall out and many things in our eco-environment would start to go absolutely wrong. We cannot allow it do so and let our planet become a huge dumpster. It may not be an extremely fast process of cleaning up the planet but at least attempting to do something could definitely change the game into the future if the awareness and action continued to increase.

I would never condone someone to go through an abortion unless it was absolutely necessary. I feel that if someone is making that decision, that is their own, and not something I should put my own opinion into. I was raised pro-life, went to catholic school, and that was the firm way to be. I was also taught by those around me, that the life that we live is ours alone. We cannot depend on the choices by others to influence our own. Me personally, I don't think I could ever go through with it unless there was a serious reason to do so. If it was going to kill me, I would weigh all of the pro's and con's and would still have problems making a decision. Life is precious.

The fact is that if, after a few weeks, the fetus has been created and there's a life inside your body, one should not abort and should have thought about that before, not now, in the point of killing a life. Besides this, abortion implies a mental component because you have to be prepared of the fact that some human person would have had the possibility of living a life and you have delete that possibility.All in all, I believe that abortion is a difficult matter that depends on each culture, nation and political issues of each territory.

I think abortion should be limited to a certain number of weeks into the pregnancy, but I don't know enough about pregnancy to determine just how many weeks it should be. I don't understand how it could take someone six months before they decide that they want an abortion, but I guess it's silly for me to judge without knowing the full circumstances.Abortion wouldn't even be that big of an issue if we just prevented pregnancy in the first place. I remember in the sixth grade that there was an extra credit assignment for signing an ""abstinence agreement."" I thought that was completely absurd at the time and I still do.

Everyone should be entitled to make their own choices and I fail to see how allowing same-sex marriage would affect anyone directly and in a negative way. It is not our place to judge someone because of the choices they have made either in their sexuality, the person they choose to marry, or any other aspect of their lives. In the Bible, God allows mankind to have freewill so that they will choose to follow him because they want to. In addition, the most important commandment is about loving God and loving each other. The Bible also states that God is the only judge so we cannot condone another person's actions, whether we believe they are sins or not, because all of us are sinners. With all this in mind, I fail to see how religious viewpoints have any foundation in condemning same-sex marriage.

For example, if a girl gets raped, I think she might have the right to get an abortion. It was not her fault and she could not control it. If the baby is very unhealthy and may kill the mother, I also think abortion is justified. In that case, the mother should be more important than the baby and her life should matter more. On the other hand, I don't think women who just ""do not want the baby"" should have the right to an abortion. Babies are humans at conception and not at birth. From the moment the egg is fertilized, they are a person. If women and men have sex, they should take responsibility for the consequences. Everyone knows that when you have sex, there is a chance of pregnancy. Whether it be adoption or keeping the baby, there are other solutions than abortion. In addition, the process of abortion is super cruel. There are so many different procedures women can choose from, especially depending on what term they are in. The process not only hurts the mother, but obviously, it kills the baby as well.

If there is a situation that causes the pregnancy or birth to be harmful to the mother and/or baby abortion is okay. A mother should not have to be put into harm for the baby if she does not want to, but she should have that choice. A close friend of mine had an abortion due to a condition she had. She was told from a young age that she would never be able to get pregnant and give birth. Last year she got pregnant and the doctor told her that there was a very large chance that out of her and the baby only one would survive. 	If the pregnancy does not present a threat to the mother or child I do not think it should be okay to have an abortion. If you feel like you are not ready or not able to raise and provide for the child you can put it up for adoption. Couples that are not able to have their own child would provide and give your child a great life. If you do not want to give it up for adoption you can raise the child yourself. Every child or possible child deserves the opportunity to live. You make the choice to be sexually active or not and you know the possible repercussions of this. Whatever happens because of this choice is something you have to live with. 	Another reason I believe that abortion should not be allowed if it does not put the mother or child in harm is the emotional aspect. Women who have abortions have a large amount of emotional pain to work through after and it is not something you will forget.

However, in this day and age with the options available for contraception or even the morning after pill there is no reason unplanned pregnancies should happen (with the exception of rape of course).  I am also concerned with the rights of the unborn baby.  My personal definition is that if there is a heart beat it's a life and why would one person's rights supersede another's.  I have a neurological condition that causes debilitating pain.  The medications for my condition would cause birth defects and I simply can not forgo my medication.  My husband I take precautions however my medication can also reduce the effectiveness of birth control.  We have plans for my husband to have a vasectomy but in the interim if I were to become pregnant I would be very upset for the government to tell me what I could or could not do regarding my health.  There is of course the issue of rape and incest.  I can?t fathom telling someone who has lived through such a terrible ordeal that they must give birth to the rapist?s child as well. I recall when I was pregnant with my daughter (before I was diagnosed with my neurological condition) and receiving an ultrasound very early on.  I could not only see her heart beat but she was literally doing summersaults.  They had difficulty measuring her because she wouldn?t sit still.  Now that she is 5 I believe that was part of her personality already shining through.  The teachers at school call her Tiger because she?s so bouncy.  I couldn?t imagine her right to live not being respected.  I don't have a definitive answer as to if I am for or against abortion.  It?s a difficult multifaceted issue.

I am a sinner just like them. Although I do recognize it as sin, that does not give me the right to judge. Judgment is God's alone.

All sin is the same; I am to same lost human being as the gay or lesbian in need of a Savior. In God's eyes all sin is the same, He forgives one man's lie as he forgives another's murder. It doesn't seem fair in human logic but God's logic isn't the same. Aren't we grateful though. Because of His enormous love for His people He forgives us our every sin when re repent. Therefore, if I were to look down upon those who are immoral in their sexuality I would be folly of the same sin and pride as the man in Jesus' parable in the Gospel Luke chapter seven. The King forgives one of His servants of an enormous debt but upon leaving as a debtless man, he runs into a man who owes him a smaller penance and immediately demands he is thrown in jail for his debt. The first man who's debt had been forgiven would not forgive his neighbors debt. Therefore, if I were to act out against a homosexual person I would be disregarding my own sin that has been forgiven.I also hope that in befriending a homosexual Christ will be able to shine through me and show this person the error of their ways.

I strongly believe that abortion is an individual choice. I do not think that someone has the right to tell a pregnant woman to kept or to not kept her baby, especially in the case of rape. We cannot pretend to know and understand every case out there because every case is different. There are so many factors that play into a how a woman feels about being pregnant. Whether the baby?s father is in the picture or not plays into the choice. I believe that pregnant women who are supported by the baby?s father to some extent, whether that be physically, emotionally, or financially, are more likely to kept their babies. In addition, age and health of the pregnant woman are significant factors. Teenagers, who are practically still children themselves, and young women, who are just starting out on their own, get pregnant on accident and not having planned for bringing another human being into the world and raising that child at that point in their lives may lead them to choose abortion. At risk women, either because of old age or poor health, may choose this as well. Furthermore, I believe that the state of life a woman is at in her life attributes to this choice. For example, if a pregnant woman could not afford or manage to provide the basic essentials for her baby, then she may decide not to subject her baby to a life surrounded by daily struggle to survive. Another significant factor worth noting is the circumstances under which the woman becomes pregnant. Unfavorable circumstances such as if the woman was under the influence of drugs or alcohol or if she was raped may lead a woman to choose abortion.",,,6,5,5,5,5,6,4,4,4,4,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,3,3,3,4,3,2,4,5,5,5,4,4,6,2,18,8,1,Christian,7,3,Graphic Design/Illustration,1,2

Exceptions include: a victim of rape, a child who was not aware of the risks that cannot physically hold a baby, and a person who is at risk of dying while being pregnant. However, most women use abortion, because they are not ready to take on such a time consuming task. Whether it be they are in school or too young, they have no excuse to choose abortion considering they knew the risks of getting pregnant while sexually active. This is not an acceptable form of choice for ""getting rid of a child"". This is a human being we are talking about; not some unimportant lifeless thing. Many people consider abortion a way out of their mistakes. They like to take the easy way out out of selfishness, because they are either fearful of what people will think of them, or the father is out of the picture. Either way, a normal, healthy teenager who becomes pregnant needs to face her fears and take on the challenge of having a child. They do not have to raise the child if they feel like it is best for the child, but killing it is just a way for them to get what they want. Wanting something and doing what is morally right are two different things, and a woman, knowing the risks of sexual activity, should own up to the consequences and take a stand. There are many creepy people in the world nowadays though that take advantage of young girls, teenagers, or even grown women. Circumstances like this call for abortion if the woman becomes pregnant as a victim of rape. This was something they were not giving consent to, therefore they had no control over whether they would become pregnant or not. Also, if a young child, old enough to be sexually active, becomes pregnant, they should be able to have an abortion if their body cannot physically support a baby.

It is preposterous for someone to take offense from someone holding a different believe than themselves. Denying the right to marriage for same-sex couples is in the same boat as denying medical care to someone because they are an Atheist. While some would not equate medical coverage to marriage, both play important roles in a person's happiness and well-being and should thus be treated with the same respect, regardless of what one religion may have to say on the matter. This is especially true since marriage provides not only qualitative benefits, but quantitative as well in the form of tax breaks and additional income. It is unjust to deny these rights to same-sex couples and it goes against what America stands for - freedom and equality.

In the case of same-sex marriages though the many couples keep their original last names. The next difference is that fact that opposite-sex marriages have the ability to reproduction. While a same-sex couple can adopt children they cannot actually have them, unless a female same-sex couple gets medical assistance. Also right now there are many issues that same-sex marriages face in the state governments. Some states have allowed same-sex marriages while others do not.

People who actually follow through with this sin of attraction and get married is still just a sin. I am never rude or judging of anyone that is married to someone of the same sex, since I sin just as much as they do, but in different ways. I think that a lot of people think we try to condemn the person, but it's nothing against the person, it's the behavior being portrayed. Also, I that in no way shape or form was same-sex marriage wanted by our founding fathers in the constitution. Of course the argument to that is that ""times are changing"" and we must adapt to the culture we're becoming. However, I think it is going to eventually lead to destruction. It is turning a moral wrong into a civil right. Same-sex marriage denies someone either a father or a mother.

Governmental regulations should never be too big or to specific across the board, but it is necessary to have some set of guidelines in place when it involves the health of the population, as well as the plants and animals within it. Additionally, a large reason why people do not recycle enough is because they see no tangible incentive to do so. While recycling should not be required by law, it would be understandable for the government to again offer a small financial incentive, or tax relief, to households and businesses that reach certain thresholds of recycling. The amount, obviously, must not be too much, because that government spending could be used elsewhere..

If Christians were more accepting toward same-sex marriage, tensions would drop and some of the homosexuality might actually decrease. Same-sex marriage should be legal throughout the United States because it would show that the large majority of Christians in this nation are loving, understanding, non-judgmental people.

Marriage is no longer an issue solely governed by the Church, when we as a society attach financial benefits (married people have lower tax rates) to marriage, we secularize the issue.  As a secular issue, and a contract between two people (one could go to a judge and be legally married, circumventing the Church entirely), it is unjust and unconstitutional to deny a subsection of the population access to the tangible and financial benefits that have been attached to the institution of marriage.  This iniquity renders claims of religion invalid, as we have made Marriage a secular entity as well.  Despite the aforementioned as a political leaning, dealing with the issue of Same-Sex marriage within the church is vastly different and incredibly more complicated.  So let us step into the realm of theology for a moment, and into a theology that poses a conflict in my mind.  I understand agree with the more conservative, legalistic approach to the issue, if we assume that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, then the entire Bible must be the inspired Word of God.  Therefore we can't pick and choose parts to abide by (though as a culture, we are often guilty of this).  Contrary to that though are the numerous other strictures within Leviticus (the primary text quoted in the Church's crusade against homosexuality), such as a prohibition against wearing clothing made from two-types of cloth (I am as I type this an ""abomination unto God""), as well as prohibitions against pork, and an exhaustive list of rules and regulations to ensure the health and righteousness of the Ancient Israelites.  My beliefs tend to be, that if we acknowledge God as Love, which I do, a God that loves us so much that he gave his Son to die for us, which I do.  And we believe that God desires a relationship with us, a relationship that closely mirrors the marital relationship.  How could we as a community of people who proclaim ourselves Christians, deny a subsection of the population (also equally loved by God) the opportunity to enter into that intimate relationship?  The apostle Paul said that it is better for people to get married than to burn with lust.  How dare we say that God's love isn't good enough for everyone?

While some choose to terminate the pregnancy before the baby begins to looks like a baby, there are many abortion where the baby is big enough to have to be dismembered. I can not even begin to fathom how that is seen as okay. If the person were outside the womb, the murdered would be thrown into jail for life. Yet it is okay to do that to a helpless, unborn child. Also, we are the start of a culture who does not value babies as a source of life, no matter the situation. We are also on the track to not viewing sex as something sacred as well. This leads to unplanned pregnancies and no value of the life growing inside of them.

In America, people used to get made fun of and persecuted for it and that is the way it should be.  People have to be taught that it is wrong.

If a person is not the one personally entering into a union with someone who is gay, then it is not their problem.  Also, we have a constitutional right to the pursuit of happiness. As long as their marriage is not causing harm to others, then it is perfectly acceptable. Likewise, if a straight couple's marriage causes harm to others, I would not support it. Another point, those who are gay cannot have children unless through adoption or surrogacy. Homosexual people are not giving birth to more homosexual people, straight people are. The final reason I believe this is that we are all people, all human beings created the same. Each person is equal, with equal rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

It only takes a couple of seconds to separate trash from recycle. As for clean energy, much like of the rest of the world, we are moving in a progressive way, so it's not a matter of if this will happen, but when.

There are a lot of issues that come up when talking about same-sex marriage, for instance, religious matters, family and friends, society, and the individuals? themselves. Happiness should be more important than reputation. I have a very diverse background and I think it is a benefit because it gives me different perspectives to view things. Parents always want their children to have what they never had or what they wished they had. It doesn?t matter what it someone?s ethnic background, parents want their children to be happy. When the topic of same-sex marriage shows up in the family most of the family think about their reputation. Parents should not think about their reputation in this matter because people did and will talk about others behind their back. Reputation is not more important than the happiness of their children. Everyone has different point of view, not everyone will agree with each other about the same-sex marriage. There are different people in society; some who are very religious, open-minded people, and who just don?t care what others do. Religious people restrict same-sex marriage because it is against their religion. That is their point of thinking they shouldn?t force it one someone else.Also, people move to America because of freedom. Freedom is the word that shows up when people about America. If same-sex marriage isn?t allowed than how is freedom practiced in America. The first amendment in the US Constitution states the freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and petition. Now, restricting someone denies the first amendment. In conclusion, right to express and freedom are the common basic rights that everyone should have and that everyone should practice. Sometimes ignoring the same-sex marriages can affect the individuals and cause them to commit suicide or depression. Past is the past, there is more diversity in the world and equal rights than there were in the past, so why not move forward accept that not everyone is same.

If you are mature enough to have sex, then you are mature enough to care for the baby you created.  There are many other safer, more reasonable solutions other than abortion. There are approximately two million infertile couples waiting to adopt, and putting your baby up for adoption will give them a better chance at a happier life if you are unable to provide it. The solution for the new creation should not be death. Abortion also can harm the mother as well. Statistics show that 65% of women who abort suffer symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder after undergoing the procedure. Once you are pregnant, there is already life.

You chose to have sex with someone. You know that you have a chance of getting pregnant each and every time you have sex. Abortion is a way of getting out of your responsibilities. People will jump at any chance to shirt their responsibilities if it inconveniences them. People should step up and take responsibility and raise their children to do such. There are some exceptions to every rule. If someone is raped then they shouldn't have to take responsibility for the child as they were not part of the decision making process.

The only reason same-sex marriage isn't allowed is because people have religious views against same-sex marriage, but not everyone has those religious views and it's wrong for the government to act upon religious views because america doesn't have a national religion.

It is unfair to ask people to purchase and utilize these items if they are above a comfortable price range for their budget. It is up to businesses take the immediate initiative to increase the use of renewable resources, eventually causing a trickle effect, until the supply and demand of the objects decreases their value. Though their monetary value will decrease, their functional value will remain high.If said resources do take off, the effort to be environmentally friendly will increase, causing our use of resources to be exponentially more efficient.

I don't believe that women should be frivolous with abortion, but most women cannot afford that anyway. I think that people that are ""pro-life"" are generally very religious and very in your face about what they think is right. In the case of abortion there is no murder involved, but say an avoidance of an outcome in which both woman and child would have suffered. Then there is the topic of adoption which most pro-life activists praise. I think adoption is a much worse route for almost everybody involved.

It really isn't that hard to just throw your plastic bottle in a different trash can or throw your used paper into a separate bin to be recycled. Recycling can help keep the animals in the ocean, such as dolphins and penguins, safe from being strangled by the plastic bottle holders. Recycling is something everyone can do. No one wants to breathe in nasty air or drink nasty water. Who wouldn't want to keep our water and air clean? Many people believe very strongly in things such as the preservation of trees.

In regards to the most basic of environmental problems is recycling.  Recycling is very important in society and the world because it allows people a way to help the environment in a simple way of getting rid of the level of waste.  When a person recycles they are helping not only remove that waste but save cost on things such as paper or plastic.  But there are many other ways to practice environmentalism like using clean energy.  Clean energy is one of the most important practices of environmentalism because it helps reduce pollution in our atmosphere which is important whether one believes it to be helping decrease the risk of the destruction of our ozone layer or simply because of the effects it can have on the health of the people living with or in a city that has an abundance of gas fumes in the air.  The main reasoning I have to explain my stance on environmentalism is that it does help our society become aware of problems that if not talked and solved now could lead to very dangerous risks and problems in the future.,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,2,3,4,1,4,5,3,1,6,5,3,6,5,1,5,2,3,5,3,5,2,2,6,2,19,8,36,Christian,6,3,Exercise Movement and Science - Pre-Health Track for Physical Therapy,4,8

Many of our society's laws govern to ensure life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for its members. I believe life begins at conception because there is significant, undeniable scientific evidence and proof of sustainable life before birth. Therefore, I see abortion as murder. I do not think it is humane, nor is it a solution to unwanted pregnancy. Many other options exist, all of which do not require committing an act of murder. My beliefs on this subject originate from my view of the sanctity of life. I believer no life should be taken by the hands of man. If this life is taken, the taker should be punished. I realize that in the event of a contemplated abortion, it is not an easy decision, but taking a life should never be the answer. If abortion remains legal it can only increase acceptance and lacksadaisical attitudes towards it. Rather, I suggest alternative resources, expedited adoption options, and revision of the foster care system to reduce people's hesitation toward the groups role in pro-life campaigning.

I believe that if you take the option to have sex then there should be no route to take away your pregnancy that you knew could happen when you agreed. There are so many options out in the world that give you protection from getting pregnant. When you take the action you should have a plan if you do not want the kids that could come from this action. If that is true then you should protect yourself. If you say yes to having sex then go out and get protection. When adoption is an option you have a life in you and you took it away from them. Some say that there is not a baby at 24 weeks which is the stopping point of abortion but I believe it to be a human life way before that. At week 9 they start to get the formation of eyelids, fingers, shoulders and earlobe. Then during week 10 they have the formation of a brain which is what I have and everyone in this world has. That is a life in there. By week 15 they have a face, they have another thing that everyone in this world has and it shows the features that it could start to have when it is born. Then by week 19 they have a scalp and blood vessels which allows the blood to get around the body. Finally in week 24 the baby has taste buds, and lungs which will allow them to breathe. I see this as a living thing. It might not be completely in the world but it is living. It is getting its nutrition from the mother?s body. Then just the next week this baby will get the hair he will have when he is born and the fat that will also be on its body when it comes out. The main point that needs to be made is this baby has a heartbeat just in the first 5 weeks. This is what we find when looking to the health of ourselves, the ones actually in the world. This tells us that we are living still and I don?t see the difference if it?s just in the mothers body. It proves that it?s still alive. At the beginning of these weeks the woman had the option to not have sex and had the option to use protection. If the guy did not want to use it then you should not join. Many people feel like since the option of abortion is there now they do not need to spend the money on protection when they can just get an abortion. There are so many places that do it that just makes it seem okay to people. Even here at Missouri State University there are coupon given out where you can get a free pregnancy test and that send out the message to some that it is okay to have sex. Shows that it is that easy to get help when you are pregnant. Not everyone is having sex so people should not give that message off. The other side I have is if you are raped and I see that as a situation that you could have options open that they could get the help they need and if it so  happens to make them pregnant then they should be able to take care of that. The only way I would see this to pass would be if they reported the rape because then there would be a document to say that it happened. This would also make these incidents get reported.  It was not their choice to have that done to them. I stand in this position because I choose to not participate in sexual activity and I do not find it hard to do. I feel like you should wait until you ready because there is always that chance you could have a child come out of it. I also believe that it is not my opinion that will change the opinions of others that will participate in those actions. If the person can live with the fact that they just killed a life inside them then they can live with that but personally I could not do so. The rates of abortion have only grown in the past years and I could just see it to continue to climb. I feel like it will never be taken away from the United States but the women should also be informed what the abortion does have the possibility of doing to them besides just taking what they call a ?problem? away. This could present problems with future pregnancies. ",,,4,5,5,4,3,5,2,5,4,4,3,3,4,3,4,4,3,5,6,5,2,5,5,5,6,3,6,4,4,4,2,18,8,,none,5,3,Elementary Education,4,4

All of the DNA and chromosomes are in place at conception. In the 5th week of pregnancy, the heart starts beating. And everything with a heartbeat is considered to be alive (animal or human). The argument, ""a baby doesn't become a human baby until the second or trimester"" is completely ridiculous. Just because it's the size of a grape doesn't make it any less human than a baby post birth. The ""blob"" of cells are actually cells dividing, causing this ""blob"" to develop into a bigger baby. So at one point, we were all a ""blob"" but that is completely normal. If the fetus is really just a bunch of cells, one has to define when life does start. It should also be noted that women who have received abortions usually become depressed, anxious, and guilt-ridden later on in their lives. Also, complications and fertility issues in later pregnancies typically occur. During the abortion process, the abortion doctor uses forceps, chemicals or some other device to crush, burn, etc. the baby. There are video footage of the ""blob of cells"" moving away in pain, and trying to escape the device. The main reason why women get abortions is usually for the sake of convenience. People should exercise responsibility when having sex, and if an accidental pregnancy happens, it is never the baby's fault -it's always the couple's fault for not using good protection or not abstaining from sex. In cases of rape, it is a terrible experience, but again -it's not the baby's fault. If anything, put the baby up for adoption -but there is never a reason to kill it. In cases of a baby with a disability, it is very difficult on a family, but every married couple before they have children should discuss what happens in the case of a disabled child. If one allows the birth of a normal child, but aborts a disabled child, that is like saying the disabled child is not as important or valuable as the normal child. So what happens to the saying ""everyone is priceless?"" In conclusion, I believe that abortion is wrong because life begins at conception, and every life is valuable. If (and when) accidents do happen, it is never the child's fault. It is time to be responsible for our actions.

God condemns homosexuality, and as a Christian, I believe that as well.  That being said, I believe that God does not condemn the person who identifies as a homosexual, only the actual sin of homosexuality.  The sin of homosexuality is a classic example of the phrase, ""hate the sin, not the sinner.""  I can dislike the lifestyle that a homosexual chooses, but that does not necessarily mean that I dislike the individual.I feel that by allowing same-sex marriages to occur, we are teaching people that nature doesn't matter, and that the way humans are made is something as insignificant as a speck of dust. Anatomically speaking, a male has his designated sex organs for a reason--to reproduce with a woman.  Men and women are made to fit together. If they weren't, God would not have made them this way.I applaud people who are trying to legalize same-sex marriage,s for standing up for their beliefs. This is me standing up for mine.

I love animals and I'm a vegetarian, so I like helping them in any way that I can and I know recycling helps save lives.  I wish that our government was more environmentally friendly and that as a country we could work harder on solar power energy and wind energy.  I would not say I'm an environmental activist, but when possible I recycle.  I love that Missouri State's campus now has many trash/ recycling receptacles placed all over.  It's especially helpful in the PSU and right outside of class rooms. Honestly, I don't see why more people don't recycle or even make an effort to, it helps the environment and in turn helps us.  Another reason to recycle is to reduce landfills and save energy.  Also, global warming is becoming a huge issue.  A lot of people still don't believe global warming is real or they just don't want to see it because it would mean that they would have to make changes in their daily life.

It is plain wrong to kill a defenseless life. At the same time, I understand why abortion is as widespread as it is. I understand that at the age of 16 a young girl doesn't want a baby, can't take care of a baby, that a baby will give her a bad reputation, and so on. The thing I don't understand is how you can find it in yourself to murder a baby. After hearing from many speakers about abortion, many of whom had an abortion or survived an abortion, the emotional toll on that women is unbearable. I have participated in the Pro-Life March in Washington, D.C. two times. I can honestly say that seeing all of the people supporting the Pro-Life movement is breathtaking.

Clean energy is health and cost effective. It will not cause people to have an increased risks of respiratory issues (i.e. asthma). Clean energy will also save on money. A person's electric bill and gas bill may cost $600. By using energy efficient appliances (i.e washers, dryers, dish washers), one can cut the cost of their bill. People will like to save money anywhere they can. For energy efficient appliances, an excellent brand to use is Energy Star. Governmental regulations I feel are not strict enough.

It may be more something that is looked down upon because it is so easy to see on the outside, but it is just one of many sins that people struggle with. Just because someone may love another from the same sex, it does not mean they are an awful person. I think I feel uncomfortable about the idea because of the backlash from my community. Same-sex marriage is really looked down upon in my circle, but I still do not think a person should be judged based off of one sin. Another contributing factor for my attitudes on same-sex marriage would come from the state I am from. Down in the south, homosexuality is frowned upon while I think it is more acceptable the further north and west you go. When I think back to middle school, there was a boy that everyone accused of being homosexual because of the way he dressed and talk. The more I relive that, the more disgusting of an act I see it as. He was bullied to the extreme and he eventually had to change schools. He handled it well and is now going to college back home and has a good paying job. An experience like that could have really messed a kid up for a lifetime.

You shall not kill is a commandment from go and I'm pretty sure that there is a law somewhere that says you cannot murder another person. For these reasons and other I am against abortion and believe that it shouldn't be legal and anyone that has an abortion and does not repent for there sins will not go to heaven.

First being that recycling and reusing items cuts down on harmful waste that would go into the landfill.  These landfills Emit harmful gases that affect the environment, not to mention they take up copious amounts of land that could be used elsewhere.  Also, recycling cuts down on the need for our raw materials such as (coal, trees, etc.).   Eventually our nonrenewable resources will be depleted.  Trees provide oxygen for humans, with out that we can not survive.  Lastly, the use of clean energy and recycling may save you money in the long run.  Setting up your home with solar panels is very expensive initially; however, the cost quickly pays for its self when you are able to breeze through months without paying an electric bill.  It's important to note that recycling not only helps out the environment, but your pocket, too.  Landfills are regulated by the United States government.  If a states landfill surpasses the set limitations, they will enforce a tax that is pushed onto the citizens of that state.  So, less waste equals more money.   All of that being said, trash helps create jobs.

While I am not completely for same-sex marriage I do not judge two people of the same sex for being together and loving each other. This is their own personal choice or feeling and I should not have a say in how they decide and wish to live their life. I have family members who are in same-sex marriages and I do not judge them for being together. It does not even seem different for me anymore. I still love them both the same as I would if they were in heterosexual relationships. They have been together for so long that it just seems normal. I could not picture it any other way. While I may not exactly support their relationship, I do not look down on them because of their lifestyle. If they are happy that is what matters. If my own child were to be in a same-sex marriage, I think I would have a very difficult time accepting it at first, but after a while it would just be fine. I would want everyone to be happy and if that mean they marry someone of the same sex, then that is what it takes.

Babies develop working organs very early in development and have control over their actions, such as kicking in the womb, just as an adult human does.  Killing a fetus is the equivalent of murdering any other human being. Also, it is ending the life of the potential child without the consent of the child.  This is the equivalent of somebody standing trial for the death sentence with tape over the mouth of the defendant, unable to give his or her input in the matter.  Minus the less controllable situations involving rape, the mother and father of a potential child should not be having sex if they are not ready to take on the responsibilities of a child.  No child should ever have to pay for the consequences of ignorant parents that can not save their physical pleasures until marriage.  In situations involving rape, the child still deserves a chance to live, even if that means being adopted.  Even though adoption may seem like a cruel solution by creating isolation from his or her parents, I guarantee adopted children would choose to be adopted rather than killed in the womb. My roommate, for instance, is adopted and said he is perfectly content with his adoptive parents and doesn't even see the need to try to find his biological parents.

I personally would not choose this path for myself but i do not think that means i should tell others they cannot live their lives that way. I want people to be happy and if that is what makes them happy then support them in that decision. I believe in gender equality. I think men and women should be equal and not be stereotyped. I feel as if same-sex marriage can go along with that concept. If both men and women are equal then who is to say men have to marry women? Men can marry other men or women can marry other women and their marriage has just as much potential as a heterosexual marriage. I do believe that marriage is a union centered around love. It is something that humans aspire for. I  believe in love. I believe that two people of any gender can fall in love. They deserve to be able to marry each other no matter the circumstance. As i said before as long as they are not harming others it should be acceptable. Why should two men or to women who love each other be unable to marry? They could love each other just as much as any heterosexual couple but they cant have the same rewards? That is not fair. Anybody in the world should be given the opportunity to follow their dreams and be happy.

It is her body and she should have the choice to do with it as she pleases. However, if the man wants the child I believe she should be forced to have it. He helped make the child so he should also get a say in whether or not she has it, but he should not get final say if she is extremely opposed to having it. I believe this because I dislike the way the Catholic church views abortion as a sin, I wouldn't go so far as to say that. Its a choice, it should be treated like one. I also believe that people should not have them unless they really need to. If it will endanger the woman for having it, then she should not have it. If she was raped, then I believe she shouldn't have to have the rape baby. However, I know that most do choose to have the child anyway.  I believe that if you have unprotected sex you should be able to assume the responsibility to have the child that you created. You should be able to take responsibility for what you created. If you think you are responsible enough to have sex, you should be responsible enough to take care of what you created. It makes sense that way.

My roommates and friends use the recycling bins often but I never think about it. If I am in the hall way or something that has a recycle bin around then I will probably throw plastic in the plastic bin but if the trash can is closer than then the recycle bin,  I will most likely use the trash can instead.

Honestly I am not quite sure why people care so much on the topic. Why does it matter to you what other people do sexually or who they decide to love. I truly believe that people are born gay. Even with toddlers you can see more ""feminine"" traits or such. On the religious side of the topic I do not think same-sex relationships are an abomination. If you are the type of person that believes God does everything for a reason then wouldn't that mean that God made that person gay?

8033,1,9/30/14 14:53,R_0ib78gyWwaZvePr,,,,,,,2,,,"I believe that it is highly important to take care of our environment. The environment matters because as humans, the Earth is obviously our home. It is where we live, breathe, eat, raise our children, etc. Our entire life support system is dependent on the well being of all of the species living on earth. The food chain is an example of this. Everything works together from the sun down to the insects.  Within the overall biosphere, when even the smallest ecosystem is off balance it impacts the entire planet. The deterioration of the environment threatens the earth?s natural resources such as our clean water supply, fossil fuels for energy and food supply. Many of these resources are nonrenewable so when they run out we will be forced to find new alternatives. I think that especially in America, between our excessive nature and carelessness, we have been impacting the environment in a very negative way and some things need to change. I am not educated enough on the subject to know specifically what we are able to change while still maintaining our quality of life, but I am in favor of more clean energy, recycling, and eco friendly things. I feel like the quality of life for human beings and other living things is declining and that is partially because of the way we have been abusing our environment for a long period of time. I feel like we are pushing its limits to the max and expecting it to uphold a standard that we created for it that it was never intended to meet in the first place.  I definitely believe that some of the damage that has been done is reversible or can at least be improved upon. Unfortunately, I do not think that the extreme amount of change that we need can come about without some type of governmental regulation simply because of the greedy excessive nature that we have developed and our unwillingness to change. I am personally not in favor of more governmental regulation, however given the track record of our society; I just do not feel like we would make the necessary changes without being forced.  In some ways I believe the government would need to be more involved and in some I believe they should actually be less involved. For example, I think they need to get their hands out of the water supply. Who on Earth made the executive decision to ?enhance? our public water supply with harmful additives such as fluoride? I mean no disrespect, but clearly the government does not always have our best interest in mind, nor do they always know how to fix the problem. Their area of involvement in these issues should be to simply enforce regulations and guidelines. Coming up with the regulations and guidelines however, I think the best method would be to collaborate with the experts on the issues such as environmentalists, farmers, and others.  Ideally, to avoid having to involve the government I think it would be great if the environmentally focused non-profit organizations would really step up in what they do, weather that be promoting a product, creating awareness, or simply expanding.  One huge issue I believe is the lack of completely organic and natural substances. In the grocery store the ?organic? section is very limited and on top of that it is expensive.  Since the food we eat (or should eat) comes from the earth I do not see any reason why there should be a lack of such food. I know that in combatting this, many organizations have turned to using pesticides and GMOs which does sustain the life of the plant or animal or allow for mass quantities of production, but again, this means that the quality of the product has drastically decreased. I think it is very important for people to consume natural and organic foods because that is our main source of energy and how we obtain vitamins and nutrients. The use of pesticides I think is extremely harmful because it can have damaging effects on humans that consume it, and it is harmful to the area in which it was sprayed. I mean think about it, it is a poison. The plants are being sprayed with poison that is designed to kill. It kills the pests, but then lingers on the food that it was sprayed on that will soon be in the hands of the consumer, and it also has been released into the air. It could effect other living things that is in the same area and also goes into the air supply that people breathe. Where GMOs are concerned, I think that becomes an environmental issue too because we are planting unnatural things, consuming them, and then even by waste the environment is still effected by them. Because of these methods used in production, the lack of natural food/plant based products is more common then not anymore. These pesticides and GMOs are harmful to living things, but especially the human body. They cause disease and defects. This is awful because plants are primarily what we use to combat such  things, seeing as nearly all of our medicines come from plants and eating healthy natural foods is what we do to maintain our health. It does not make sense to put something  so harmful into our bodies and it is a shame because that is not the way it should be. And the really disgusting thing is, is why is this even an issue? Why is it so hard to produce a product that naturally comes from the earth? And why are we so unsatisfied that there is not enough of it to be distributed to the entire planet or it is not as big as we wanted it to be. To be completely blunt about it, I think it is really stupid. Also, I think the main reason for it is simply for profit. Again with America?s excessive nature and greediness, can we not just be satisfied with what we have where we have it as long as the quality is up to par? If some places can?t have banana?s I think they should deal with it, and if some places can?t have grapes I think they should deal with it too. It would be better than consuming mass quantities of empty non-living food everyday. I wish that we would focus more on enhancing the quality of life around us in our own environment instead of making money the top priority. There are obviously many environmental issues but the good news is that each individual can help reduce problems in the environment little by little by doing their bit. These can include unplugging electronics that are not being used, turning off lights when leaving a room, not leaving the refrigerator door open, and converting to using solar panels.  I am clearly no expert on the subject of environmentalism, but I do believe in improving the quality of life and know that a huge part of that is going to depend upon improving the quality of our environment. Other than that, from a spiritual standpoint, I also do believe that God created the earth, and out of sheer honor for him, we should also treat his creation with honor.

Thus, women should certainly have access to it. But many people who care strongly about women's rights want unfettered access to abortion at any stage in pregnancy.

They never informed me about how a woman might feel when she is presented with an unwanted pregnancy. They only took the fetus into consideration even though there is a woman who is already alive. For example, if a woman is raped and becomes pregnant, she should not have to have that child as a constant reminder about the trauma she went through. People tend to disregard the fact that pregnancy is a nine-month process. It is a heavy burden for someone who was raped to deal with. A woman has the right to control her body If a woman were to become pregnant, and it would effect her life in a way she wasn't ready for, who are we to tell her that she has to carry it anyways? Also, say she got raped? Forcing her to carry a child that she might not even love is cruel, both for the mother and the child.

Obviously, it is sad for everyone involved and a lot of thought should be put into an action as important as this. On one hand, you have the idea that it is up to mother because it is her body and logically should be her choice. But what would a father think if he wanted his unborn child to be alive? On the other hand we have to think that a life form, no matter how early it has been conceived is still alive. Some people might think that because a fetus isn't fully developed that it doesn't matter because they see it as a cell that's not a developed human being. If abortion is a major issue I think the use of birth control might be effective in eliminating unplanned pregnancies. But what about rape? That's a tricky topic and I still don't know how I feel about it. It seems to me that in 2014, abortion is not a hot button topic like it used to be. I never here anything about it in the news. Personally, I think it would be useless to try and outlaw abortion because people would continue to do it in private and no one would ever know about it.

We as humans were created to love all things and people around us, but it is very clear in multiple passages of Bible that people of he same gender are not to be intimate with each other.  A good thing that I must admit comes from same-sex relationships is that more children are adopted due to the fact that conception is impossible between the couple, but doesn't that also add to the case of same-sex marriage being wrong?  The relationship is unable to expand biologically without assistance from others.  The children whom are adopted by same-sex couples do have the same chances of experiencing love that children of heterosexual couples do, but whether there is love or not, children were intended to be raised by a father and a mother. In saying all this, it is important to mention that simply disagreeing with same-sex relationships does not mean I condemn those who do condone them or practice same-sex relations themselves.

We have to look at their situations before we judge, especially in the extreme cases such as rape, incest, and to save a woman's life because of pregnancy. It is completely their choice since it's their body. Now, I don't mean to say that abortion should be completely legalized. I support the first trimester abortion, but I'm totally against the second and third trimester. If they were to get an abortion, they should do it very early, instead of waiting until the halfway or until the end. I believe that abortion should be legal as long as women get their abortion in their early trimester. I support legal abortion for some reasons and others not so much. Every time I hear a someone talking about abortion, I picture their situation in life, if they're financially struggling, not having any support after the birth, their risk from giving birth, and other tragic cases.

She shouldn?t have to deal with the decision of killing the fetus or having a baby from the man who raped her. I also believe it is not a big deal when it is as little as it is. I feel it is better for the baby to not come in the world at all if the mother and/or father cannot provide for the child. Abortion is just as bad as bringing an unwanted child into this world that could possibly live a miserable life. But on the flip side I also think there should be a limit to the amount of abortions you can have in a certain period of time. If you are being careless and just having unprotected sex knowing you can just abort the baby then I think that should be against the law and they should be punished. I would say more towards 3 months is when it starts getting complicated. This is when I can see the ethical issues that others see.

Also, I believe the people involved must have to ask their parents for permission. If their parents give them permission to do it then I believe they should be able to do without any questions asked. If the parents disagree on whether or not they should let it happen, I believe it should come down to the childrens decisions. If the parent says no to having an abortion then they should not be able to have the abortion at all.

It is hard for some people to see that abortion is actually a good thing because they view it as killing a life tat has not had a chance to fight for themselves. My primary reason why I believe that abortion should be allowed in todays world is because it allows people to live their lives as they want to without having to bring a child that needs love and caring. Its hard to raise a child when the family cannot give proper care to the child. I feel as if the world needs to come to a better understanding of why abortion is actually a good thing and why it should not be viewed by people as killing a life. It makes no sense to bring a child into the world that does not have the proper family care that involves things such ass food, time, and money to support the child. This would just bring up the child into a horrible family that should not have the child. A child needs all of these things and a poor family cannot give this too the child.

As far as government involvement in regards to recycling, I think there is more they can do although they do a good job as it is.

God does not hate the gays and doesn?t send them to hell, he just wants them to understand that they cant act upon those feelings. A man and women should be able to get married, not a women and a women and a man and a man. God did not create Adam and Steve, he created Adam and eve.

If God did not want man and women having sex and producing babies, he would have never created that hole.

Lastly my own Ethics, I believe that it is morally wrong to kill a helpless baby that didn't do anything wrong.  I also think it is ethically wrong, because it is the murder of another human being.  It is just like the holocaust in a sense that you are killing a helpless human being (not just killing, but murdering innocent civilians).  Many people would argue that you are killing someone that isn't even alive yet, but do you really think killing a precious baby is a morally and ethical right thing to do.

There are tons of people that would love to have children and are incapable. Many of them will even pay all the medical costs to ensure the child is safe during the pregnancy.

Millions of children are born with cleft palates. Turns out we have amazing medical science now. If the child has a deformity, how about you do what parents are suppose to do. Take care of your child! They have a deformity, they are hurt you make it better. That is your job as a parent. Don't want that job? Don't become a parent. Birth control failure?

In addition to the current same-sex marriage discrimination, our government has used the marriage license restrictions to prevent inter-racial marriages in the past.    In my opinion, the best way to resolve this issue, and probably the only way to truly end marriage contract's discrimination, is to discontinue the issuing of more government licenses, and allow all competent and consenting adult individuals to create their own social contracts. Personally, I will never ask the government for permission to have a life partner, and I find it hard to understand why some many people still denigrate themselves by asking permission to do something that should already be their right to do.",,3,3,3,6,6,6,1,1,4,2,1,5,3,3,1,4,4,4,6,6,1,4,2,1,2,2,1,4,1,3,1,29,8,47,agnostic,5,3,Computer Science,8,10

I think some people let emotion dictate their feelings about the environment rather than reason and logic. This can be dangerous because people will be biased and choose to ignore facts. This would only hurt the future of mankind. Governments should balance the rights of its citizens with the necessity of caring for the environment. I have heard ideas of making wild life refuges across entire US states and banning human habitation of those areas and forcing people to live in large cities. This is foolish and does more to hurt the environment than to help it. There is a real problem in countries such as China and India where the population is over 1 billion people.

It seems to me that eventually states that are opposed to gay marriage will cave in because it is becoming commonly accepted. It's 2014 and I think people are starting to realize how much time and energy we are wasting by focusing on such a silly issue as to whether or not two people can get married or not. Personally, I don't care, gay marriage doesn't bother me at all. Even if it is illegal, people will still be in relationships regardless.

If you are mature/old enough to be involved in sexual activity, then you are mature/old enough to deal with all possible consequences. Birth control exists for this very reason, and it is selfish to end a life because you do not like the consequences. I understand that it is unfortunate when you take all possible precautions and still end up pregnant, but sometimes unfortunate things happen that are out of our control. For example, you could be a safe driver who follows all traffic laws, but you could still end up getting in an accident even though you are careful. But that doesn't mean you can just avoid the concequences of the accident. As I stated previously, if someone believes they are mature enough to have sex, they are mature enough to deal with the consequences. Many will argue that in cases of rape, abortion should be allowed to not force the victim into having to raise her rapist's child. I do agree that it would be awful for a woman to have to raise her rapist's child, but still don't believe that abortion is the answer. It's still a child, no matter who the father is. If the mother does not want to raise the child, there are other options, like adoption. It would be very difficult to go the 9 months with the constant reminder of the rape, but bad stuff happens to good people all the time, that's just how life works.

Creating a new life is always a blessing and should be a happy memory and should never be taken for granted. I also believe putting up the child up for adoption in the case a woman finds herself pregnant and not wanting it is a far better choice.

As the slogan goes, love is love; it doesn't matter if it's between a male and a female, or two males, or two females. the only reason same-sex marriage is banned in certain states is because of radical religious groups, i.e. Westboro Baptist Church, who whole-heartedly believe it's a sin and should not be allowed. I was raised a conservative Christian, so I can understand where these claims are coming from, although I don't have the same views on it myself. The Bible has been proven time and again to have multiple different meanings, depending on how people interpret it. But the first thing you're taught in Sunday school is God loves everyone, no matter what, and people should not judge others and treat them like you would want to be treated. So it boggles my mind how some people can contribute and spread so much hate to same-sex couples, literally defying the main principle of Christianity, and call themselves Christians.I believe the debate is very generational though. Most of the people I've talked to who are around my age have no problem with same-sex marriage. I have no exact data to back this up, but most of the people who you see protesting it look to be in the 30+ age range. I think this is because of how people were raised. For example, in the civil rights era, the adults of that generation were raised to look a certain way at social order, which wasn't questioned when they were growing up. Therefore, they inherited their prejudiced ways from the generations behind them. Today, we look at them as being very prejudiced and discriminatory people.

I do believe that once a child is conceived, then that egg becomes a human being regardless of it being just a cell. If a woman wants to have an abortion, then that decision is up to her and no one else; not her parents, the baby?s father, or any peers. Sure, her actions may have implications on her family, herself, and the baby?s father, but it is, after all, her body; and she can do with it what she wants. Some that are pro-choice believe the same as I do. The people that are pro-life believe that all life is sacred, that abortion is a sin. Of course, I do not believe that to be all pro-life believers but that is what I believe to be the major reasoning behind their views. If a woman was raped and the result was not only lowered self-esteem but a pregnancy, and wanted to get an abortion; I sure will not stop them. If I got pregnant and I knew I was not ready to have a baby and it was early in the pregnancy, I would, personally, still keep the baby and then find the best option for her/him. Whether the option being to give the baby up for adoption (closed or open) or keeping the baby and doing everything I can to provide for him/her. The argument on whether or not abortion is right or wrong is a matter of different opinions, and will be around for a very long time.

Well, on the subject of recycling, I never considered it be such a big deal until I arrived at college. Our rooms come with a recycle bin that I never use even when I did have things that needed to be recycled. That was until, one day my friend made the argument that If I can take the steps to throw the garbage in the trash can, then I should be able to put the same amount of energy into putting recyclable items in the recycle bin. I think its important to recycle because it can reduce the amount of plastic bottles and waste that goes into the water supply. I do not think that as a teenage American we take recycling as serious as we should because we have so many different water filtration devices that can remove any waste or toxic things from the water. We we have to remember is that animals do not.   Animals have to live in the water that we dump waste into and they can not leave it without dying. I take this stance and or opinion on recycling because everyone and every living thing deserve the opportunity to live in a clean and safe environment and the only way that is going to happen is if we recycle and keep the land and water clean.

Now if I were in that situation I am not saying that i would do that but i do believe that people should have the right to choose. So in that case i am pro-choice. Anyone put into that situation has to go through making that tough decision. No one should have to go through something like that cause it does break people down and scar them for life. Some women, after having an abortion when they are younger are not able to have kids when they are older and that messes them up. So that they must adopt, which is not neccesarily a bad thing. Adopting can be a great experience for people even though it is not their own child it still can suffice for what they lost a long time ago. But that abortion will probably always be in their mind and is something they will never forget. Again it is not something that i would choose to do but some people do have that right.

I think we should have more biodegradable products instead of using so much plastic, this would eliminate a lot of unneeded waste in the landfill for those who do not recycle. Clean energy also is vital in order for environment to stay reasonably clean. I believe this because we have to preserve our environment for our future and our children's future as well. Teaching children and showing how to help the environment by recycling, planting trees, car pooling and using less water can make an impact for the future. The conservation of water I feel is also a big concern.  We often waste water without realizing it, showing children what an impact it can make can help them try to conserve and use less water. I feel like educated those of this issue with the environment would help it dramatically. The environment is slowly becoming a victim of society with our new technologies. People need to open up their eyes and look at what they are doing to the beautiful world they live in.  We all need to do our part in preserving what we have left or else we may end up with nothing at all.

It seems that the world has forgotten that our earth is not some large trash can. We have to properly preserve it, and it can be done in so many simple ways. With some research I was able to find out some simple ways to recycle and conserve energy. Some of these ideas include turning off your computer at night, do not rinse your dishes, use both sides of paper, wash clothes in cold or warm water, and pay your bills online. These ideas are so easy to do and can really make a huge difference. I also found some reasons on why we should recycle. These reasons include creating jobs, it is good for our economy, it reduces waste, saves energy and prevents global warming. If everyone did their part in recycling, our world would be such a better place.If we did not recycle the world would be in great danger. Without recycling, there is the risk that our homes and habitats could be destroyed, we may not have any more everyday resources, and people could die of toxic gases and even the horrible stink of trash. The most important reason to recycle is most probably because if people don?t recycle, everyday resources will soon disappear.

I think it all depends on the situation and I think the woman has a right to choose what to do with her body. There are certain cases where an abortion may be the smartest choice for example a 14 year old who is raped by her father? Having to see a product of a memory that girl would like to forget would affect the girl and the child. I think the baby should grow into the stages where it is a human. If it is still not developed I believe it is okay. Especially if the child will be growing in a unsafe or unhealthy environment with for example unfit parents who are not ready for a child. Adoption can be a smart solution but there are many children who do not get adopted and spend their lives in fosters home, etc. However, I don't like to speak about this issue because I have not fully had to experience it. It's very easy for total strangers to tell you that having an abortion is wrong or right, and it's ok for them to feel that way. But no one should make that decision for someone else. Having an abortion is never a easy decision.

They should be able to see each other when they are hospitalized. My reasons are simple: I know that all people are people and all love is love. All people Deserve the same amount of respect. That includes respecting their lifestyle, even if it differs from your own. In my eyes, the equality is a given, but the government, and indeed many people, don't think the same way. If you find the one person you want to spend the rest of your life with, you should be able to marry them and have the same rights as any other couple. This applies to a man and a woman, two men, two women, and any other combination of sexes and genders. Same-sex relationships are not a new thing, either.

I take this very seriously. Its unhealthy and not something people were ""born with"". God created Adam and Eve. Not Adam and Zack, or Eve and Jill. The idea of being gay or lesbian is a choice that the person chooses to be or not to be. We have control over our emotions and even though it may not feel like it we really do. Its a matter of control. So morally I think it is very wrong and do not support it. However in the area of government I think that government should not dictate what marriage entails and that is up to the couple. So government should keep out of that and allow it because it is a right but by no means do I support it. Its really something that should not be mandated in such a strict way by a government who prides itself on freedom. Government should only be involved in legal issues and though you get married under the legal system there isn?t anything that says it has to be a man and a woman. Personally I find it odd but try to be loving to those that are. Although I don?t understand it, that doesn?t mean that they don?t desire the same things I do. To fit in, to belong, and to be loved.

However, certain tragedies such as rape do happen, and too frequently for comfort. So I believe that in order to compromise abortion should only be legal within the first month/ couple months of becoming pregnant. In my opinion, this covers both pro-life and pro-choice. Because while it is still a child, in the first couple of months the embryo is unable to smile, move it's fingers and toes, etc.. Once a baby gets to this point in their growth, it is wrong to take their life. With this put in play, America can expect to see a lot less unwanted pregnancies for woman who have been raped, or young girls. This may even decrease the amount of children in orphanages across America. Along with these abortion laws set, It would be wise for America to thoroughly stress the importance of safe sex, and the real consequences of teen pregnancy. While in high school, girls should be strongly recommended to take a course on being safe with sex, as well as a self defense course training them to know what to do if they are attacked. I have taken the SHARP (sexual harassment and rape prevention) course and I now feel fully equipped to protect myself, and avoid rape and/or unwanted pregnancy.

Now that I am thinking about it I can see the issue. Being environmentally friendly is really important to the earth and to us.  Without clean energy and recycling we wont be able to preserve the earths? ecosystem. Environmentalism is there to help us protect the earth for further generations. We want people after us to be able to see the earth as we see it. As a population, we need to make sure that we leave the earth in better condition than we found it. Recycling is a very important concept in environmentalism. Recycling does a lot of things that help the earth. It saves energy and prevents pollution and helps conserve natural resources.  It also decreases greenhouse gases, which help contribute to global warming. I think that recycling is an easy way that everyone can help out the earth. It only takes two extra seconds to put something in a recycling bin. Recycling shouldn?t be something that people think isn?t important in the long run. Recycling things now can help the earth and the people living on the earth in the future. Without us helping to save the earth, it wont be here to use for the future generations. Clean energy is another thing that environmentalism is trying to preserve. The need for clean energy and clean air is sentential. Every time I go to St Louis I can smell the air outside and it doesn?t smell clean at all. The air that some factories produce does not help the environment. There is many ways to use clean energy and reduce the energy that you use everyday. Switching light bulbs is an easy and fast way to conserve energy. Using florescent light bulbs compared to regular ones can help save energy.  Turning down your water heater to warm instead of hot is also an easy and fast way to make sure you?re helping conserve energy. I think that using clean energy and preserving the energy we do have is an important component in making sure the earth is in a good place. If you only take out a small amount of time out of your day, you can make sure that you are helping conserve the earth. I never thought about environmentalism being a big deal because I was always thinking about the issues that were going on in the foreground.

Too many people probably is one of the most important reasons that why we so many probably in the world today. For example, in many countries of Africa, they have too many people. We always see many poor kids pictures of America. But why they still give so many birth of children. China also had this problem before. Too many people, really hard to control!
