Customs and Border Protection said the suspects were seen loading  bundles of narcotics  into an off-road-style utility vehicle outside of Garciasville, a city in Texas up against the river. The suspects, apparently aware they had been seen, were able to  abruptly  drive the vehicle into the river and escape into Mexico,  writes the Washington Examiner. 705 lbs. of cocaine, caltrops, evidence of sophisticated counter surveillance and a splashdown in one encounter are an obvious reminder of the need for more personnel, technology, and infrastructure in the Rio Grande Valley,  said acting Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz. Transnational Criminal Organizations continue to exploit areas along our western corridor that accounts for more than 90 percent of our traffic,  he added.Read the full report at the Washington Examiner."

The legislation would prevent Trump from using funding from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works funds and military construction funding  for the construction of barriers, land acquisition, or any other associated activities on the southern border without specific statutory authorization from Congress  if he declared a national emergency,  reports The Hill. We must stand up and assert our role as a co-equal branch of government, and we must prevent the president from going around Congress to raid critical funds   for a politically-motivated, unjustified national emergency declaration that isn t based in reality,  said Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico.Read the full report at the Hill."
