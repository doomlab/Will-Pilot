If in a few months from now the Supreme Court looks like I m pretty scared it s going to, a court that would overturn Roe and make the president above the rule of law. What is to be done? According to footage from the event that NTK Network obtained on Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez replied:  I think that we take back the House, we take back the Senate, we take back the presidency, and we pack the Supreme Court of the United States of America. Left-wing activists have been demanding that Democrats become more aggressive when it comes to the Supreme Court after Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation hearings and Democrats like Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) have been referring to Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh as  illegitimate. After Kavanaugh was sworn in as retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy s replacement on the Supreme Court, left-wing law professors, editorial pages of left-wing and establishment media outlets, and even lawmakers like Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), who was the only sitting member of Congress to endorse Ocasio-Cortez before her shocking primary upset over Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY), have been insisting that Democrats must seriously consider packing the Supreme Court the next time Democrats control all three branches of government.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/11/josh-hawley-noticeable-surge-in-anger-from-voters-after-kavanaugh-circus/","Missouri Republican Senate Candidate Josh Hawley said this week that he has seen a  noticeable surge in anger among all voters  in the state after the Democrats tried to derail Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court nomination.Hawley, the state s attorney general, told ABC s  Powerhouse Politics  podcast that was released on Wednesday evening that  people just cannot believe what happened with the Kavanaugh process.  There s a noticeable change in atmosphere here in the state and a noticeable surge in enthusiasm among Republican voters,  Hawley said on the podcast.  But also, I would say a noticeable surge in anger among all voters in my state. Hawley added that voters in Missouri just  can t believe the games that Senate Democrats played. Hawley s race was the leading indicator when it came to how much of a boost the Kavanaugh confirmation circus would give Republican Senate candidates.In the days after Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) announced that she would be voting against Kavanaugh, Hawley took a two-point lead over McCaskill in the polls.Hawley, according to a poll released last week by a pro-Hawley super PAC, has since expanded his lead to eight percentage points over McCaskill. The way that they attempted to smear Justice Kavanaugh, what they did to Dr.[Christine Blasey] Ford to be treating her as collateral damage,  he added.  I get asked about it at every stop, every day.

Another six percent had  no opinion. Trump fulfilled one of his most important campaign promises by appointing conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The president also promised to right America s terrible trade deals in 2016. And after Trump negotiated the new USMCA trade agreement, 43% now approve of how Trump is handling trade, an improvement of eight percentage points from last month.In addition, 51% of Americans approve of Trump s handling of the economy while 53% believe the country is doing  very well  or  fairly well. During his campaign speeches this week, Trump emphasized that under his administration,  the era of economic surrender is over.  After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation,  Trump said.One of Trump s major 2020 reelection slogans will be  promises made, promises kept. The poll was conducted October 4-7 and has a margin of error of +/- 3.8 percentage points.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/11/jeff-merkley-doj-should-absolutely-pursue-felony-charges-against-kavanaugh-for-perjury/","Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), a potential 2020 presidential candidate, said this week that he will push for the Justice Department to  pursue felony charges  against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh for lying to the Senate during his confirmation hearings.In an interview on The Intercept s  Deconstructed  podcast that was released on Thursday, Merkley was asked what Democrats could do about Kavanaugh since they are not going to have 67 votes to impeach him in the near future. Let s start with the proposition that the Justice Department could, obviously under a different leader than President Trump, proceed to pursue felony charges against Brett Kavanaugh for perjury before the U.S. Senate,  Merkley said.When asked if he would be pushing for that, Merkley replied,  Absolutely. Merkley further added that the Supreme Court is now  the most powerful legislative body  and declared that  it is a legislative body controlled by and for the powerful rather than by and for the people. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), who is set to become the chair of the House Judiciary Committee if Democrats take back the House after November, recently said the House would further investigate the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh if Democrats are in charge next year. It is not something we are eager to do,  Nadler reportedly said.  But the Senate having failed to do its proper constitutionally mandated job of advise and consent, we are going to have to do something to provide a check and balance, to protect the rule of law and to protect the legitimacy of one of our most important institutions. Merkley s comments further reveal that Democrats are not going to let Kavanaugh s confirmation go and offer a preview of what Democrats could try to do if they end up controlling all three branches of government after the 2020 elections.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/10/11/law-students-organize-nationwide-3-day-walkout-over-brett-kavanaugh/","Law students around the country are skipping class this week to protest Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation to the Supreme Court.Law students around the country are in the middle of a three-day walkout protest over Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States. Starting on Wednesday, students at law schools around the country walked out of their classrooms at 2:15 p.m. with the intention of returning on Monday morning. The students believe their protest will encourage congressional candidates to announce their commitment to impeaching recently confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.Students at the law schools at American University, Duke University, Emory University, Georgetown University, New York University, and Temple University have signed on to participate in the protest.In an open letter on the StrikeAgainstKavanaugh.com, student organizers say that they don t believe Brett Kavanaugh is a  legitimate  Supreme Court justice. The letter makes an unusual tie-in to America s history of brutality against Native Americans.We are in the middle of a national emergency. Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed to the Supreme Court. We cannot accept a system that empowers a man who repeatedly lied under oath and a judiciary review process that only performs a sham of an investigation into his misconduct. We do not recognize Kavanaugh as a legitimate member of the United States Supreme Court.As we announce this strike on Indigenous Peoples  Day, we recognize the ongoing harm indigenous people have suffered under the American legal system. The United States was borne out of conquest of indigenous people by European colonizers whose descendants became this country s founders. Since the Supreme Court s first case involving indigenous rights, the Court has heard hundreds of cases and it has been grossly unjust to indigenous plaintiffs and defendants. Later this term, the Court   could curtail the hunting rights of the Crow Tribes, rights which are  central to [the] Tribes  subsistence, economy, culture, spiritual life, and day-to-day existence.  We do not believe that Kavanaugh will be a champion for indigenous peoples  rights, and fear the worst for the indigenous communities who have already faced so much harm from the Court.A local news report from Wednesday revealed that students at Ohio State University s law school walked out of their classrooms at 11:10 a.m. to protest Kavanaugh s confirmation. Students told reporters that they believed that Dr. Ford s allegations were not taken seriously by members of Congress. Some said that they participated in the protest to bring attention to the ever-present issue of sexual assault.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/11/mike-braun-hammers-joe-donnelly-for-hillary-clinton-support-opposition-to-brett-kavanaugh/","Hoosier businessman Mike Braun slammed Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN) in a campaign ad released Thursday for supporting Hillary Clinton. He also took issue with his opposition to confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Braun, the Indiana Senate Republican candidate, released a campaign ad hammering the Hoosier Democrat for opposing Kavanaugh, supporting Obama s Iran nuclear deal, outsourcing jobs to Mexico, and supporting Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election. Hillary for President? And Donnelly says he s for common sense? Sorry, Senator, you re just not one of us. You re one of them,  the narrator in the ad said. Hoosiers know it s not what you say, it s what you ve done: Senator Donnelly joined the extreme left in opposing Justice Kavanaugh, fell in line with President Obama s dangerous Iran nuclear deal, profited from outsourcing Hoosier jobs to Mexico, and worked nonstop to elect Hillary Clinton,  said Braun in a press release on Thursday.  Donnelly will say anything, but look at what he s done: he s not one of us, he s one of them. Donnelly s opposition to Kavanaugh caused the Indiana News-Sentinel to publish an editorial urging Hoosier voters to vote  no  against the Indiana Democrat for another term in the U.S. Senate.Braun s new ad comes off the heels of an exclusive Breitbart News report which revealed that the Indiana GOP filed a Senate Ethics complaint over Donnelly s  illegal  use of an official Neil Gorsuch photo in a campaign ad.Last year the Associated Press (AP) reported that while Sen. Donnelly criticized Carrier Corp. for moving manufacturing jobs to Mexico, he profited from a family business that relied on Mexican labor to produce dye for ink pads.Donnelly, during his first run for the House in 2004, railed against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and called  outsourcing,   a fancy term for Someone in Indiana has just lost their job. Braun told Breitbart News in an interview that in contrast to Donnelly, he hires exclusively in the United States and most of his suppliers for his business also come from America.The Indiana Senate race has become increasingly competitive; a Fox News poll found that Sen. Donnelly leads Braun by only two points, well within the survey s margin of error.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/11/indiana-news-sentinel-editorial-hoosiers-should-vote-against-joe-donnelly/","The Indiana News-Sentinel published an editorial on Thursday urging Hoosiers to vote against Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), citing his vote opposing Judge Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.The News-Sentinel suggested that Donnelly would imperil his political future if he were to oppose President Donald Trump s nominee to the Supreme Court; Donnelly voted against confirming Kavanaugh last Saturday despite polls showing an increasingly tight race between him and Hoosier businessman Mike Braun.The Hoosier paper also pointed out that despite Donnelly s vote against the president s nominee, during Monday s debate against Braun and Libertarian candidate Lucy Brenton, he attempted to tie himself with Donald Trump. It was clear in the televised, hour-long debate that Donnelly was hitching himself to the president as much as possible to assuage the concerns of Indiana s swing voters who may have voted for Trump in 2016,  the News-Sentinel wrote. I go against my party all the time,  Donnelly said in an attempt to rebuke Braun s attack that he follows Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer s (D-NY) marching orders.  I ve been with the president 62 percent of the time. However, the Hoosier paper notes that the same Congressional Quarterly report details how Donnelly also voted with the Democrat party 74 percent of the time, and another report notes that Donnelly voted with Schumer 85 percent of the time since 2013.During the debate, Braun said that a vote for Donnelly represents the status quo. If you want more of the same. Joe s your guy,  Braun said.On Monday s debate, the Hoosier Democrat said that he opposed Kavanaugh due to his alleged  impartiality and judicial temperament,  despite that Donnelly cites Christine Blasey Ford s sexual assault accusation against Kavanaugh as his primary concern. Donnelly said that Ford s testimony was  disturbing and credible  and called on the FBI to investigate the accusation. Donnelly never mentioned the judge s temperament or any issues of impartiality until after the FBI s report that there was nothing to substantiate Ford s claims,  the News-Sentinel explained.The Hoosier News-Sentinel contended that no matter the explanation, Sen. Donnelly, and most Senate Democrats, planned to vote against Kavanaugh to block a conservative majority on the Supreme Court and because of that, Hoosiers should vote against Donnelly in November. We still believe Donnelly, like the vast majority of Democrats, was set on voting  no  against Kavanaugh no matter what in order to block a conservative majority on the court,  the Hoosier paper concluded.  And for that, we still believe Indiana should vote  no  for another Donnelly term in Washington.

God, I wish I could get through to the 52 percent of white women who put Trump in office, but they re too far gone, so instead I am looking to young people,  Sarah Silverman said.Silverman also went after Brett Kavanaugh, saying,  If I think of his frowny pink face and his Pert Plus hair one more time I m gonna puke. The School of Rock actress then urged young people to vote, saying that if young people don t want to listen to her, they should at least listen to pop star Taylor Swift. Yes, Taylor s a little late to the game and waited until the American leg of her tour was over to speak up but hey, better late than never, ever, getting back together, fuck, her songs are so catchy, look what you made me do.  the 47-year-old comedian said, referencing a number of songs by Taylor Swift.Swift made headlines for endorsing two Tennessee Democrats in an Instagram post this week. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent,  Swift wrote. I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Silverman has long been an outspoken progressive. Just last weekend, she posted a sickening tweet where she fantasized about President Trump being  held down  and violated.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/11/christine-blasey-ford-nominated-for-distinguished-alumna-award-at-unc/","An English professor at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill has nominated Christine Blasey Ford for a distinguished-alumna award for  speaking truth to power. Professor Jennifer Ho said in her letter of nomination that  what Dr. Blasey Ford did on September 27, 2018 was something that was extraordinary in how ordinary it was: she told the truth about a sexual assault she experienced when she was fifteen years old at the hands of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.  She made a statement and then answered questions for over three hours in front of a Senate Judiciary Committee with the cameras of the world trained on her,  Ho said.Ford earned an undergraduate degree in Experimental Psychology in 1988 at UNC. Dr. Blasey Ford talked about how the first few years at Carolina were difficult for her  that her attack at the age of fifteen had lasting implications,  Ho wrote.In her letter, Ho said her words are  not about partisan politics,  but about how  speaking one s truth  is  an act of bravery.  We live in a society that does not believe women,  the professor said.  The many indignities that women experience in their day-to-day lives is proof of this, as is the continued attacks on Dr. Blasey Ford after her testimony. Ho said that Ford is  an inspiration for so many of us,  and that Kavanaugh s accuser  spoke clearly and precisely about her experiences with trauma, educating the committee and the rest of us about the way certain memories are encoded in the hippocampus when we experience traumatic events. Ho also described Ford  a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California  as showing  no evidence of avoidance or defensiveness  in her testimony and asserting to the Senate Judiciary Committee that  she is no one s pawn.  By awarding Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a distinguished alumna, UNC Chapel Hill sends a message to her, to our students, faculty, and staff, and to the larger community of the US and that world that we believe her,  Ho concluded,  that UNC Chapel Hill believes survivors of sexual assault.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/10/democrats-warily-eye-avenatti-2020-bid/","Some Democratic Party leaders are  warily  eyeing TV Resistance lawyer Michael Avenatti as he gears up for a potential 2020 bid, according to the Associated Press.According to the report,  some party leaders are worried about trying to replicate Trump s approach by backing another untested and unpredictable candidate   a concern that was heightened after Avenatti s involvement in the recent Supreme Court confirmation fight. Avenatti has dismissed criticism he helped Justice Brett Kavanaugh get confirmed after he presented a client, Julie Swetnick, who claimed she had been gang-raped at parties that Kavanaugh allegedly attended. She also claimed that Kavanaugh  spiked  punch at the parties, only to back away from that claim during a disastrous MSNBC interview. MSNBC later said they could not corroborate her stories with any of the four people she listed as witnesses.Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who cast a key vote for Kavanaugh, cited Swetnick s  outlandish  allegations in her decision.Avenatti told the AP the criticism is  being stoked by the Republicans and establishment Democrats that are very nervous about what my intentions are.  This is a direct response to individuals coming to the conclusion that I am a threat,  he said.According to the article, Avenatti has been undertaking serious preparation to make a bid in 2020, speaking with Democratic strategists in Washington, and state operatives. He has been speaking at Democratic Party dinners in Iowa and New Hampshire.Avenatti told the AP he has  donors lined up  should he run and that he would have no problem raising money. He has already launched a federal political action committee, The Fight PAC, and is being advised by Los Angeles-based fundraiser Tracy Austin, former Hillary Clinton campaign aide Adam Parkhomenko, and digital media strategist Stephen Solomon.He has also begun attacking other potential 2020 Democratic contenders, such as Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ). I have a lot of respect for @CoryBooker. But we have VERY different views as to how to solve the crisis of Donald Trump and the dumpster fire of his presidency. #FireWithFire #HitHarder #FightClub,  Avenatti tweeted after Booker went to Iowa.So far, his claim to fame has been representing porn actress Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had sex with Trump once more than a decade ago.Steve Shurtleff, the top Democrat in the New Hampshire state house, told the AP that Avenatti s entrance into the Kavanaugh confirmation process helped it become a  three-ring circus. Still, other Democrats disagree, saying his involvement fired up the party. As to whether it will help him as a candidate, Iowa Democrat Randy Brown, who hosted Avenatti at a Democratic fundraiser in August, seemed to demur.Avenatti was simply  doing what he does best   getting his name out there,  he said.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Breitbart News on Wednesday evening that Democrats have taken civility to a  new low  during Justice Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation process. I think they ve taken this to a new low, when if Kavanaugh s not rock bottom, God help us all,  he said exclusively to Breitbart News.Graham s comment came the same day Hillary Clinton called for incivility towards Republicans. You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about,  she told CNN.  That s why I believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and or the Senate, that s when civility can start again. It also came the same day former Attorney General Eric Holder called for physical measures.  When they go low, we kick  em.  That s what this new Democratic Party is about,  he said at a campaign event in Georgia.Graham delivered one of the most dramatic moments during Kavanaugh s confirmation at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week, where he excoriated Democrats for attempting to derail his nomination at the last minute with uncorroborated allegations of sexual assault. I would never do to them what you ve done to this guy,  he yelled.  This is the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics. And if you really wanted to know the truth, you sure as hell wouldn t have done what you ve done to this guy. The comment came after Graham delivered an address at a dinner hosted by the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) to celebrate U.S.-Israel military ties. At the beginning of his remarks, he had commented,   We believe in the rule of law, not mob rule. Asked later whether he was also referring to Kavanaugh s confirmation, he affirmed that he was, but also tied his remark to the Middle East. There s a process in the civilized world to arrive at decisions. Democracies don t go to war. What we re missing in the Mid-East is more democracies. If you had democracies in the Mid-East, you d have less war. I can t think of any war between two democracies, so the point here is that democracies are held together by the rule of law,  he said.

Today, SCR experienced the violent and totalitarian behavior of the unhinged Stanford left. During a Change My Mind  tabling event regarding the presumption of innocence and the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation, SCR s President was assaulted by Melinda Hernandez. A sophomore at Stanford, Hernandez approached our President, hit him in chest and forcefully pushed him back,  the group posted on Facebook. Our President is pressing full charges against Hernandez. Violence is completely unacceptable, and we will not allow anyone to get away with it. Throughout the day, our signs were vandalized and destroyed, and we will be posting more video and photos shortly. Stay tuned,  it said.The group posted pictures, including of sheriff s deputies on the scene and a torn up poster.Later, the group posted video of three students attempting to vandalize the table the Stanford College Republicans had set up. In addition to having our President assaulted by the violent and unhinged Melinda Hernandez, SCR members were harassed at yesterday s Change My Mind  table throughout the day. Leftists vandalized and destroyed our signs, threw paint and water at our members, and hurled insults and profanities for hours. This is the state of poltical discourse at Stanford University: defined by the violent and childlish antics of the unhinged left. The event mirrored others in Washington during Justice Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation process. Liberals swarmed the Capitol, protesting inside Senate buildings and on the steps of the Supreme Court.One viral video showed two young liberals harassing an elderly pro-Kavanaugh protester, who was holding up signs silently. At one point, one of of the young liberals hit and appeared to damage his signs.Look at these tolerant, progressive protesters dancing around this lone, 71 year old Trump supporter  they eventually try and rip his signs up but are stopped by organizers. pic.twitter.com/X8evmEzmzx  Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 6, 2018

Joe Donnelly (D-IN), a vulnerable Democrat up for re-election, for what it saysand Donnelly s own campaign spokesman admittedis an illegal use in a campaign ad of an official U.S. Senate photograph of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and Donnelly standing together before Gorsuch s confirmation.Ahead of its public release, Breitbart News has obtained a statement from the Indiana GOP chairman and a letter the Indiana GOP sent to the U.S. Senate Ethics Committee alleging Donnelly s campaign engaged in illegal activity that also violates Senate Ethics Rules for using the official Gorsuch photo in his campaign advertisement airing on television.In the television ad that Donnelly is airing in Indiana, Donnelly touts his supposed closeness with President Donald Trump. I have a 99 percent attendance recordbut it s not just about showing up,  Donnelly says in the ad, speaking directly into the camera.  It s about delivering for Hoosiers. Then a narrator comes on and says Donnelly  broke with his party and voted for Trump s border wall three times,  and then the narrator says:  And Joe voted for the president s first Supreme Court Justice, Neil Gorsuch. At that point, on screen is an official photograph of Donnelly standing with Gorsuch from their official U.S. Senate meeting when GorsuchTrump s first selection to the U.S. Supreme Court in the first year of his first termwas in the confirmation process. Donnelly ended up voting for Gorsuch, but Donnelly would laterin 2018, Trump s second yearvote against the president s second selection to the U.S. Supreme Cour, now- Justice Brett Kavanaugh.WATCH THE DONNELLY AD HERE:The official Senate photo of Donnelly with Gorsuch first appears at about 14 seconds into the above ad.This is significant for a number of reasons. Donnelly demonstrated he was in the end part and parcel of the radical leftist Democrat Senators  unsuccessful ploy to attempt to take down Kavanaugh with uncorroborated smears and baseless, evidence-free allegations. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, during the confirmation process of Kavanaugh, Donnelly s team also filmed and photographed the official U.S. Senate meeting the Democrat senator had with Kavanaugh before he announced he was a no. At that time, it was expected Donnelly may, as he did with Gorsuch, eventually vote in favor of Kavanaugh s confirmation.When it was revealed publicly that Donnelly and his official Senate staff used government resources to film and photograph the meeting, the Indiana GOP cried fou,l warning Donnelly against using such materials in campaign advertisements. In a Breitbart News exclusive at the time, Josh Kelley, the spokesman for Donnelly s GOP challenger businessman Mike Braun, hammered Donnelly for serious ethical lapses with regards to the footage:Career politician Joe Donnelly blocked cameras from his meeting with Judge Kavanaugh, but that didn t stop him from secretly filming the meeting so his buddy Chuck Schumer and other liberals could use the footage for political ads. This behavior reaffirms that Donnelly will vote for Kavanaugh once his confirmation is secured, and his taxpayer-funded office creating footage for campaign ads borders on serious ethical issues.Taken aback by the forceful condemnation of their tactics and use of government resources potentially for campaign purposes, Donnelly s spokesman pushed back at the time in a local news report, actually admitting that use of those photographs or videos from the Kavanaugh meeting in any Donnelly campaign ad would be outright  illegal.  This nakedly political stunt is just the latest bald-faced lie from Rep. Braun s campaign. The fact of the matter is that Donnelly for Indiana has no intention of using that footage in an ad   but more importantly, even if the campaign or any outside group wanted to use this footage, it would be illegal,  Donnelly campaign spokesman Will Baskin-Gerwitz said, per the Journal-Gazette in August of this year.Donnelly ended up voting against Kavanaugh in the end, so that footage and those photos were useless politically for him and he is paying dearly for the move back home in Indiana with just weeks to go before the Nov. 6 midterm election. But that raises the question: Would the same behavior Donnelly s team says is illegal regarding Kavanaugh be equally illegal with another Supreme Court Justice, like Gorsuch?And that s where the Indiana GOP comes in, with regard to this new ad that Donnelly is hitting airwaves with in Indiana featuring an official photograph of the senator and Gorsuch. In a statement that will be released publicly on Thursday morning but was provided to Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday night,  Indiana GOP chairman Kyle Hupfer unloaded. Hupfer said in the statement.Democrat Joe Donnelly is so desperate to fool Hoosiers into thinking he s a not a liberal Democrat, he ll violate Senate ethics and break federal law to do it. Even his own spokesman admitted it s illega. Back in August, Democrat Donnelly s campaign said politicizing the confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice would be a disservice to Hoosiers. Since then, Donnelly s Democrat Party has led a three-ring circus to delay and destroy Justice Kavanaugh. Now, as Donnelly is illegally abusing taxpayer resources to politicize a Supreme Court nominee to save his job, Hoosiers can see it s Donnelly who s doing them a real disservice. Today, I am filing a formal complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate Senator Donnelly s flagrant abuse of taxpayer dollars in a desperate bid to get re-electeqed. In the meantime, Donnelly s campaign must immediately cease running this ad and issue a public apology to Hoosier taxpayers.The Indiana GOP, at Hupfer s direction, has filed an official ethics complaint with the U.S. Senate Ethics Committee about Donnelly s new ad. In the letter to Senate Ethics Committee chairman Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Ranking Member Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), obtained by Breitbart News ahead of its public release, the Indiana GOP requests a formal Senate Ethics Committee investigation of Donnelly s  improper and illegal use of official resources for campaign purposes  which the Indiana GOP charges is in violation of 31 U.S.C. 1301(a) and U.S. Senate Ethics Rules.In the letter to the Senate Ethics Committee leaders, the Indiana GOP argues that this is a violation of federal law and a violation of Senate Ethics Rules. The Indiana GOP wrote to the Senate Ethics Committee in the letter dated October 10:Federal law and Senate Ethics Rules make clear that official resources may only be used for official purposes. The General Appropriations Statute, 31 U.S.C. § 1301 states that appropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.  This Committee has made clear that this statute means it is thus inappropriate to use any official resources to conduct campaign or political activities.  Additionally, Senate space, equipment, staff time and resources generally should not be used to assist campaign organizations. The letter cites the Senate Ethics manual and various federal laws to make its case. The Indiana GOP wrote, citing a 1982 case.:Federal case law has also affirmed that Congress has recognized the basic principle that government funds should not be spent to help incumbents gain reelection. Senate Internet Services and Technology Resources Usage Rules adopted by the Senate Rules Committee also state that the use of Senate Internet Services and Senate technology resources for campaign purposes is prohibited.The letter also quotes the Donnelly spokesman admitting that such behavior would be illegal and says that the Indiana GOP agrees with Donnelly s spokesman about that:A spokesman for Donnelly s campaign previously acknowledged that using material posted online by Donnelly s official Senate office for campaign purposes would violate Senate Ethics Rules. In response to a complaint related to a video of Donnelly and Justice Kavanaugh posted by Donnelly s official office, Donnelly s spokesman said that if the [Donnelly] campaign or any outside group wanted to use this footage, it would be illegal  We agree. Like the video of Donnelly and Kavanaugh, the picture used in the advertisement by the Donnelly campaign was taken in Donnelly s Senate office and posted online by an account for Donnelly s official office. By Donnelly s own admission, this use of official resources is illegal.It remains to be seen where this goes from here, but this does not appear to be a positive development for Donnelly.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/10/project-veritas-video-campaign-staffers-say-phil-bredesen-lied-about-kavanaugh-vote/","Campaign staffers for Tennessee Democrat Senate nominee Phil Bredesen say he lied on Friday when he released a statement saying he would have voted  yes  to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, according to a new undercover video released by Project Veritas Action on Wednesday night.Bredesen campaign field organizer Maria Amalla was captured on video by a female journalist sent undercover into one of the Bredesen campaign s Nashville offices describing Bredesen s statement on Friday as  a political move  that was necessary because  he s trying to make up points. The undercover journalist told another person, identified in the Project Veritas video as Will Stewart, Phil Bredesen Campaign:  I was so confused because I just can t believe he would actually vote yes [to confirm Kavanaugh.]  He wouldn t. He s just saying he would,  Stewart said in response.Bredesen trails Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN-07), the Republican nominee, by eight points in a CBS Poll released on Sunday.Another exchange between the undercover journalist and a person identified as James Miller, Voter Protection, Bredesen Campaign, was equally illuminating. Because, I mean he [Phil Bredesen] wouldn t really [vote to confirm Kavanaugh], right?  the journalist asked Miller. I don t think so. Um, and I think it s not reassuring, but it s something that I think gives me . . . The feeling is that of reassurance, but it s certainly not reassuring. I think much like Doug Jones, or somebody,  Miller answered. Who did you say?  the journalist asked. Doug Jones of Alabama. That guy didn t vote for him [Kavanaugh]. Phil Bredesen s not going to vote for him [Kavanaugh]. The only reason Joe Manchin did is he s running right now,  Miller said. The dialogue continued:Miller: Once you re in, six years, you re gonna do the right thing.Journalist: He ll be a good Democrat, I know he will.Miller: 100 percent. Always has been.Journalist: It s just a political move, right?Miller: YeahJournalist: That s the only way I canMiller: But, isn t it gross?Journalist: YesMiller: Yeah, that s like the way it has to goJournalist: I just hate that he has to like lie to get that voteMiller: I know, I know. Tell me about it. Unfortunately, that s realityAccording to the people identified by Project Veritas as Bredesen campaign staffers filmed on the video, Bredesen has misled Tennessee voters about how he views President Donald Trump as well. I ld like to think in my little heart that he s not a super fan of Trump,  the undercover journalist said on the video. He s not. Between you and me, once Phil actually gets into the Senate, he ll be a good Democrat,  Will Stewart said, adding:Stewart: And it s also just the start of something big, you know?Journalist: The resistance.Stewart: Yeah. Yeah. We don t say that out of these walls. But here, of course, we talk about that. Cause it s so funny. The message is, like, don t talk about the blue wave.We re not running against Trump. All this sort of stuff. Even though that s all why we are all here. We can t put it out there. I can t help but think that Phil is the same way though,  the journalist said. Oh yeah. Oh, he hates Trump, like yeah. He s not going to be running for re-election. He can get in there and do the right thing,  Stewart responded.Those working at the Bredesen Senate campaign office in Nashville also had very clear instructions about how to  stay on message  by not discussing  the Blue Wave  or Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) with voters:Bredesen staffer: Did you hear about that?Stewart: The Blue wave?Staffer: Yeah, you can t say that too often here.Journalist: I don t understand why, though?Stewart: We re allowed to say it, but it s off messageStaffer: Yeah, the others?Journalist: What others?Stewart: Like, campaign-wide, it s not our message. You can say it in here, but like on those calls and stuff, that s not a message we want to be sending. Because we re not runningBredesen campaign worker Drew: We would scare all the people who would vote for Phil Bredesen but not Chuck Schumer.Stewart: Yeah, exactly, because there s a lot of people who are Republicans who are going to vote for him. You can watch the full video here.

Audrey Cooper (@audreycoopersf) October 10, 2018The idea of impeaching Kavanaugh has been floating around Democratic Party circles for several days, even before Kavanaugh was confirmed last week. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), who would chair the House Judiciary Committee if Democrats take control, said that he would re-open investigations into alleged sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh.
Last month, after confirmation hearings in the Senate had concluded, Kavanaugh was suddenly accused of sexual misconduct more than three decades before, when he was in high school and university. He denied the claims vigorously, and no corrobroating evidence was ever produced to support the allegations. Outrage over the way Democrats pursued the claims against Kavanaugh has been cited in several recent polls as boosting Republican enthusiasm to turn out in the election.Pelosi has indicated that she intends to run for Speaker of the House if Democrats win. She held the position from 2007 to 2011, and clung to power in her caucus after leading her party to historic defeat in 2010.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Joe Manchin (D-WV) have struck a virtual dead heat, according to a poll released on Wednesday.A new poll commissioned by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) found that Manchin leads by only one point41 to 40 percentover Morrisey in the West Virginia Senate race. The poll surveyed 600 likely voters from October 7-10 and had a margin of error of four points, making the race a virtual toss-up.The NRSC survey polled voters immediately after Sen. Manchin voted to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.The poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies also found that Manchin s favorability hit a new low 45 percent of West Virginia voters have a favorable opinion of Manchin, while 50 percent of voters have an unfavorable view of the incumbent Democrat. Forty-five percent of voters, or a plurality of voters, consider themselves conservative while only 17 percent of West Virginians consider Sen. Manchin conservative.West Virginian voters also said that recent campaign ads had given them a negative impression of Sen. Manchin. Of the 90 percent of voters who said that they have recently read or heard something about Manchin, 54 percent said that it made them less likely to vote for him, compared to 32 percent who said that it made them more likely to back Sen. Manchin.The NRSC poll found that President Donald Trump remains popular in the state and that they would rather have a Republican represent their interests in the U.S. Senate. President has a 62 percent approval rating in the state, and 44 percent of voters said that they would rather have a Republican represent them, compared to 39 percent who would rather have a Democrat in the U.S. Senate.Nathan Brand, a spokesman for Morrisey, said in a statement on Wednesday that Manchin s support will continue to drop as they learn about his liberal voting record. Brand said:As West Virginia voters learn more about Joe Manchin s record of being a dishonest Washington liberal who stood with Obama for gun control, and supported Hillary Clinton for President, they know he can t be trusted. This race will come down to who voters trust to stand with President Trump, and the choice is clear: Morrisey is the Trump endorsed candidate while Joe Manchin is one more vote for Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi s resist and obstruct circus.This new survey comes on the heels of a Morning Consult survey which found that Manchin was one of the top ten least popular senators, with a 43 percent unfavorable rating and a 44 percent approval rating.Sen. Manchin represents a deep-red state that went for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election by 42 points.Attorney General Morrisey continues to attack Manchin for refusing to be the deciding vote for Kavanaugh, contending that he only came out for the president s nominee only after Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) announced her vote to support Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.Morrisey tweeted,  Amazing to hear such dishonesty from @JoeManchinWV on radio this AM. Manchin misleads Hoppy about his cloture vote   Manchin ducked making a decision until Collins voted for Kavanaugh. That s because he promised Schumer he wouldn t be the deciding vote.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/10/after-democrats-fail-on-kavanaugh-poll-shows-washington-state-battleground-district-moving-safely-back-to-gop/","A new poll from Washington s eighth congressional district shows Republican Dino Rossi raking a commanding lead over Democrat Kim Schrier in the wake of Democrats  failed smear attempt on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.The poll, published Wednesday, shows Rossi with a commanding 10-point lead in the battleground district in his race against Schrier to replace retiring Rep. Dave Reichert (R-WA) in one of the districts that could determine the fate of the majority of the House of Representatives.At 49 percent, Rossi leads Schrier s 39 percent, well outside the poll s five percent margin of error. The survey of 400 eligible voters was conducted from Oct. 4 to Oct. 9 by Crosscut/Elway.In a piece on the poll, Crosscut s David Kroman wrote that this was unmistakably due to the Democrats  mishandling of the Kavanaugh confirmation. Rossi, a former state senator and real-estate investor, saw an especially large bump last weekend, claiming a 24-point advantage among voters surveyed in the hours and days immediately after the U.S. Senate s vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh,  Kroman wrote.  Those respondents made up nearly a third of the total voters surveyed. Kroman s piece cites Elway Research president and pollster Stuart Elway as saying it appears as though the Democrats  handling of Kavanaugh has  erased  their advantage heading into the midterms. What appears to have happened here is the Kavanaugh hearings have erased [the Democrats ] advantage,  Elway, whom Crosscut notes has an A plus rating on FiveThirtyEight after decades of polling work, said.  Now it looks like what you would have expected this district to look like before everyone was talking about a blue wave. The fact that Republican Rossi is so far ahead of Democrat Schrier in this district is nothing short of an amazing development for Republicans. Just a few weeks ago, Rossi trailed Schrier by a single percentage point45 percent to 46 percentin a New York Times/Siena College survey  in September.This district has been GOP-held, but close, since its creation in the 1980s. Republicans have never lost it, and Reichert moved into the seat replacing now former Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-WA) in the early 2000s and held it for several terms. Dunn was elected in the early 1990s to replace the district s first-ever member, now former Rep. Rod Chandler (R-WA). To reiterate, this district for nearly 40 years has been in GOP handsand Reichert had represented it for over a decade, but the Cook Partisan Voting Index this year had rated the race as even chances for either party, GOP or Democrats, and some polling had shown the Democrat Schrier with an outside chance at winning.Now, though, after the way Democrats handled Justice Kavanaugh s confirmation, that potential edge seems to have slipped away and Rossibarring some unforeseen circumstancesappears poised to win re-election. That means another seat Democrats thought they were going to take on a march back into the House majority handing now Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi back the Speaker s gavel for the first time in eight years has slipped out of reach, and Republicans have a better chance at limiting losses to less than the requisite number of seats Democrats would need to take to take back the majority. That so-called magic number is 24 seats.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/10/ann-coulter-gop-needs-update-dems-ufc-cage-match-rules/","It s time to update the GOP s Marquess of Queensbury Rules.If you saw Ruth Bader Ginsburg at Brett Kavanaugh s swearing-in ceremony, you know that we may need to fill her seat in about 4 1/2 minutes. Naturally, I hope she lives to be 300   although parenthetically, it seems she already has.The confirmation hearings for Kavanaugh made Robert Bork s hearings look like a day at the beach. At least liberals only lied about Bork s judicial philosophy. They didn t accuse him of being Ted Bundy. The next nomination hearing will make Kavanaugh s look like an ice cream social.Just because it didn t work this time doesn t mean Republicans  work is done. They have to make sure this never happens again.Democrats are already pushing the idea that Kavanaugh s confirmation was somehow illegitimate because of the shoddy FBI investigation. Liberals  beef is that the FBI neglected to interview Kavanaugh s former Yale classmates, who dispute his characterization of precisely how big a drinker he was in college.I wouldn t say he was a belligerent drunk, but more of an obstreperous drunk.No, no! I would say he was a mild drunk with periods of obstreperousness.This is not the stuff of perjury prosecutions.Of course, if true, it s HUGE. Kavanaugh s demeanor when drunk in college sounds nearly as awful as liberals  behavior when sober   obnoxious, aggressive and argumentative. I refer you to the recent antics we ve seen on Capitol Hill, as well as anywhere Ted Cruz stops in for a bite.Since none of the FBI s latest report on Kavanaugh has leaked, the one thing we can be sure of is that the agents turned up nothing unfavorable on him. Except for a colonoscopy, I think we re done with Kavanaugh.It s the accusers who have skirted investigation. Even Republicans have moved on. He s on the court, so who cares if Kavanaugh was falsely accused of  rape  in front of his little girls?That s what everyone thought when the falsely accused Duke lacrosse players were proved innocent and the D.A. was disbarred. Why go after the accuser? Hasn t she suffered enough?Crystal Mangum was not prosecuted for falsely charging she was gang-raped. And see? No harm, no foul! She went on to live a happy and productive   oh, wait! The next time we heard about Mangum was when she stabbed her boyfriend to death.On reflection, it certainly seems possible that Kavanaugh accuser Julie Swetnick was not being completely, 100 percent honest in her sworn statements about repeatedly attending high school parties in the 1980s, when she was a college student, where underage girls were drugged and gang-raped.Deborah Ramirez s three-decade-old, unsubstantiated, recovered memory of a drunken Kavanaugh exposing himself as a college freshman is the sort of charge that makes feminists laugh! (I know that from reading Gloria Steinem s explanation in The New York Times that Gov. Bill Clinton summoning a female underling to his hotel room, dropping his pants and saying,  Kiss it!  did not rise to the level of sexual harassment. He took  no  for an answer!)Perhaps Republicans could get Steinem to explain under oath why it s acceptable for a sitting governor to do what is disqualifying for a drunk college freshman to do.While no one would question the word of a living saint like Christine Blasey Ford, some parts of her testimony demand the clarity that can be obtained only in a formal legal proceeding   such as her trauma-induced need for two front doors (when the second front door seems clearly attached to a rental apartment); her fear of flying (but only when it will delay a confirmation hearing); and her claim that she never helped anyone prepare for a polygraph (contradicted by her ex-live-in boyfriend); among other things.Pretending they are the wronged ones, liberals keep yipping about Barack Obama s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. They believe any attack on Kavanaugh was justified after the dirty trick pulled by Republicans on Garland.The Republicans  refusal to hold hearings on Garland has been called an  unprecedented obstruction  (MSNBC s Chris Hayes), a  violation of traditions in norms  (Hayes again), an  insult and injury  (Sen. Cory Booker) and  remarkable and unprecedented  (MSNBC s Rachel Maddow). The GOP s treatment of Garland showed their  hypocrisy on Brett Kavanaugh  (MSNBC s Ari Melber).The truth is apparently a big secret, inasmuch as even Republicans aren t saying it. You ll read it here for the first time.The Republicans  wily, underhanded, double-dealing trick with Garland was this: Win a majority of seats in the U.S. Senate! I know liberals won t read the Constitution, but can they do math? Garland didn t have the votes.Republicans had 54 seats and, in 2016, Senate rules still required 60 votes for Supreme Court appointments. Democrats would have needed 14 Republican senators to switch sides to confirm a Democratic president s nominee.There was no way that was happening. A Republican Senate simply wasn t going to give  consent  to any Democratic nominee eight months before a presidential election   even an election that everyone thought Hillary was going to win. The Constitution says  advice and consent,  not  advice and rubber-stamp. There was nothing  unprecedented  about a Republican Senate rejecting a Democratic nominee   other than the fact that Republicans were the ones doing it. Democrats do it all the time.That s how we got Justice Anthony Kennedy   whom Kavanaugh replaced: A Democratic Senate rejected Reagan nominee Robert Bork. That s also how we got Harry Blackmun, author of the ridiculously lawless Roe v. Wade: A Democratic Senate rejected Richard Nixon s previous nominees Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell.It would have been a waste of time and only humiliated Garland to hold hearings. At least Republicans didn t accuse him of gang rape.COPYRIGHT 2018 ANN COULTER

Peterson s followers aggressively pushed back against his call for Kavanaugh to step down, and he eventually clarified his thoughts on the topic in a subsequent series of tweets.In the blog post, Peterson more or less argues that Kavanaugh should step down in order to promote peace and stability in the United States.I asked myself a question, after reading these posts:  Is there an alternative to confirming or not confirming Kavanaugh?  When a choice appears starkly binary, a third path appears impossible, by definition   but might possibly still be worth seeking. I tried to place myself in Kavanaugh s position, while generating a potential answer (and think that I can do so with some justification, having been publicly identified as reprehensible by many people prominent journalists, activists, and academics among them).I thought,  He can t withdraw, prior to the nomination, because his reputation has been savaged so badly that withdrawal would not only mean loss of the Supreme Court nomination, but demolition of his entire career and future life.  So the only way for Kavanaugh was forward, through the FBI investigation, on to the nomination hearing, and the hope that he would be what? Cleared? Not cleared, because it is too late for that, even given the favorable or at least not damning FBI report. A large percentage of the American public does not believe that he is an appropriate choice for the highest bench position in the land (51%, according to NY Mag). I m not claiming, necessarily, that CNN s poll is reliable. It doesn t matter. What matters is that there is very widespread opposition to his candidacy, much of it generated not by people s belief in his innocence or lack therefore but by their objection to the manner in which both parties handled the nomination process.It s not a good thing when there is general discomfort with the manner in which something as important as the naming of a new Chief Justice is undertaken. It doesn t bode well for the stability and peace of the state (and perhapsperhapsthere is nothing more important to preserve than that).You can read the entirety of Peterson s blog post here.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/10/poll-bob-menendez-claire-mccaskill-bill-nelsons-popularity-plummets/","Sens. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), and Bill Nelson s (D-FL) popularity plummeted, according to a poll released on Wednesday.A Morning Consult poll released on Wednesday found that Sens. Menendez, McCaskill, and Nelson s popularity has plummeted since the second quarter of 2018 the last time Morning Consult ran this poll. The Senate Democrats represent three of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats up for re-election this November.Sen. Nelson, who faces a contentious race against Florida Gov. Rick Scott, saw a dramatic 12-point decline since the second quarter. The third quarter of 2018 represents the first time that Florida voters had a net-disapproval of Nelson, with a 41 percent of Floridians disapproving of the senator, while only 39 percent of voters approving of the incumbent Democrat. According to the Real Clear Politics average, Nelson only leads by two points over Gov. Scott.Sen. McCaskill saw a net drop of seven points in her approval rating in the third quarter and remains virtually tied with Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley. McCaskill, according to the poll, serves as the most unpopular senator up for re-election.Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), another vulnerable Senate Democrat, saw a net seven-point drop in approval rating. Donnelly faces a contentious race against Hoosier businessman Mike Braun.Sen. Menendez, who is tied in the polls with Bob Hugin in deep-blue New Jersey, was the second most unpopular senator up for election during the 2018 midterm elections. Menendez s favorability fell by eight points, with 46 percent of New Jersey voters disapproving of the incumbent Democrat s performance.Morning Consult wrote that Sens. Nelson, McCaskill, Donnelly s popularity dropped below President Donald Trump s approval rating,  Nelson joined three other Senate Democrats on the ballot next month in Trump-won states   Claire McCaskill in Missouri, Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Joe Manchin in West Virginia   in trailing the president s net popularity among their constituents. Other vulnerable Senate Democrats up for re-election, such as Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), made the top-ten list for most unpopular incumbents. Forty-three percent of West Virginians disapprove of Manchin, while 44 percent of his constituents approve of the incumbent Democrat. An October survey found that Sen. Manchin s lead in the polls slipped to only four points over West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.In North Dakota, 43 percent of North Dakotans disapprove of Sen. Heitkamp, compared to 47 percent of voters who approve of Heitkamp.All of these Senate Democrats except for Manchin voted against confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. Several polls over the past couple of weeks have detailed how Republicans have skyrocketed in the polls amidst the Democrats  smear campaign of Kavanaugh.These Senate Democrats  popularity plummeted after they all voted against Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, which served as a political risk given that many of them represent states that went for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election.Republicans have seen what some analysts called a  Kavanaugh effect  in which Republicans have seen a surge in donations to Republican groups as well as interest in voting in the November midterm elections.An NBC/Wall Street Journal released recently found that Republicans have nearly matched Democratic interest in the midterm election.The poll said that 65 percent of Democrats are  very interested  in the midterm election, compared to 61 percent of Republicans who have also signaled that they are  very interested  in the November elections. The poll has a margin of error of 3.27 percent, which would make the poll a near tie in voter enthusiasm.Glen Bolger, a GOP pollster, said  Seeing a significant jump in GOP voter interest in the elections this week. The Dem intensity advantage is melting away. Two things: 1. I figure it has to be Kavanaugh effect. 2. Remains to be seen if it lasts. GOP campaigns should not assume their turnout concerns are done. Josh Holmes, a Republican consultant, tweeted recently,  Looking at some poll numbers this morning, it s impossible to overstate how important the Kavanaugh hearings have been to voters. Like dropping a grenade into the electorate. Ds in red states are not going to like this.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/10/10/nolte-cnn-says-mobs-have-constitutional-right-to-chase-republicans-out-of-restaurants/","The far-left CNN spent much of Tuesday defending mob action against Republicans as a  Constitutional right  and as fearless acts of free speech.On her low-rated afternoon show, CNN s Brooke Baldwin mocked both of her guests as they described the left-wing activists who chased Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his wife out of a DC restaurant last month as a  mob.  Oh, you re not going to use the mob word here,  Baldwin moaned after the Daily Caller s Matt Lewis brought up the mob that harassed Cruz and his wife. A mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia, two Augusts ago. A mob is not what we saw chasing   I m not saying what they did was right.  Baldwin argued.When asked what she would call the people banging on the Supreme Court walls, Baldwin refused to answer. She just mocked her guests by shaking her head and covering her eyes before moving on to another subject.Get ready to roll your eyesCNN s Brooke Baldwin is offended that the left s angry mob was called a mob.Would she rather them be called violent harassers, vandals and criminals? pic.twitter.com/hW9GWvZx5I  Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) October 9, 2018Later, during his last-place evening show, far-left activist Don Lemon went even further in defending mob action against the political right by framing it as free speech.Again the guest was Lewis and again the example was of Cruz and his wife being intimidated out of a restaurant. Don, if they started following you around a restaurant and running you out of places,  Lewis said.Lemon interrupted,  But that doesn t mean that people don t get to object. That s your right as an American to object. It s covered in the First Amendment. It s like the first one! After Lewis continued to press his case that there is a difference between free speech and harassing a man and his wife until you are able to bully them into fleeing a public restaurant, Lemon started screaming at Lewis.Will you let me finish? Matt, please! Let me finish,  Lemon shouted. Bring it on. Mind if I have a drink?  Lewis asked. You can do whatever you want. You can leave the show if you want,  Lemon fired back. I m not going to do that,  Lewis said. Shut up and let me do it,  Lemon snarled.With the floor to himself, Lemon launched into a full-throated defense of mob action: In the Constitution, you can protest whenever and wherever you want. It doesn t tell you that you can t do it in a restaurant, that you can t do it on a football field. It doesn t tell you that you can t do it on a cable news   you can do it wherever you want.  To call people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right is just beyond the pale,  Lemon said before cutting to a commercial.This was not the first time Lemon has defended mobs harassing Cruz and his wife.CNN s history of dismissing, inciting, downplaying, or outright advocating in favor of political violence against Republicans and conservatives is a long and sordid one.The anti-Trump outlet has openly called for race riots, frequently defends and even championing the left-wing terror group Antifa And here is a list of more examples, though far from an exhaustive one:CNN also threatens to doxx its critics, openly harasses everyday Trump supporters, and puts Trump in literal crosshairs.As of this writing, Breitbart News has documented over 580 individual acts of violence, harassment, and vandalism, against the political right in just under three years.CNN is seen by many as one of the prime instigators and defenders of this reign of domestic terror.Despite CNN s extremist behavior and tabloid approach to news coverage, the cable channel continues to shed viewers and earn dismal ratings that put it in last place by a wide margin. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Mike Lee (R-UT) discussed being doxed, allegedly by a former Democratic staffer following Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding sexual misconduct allegations against now-Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh.Hugh Hewitt, host of  The Hugh Hewitt Show  asked Lee if he was  physically threatened  in the process of confirming Kavanaugh. I was doxed, meaning our personal information was released   our personal address where I m here in Washington, where I live in Utah, as well as my personal cell phone number,  Lee responded.  It s terrible. It leaves us feeling very unsafe. My wife has had to be followed to the park by the local police. It s not a pleasant thing. This is completely unnecessary, I would add. It s completely unnecessary to descend to a point in our society where with the confirmation of a Supreme Court justice, someone has to feel physically threatened by the release of such information.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/10/report-rise-sexual-abuse-claims-christine-blasey-fords-allegations/","Christine Blasey Ford s testimony regarding her allegations that newly confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school has reportedly led to an increase in sexual abuse claims.A group that identifies itself as  the nation s largest anti-sexual violence organization  said that following Ford s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, its hotline call center saw a record jump in calls from sexual assault survivors.Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) said its National Sexual Assault Hotline had a 338 percent increase in traffic between Thursday, September 27  the day Ford testified regarding her allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh  and the following Sunday.The group noted that Friday, September 28, was its  busiest day in the 24-year history  of the hotline, as more than 3,000 people called in for help: Our nation has learned a lot in the last two weeks about the millions of sexual assault survivors who have stayed silent for years.  Read the rest of our statement about the Kavanaugh confirmation: https://t.co/9NRAQisOjJ  RAINN (@RAINN) October 6, 2018 History shows us that when high-profile allegations such as these are in the news it often causes others to reach out too,  said RAINN President Scott Berkowitz, adding that Ford s allegations  clearly resonated with survivors, and has led thousands to reach out for help for the first time.  Over this past year, following the cases of Weinstein and Cosby and the explosion of #MeToo, our numbers have been growing pretty rapidly, but we ve never seen anything like this before,  Berkowitz added.Following the Senate s vote to confirm Kavanaugh, RAINN said in a statement that the group is  disappointed in the outcome  but  glad that America got the opportunity to hear Dr. Blasey Ford s testimony. Ford s allegations and the reported rise in sexual abuse claims come as the Trump administration is poised to release new Title IX policies concerning sexual misconduct on campus  policies that recognize the right of due process for those accused of sexual assault.On October 2, RAINN tweeted NBC News s  Breaking  story that read,  President Donald Trump mocks Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Trump s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, during a rally in Mississippi :We have a whole page of tips about how to react when someone tells you that they ve been sexually assaulted. Spoiler alert: mockery isn t one of them. https://t.co/JA6EQjMtsn pic.twitter.com/HaBtQD2qTH  RAINN (@RAINN) October 3, 2018 We have a whole page of tips about how to react when someone tells you that they ve been sexually assaulted,  RAINN responded.  Spoiler alert: mockery isn t one of them. Appearing as a guest on CBS This Morning, Berkowitz said the record number of callers into the hotline indicated that  there was something about having watched Dr. Ford that they identified with. At Northwestern University, associate general counsel Sarah Wake said that since the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, she has observed a significant increase in student reports of past sexual misconduct to the Office of Equity. My general impression is that people are coming forward to the Office of Equity and other campus partners to discuss incidents that happened in their past because the testimony inspired them (or) evoked difficult memories,  Wake said, according to the Daily Northwestern.Though Wake did not provide specific details about the uptick in sexual assault reports, she said Ford s testimony showed how difficult it can be to report sexual misconduct. I absolutely believe Dr. Ford s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee impacted individuals in the Northwestern community,  Wake said.  I am glad that people are coming forward to seek support from campus resources and I hope that this will continue.

Circuit vacancy left by now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.Grassley told host Hugh Hewitt that there is a chance that Kavanaugh s replacement could be confirmed before the end of the year, depending on how quickly the nomination is received.Partial transcript as follows:HEWITT Now Senator Grassley, I always ask you about pending nominees. There are 10 Appeals Court nominees before you. Three are out of committee. Will all 10 of those nominees get a vote before the end of the year?GRASSLEY: Well, there s more than 10. There s 41 on the calendar right now, and I think there s 10 in our committee. And I think hopefully, I get the 10 out of our committee. But McConnell ought to keep the Senate in session until we get all 41 of those judges done. Or if you want to add 10 more to it, add 10 more to it.HEWITT: I m talking about the 10 Appeals Court nominees, and I am wondering about the Kavanaugh vacancy on the D.C. Circuit. Is there time for a nominee to come out of the White House and be confirmed by the end of the year for the D.C. Circuit nomination, a vacancy created by Brett Kavanaugh s promotion?GRASSLEY: If we received it right now, the answer is yes, but just before Christmas. So it kind of depends upon how long we ll be in session. And by the way, I m not denigrating your efforts to get 10 Circuit Court judges approved, because I m in favor of them as well. And we re pushing them. For instance, we have two Ohio Circuit Court judges on the calendar for today s hearing, as another example.Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/10/10/mercedes-schlapp-kavanaugh-debacle-showed-bush-people-how-democrats-attack-one-of-their-own/","White House Communications Director Mercedes Schlapp speculated that many Republicans have awakened to the nature of the Democrat Party following Democrats  attempt to block the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. She offered her remarks in a Tuesday interview with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow on SiriusXM s Breitbart News Daily.Schlapp, a communications alumnus of George W. Bush s 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns, said several  Bush people  she knows now adore President Donald Trump.LISTEN:Schlapp said,  One of the things that I found fascinating is that during this Brett Kavanaugh debacle for the past several weeks is I reconnected with a lot of the Bush people. These Bush people, a lot of them didn t even vote for Donald Trump. Schlapp continued,  I think it was so revealing to them, because  [my husband] Matt and I, we ve all been under attack for over two years in supporting President Trump. We have battle scars to prove it, but here s the deal, these Republicans, they have not been attacked in a way as viciously, and when they saw one of their own, someone who really has lived a really good life, has amazing qualifications, was a public servant for a very long time, someone that was one of their own, the establishment Republicans get attacked in the way they ve been attacked.  One or two of the folks was like, We love Trump. We re sold,  and I think that s what s happened. Schlapp went on,  It s because you had so many of these women who have sons, they come up to me quietly saying, Oh my gosh, what I ve seen these Democrats do to Brett Kavanaugh is appalling,  and as the mother of a boy, I never want to see my son go through something like that. Schlapp said the political battle over Kavanaugh had shown previously uninitiated Republicans that Democrat will use  whatever tactic it takes to tear people down.  They understand that the Democrats  attack is no longer just for a Trumpian,  assessed Schlapp.  No, it means that they re going after all of us. They re going after all Republicans. Schlapp praised Breitbart News s audience s awareness of the nature of Democrats and the broader left. The Breitbart audience has always understood this very clearly, because we re always under attack,  remarked Schlapp.  Now it s expanded more broadly, and I think that there s a realism. I think it s really united Republicans, at this point, and I think it s a very strong message as we go into the next couple of months.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/10/10/hillary-says-misconduct-allegations-against-bill-different-from-kavanaugh/","Hillary Clinton told the far-left CNN that the sexual misconduct allegations against her husband were different than those against Brett Kavanaugh.The interview was conducted by the left-wing Christiane Amanpour. It was made up of 30 minutes of softballs that allowed Hillary to tee off on whatever she wanted (primarily President Trump) without any tough follow ups.The most outrageous moment, however, came at the end when Amanpour spread some breathtaking fake news. In reference to the Clintons upcoming speaking tour, Amanpour asked:Obviously you re going to be prepared to have questions about that moment in 1998, the impeachment, the allegations of sexual harassment against your own husband. Are you prepared to answer those questions? Is he prepared to answer them? And how do you see that similar or different from what President Trump is being accused of and Kavanaugh and others today?Before we get to Hillary s answer, let s look at the question Amanpour describing the allegations against Bill Clinton as  harassment  is like describing an apple as, say, a banana, an uzi as a Dreamsicle, CNN as a legitimate news outlet.Bill Clinton was not accused of harassment. Among other things, he was credibly accused of rape (Juanita Broaddrick), of exposing himself (Paula Jones), and of groping a grieving widow in the Oval Office (Kathleen Willey).What s more, over the exposure allegation, Clinton was forced to settle a lawsuit filed with Paula Jones for $850,000, which was $100,000 more than Jones originally asked for.Here s Hillary s answer:There s a very significant difference. And that is the intense, long-lasting partisan investigation that was conducted in the  90s. If, you know, the Republicans, starting with President Trump on down, want a comparison, they should welcome such an investigation themselves.The  partisan investigation  Hillary is obviously referring to is Independent Counsel Ken Starr, who was appointed, not by Republicans, but by three judges on the DC Circuit. What s more, he was appointed to replace a man appointed by Clinton s own attorney general, Janet Reno, who launched the special prosecutor  at the request of President Clinton himself.And it was Clinton s sleazy Oval office affair with Monica Lewinsky, a much young subordinate, along with the Jones  suit, and his own act of perjury, that brought his sex life into the Starr investigation.Apparently, Hillary would also like us to believe the now-debunked allegations against Kavanaugh were not partisan, when that is all they were. Accuser Christina Blasey Ford surrounded herself with left-wing, activist lawyers. Donna Ramirez is herself a left-wing activist. Julie Swetnick is the creation of Michael Avenatti, a deeply partisan attorney determined to destroy Trump s presidency.Kavanaugh not only survived a deeply partisan three week investigation conducted by the establishment media, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the FBI   he walked out of it exonerated.On the other hand, Bill Clinton settled the indecent exposure case, was caught lying about Lewinsky, committed perjury, and Broaddrick s rape allegation is about as credible as they come, including contemporaneous witnesses.And what was Amanpour s follow up question after Hillary spewed that nonsense?Hillary Clinton, thank you very much indeed for joining me.This is CNN. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Claire McCaskill s support for Democrats  obstruction of Brett Kavanaugh s Supreme Court confirmation and Missouri s role in the control of the Senate were Vice President Mike Pence s top talking points during a Monday stump speech for Republican challenger Josh Hawley. The Truth is Missouri s other Senator, Claire McCaskill, was there with the Democrats in the Senate every step of the way,  Pence told Missourians gathered in a Missouri convention center.  Claire McCaskill supported the Democrats  search and destroy tactics, and it s just one more reason why Missouri needs to fire Claire McCaskill and hire Josh Hawley as your next United States Senator. He pointed to the anguish Kavanaugh s family, the U.S. Senate, and the nation have been put through.  The way some Democrats in the Senate conducted themselves in this confirmation process was just terrible. They threw away basic fairness, due process, the presumption of innocence. They literally tried to wreck the reputation of a good man just to prevent another conservative from making their way to the highest court in the land. The truth is, Missouri s other Senator Claire McCaskill was there with the Democrats in the Senate every step of the way,  Pence charged.  Claire McCaskill supported the Democrats  search and destroy tactics. And it s just one more reason why Missouri needs to fire Claire McCaskill and hire Josh Hawley as your next United States Senator. Earlier, from the tarmac at the Springfield-Branson National Airport, Pence stood next to Hawley as they spoke to reporters. Missourians know that control of the United States Senate may very well come down to this race right here in Missouri,  Hawley said.  Everything that the voters of this state voted when they voted for the Vice President and the President in 2016 is on the line in this election.  Our voters voted to keep America strong, to rebuild this country,  Hawley said, adding this is what President Trump is accomplishing.  Now the Democrats, and you see this in Washington these recent weeks, they want to take all of that away. They are hungry for power, they will stop at nothing,  charged Hawley.  We have to defeat them in November. That s what this election is all about. Pence said,  As Josh Hawley said, the control of the United States Senate could very well come down to the people of Missouri and to this Senate race and it is one of the reasons President Trump and I are so committed to stand with this man of integrity, to stand with this man of principle. President Trump campaigned for Hawley in late September, holding one of his Make America Great Again rallies and promoting Hawley. He told the massive crowd,  Get out in 2018, because you re voting for me in 2018  and warned against complacency.Michelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News   follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook

Last night was revenge of the Republicans. Republicans in the end zone doing a dance. So to me, the apology out of line totally. Remember, the poll we showed a moment ago, gosh, we didn t show you but guess what, most Americans disapproved of the way Republicans handled it as well. He continued,  The bottom line is 51 percent of Americans did not approve of this man s confirmation. In addition, a majority of Americans believed Professor Ford, not Justice Kavanaugh. This is going to go on for some time, and if you want to get into women, wow American women are overwhelming in their disapproval of Kavanaugh. When you hear people say Oh, my gosh, what we see here is President Trump basically having a campaign ad at the White House and throwing it in people s faces.  That s what it felt like.

She might have had enough after the GOP s nasty, misogynistic rhetoric expressed throughout the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Or this just might have been the most convenient moment   after Kavanaugh was sworn in and far enough in advance of the midterms to not be too much of a distraction.Rubin also speculated that Haley is waiting for Trump to  collapse under the weight of multiple investigations  and then she ll run in 2020, or  maybe she s going to try to primary South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham.Of course, this is nonsenseit s all literally just completely and totally made up out of thin air, which is apparently a skill you need to get a job writing articles at the Washington Post.She s in good companymany people in the establishment media spread baseless conspiracy theories about why Haley is leaving.Rubin just recovered from an incident of spreading fake news in a tweet where she also slammed  old white guys. This  conservative  writer also called for White House press secretary Sarah Sanders to face a  life sentence  of being uncomfortable. We re not going to let these people go through life unscathed,  Rubin said during an MSNBC appearance.  Sarah Huckabee has no right to live a life of no fuss, no muss, after lying to the press, after inciting against the press.

Clarence Thomas was seen clapping in the room. I don t know if any of the other justices were, but Clarence Thomas, who of course, during his confirmation hearings was also accused of sexual assault, was there clapping, as well. A September-published article at CNN   ostensibly a timeline of the FBI s investigation of Anita Hill s allegations against Thomas in 1991   makes no mention of  assault,   physical,   threat,  or  violence  in reference to Thomas. It notes that Thomas was accused of sexual harassment.The New York Times published a similar reminiscence in September, making no mention of  sexual assault    or physicality of any kind   in describing allegations made against Thomas.Hill s accusations against Thomas were advanced by Joe Biden   then a senator from Delaware and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee   as cause to oppose Thomas s confirmation. Biden voted against confirming Thomas, who was confirmed with a majority of 52 to 48 in the Senate.CNN markets itself as a politically objective and non-partisan news media outlet, previously branding itself  The Most Trusted Name In News.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/09/justice-brett-kavanaugh-hits-the-ground-running-in-first-day-on-supreme-court/","Newly minted Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday made his presence felt in his first day on the Supreme Court, peppering counsel with questions amid a  jovial  mood inside the Supreme Court, according to reports.The new justice dived into his new job, asking a handful of questions in the first arguments of the day following a traditional welcome from Chief Justice John Roberts, who wished Kavanaugh  a long and happy career in our common calling. Kavanaugh took his seat at the end of bench to Roberts  far left just after 10:00 a.m., a visible manifestation of a moment that Republicans have dreamed of and Democrats have dreaded for decades, with five conservative justices on the court. His path to confirmation was met with immense opposition from Democrats and left-wing groups   which intensified after Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her, allegations Kavanaugh denied and which the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) found to be uncorroborated.In court, Kavanaugh asked questions of both sides in arguments over increased prison sentences for repeat offenders. He jumped in with his first question after most of the other justices had spoken. Questions from Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump s two high court picks, suggested they could vote against the Trump administration and side with a criminal defendant from Florida who is fighting an increase in his sentence from just over six years to possibly more than 15 years.In his first-ever question as a Supreme Court justice, Kavanaugh posed the following query to Denard Stokeling s attorney, regarding Johnson v. United States:There were no disruptions in the courtroom and the justices laughed at each other s jokes. Justice Sonia Sotomayor even appeared to playfully pinch Gorsuch s arm as she asked a question about the kind of physical force necessary to have a crime be treated as violent under a federal enhanced sentencing law.The newest justice s wife and two daughters were in seats reserved for justices  guests, along with retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kavanaugh replaced Kennedy on the bench. The 53-year-old Kavanaugh occasionally chatted privately with his seatmate, Justice Elena Kagan. From time to time, he put on reading glasses to refer to papers in front of him.There was a long line of people hoping to see Kavanaugh s first appearance. Police put up barricades in front of the court, but there were few protesters in the early morning.Kavanaugh has had busy days since he was confirmed Saturday. That evening, he took his oaths of office in a private ceremony at the Supreme Court while protesters chanted outside the court building.On Monday evening, he was the guest of honor at a ceremonial swearing-in at the White House, where Trump apologized on behalf of the nation for  the terrible pain and suffering  Kavanaugh and his family had suffered.  On behalf of the nation, I d like to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you ve been forced to endure,  President Trump said. Those who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation, not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception,  he added.Speaking before well-wishers, Kavanaugh said that while the confirmation process  tested  him, his  approach  remains the same.  My focus now is to be the best justice I can be. I take this office with gratitude and no bitterness. On the Supreme Court I will seek to be a force for stability and unity,  he said.  My goal is to be a great justice for all Americans and for all of America.  I was not appointed to serve one party or one interest, but to serve one nation. America s constitution and laws protect every person of every belief and every background. Every litigant at the Supreme Court can be assured that I will listen to their argument with respect and an open mind,  the newly minted Justice added.Kavanaugh has also begun moving in to his new office at the Supreme Court, taking over space previously used by Justice Samuel Alito, who moved into offices vacated by Kennedy. Kavanaugh has also hired four clerks, all women  the first time that has happened.On Wednesday, the only other day of arguments this week, the court will hear another two hours of arguments. One of the two cases the court is hearing then involves the detention of immigrants, an issue on which Kavanaugh s vote could be key.Though he missed the court s first week, none of the six cases argued dealt with blockbuster issues. They included a case about a potential habitat for an endangered frog and another about an Alabama death row inmate whose lawyers argue he shouldn t be executed because dementia has left him unable to remember his crime. Kavanaugh won t vote in those cases, but if the court is split 4-4 it could decide to have those cases re-argued so Kavanaugh can break the tie.As the newest member of the court, Kavanaugh will take on a few special jobs. He will take notes for the justices when they meet for private conferences. He ll also be the one to answer the door at those meetings if someone knocks to deliver something such as a justice s coffee or forgotten glasses. Further, Kavanaugh will also sit on the committee overseeing the court s public cafeteria.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/09/poll-independents-overwhelmingly-disapproved-of-democrats-handling-of-kavanaugh-nomination/","Independent voters overwhelmingly disapproved of Democrats  handling of Justice Brett Kavanaugh s nomination, according to a new poll.The CNN/SSRS poll published Monday afternoon showed that 58 percent of independent voters disapproved of the way Democrats handled the nomination, compared to 30 percent of Independents who approved   a 28-point margin.Independents also disapproved of the way Republicans handled the nomination, but at a lesser 21-point margin.The poll was conducted between Oct. 4-7 among a sample of 1,009 respondents, with a margin of error of +/-3.8. The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh on Saturday, Oct. 6.Republicans are hoping Kavanaugh s confirmation has helped to energize the conservative base and expose Democrats for their strong-arm tactics to keep President Donald Trump from naming a new justice to the Supreme Court.Republicans have argued that Democrats were the ones who leaked the confidential letter from Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, for their own political gain.They have also argued that Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, held on to Ford s letter since July and had kept it secret until right before the committee was set to vote on Kavanaugh.The allegations of sexual assault threw Kavanaugh s confirmation into question at the last minute, prompted a public and emotional hearing with Ford and Kavanaugh, and prompted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) to call for a last-minute FBI investigation into her allegations.They also led to other accusers coming forward, including a woman represented by TV Resistance lawyer Michael Avenatti, who claimed that Kavanaugh was present at parties were she had been gang-raped. The woman, Julie Swetnick, walked back many of her claims in a MSNBC interview later.Republican senators said the FBI investigation had no new information to corroborate claims of sexual assault, and the Senate voted to confirm Kavanaugh 50-48.CNN Senior Political Commentator and former Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said Sunday he thought the way Democrats handled the nomination hurt them with Independents. I think for many independents they are not ignorant to the fact that that was caused by the Democratic Party leaking this information and bringing forward someone who didn t want to be out there, who didn t want to be testified before Congress, but was used as a political pawn to do so,  he said on CNN State of the Union on Sunday.

I need you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors,  Obama said on the presidential campaign trail in September 2008.  I want you to talk to them whether they are independent or whether they are Republican.  I want you to argue with them and get in their face,  Obama said.Fast forward to 2018 when lawmakers and activists are encouraging confrontations with members of Congress who disagree with them or support Trump.The latest rant took place on Saturday ahead of the confirmation vote on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when protesters gathered on the steps of the high court, including Jennifer Epps-Addison, network president and co-executive director at the leftist Center for Popular Democracy. If you think a few women were getting up in their faces at an airport, if they thought of us calmly saying, Listen to survivors  was enough to shake and intimidate them, well, wait till they go home,  Epps-Addison said.  Wait till they go to the state fair. Wait till they go to the coffee shop. Wait till they go to the movies. Wait till they go anywhere we see them.  Make your voice heard,  Epps-Addison said.  Do not be calm. Do not be silenced. Do not be patient. Leftists continue to get marching orders from elected officials, including Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA).In June, Waters told her supporters at a rally in Los Angeles to  push back.  Let s make sure we show up wherever we have to show up,  Waters said.  And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd.  And you push back on them,  Water said.  And you tell them they re not welcome anymore, anywhere. Booker gave similar advice in July at the National Conference on Ending Homelessness. Please don t just come here today and then go home,  Booker said.  Go to the Hill today. Get up and, please, get up in the face of some congresspeople. Sen. Rand Paul s (R-KY) wife, Kelley, recently wrote an open letter to Booker expressing her anguish over the harm done to her husband after a neighbor attacked him. She shared other  horrifying  threats the family has faced and called on Booker to condemn the ongoing threats and violence.Watch  Rand Paul s Wife: I Sleep with a Loaded Gun Thanks to Leftists  ThreatsThe same angry anti-Kavanaugh protesters confronted Sen.

So whose [sic] gonna take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh?  the unnamed teacher allegedly posted following Kavanaugh s confirmation to the Supreme Court.The teacher was originally placed on paid leave pending an investigation by Rosemount, Minnesota s Independent School District 917 into her post, but has since reportedly resigned. On Sunday, October 7, 2018, the district began receiving complaints regarding an employee,  explained Independent School District 917 Superintendent Mark A. Zuzek.  The actions of the employee did not occur at school, and there were no school devices, equipment, or other school staff involved in the actions. At no time were students or staff in danger. The employee was placed on paid administrative leave and an investigation conducted. Last month, before Kavanaugh s confirmation to the Supreme Court, it was reported that  #KillKavanaugh  had become a top Twitter search suggestion. Typing kill  into Twitter s search function currently returns a shocking result at the top of its search suggestions: #KillKavanaugh.  It s also currently the third autocompleted suggestion in searches for ki  and the fourth suggestion in searches for k  as of this writing,  reported Breitbart Tech Senior Reporter Allum Bokhari.  That s right   by typing a single letter into search, Twitter is suggesting that its users might be interested in a hashtag about the murder of a federal judge and SCOTUS nominee. At the time, Twitter did not respond to an email from Breitbart News about the search suggestion.In September, actress Rosie O Donnell claimed voting for Kavanaugh was a  vote to kill women,  and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) claimed  women will die  if Kavanaugh was confirmed.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) also suggested more people would die in school shootings should Kavanaugh be confirmed, while an open letter from members of the Yale Law community declared,  People will die if he is confirmed.

Ed Markey (D-MA) said the confirmation of  Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh will be  the single most powerful animating force,  to especially woman voters in the upcoming midterm elections.On the Republican base, Markey said,  It s not as galvanized as the Democratic base. It s not as galvanized as those who were outraged at the way in which Dr. Blasey Ford was treated before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the entire process for the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh. What we are seeing here is a historic uprising, especially of women in our country who really do feel that this president has to have a check be placed upon him. Otherwise preexisting conditions, which are protections for those who have health care needs, or the entire Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade can all just be swept away. It can be completely overturned by Brett Kavanaugh s vote on the Supreme Court. This is going to be a referendum on Donald Trump, on Brett Kavanaugh, on the key votes, which he can now cast, that undermines protections for women in our country and families in general. He added,  Donald Trump is, I think, in a small minority of people who think Dr. Blasey Ford s accusations were a hoax. I think she was highly credible. I think across this country, people know that she was sincere. She was absolutely fearless in coming forward even though there would be huge negative consequences for her personally. I think the real hoax now that is attempting to be perpetrated is by Donald Trump that will contend there was nothing to any of these accusations made about Brett Kavanaugh. I think the American people know who watched that process very closely over a two-week period know that is not the case. He doesn t have the temperament or the credibility to serve on the Supreme Court, and that will be the single most powerful animating force for the next 28 days across this country. There is an uprising of people who will get to the polls. We lost when we should not have lost, and there is nothing more motivating than that in politics.

At one point, one of the protesters hit his signs, appearing to damage them:Leftists harassing an elderly Trump supporter.

Ambassador Nikki Haley in the Oval Office. I guess that s why she lost. She doesn t get it,  Trump replied.  She never did. I knew that a long time ago. Hillary never got it. That s why she lost. Trump apologized to the Kavanaugh family on Monday night for the Democrat-led smear of their reputation and the ugly confirmation process.Clinton defied the idea that Democrats should be  civil  in their opposition to the president. You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about,  she said during the interview.  That s why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that s when civility can start again.

I agree that the ceremony aspect I would have pulled immediately. I actually   had I been emotionally capable of being on the show at the time this happened the second Kavanaugh had that accusation I would have pulled him and put up Amy Coney Barrett.

She added that she had no intention of challenging Trump for the presidency in 2020. She added that she would be campaigning for Trump re-election.Nevertheless, without offering anything other than  sources close to the White House,  which are not sources  in  the White House, which means those sources could be virtually anyone willing to tell a so-called journalist what she wants to hear, the unverified and illogical narrative was spread that Haley might have resigned in disgust over the successful confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.From the far-left Washington Post:Sources close to the WH echo this sentiment   that the timing doesn t make sense.

The allegations of sexual misconduct against the now-Supreme Court Justice were nearly 40 years old. What s more, they were all debunked.Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who is much more moderate and closely aligned with the feminist movement than Haley, voted to confirm him, as did four other female Senators.As of now, there is not a single women within the Republican establishment who believes Trump and the Senate put a man on the Supreme Court guilty of anything other than liking beer as a teenager.Even Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh, said he was a good man. Her issue was temperament, not lechery.I am certain  sources close to the White House  tell these so-called journalists all kinds of things. It is what they choose to publicly pass along (with zero confirmation) that exposes their malicious agenda. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/09/vulnerable-democrat-congressman-on-kavanaugh-the-democrats-i-thought-went-a-little-bit-too-far/","Rep. Tom O Halleran (D-AZ), a vulnerable Democrat seeking re-election in Arizona s first congressional district in 2018, bucked his party s leadership in public commentary on Monday evening in a television interview where he criticized Democrats for going  too far  with their opposition to now Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.Speaking about Kavanaugh, O Halleran said his party  went a little bit too far.  The Democrats I thought went a little bit too far,  O Halleran said.  We re supposed to ask probing questions. I don t like it   I never did like it   when people got up there and pontificated time and time again about their position. This is supposed to be about a discussion back and forth between you and the nominee. O Halleran is one of the Democrats from swing districts in the country that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is counting on to retake the Speaker s gavel in November s midterm elections, and scant polling on this race shows his Republican challenger Air Force veteran Wendy Rogers a few points ahead of him. O Halleran is an ally of Pelosi, and voted for her to remain as Majority Leader at the beginning of this Congress when he first won his election, per a local news report at the time:While he voted for Pelosi, O Halleran said it was evident at the meeting that the caucus was ready for a change and for leadership to be more responsive to members. The underlying agreement was that there s a need to change some of the ways we ve been dealing with the caucus,  he said.So, for O Halleran to now come out against his partyPelosi was just as vicious to Kavanaugh as Senate Democrats wereon this matter shows yet again just how deeply negative the effect of fierce Kavnaaugh opposition has been on Democrats as they seek to take the House majority away from Republicans for the first time since the 2010 midterm elections.WATCH DEMOCRAT TOM O HALLERAN ON HIS PARTY S MISHANDLING OF BRETT KAVANAUGH:Holding this very rural Arizona district is critical to Democrats  chances in November. If they are going to take the net 24 seats they need to claim from Republicans, they cannot afford to lose districts like this one in November. There are precious few GOP pickup opportunities in the country. Others exist in places like Minnesota, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, but for the handful of GOP opportunities to take seats away from Democrats there are dozens of opportunities for Democrats to take seats from Republicans.Rogers, O Halleran s GOP opponent, appeared on Breitbart News Saturday this weekend, breaking down just how radical O Halleran isand the stakes at play in this election. My opponent a first-term incumbent has gone along with the liberal agenda. He voted against the tax cut, he would most assuredly vote for impeachment of our president. He tries to cast himself as moderate, but he s anything but,  Rogers said. He actually I don t even know how you do this he started off as a Republican, then became an Independent, and now he s a Democrat,  Rogers added.  He s all over the map, trying to be all things to all people.  Our entire nation is hanging by the slender thread that runs through the House of Representatives, is the way I look at it, and the way all of my voters look at it,  Rogers said.  The feeling in my district is that we are at a pivot point, that the future of the country rests on whether or not our president is going to remain president. I tell people, we have the Supreme Court, we have the Senate, we have the presidency, but if we don t hold the House, we are in for a just a complete devolution and degradation of due process because of exactly what was on display this past week.

What?Are we talking about the same Democrats who violated every norm to hold onto Christine Blasey Ford s allegations against Kavanaugh until it could do the maximum damage? Are we talking about the same Democrats who used procedural trickery to pass Obamacare? The same Democrats who nuked the Senate filibuster? Who politicized the FBI to try to frame Trump as a Russian spy? Who weaponized the IRS against the Tea Party? Who accused Mitt Romney of murder? Who investigated Sarah Palin s womb? Who accused Palin of a mass murder in Arizona? Who invented Borking? Who threatened a broadcast network s license over a miniseries? Who are promising to pack the Supreme Court with more justices?Those Democrats?Those Democrats seriously believe they are playing by the rules and need to become even more ruthless?Already, and with the silent (and sometimes not-too-silent) approval of Democrats, Breitbart News has documented over 580 individual acts of violence, vandalism, harassment, and threats aimed at Trump supporters.Already, and with the silent (and sometimes vocal) approval of the Democrats  allies in the establishment media, over 580 acts of ruthlessness have been committed against Trump supporters during the Trump era.The Politico article continues:Whether Trump knew it or not, his remarks were perfectly pitched to stoke anxieties that have haunted many top Democratic operatives for a generation: the fear that their party loses big power struggles because Republicans are simply tougher, meaner, more cynical and more ruthless than they are.If after all of the above, Democrats fear they must become even more ruthless to obtain power, I guess we now know why they are so desperate to abolish the Second Amendment. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Tom Cotton (R-AR) discussed the leak of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s letter alleging sexual misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh over 30 years ago.Hewitt asked Cotton if he believed there was something behind the timing of Ford s letter, which was sent in July and leaked just days before the Senate Judiciary Committee planned to vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation, which the Arkansas senator affirmed. Hugh, I believe the Schumer political operation was behind this from the very beginning,  replied Cotton.  We learned last week that a woman named Monica McLean was Ms. Ford s roommate, and she was one of the so-called beach friends who encouraged Ms. Ford to go to Dianne Feinstein and the partisan Democrats on the Judiciary Committee. Well, it just turns out, it just so happens that Monica McLean worked for a Preet Bharara, the former U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, now a virulent anti-Trump critic on television and former counsel to Chuck Schumer. He continued,  So, I strongly suspect that Chuck Schumer s political operation knew about Ms. Ford s allegations as far back as July and manipulated the process all along to include taking advantage of Ms. Ford s confidences and directing her towards left-wing lawyers who apparently may have violated the D.C. code of legal ethics and perhaps may face their own investigation by the D.C.

Actors, such as Alyssa Milano, Barbara Streisand, Debra Messing, Sarah Silverman, Kumail Nanjiani, and Mark Ruffalo, have responded by urging their followers to register to vote before their state deadline, presumably in the hope that they will vote Democrat.Actress and Hulu talk show host Sarah Silverman raised fears that Kavanaugh would implement laws affecting her body.

Trump declared that Kavanaugh was proven  innocent  of the false accusations made against him by various women during the confirmation process and apologized  on behalf of the nation  to Kavanaugh and his family for the  terrible pain and suffering  they were  forced to endure.  Those who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation, not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception,  Trump said before introducing Kavanaugh.  On behalf of the nation, I d like to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you ve been forced to endure. WTF is a SCOTUS judge doing at a WH campaign event???? He doesn t have to do this. The president doesn t get to  swear in  justices. This is bizarre.  Charles P.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/josh-hawley-claire-mccaskills-radical-democrat-party-seeking-to-undo-missourians-2016-vote/","Senate challenger to Claire McCaskill Josh Hawley alerted voters Monday about the urgency of keeping radical Democrats in 2018 midterms from undoing what Missourians voted for in 2016. The confirmation progress of Justice Kavanaugh was an unprecedented smear campaign and unlike anything we ve ever seen in American history or in American politics,  Hawley told reporters on a Monday press call.  Their attack on the institution of the Supreme Court is an unprecedented effort to delegitimize the basic institutions of American government, an entire branch of American government, Article III of the Constitution.  It is a radical, radical agenda that gets more aggressive by the day,  said Hawley, a  radical attempt to seize power and undo the 2016 election  He said the future turns on the Missouri Senate race.Hawley said he Missourians have expressed tremendous frustration over Democrats  actions during the confirmation of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States.  What I ve heard from people over and over is they cannot believe this smear campaign that the Democrats mounted,  he said. He added they can t believe Sen. Dianne Feinstein withheld the letter of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford  for months on end in order to get a circus-like atmosphere and hearing in order to derail this nomination.  It s been a terrible stain on the United States Senate and I think voters are going to punish those who have engaged in the smear campaign at the polls, and that includes Claire McCaskill,  Hawley said of Democrats  actions during the Kavanaugh hearings. [Sen s] Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, [Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris] have made this agenda very clear and of course we know what their broader agenda is: open borders, allegiant military, higher taxes on the middle class, government-run health care, and now the impeachment of President Trump and Justice Kavanaugh,  said Hawley. The Democrat Party wants to undo everything the people of Missouri voted for in 2016 and they couldn t be more open about it,  he went on. He called McCaskill a proven  partisan ally and reliable supporter  of those senators. He said Schumer has  spent more than $15 million to boost her election here  and that she has voted with Schumer 90 percent of the time.He said Democrats know  They cannot win power in congress without Claire s victory in November here in Missouri. This is an unprecedented power grab by Democrats in Washington. Asked if he thinks McCaskill has laid off criticism of Trump as the election draws near, Hawley responded he s seen McCaskill  ridicule Trump in the most personal terms. One reporter asked Hawley if he agreed with President Donald Trump s recent comment regarding accusations against Kavanaugh,  It s a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of.  Hawley resolved,  In American politics at least, It s a very scary time for the rule of law.  It should be very, very, very worrisome to Americans of good will, whatever political background, that this is what Senate Democrats are willing to do in order to seize power,  said Hawley. He later criticized McCaskill:  She would not say a word to stop the smear campaign, she would not say a word against her party.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2018/10/08/panthers-anthem-kneeler-reid-says-kavanaugh-appointment-unacceptable/","Maybe the Carolina Panthers thought newly-signed safety Eric Reid wouldn t kneel during the anthem, like he did in San Francisco.After all, on March 22, the San Francisco Chronicle s Eric Branch, reported after talking to the then-free agent safety, that  Reid also said he does not intend to kneel during the anthem this season.  I m just going to consider different ways to be active,  Reid told Branch during an event at Stanford University.  Different ways to bring awareness to the issues of this country. To improve the issues happening in this country. Perhaps the operative word is  consider,  because before his first game with the Panthers, on Sunday, he knelt during the anthem.Why did he kneel before the Panthers 33-31 win over the New York Giants? Because he feels the nation still has work to do on racial injustice and police brutality, the two issues that started the movement in 2016, led by former 49ers QB Colin Kaepernick. Reid, who is close with Kaepernick, knelt during the anthem during the 2016-17 seasons in San Francisco.Reid isn t trilled with the state of the country right now, including the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Saturday. This morning, I found out the officer that killed Tamir Rice was re-hired,  Reid said.  I feel like that s unacceptable. (Brett) Kavanaugh was voted into the Supreme Court   that s unacceptable. I feel like our country is moving backward, and the only way to change that is to keep talking about it, to keep raising awareness. Keep doing what we re doing. Former Cleveland police officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice in 2014, has been re-hired by another Ohio police department. A grand jury didn t indict Loehmann in the shooting of Rice.Why Reid feels the Kavanaugh appointment is  unacceptable  is unclear because wasn t asked to explain his opposition.Panthers coach Ron Rivera, son of a career military officer, and known for his patriotism, isn t interested in talking much about his new player kneeling during the anthem. I m not going to talk about a guy exercising his First Amendment Rights,  Rivera said after the Giants-Panther game.  I m going to talk about what happens on the football field. Some legal scholars argue the First Amendment doesn t apply to protesting at work. The players are entitled to kneel if the owners allow them to,  Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz told AM-970 in New York.  Now the owners could say no  because the players don t have a First Amendment right in relation to the owners. They only have a First Amendment right in relation to the government. How did the Carolina fans react to Reid kneeling during the anthem? Some fans in attendance Sunday left the game when Reid took a knee,  wrote Brendan Marks of the Charlotte Observer.Shelley Wiggins of Gastonia was one of the fans who left. I mean, I understand he feels like he s doing something noble, but to teach a generation of children to hate the police and America is not the right way to fix the problem,  Wiggins told the Charlotte Observer.Reid believes his critics are missing the point. People who don t want things to change, people who want to maintain the status quo, this is the only thing they can do,  Reid said.  They have to subvert, they have to distract, they have to redirect from what we re trying to accomplish, and the only way to do that is to try to alter the narrative. We have to stay strong, we have to stay diligent, to make sure that that narrative doesn t change. We, as a country, have fallen short. It s unclear if signing Reid will make the Panthers fall short at the box office. Perhaps not, since most fans have already paid for their 2018 season tickets.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-process-tested-me-did-not-change-me/","Justice Brett Kavanugh took the Judicial Oath as an associate justice of the Supreme Court Monday at the White House, administered by the man whose seat he now fills and for whom he once clerked, retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.Kavanaugh became a justice formally on Saturday in a small private ceremony, but Monday s oath-taking allowed him to address the country for the first time since being confirmed 50-48 in Saturday s final Senate floor vote. Speaking after President Donald Trump, Kavanaugh sought to move past the historically unprecedented tactics that Democrats unleashed on him during the confirmation process and put to rest notions of his being controversial, biased, or partisan.Kavanaugh called his confirmation process  contentious and emotional,  but added later,  Although the Senate confirmation process tested me, as it has tested others, it did not change me. My approach to judging remains the same.  That process is over,  Kavanaugh continued,  My focus now is to be the best justice I can be. I take this office with gratitude and no bitterness. On the Supreme Court I will seek to be a force for stability and unity. My goal is to be a great justice for all Americans and for all of America.  I was not appointed to serve one party or one interest, but to serve one nation. America s constitution and laws protect every person of every belief and every background. Every litigant at the Supreme Court can be assured that I will listen to their argument with respect and an open mind,  the new Justice went on, repeatedly stressing a judge s role as an independent  umpire  and not a policy maker.Earlier in his address, Justice Kavanaugh stressed the Supreme Court;s non-political nature and sought to stress that he would not upset that tradition. He told the crowd:I am honored to serve alongside all of my new colleagues, each of whom I know, and each of whom I greatly admire and deeply respect. All nine of us revere the constitution.  The Supreme Court is an institution of law. It is not a partisan or political institution. The Justices do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle. They do not caucus in separate rooms. The Supreme Court is a team of nine and I will always be a team player on the  team of nine. As in the past, our nation faces challenges and divisions, but I am an optimist,  Kavanaugh said in conclusion.  I live on the sunrise side of the mountain. I see the day that is coming, not the day that is gone. I am optimist about the future of America and the future of our independent judiciary.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/phil-bredesens-last-minute-statement-on-kavanaugh-hurting-him-in-tennessee-with-far-left-base/","Former Gov. Phil Bredesen s last-minute statement on Friday that he would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court has cost him votes among his far left base in Tennessee.The statement by the Democrat nominee for the U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee was made on the last day a CBS Poll was in the field (from October 2 to October 5). That poll shows him losing to his Republican opponent, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN-07), by eight points, 50 percent to 42 percent. It also came one day before Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate, and two days before pop star Taylor Swift endorsed him over Blackburn in the November race to replace retiring Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) in the U.S. Senate.The CBS Poll showed the Republican crossover on which he has been counting is already in decline, a function of his inability to separate himself from the far left policies and actions of Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who recruited him to run for the Senate seat.Last month, Bredesen declared that, if elected, he would not vote for Chuck Schumer as leader of the Democrats in the Senate. That statement was met with widespread derision in Tennessee, given the close relationship the two men have and the fact that Schumer s PAC has spent millions of dollars to support his candidacy.Bredesen s handling of the Kavanaugh nomination has not helped his cause.In contrast to Blackburn, who announced her steadfast support for Kavanaugh from the day President Trump nominated him to the Supreme Court on July 9, Bredesen has maintained radio silence on where he stood on Kavanaugh s nominationand the unfair smears and  search and destroy  tactics deployed by Senate Democratsduring the months of July, August, and September.In his statement on Friday, Bredesen said, I was prepared to say yes  to his nomination prior to Dr. Ford s coming forward. While the subsequent events make it a much closer call, and I am missing key pieces of information that a sitting Senator has, I m still a yes.   Bredesen made no mention of the unfair treatment Kavanaugh received at the hands of Senate Democrats during the confirmation process. Instead, he claimed that Kavanaugh s accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, had been treated unfairly by the Senate:Dr. Ford is a heroine, and has brought forcefully into the national conversation the many barriers women face in reporting and dealing with sexual harassment and assault. I was disgusted by the treatment she received at the hands of the Senate and am determined to help bring about a fairer and far more respectful treatment of these issues.The former governor s attempts to thread the needle on the Kavanaugh nomination has fallen short on both sides of the aisle, but particularly among far left Democrats, as the Chattanooga Times FreePress reported that late Friday:Chattanoogan Randy Price [a Democrat], who is running in Tennessee s state Senate District 11 contest in Hamilton County, called Bredesen s announcement  disappointing  in a tweet and soon followed up with a far sharper jab: So you are saying lying to the Senate and serious partisanship aren t disqualifying?  Price said of Bredesen s stance on Kavanaugh, who had angrily denied allegations of sexual improprieties while in high school and college from three women, including Ford.  You need to rethink your position or job application. Price s  job application  dig was a reference to a frequent Bredesen video ad tagline in which he says  I m applying for the job. Tennessee Democratic Party Chair Mary Mancini issued a statement, hours after being contacted by a Times Free Press reporter, in which she said:  Let me be clear: We stand with the survivors of sexual assault and abuse. Today, Governor Bredesen released a disappointing statement based on imperfect and limited information as a result of a flawed and secretive process,  Mancini added.Sunday s announcement by Swift that she is endorsing Bredesen is viewed in Tennessee as an attempt by Bredesen s allies to bury his support for Judge Kavanaugh in the memory hole and restore enthusiasm for his candidacy among his far left base.

The idea that if you re a man, any woman you see, you should be able to get an erectionand when we don t, that s the trauma,  John Mayer said.  I don t want it to be the male contract, but that s the contract, and we have to tear the contract up. After the Grammy-winner finished his rant, someone in the audience could be heard asking him what the  male contract  is. What you re saying   what is the male contract  then? The male contract is to   between the ages of, whatever, puberty and college, to be instructed, to have a class, to have a voice of reason, taught to young men,  Mayer said. You are not supposed to be able to do this to everything that moves, you are not entitled to be able to do this to everything that moves. This does not come naturally to a man, this does not come unnaturally to a man. You do not posses the universal ability to have any woman that you seek,  the 40-year-old singer said before performing his hit song  Daughters. Ironically enough, Mayer appeared as himself in the 2015 film Get Hard, and during one scene, before he sang  Daughters,  joked about how he would  fuck anything.  There s nothing I love more than making moneyeven chicks, or dudes. I ll fuck anything,  Mayer said.The  Love on the Weekend  singer has made other controversial sexual remarks in the past.In 2010, Mayer described himself as having  white supremacist  sexual attractions, saying,  I ve got a Benetton heart and a fuckin  David Duke cock.

Party Chairman Tuckerman Babcock says the committee could decide to issue a statement condemning Murkowski or withdraw support from the senator. Futher, Babcock could encourage party officials to search for a replacement and request that she not seek re-election as a Republican.Read the state party s full statement on Murkowski s opposition to Kavanaugh:We are both shocked and disappointed by the decision of US Senator Lisa Murkowski to oppose the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh. The Alaska Republican Party supports his confirmation. We respect the process, but after the process ran its course, the time came for the Senate to do their duty and advise and consent, or not. We expected many Democrats to remain adamant in opposition to the nomination by President Trump. We did not expect Republicans to end in opposition. Werepeat, we are both shocked and disappointed by the opposition to the confirmation from just one Republican, Senator Murkowski.This is a very significant vote. And the Alaska Republican Party will have a very significant response. However, it will not be the response of one man. As Chairman, while I have the authority under our Rules to speak on behalf of the Party, this issue is just too significant. How we respond as Republicans will be brought before the entire grassroots leadership of the Party: the State Central Committee. As representatives of 140,000 members of the Alaska Republican Party, we will consider what action to take. We will deliberate, and discuss and then vote on exactly what our response will be to her vote against confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court.After remaining undecided on whether Kavanaugh s nomination should move forward, Murkowski rendered her decision Friday in dramatic fashion. As the clerk read the names in alphabetical order, all eyes were on Murkowski. Senators stood up in their chairs and voted, some of them loudly.But when it came to Murkowski, she stood up, paused, and whispered  no,  her voice barely audible.Then she took her seat, looking down with a stone-faced expression.As the end of the vote neared, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who sits next to Murkowski, leaned over and put her hand on the arm of Murkowski s chair. The two huddled in deep conversation.Collins and Murkowski are the only GOP senators who support abortion rights, a crucial issue in the debate over Kavanaugh s nomination. If confirmed, Kavanaugh could tip the court s balance toward conservatives for a generation. Collins said Kavanaugh assured her during a private meeting that Roe v. Wade, the ruling that established abortion rights, is settled law.Murkowski s decision brought a swift response from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who insinuated that she might mount a primary challenge against the senator if she opposes Kavanaugh.Palin, who was GOP presidential candidate John McCain s running mate in 2008, tweeted,  Hey @lisamurkowski   I can see 2022 from my house.  The tweet referenced an infamous Saturday Night Live skit in which Tina Fey, portraying Palin, said she could see Russia from her house. Murkowski is next up for re-election in 2022.Hey @LisaMurkowski  I can see 2022 from my house  Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) October 5, 2018Murkowski acknowledged she agonized over her vote, telling reporters she didn t make up her mind until she walked into the Senate chamber. This has truly been the most difficult evaluation of a decision that I ve ever had to make, and I ve made some interesting ones in my political career,  the Republican senator said.Over the weekend, President Donald Trump told the Washington Post that Murkowski will  never recover  from voting against Kavanaugh.  I think the people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did,  he said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/nuclear-option-everything-the-democrats-tell-you-about-the-merrick-garland-nomination-is-a-lie/","In this shameful season of partisan lies, it is nearly impossible to run down every deceit before it lands on the lips of some lusty mob, where it becomes a rallying cry to chase decency, dissent and free speech from the public square.Look at this weekend s mobs of protesters   many of them paid by hugely wealthy and powerful special interests   that thronged the streets around the Capitol and Supreme Court to shout down any difference of opinion. Jackbooted hippies jeered, harassed and intimidated anyone who hesitated to swear fealty to their warped worldview and twisted lies.No single lie has been more freely uttered   or is more profoundly dishonest   than the claim that SenateDemocrats had every right to kill the Kavanaugh nomination as payback for Republicans  refusal to take up President Obama s nomination of Merrick Garland in the final months of his presidency.Let s set aside for the moment this insidious notion that it is somehow acceptable to publicly endorse revenge politics.The fact that so many Democrats openly embrace this kind of  governing by revenge  reveals just how cynical and disingenuous the entire party has become. It also reveals just how unlikely they will ever be any part of a genuine effort to stop the insanity gripping Congress these days.The biggest lie about Merrick Garland   one that is constantly peddled by Democrats and unquestioningly accepted by the press   is that Republicans  treatment of him and his nomination is somehow on par with how Democrats treated Justice Kavanaugh and his nomination.Nothing could be further from the truth.If you go back and consult the Constitution, you will remember that the president is charged with nominating Supreme Court justices. The Senate is charged with providing  advice and consent,  meaning confirmation or rejection.Merrick Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court at a time when American voters had expressly put Republicans in charge of the Senate. If voters wanted Mr. Obama to have a free hand in selecting a Supreme Court nominee in his final two years in office, they would have elected Democrats to control the Senate.They did not. As such, a majority of the Senate declined to confirm Merrick Garland. That is democracy at work.Democrats also like to suggest that the filibusters they waged against President Bush s lower court nominees   and virtually every Republican Supreme Court nominee since then   are no different from what Republicans did to Merrick Garland.Again, a complete lie.Merrick Garland suffered the lawful will of a Republican-led Senate. Filibusters against judicial nominees, on the other hand, are carried out by rogue insurgencies inside a Senate minority, preying on the long-outdated mannerly customs of a collegial U.S. Senate.By definition, filibusters are not expressing the will of the elected Senate. Rather, filibusters thwart the will of the Senate by a guerrilla minority.In other words, Democrats hijacked the Senate and handed it over to  tyranny of the minority. No one spreads these lies more shamelessly than Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has done more than anyone else to turn the courts into an ideological battlefield.In a rare departure from his usual dishonesty, Mr. Schumer offered a sobering message after Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed.This fight, he said, can be ended at only one place: the ballot box.Indeed. And Republicans had better not forget that. Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/kirk-republicans-just-started-winning-they-cant-be-tired-of-it-yet/"," and dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell your enemies that they make take your lives, but they ll never take your freedom!    Mel Gibson as William Wallace in the movie BraveheartWith the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, the Republican political establishment has done something it is not actually used to doing. It won. It isn t that Republicans have never won before, it is just that they typically win by forfeit.On the rare occasion that Democrats calculate they don t have the necessary numbers, and that the issue isn t important enough for them to spend political capital, they walk away and Republicans end up winning the same way a junior high school team wins when the other team s bus runs out of gas. They didn t really beat them, they won on a technicality.With Kavanaugh, however, there is no asterisk next to the Republican  W.  They faced an all-out assault from the Democratic Party and all the sinister characters that operate in its hidden and nefarious underworld. The Democrats emptied their bench, pulled their goalie, threw a greased pitch, placed cork in their bats, and even let some air out of footballs (enough sports metaphors?). The Democrats played their best game. They also cheated.And they lost. They aren t used to losing. They never lose in these battles. Republicans don t play to win.But Donald Trump always plays to win and he is teaching Republicans how much fun it can be to play that way.It isn t hard to imagine that, in the not-so-distant past, if the Republicans had found themselves facing the offensive mounted against them, against Brett Kavanaugh, and against their constituents who put them in office, that they would have turned to a different Republican President and quietly counseled him to get Kavanaugh to voluntarily withdraw himself from consideration.You can picture the scene. There would have been a solemn statement to the press, Kavanaugh at the microphone saying how it was just too much for his family and because of his love of the nation and the need for it to heal he felt it best to step aside. Behind him would be a cast of dour-faced Republicans, each looking as if they had just been told they were going to have to sit through eight consecutive hours of opera.Instead, Republican lawmakers could be scene on the Senate floor this past Saturday looking like they were all auditioning for the role of the Cheshire Cat. There were even salacious rumors of laughter, high-fives, and chest bumps (none of those from Justice Kavanaugh).During the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump said in a tweet,  Republicans don t know how to fight and win   I will teach them!  Well class has been in session for almost two years and Republican Senators just passed their midterms.I actually think he is doing something more than teaching them how to win. I believe he is teaching them to hate to lose. That can be an even greater motivator for people in general and politicians in particular. The Democrats hate to lose, and they are filled with hate right now.The President is also reinforcing how he will support those joining the fight. When Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) gave her inspiring speech on the floor of the Senate Friday, and then followed it up with a  yes  vote on Kavanaugh Saturday, President Trump took to Twitter to praise her courage. This despite Sen. Collins s frequent criticisms of the President over the last two years.Converts to  winning  are welcome.Until this past Saturday, the Republicans in Washington had been behaving as though they were so afraid of the Democrats they were unwilling to exploit their numerical advantages. Despite having a majority in both the House and the Senate, the Republicans have repeatedly acted as though they were hopelessly outnumbered and that by aggressively challenging the Democrats and the pop-culture infantry that serves them would simply place their members at too great a risk of loss.Now these formerly timid Republicans have joined President Trump and the real resistance movement. This past week, they were willing to fight and resist the Democrats attempt to derail and destroy Constitutional process, due process, civil process, and moral process.And they won.President Trump warned us just before the election in 2016 that he was going to make sure America started winning. He said we would win, win, win and we would keep winning until Americans got tired of winning. Exhausted, we were going to protest that we couldn t win anymore. He said he was going to encourage us at that moment to keep winning so we could make America great again!Well, it took a while, but the Republican Party just started winning. They figured it out just in time. We are less than one month away from an election that will determine how much their President, the man who is coaching them on how to win, is able to accomplish over the next two years. They ought to be able to build some momentum from the Kavanaugh victory.They can t be tired of winning yet. Let s hope they are just getting started.Charlie Kirk is the founder and president of Turning Point USA.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/10/08/cnns-acosta-trump-knows-all-about-mobs-he-encourages-them/","Monday on CNN s  Newsroom,  network chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta said President Donald Trump knew  what mob rule and mob tactics look like because he encourages them. Acosta said,  It s pretty remarkable what he s saying, Brooke. We should point out, a few minutes before you came on the air, he was making additional comments at this law enforcement speech that he s giving down in Orlando, Florida. He was talking about the battle over Brett Kavanaugh and some of the allegations that were brought forward. And he said, quote, It was a disgraceful situation brought about by people who are evil.  So the president is putting this in some very stark   I mean just the most pointed terms possible. It is unclear, Brooke, whether or not the President is lumping in the accuser in that Brett Kavanaugh saga, Christine Blasey Ford, into that comment when he says that this was brought forward by people who are evil. If you talk to people inside the White House, inside the Republican party, obviously in the Democratic side, they all believe Christine Blasey Ford, to the point where she says she was sexually assaulted. Where there seems to be a huge divide is that people like Susan Collins and so on say while they believe Christine Blasey Ford, was assaulted, they don t believe that Brett Kavanaugh committed that act. He continued,  But it is rather striking, Brooke, to hear the president continue this battle, almost as if he wants it to continue. And we ll see some of that later on this evening when the president hosts an event over here at the White House in the East Room, where Brett Kavanaugh will be brought out in front of the cameras and announced as the next Supreme Court justice. This is the victory lap that they re looking for over here at the White House. The way this is being framed in the most stark political terms possible, it does raise the question whether or not the president is trying to go too far with some of this rhetoric, you know? His talk of mob rule and so on, I mean, Brooke, have you been to a Trump rally? He added,  You do hear rhetoric at those rallies that would conjure up images of a mob. Go back to the 2016 campaign when the president said as a candidate that he would like to punch protesters in the face and so on. So perhaps the president knows what mob rule and mob tactics look like because he encourages them himself. Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN

It was a disgraceful situation brought about by people that are evil, and he toughed it out,  he said.  We all toughed it out together.

I haven t heard him say that again to me, but I think he still believes it,  Trump said as the audience laughed.The audience applauded loudly when Kavanaugh was mentioned. People are loving that man and loving that choice. I think we re all going to be very happy,  he said.

Those who believe that Bill Clinton should never have been impeached for allegedly lying about his sex life are now going to lead the campaign to impeach Kavanaugh for allegedly lying about his sexual and drinking activities back when he was a 17-year-old? It s hypocrisy run rampant. The Constitution would not permit impeachment of a sitting justice for actions he took while a private citizen 35 years ago, nor, I think, would it permit using the laws of perjury, which are very tough. They have to be about a material fact that has to have been a deliberate lie, not forgetfulness, not a boast, not an exaggeration, but a willful, deliberate lie about a material fact. I think that the Democrats are shooting themselves in the foot. We ought to be moving forward. Let s judge Justice Kavanaugh on his performance as a justice of the Supreme Court.

Kevin Cramer (R-ND) told Breitbart News Sunday that Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND)  flushed  her bipartisan brand with her vote opposing Judge Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court.Congressman Cramer, who hopes to unseat Heitkamp in the North Dakota Senate race, told Breitbart News Sunday host Amanda House that Sen. Heitkamp s vote against Judge Kavanaugh on Saturday tarnished her brand as a bipartisan lawmaker. Politically speaking, it plays very well for me. I will tell you I was perhaps the most surprised person in America when she decided to vote  no.  I was certain she would vote  yes.  She was running her entire campaign on the brand that she s the most bipartisan senator from North Dakota; she can reach across the aisle,  Cramer told Breitbart News.  She likes to fasten herself as pro-Trump most of the time. She says that she votes with him; he s right for North Dakota.  That effort to brand herself [as bipartisan] was flushed in one vote  the North Dakota Republican added:Cramer also said many North Dakotans told him that Heitkamp s vote against Kavanaugh was the  deciding factor for them to vote for  him.Sen. Heitkamp also admitted recently that her vote against Kavanaugh was not a  smart political move  adding,  That s the way it just goes. In contrast, Rep. Cramer said the  polls are showing from a margin of two-to-one they wanted Brett Kavanaugh to become Justice Kavanaugh. Heitkamp s support continues to plummet in recent polls. In a Fox News poll, Cramer leads against Heitkamp by 12 points, whereas in a September poll, Cramer only led by 4 points.The Fox News poll also found that if Heitkamp were to vote against Kavanaugh, 34 percent would be less likely to vote for her, whereas only 17 percent would be likely to vote for her.The North Dakota Republican said,  She voted with Chuck Schumer instead of Donald Trump in North Dakota.

Phil Bredesen is running to fill the vacancy created by retiring Republican Senator Bob Corker. Bredesen s Republican opponent is Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who has been surging in the polls.Using her Instagram account, Swift wrote,  As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She went on:[Blackburn] voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives.Using his Twitter account, Bredesen thanked Swift.  I m honored to have your support and that of so many Tennesseans who are ready to put aside the partisan shouting and get things done. But Swift s timing could not have been worse. Bredesen had just come out in support of confirming Kavanaugh to the highest court, and two influential left-wing groups immediately came out swinging against him: MoveOn.org and Priorities USA.Both claim to have withdrawn their support, including  a  six-figure digital video ad expenditure for Phil Bredesen  that is now canceled  due to his Kavanaugh position.

It s fuck Trump!   he said.The 75-year-old actor also bashed Trump in a speech to high schoolers, saying,  What does the truth even mean today?

Rhodes said,  I think it just shows you how dishonest and disingenuous their initial comments were after Dr. Ford came forward when they were bending backwards to say they wanted to hear from her. Now you have people like Senator Collins saying well, she was sexually assaulted, but it wasn t Brett Kavanaugh with no basis for her to make that assertion. Now you have President Trump is essentially insulting every survivor in this country and frankly sending a message that people shouldn t come forward by saying it was made up. He s showing his true colors. He added,  These midterm elections are always dominated by the energy in opposition to the party that is in power. That is Donald Trump, and that s not going to change because of what s happened. He continued,  It s important Democratic voters feel like their energized to come out and vote for Democrats. If the Democrats are constantly trying to tack themselves off the Republicans and have a national message designed to protect one red state Senate race, they re not going to energize the base of voter they need to take back the House. That s the main event in the midterm election. I think the fact that Democrats supported survivors and held Kavanaugh to account and frankly revealed him to be the rabid partisan he is, that is what voters need to see to get energized to come out and vote for Democrats. Either because they want a different alternative to President Trump or even if they are sympathetic to Trump they want to make sure there s a check in a divided government. On Taylor Swift endorsing Democrats, Rhodes said,  I don t think one celebrity makes that big a difference. What I do think it might represent, though, that s more important, is women voters. You know, younger women voters turning out in bigger numbers. Frankly, white women swung the election to Donald Trump in 2016. And contrary to what Mitch McConnell is saying and a kind of Washington parlor game, I think you see in the number of people running who are women on the Democratic side, the survivors who are coming forward, the Women s March. I think we could be surprised at the scale of the turnout among women including younger women in this country in the midterm elections. I think it s more interesting to me that she s coming forward as a woman and making those points than coming forward as a celebrity.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/trump-blasts-democrats-for-pushing-kavanaugh-impeachment-over-hoax-allegations/","President Donald Trump on Monday criticized Democrats for already discussing the idea of impeaching newly-confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, calling allegations of teenage sexual predation a Democrat-led  hoax. President Trump on talks of Kavanaugh impeachment:  I think it s an insult to the American public, and I think you re going to see a lot of things happen on November 6 that would not have happened before  pic.twitter.com/MINAGYJTJx  NBC News (@NBCNews) October 8, 2018 I ve been hearing that now they re thinking about impeaching a brilliant jurist, a man that did nothing wrong, a man that was caught up in a hoax set up by the Democrats, using the Democrats  lawyers. Now they want to impeach him,  President Trump told reporters on the White House grounds.  I ve heard this from many people. I think it s an insult to the American public, and I think you re going to see a lot of things happen on November 6 that would not have happened before. Last week, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) vowed to probe teenage sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh.  It is not something we are eager to do,  Nadler told the New York Times last week.  But the Senate having failed to do its proper constitutionally mandated job of advise and consent, we are going to have to do something to provide a check and balance, to protect the rule of law and to protect the legitimacy of one of our most important institutions. However, not all Democrats are on board   yet.In an interview with Yahoo News, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) refused to dismiss discussions of removing Kavanaugh if Democrats retake a majority in Congress next month.  I think that after the dust settles on the night of the 6th, I think that s where we start to evaluate  what is the best thing for us to be focusing on in terms of what s best for America and the American people,  the 2020 hopeful said.The Senate on Saturday confirmed Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court 50-48 and was promptly sworn in as the 114th justice by Chief Justice John Roberts and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/michael-avenatti-brett-kavanaugh-fruit-basket/","Not only should Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh (man, I love writing that) send Michael Avenatti a fruit basket, we all should because without him, America might be in a much darker place today.There is no reason to reiterate what it would have meant had the obscene smear campaign against Kavanaugh succeeded, had sexual McCarthyism won the day. But there were two counter-intuitive turning points in this bruising 18-day battle that are worth looking at.The first was President Trump s decision to mock Christine Blasey Ford s testimony at a Mississippi rally last Tuesday.Ford accused Kavanaugh of attempting to assault her at a 1982 house party, and after her Senate testimony, the unwritten rule demanded everyone believe she was guilty only of fingering the wrong man. Sorry, no. In my opinion, she lied, and I have tons of documentation to back up that opinion.But no one supporting Kavanaugh dared talk about this, and the unwillingness to discuss inconvenient truths about Ford s story put the confirmation in real danger.Enter Trumpzilla.When the president stood before the world and mocked Ford s memory lapses, while it may have  disgusted  and  appalled  some, it also shifted the narrative. Hoping the viral clip would sway a handful of then-undecided senators to vote against Kavanaugh s confirmation, the corrupt media broadcast the clip endlessly for 36 hours. But the tactic backfired, just as Trump knew it would.All at once, the spotlight was off of Kavanaugh s yearbook and virginity and on the gaping holes in Ford s testimony. This mattered  bigly.And then there is Mr. Avenatti, the FameMonster brought to life by tabloid outlet CNNThe porn star s lawyer stepped on the biggest rake of them all.Let me explain to you what the media and Democrats (pardon the repetition) had planned We will call it The Sunday Night Blitz.After Ford came forward, everyone assumed that if we made it through the following weekend without a second accuser, Kavanaugh was home free   because one accuser with three named witnesses who sided with Kavanaugh was not going to be enough to disqualify him.As the sun set on Sunday night, and just as we were beginning to exhale, Mr. #MeToo dropped his precision-timed bomb. Ronan Farrow was supposed to take Kavanaugh out. Using his own clout and Deborah Ramirez s allegation that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken 1983 dorm party, this was meant to be the kill shot. One of three things was now supposed to happen1) Knowing he was doomed and sick of the whole process, Kavanaugh would surrender. 2) Trump would cut bait in the hopes of getting someone else over the finish line before the midterms. 3) A couple of lily-livered GOP senators would pull their support, which would doom everything.In other words, the left pushed all their chips into the middle of the table. But there were a couple of problems.The first is that the Farrow story was a joke. Although it was expertly crafted to present her ludicrous allegation into the aforementioned kill shot, Ramirez s accusation was even weaker than Ford s. All of Ramirez s so-called witnesses bolstered Kavanaugh s claim that he was innocent. (This included Ramirez s best friend in college). What s more, Ramirez admitted to being  foggy  drunk on the night in question. We later learned she had been calling around admitting she could not remember who the culprit was.The second and much larger problem for Democrats was Mr. Michael Avenatti.Mere moments after Farrow delivered his kill shot, Avenatti bumbled all over it by parachuting in like a lummox on meth, hoping to steal Farrow s thunder and secure the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination.Like something out of a movie titled Lex Luthor: Mall Cop, Avenatti floated down into a field of rakes while screaming,  GANG RAPIST! GANG RAPIST! And just like that *snap* the whole scheme was exposed. It was even more exposed when all of the establishment media proved they were in on the conspiracy by taking Avenatti s outrageous claims seriously, even though he had not yet produced his alleged victim, Julie Swetnick.This is when all decent people realized the fix was in, the frame was on, and the assassination of Brett Kavanaugh really was a left-wing plot.In other words, Avenatti overplayed his hand, and by doing so, exposed that it was all a big, fat bluff.To the surprise of no one, this was only further exposed a couple days later when Swetnick finally did come forward. Her sworn statement about Kavanaugh spiking punchbowls so he and his friends could run gang rape trains on incapacitated women was hot garbage.And her subsequent NBC interview, where she basically recanted everything in her statement, was the best evidence ever presented against The Matriarchy s fascist talking point about  Believe All Women. And that right there is the rub, the undercurrent, the subtext of this disaster. The FameMonster they built destroyed their conspiracy by unwittingly dropping Democrats and their media allies into a  Believe All Women  box.As fascist and un-American as it is,  Believe All Women  is a pretty solid talking point, at least until one of the women we are supposed to believe is accusing someone of being a serial rapist based only on the fact she  saw him by  a punch bowl and that he  definitely huddled  with other boys.Would Kavanaugh had been confirmed without Avenatti s pratfall?We will never know for sure.But based on her own speech, Avenatti s Lex Luthor: Mall Cop routine was a major turning point for the one person who mattered   Susan Collins. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/ronna-romney-mcdaniel-kavanaugh-confirmation-battle-completely-energized-gop-voters/","Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel on Sunday told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace that Republican voters are  completely energized  after a successfully hard-fought battle to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgWaXVqJN3EA partial transcript is as follows:WALLACE: The fight over the Kavanaugh confirmation seems to have energized Republican voters. I want to take a look at a poll. In a poll in July, 78 percent of Democrats said that the November elections are very important  compared to 68 percent of Republicans. In a new poll, a ten point enthusiasm gap has now shrunk to two points. 82 percent for Democrats, 80 percent for Republicans. What is it about the Kavanaugh confirmation process that you think has mobilized your voters?MCDANIEL: I think it s been a culmination of things. The Democrats have doubled down resist and obstruct  the past two years. This [the Kavanaugh confirmation process] has brought all of this to the forefront   the protests, the interruptions during the hearings and now with this smear campaign of Judge Kavanaugh, holding these allegations to the eleventh hour. I think Republicans have woken up and said Listen, it s a very clear choice, do we won t resist, obstruct, delay, dysfunction in Washington?  They are also seeing the results, 3.7 percent unemployment, four million new jobs in this country. It s a pretty clear choice which party s delivering and which party is obstructing.WALLACE: Some analysts say that this new energy, what Senator McConnell called a political gift of the Kavanaugh case, will help you more in Senate races, in state-wide races, than it will House races, particularly in suburban districts. A recent Quinnipiac Poll, when voters were asked the generic ballot question who do you back in your House district?  49 percent said the Democratic candidate, while 42 percent said the Republicans. So, it s still plus seven for the Democrats. Is the Kavanaugh bump, if there is any, playing differently in House and Senate races?MCDANIEL: It s not. It s helping across the board. The generic ballot has narrowed from double digits. Now it s at seven. I m looking at every race across the country. We have about 30 that are in the margin of error, certainly in districts where Hillary Clinton won where we have Republican incumbents. Our job is to turn out our base first. Our base is completely energized right now. The Kavanaugh hearings have just highlighted how important this election is for them.

Bill Nelson (D-FL) has an F-rating from the NRA and wants many new gun controls, including a national database of all firearm sales and firearm owners.The Miami Herald reports that Nelson has an F-rating from the NRA and supports an  assault weapons  ban and barring 18-20 year olds from exercising their Second Amendment rights to purchase long guns.Nelson also opposes national reciprocity for concealed carry. This opposition means your Second Amendment rights stop at your state s border in Nelson s mind; that you have no right to carry a gun for self-defense in any state but your state of residence.Breitbart News reported that Nelson also supports universal background checks. Such checks outlaw private gun sales, criminalizing a neighbor for selling a gun to a neighbor or a co-worker for selling a gun to fellow employee.Universal background checks require a national gun registry in order to be enforceable, and Nelson is already on record supporting a national database of all gun sales and gun owners. In 2014 he co-sponsored the Crime Gun Tracing Modernization Act, a bill intended to create a  searchable database of the importation, production, shipment, receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms. Nelson voted against confirming pro-Second Amendment Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court but the NRA-ILA reports he voted for Barack Obama s  anti-gun nominees to the Supreme Court   including Sonia Sotomayor, who signed a Supreme Court opinion saying that Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/nancy-pelosi-rallies-colleagues-after-kavanaugh-loss-dont-agonize-organize/","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is attempting to boost morale among her Democratic colleagues in the wake of the fight over Justice Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation by urging them to  OWN OCTOBER  and win a majority in the November elections.The letter, dated Sunday, October 7, tacitly acknowledges that Democrats are dejected after failing to stop Kavanaugh   and that Republicans are enjoying a massive boost in voter enthusiasm that could help the GOP retain Congress in the midterms.A new survey of battleground districts published by the Washington Post on Monday shows that Democrats only enjoy a narrow edge in the race to control the House of Representatives, 50% to 46% (with a margin of error of 2%).The letter, obtained by Politico, exhorts Democrats not to give up:We must not agonize, we must organize. People must vote. What is at stake in this election is nothing less than the health and financial security of families across America. The new conservative majority on the Supreme Court threatens a rollback of protections for people with pre-existing conditions, more leverage for corporate special interests over working families, and little hope to reform CitizensUnited. That is why we must fight even harder to win so that we can advance our For The People agenda:lower health costs and prescription drug prices;raise workers  wages with strong economic growth by rebuilding America;clean up corruption to make Washington work for the people.In stark contrast to the GOP Congress, our Democratic agenda will be conducted with openness and accountability to the people, fairness to everyone, and solutions that bring us together.With the majority, we will strengthen the Congress to the vision of our Founders: Article I, the first branch of government, a check and balance on the executive and judiciary.To achieve this, we must OWN OCTOBER with our For The People agenda, which I hope you will advance in events and on social media in the weeks ahead.Thanks for your leadership.Curiously, the original letter includes abrupt changes in font and a glaring capitalization error.On Sunday, Pelosi also sent a fundraising email urging recipients to  never forget and never forgive  over Kavanaugh s confirmation.Pelosi hopes to return as Speaker of the House if Democrats win a majority   a position she held from 2007 to 2011, amidst much controversy.Joel B.

People say, Where do you get this energy?   Trump said in Pennsylvania last week.  You know where I get it? If you love doing it, it s easy. If you don t like doing it, not so good! His approval ratings hit 51 percent in a recent Rassmussen poll of registered voters, tying a record he set for 2018 in May.Trump s biggest concern is history. The opposing political party typically takes back power in the midterm elections as the party in power gets complacent.Recent polls, however, show increased Republican enthusiasm for the midterm elections as a result of the contentious Kavanaugh confirmation process. The only reason to vote Democrat is if you re getting tired of winning,  Trump said to his supporters on Saturday.  We want to win, win, win! After the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings brought out the worst in the left, Trump argued that the Democrats cannot be trusted with power. You don t hand matches to an arsonist, and you don t give power to an angry left-wing mob, and that s what they ve become,  Trump said in Kansas on Saturday.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/media-conspiracies-about-brett-kavanaughs-yearbook-debunked/","The establishment media have been spreading conspiracy theories about Brett Kavanaugh s yearbook for more than three weeks. Now those conspiracies have been fully debunked.Yes, Kavanaugh s confirmation fight is over, but the autopsy exposing the establishment media s lies must continue.There are three entries in the now-Associate Supreme Court Justice s high school yearbook from 1983 that Democrats and their media allies told us proved that Kavanaugh was a drunken serial rapist:1)  FFFFForther of July     an acronym for gang rape:  Find them, French them, Feel them, Finger them, F*** them, Forget them. 2)  Devil s Triangle   A threesome with one woman and two men. In other words, two men exploiting and abusing a woman as piece of meat.3)  Have You Boofed Yet?     boof  being slang for sex.During his testimony last week, Kavanaugh was asked about all three and claimed they were perfectly innocent in-jokes among high school buddies.He testified that  FFFFF  referred to the memorable way a friend in his group said the word  fuck.  Devil s Triangle,  Kavanaugh said, was a drinking game like Quarters. Boofed  is a reference to flatulence.So what you have here are a bunch of high school guys using their yearbook to forever document their silly jargon.Naturally, though, no one on the left believed him, and as the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh began to collapse, in order to defeat his nomination, the media were forced to invent perjury charges. The laugh-out-loud claim was that Kavanaugh had risked his reputation, career, and prison to cover up juvenile in-jokes.On cable news, online, over social media, and in the newspapers, to say the elite media were dedicated to framing Kavanaugh as a perjurer, would be quite the understatement. Over and over and over again, now that smearing Kavanaugh as a sexual predator had failed, the media would disqualify him for drinking beer in high school and lying about farting as an adult.Well, after days and days of endless smears, we finally learned the truth, and the truth is that Kavanaugh told the truth.No less than the New York Times debunked the  FFFFF  controversy on Wednesday. Buried deep in a pathetic exposé about a 1983 party Kavanaugh planned (impressively, I would add), the Times writes:When he drank, Mr. Garrett would stutter words that began with the letter F. It became such a joke that many football teammates, including Judge Kavanaugh and Mr. Garrett himself, had  FFFFF  references in their personal yearbook pages.Washington Post reporter Charles Lane corroborated a key part of Kavanaugh s explanation for the origins of  FFFFF. Since it s come up   I grew up across the street in Chevy Chase from the guy known as  Squi  and saw him every day in my childhood. He did not stutter, so nothing to mock in that dept. but he did have that funny way of saying the F-word, as BK said. FWIW.  Charles Lane (@ChuckLane1) September 27, 2018On Thursday, the  Devil s Triangle  conspiracy theory was finally put to bed when four former Kavanaugh classmates issued sworn statements confirming that it was indeed a drinking game. If the phrase Devil s Triangle  had any sexual meaning in the 1980s, we did not know it,  they wrote under penalty of felony.One of the letter writers, Bernard McCarthy, wrote in his yearbook that he invented the name  Devil s Triangle,  which is contemporaneous proof of its meaning. A total of six people have corroborated this.Another sworn statement from a former classmate debunked the  boof  conspiracy theory.A simple search of Google Books found that  boof  is indeed slang for passing gas.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

He also displayed an image of White House adviser Stephen Miller with his head on a spike in 2017.In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Colbert went on a strange rant where he declared that feeling positively about being a white male Christian was a  dark feeling. Reflecting on his old Comedy Central show The Colbert Report, he said,  The question was, why am I, Stephen Colbert   white, male, straight, Christian, Americana hegemonic figure? In my life, I don t just mean in character.  I m like, Yeah, fuck yeah, me, me. Me, white male Christian, American, straight. Number one!  That is a dark feeling, because it is indulging in an appetite for yourself, it s very possessive, it s very consumptive, it s pornographic, and so the confession is: Yes, I have these feelings as well. But the question is: Why are those feelings indulged in America?  he told the magazine.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/07/pollak-everything-in-moderation-including-moderation-in-brett-kavanaugh-fight/","The Senate s moderates were the stars of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation battle. With the slender Republican majority   just one vote on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and two votes in the Senate overall   the moderates held unusual influence.They showed both the positive and negative side of moderation   the way in which swing votes compel both sides to work together, or create more opportunities for partisan bickering. And they also showed that moderation has its limits   even for moderates.Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) provided a shining example of moderation at its best. Her valediction on the Senate floor Friday was so careful, pragmatic, and convincing that even the New York Times   otherwise livid at Kavanaugh s confirmation   had to acknowledge that she made an excellent case. She also played the theatrics of the moment perfectly: by leaving the country in suspense as to which way she would vote, she ensured that the whole nation would pay close attention to her arguments.Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), by contrast, showed moderation at its worst. She took a wishy-washy middle position that had little philosophical or intellectual justification. Caught between two sides, Murkowski made herself vulnerable to sentimental persuasion by survivors of sexual assault   whose experiences, while compelling, had nothing to do with the facts of the case before the Senate. In the end, Murkowski broke with the Republicans without earning any respect across the aisle for doing so.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) showed that moderation can take great courage, when one s own party has run to the extreme. True, Manchin may also have had self-serving motives: in voting to confirm Kavanaugh, he was siding with the majority of the conservative West Virginia electorate, with just weeks to go before a tough re-election. But he also stood up to incredible pressure from a left-wing mob that was literally standing outside his office and screaming at everyone who entered and left.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) showed that while moderates can be frustrating, they can also be helpful. Because he held the swing vote on the committee, he was able to dictate the process, insisting on a week-long supplemental FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh even after the special hearing. Republicans were hugely irritated, but when the inquiry   predictably   turned up nothing, it became clear that Flake s gambit had given Kavanaugh s appointment new legitimacy.Finally, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) showed that while moderation has its uses, it also has its limits. He was in a unique position to make the case for Kavanaugh after having voted to confirm both Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, telling fellow Republicans  elections have consequences.  When Democrats failed to reciprocate that civility, Graham blasted them for what they had done. He cast his moderation aside and became one of Kavanaugh s most forceful advocates, rallying his party s base.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/10/07/jordan-peterson-kavanaugh-should-step-down-from-supreme-court-to-have-his-name-cleared/","Professor Jordan Peterson argued this weekend that Brett Kavanaugh should step down from the Supreme Court for a  less divisive  nominee to take his place, despite Peterson s past advice to  never apologize to a mob. In a tweet, Peterson chimed in on a tweet by Eric Weinstein that criticized Brett Kavanaugh s upcoming appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States.  If confirmed, Kavanaugh should step down,  Peterson tweeted.The tweet came in response to a thread by former Evergreen State College Professor Bret Weinstein, who called Kavanaugh an  entitled punk. My position on the #Kavanaugh confirmation: Both outcomes are completely unacceptable.  Bret Weinstein (@BretWeinstein) October 5, 2018 My position on the #Kavanaugh confirmation: Both outcomes are completely unacceptable,  Weinstein wrote.  Kavanaugh was clearly, at the very least, an entitled punk through college. Nothing suggests a radical shift in mindset,  he added.  He appears to be the kind of adult that entitled punks grow into.  Putting someone on the court who is likely to view the world through those narrow eyes is a betrayal of the most elemental American values,  he continued.  All the worse that the nomination came from another entitled punk. It s a divisive finger-in-the-eye-for-life to patriots of all stripes. Several hours after Peterson called for Kavanaugh to step down, he attempted to explain his rationale.   I m not certain that is the right move. It s very complex. But he would have his name cleared, and a figure who might be less divisive might be put forward,  he tweeted.I m not certain that is the right move. It s very complex. But he would have his name cleared, and a figure who might be less divisive might be put forward. https://t.co/oNQB2bRsC7  Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) October 6, 2018Some pointed to an older tweet from Peterson, in which he argued that caving to mob mentality is dangerous, as evidence of his hypocrisy.  Never, never, never apologize to a mob. Particularly if you have done nothing wrong. You re a poet.

 This entire process has been turned into a joke,  she wrote.  And if the Democrats are able to get what they want out of it, whether because Kavanaugh nobly but futilely falls on his own sword, or because the Democrat mob opts to impeach the equivalent of pulling a fire alarm to shut down a speaker they don t like   it will open a door we do NOT want opened.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/07/dems-latest-scheme-balance-supreme-court-by-adding-two-liberal-judges/","NEW YORK   Following the confirmation of President Donald Trump s Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh, some Democrats and progressive activists are shifting tactics, pushing a scheme to  pack  or  balance  the Supreme Court by adding two new seats to be filled by liberal judges. The Supreme Court expansion plot would be enacted if Democrats retake Congress and the presidency in 2020, according to the plan.On Saturday, Vice s West Coast editor Harry Cheadle referenced the plot in a piece titled,  We re Watching the Slow Poisoning of the Supreme Court. He wrote:Chatter of impeaching Kavanaugh was floating around, and some have taken to imagining a scenario where the Democrats retake Congress and the White House in 2020 but have their progressive legislation blocked by the Supreme Court. The only way forward then, the argument goes, would be appointing extra justices to  pack  the court a scheme proposed by Franklin Roosevelt in response to a similarly right-wing Supreme Court in the 30s (FDR s plan was rejected by Congress, but the court became friendlier to his policies anyway).On Sunday, Vox.com featured an interview with political scientist David Faris, who advocated in a recently published book for Democrats to pack the Supreme Court with as many liberal judges as they can. Farris branded the plan the  neutron option for the Supreme Court. Cheadle himself previously summarized Faris s arguments thusly:[It] would involve first proposing a constitutional amendment to end lifetime tenure on the court and pushing a proposal to let each president pick two justices per term, a compromise that Faris hopes would  end the court wars.  He suspects Republicans wouldn t go for that, however, so he d advise the next Democratic president to just  pack  the court as FDR tried to do in 1937 before Congress rose up against him and prevented it. That would involve passing a bill to expand the size of the court and allowing the president to appoint however many justices would be needed to create a new liberal majority, with the friendly Senate signing off on any appointee. (This would be legal, Faris points out, because there s nothing in the Constitution stipulating the size of the court, which has in fact fluctuated in the past.)Indiana Law professor and podcaster Ian Samuel, meanwhile, advocated for such a plan to become a new progressive catch phrase, tweeting,  Pack the courts  should be a phrase on par with abolish ICE.  Huffington Post senior reporter Zach Carter followed with a piece titled,  Hey, Democrats: Pack The Court.   Eleven Justices  is the next Abolish ICE,   was the subtitled of the article.Writing at NBC.com on Sunday, political science professor Scott Lemieux opined that  Democrats are now much more likely to mobilize against an even more conservative court. He continued:But how might Democratic leaders respond?A more likely scenario   especially if a Trumpified Supreme Court not only effectively overrules Roe v. Wade but then keeps striking down legislation passed by the next unified Democratic government   is expanding the size of the Supreme Court. The constitution does not fix the size of any federal appellate court, and the number of justices can be changed with simple majorities of both houses of Congress. Doing so isn t hypothetical: After the Civil War, congressional Republicans manipulated the size of the court to ensure that it wouldn t interfere with Reconstruction.On Thursday, Bustle.com s Caroline Burke asked,  Why Are There 9 Supreme Court Justices? Burke noted that  packing the court  might  sound kind of revolutionary, mostly because of the stigma around the Supreme Court as an institution that is above partisan politics, not to mention the notion of justices having life terms on the bench. Burke continued:But the number of Supreme Court justices isn t a foundational American tenet, like termed presidencies. It s just a law   and more and more, intellectuals and thought leaders are raising the idea of packing the courts as the only solution to ensuring the continuation of progressive legislation in coming years.Last month, activist attorney Michael Avenatti advocated for the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate to add two seats to the bench and expand the Supreme Court to eleven seats, ostensibly by picking additional liberal judges. The Dem nominee must commit to this or not receive the nomination IMO,  Avenatti tweeted about his proposal.  There is far too much at stake. Also last month, British journalist Mehdi Hassan wrote in the Intercept that following the nomination of Kavanaugh it is now  past time for liberals and the left to consider court packing: When they next have control of the House, the Senate, and the White House, Democrats should add at least two new seats to the Supreme Court and then fill them, ideally, with left-wing, well-qualified women of color. They could even call it court balancing.  The far-left Daily Kos blog issued a  warning for Republicans  that if Kavanaugh is confirmed, a  future government controlled by Democrats  is  likely to pursue that option   referring to  court packing. In July, Yale Law School professors Ian Ayres and John Fabian Witt laid out the case in the Washington Post for expanding the Supreme Court, referring to the tactic as  court balancing.  Democrats need a Plan B for the Supreme Court. Here s one option,  their oped was titled.The duo advocated for Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to announce a plan aimed at  balancing  the Supreme Court if the Democrats can win a majority in Congress and take the presidency in the 2020 election.Ayres and Witt note the Constitution does not stipulate the Supreme Court must have nine seats and they reference historical precedent for expanding the nation s highest court:The court originally had six seats. It expanded and contracted in the first half of the 19th century, then settled on nine. It has remained there since 1869, partly as a political norm and partly to preserve competitive equilibrium.At crucial moments in U.S. politics, parties have acted to change the size of the Supreme Court. Often the tactic was a political power play. But sometimes it was undertaken for the good of the country, as during the Civil War, when the Republican Congress in 1863 added a seat to the court in part to protect the success of the war effort against formidable legal challenges.The Democrats  court-balancing proposal for 2020 should commit the party to expanding the size of the Supreme Court by appointing two new federal judges who, by statute, would be designated to sit on the court for 18 years; thereafter, the constitutionally required life tenure would be served in lower federal courts.While pushing their proposal under the banner of  balancing,  the Yale professors do not disguise their goal of packing the court with two new liberal judges:If Democrats took control of Congress and the presidency in 2020, the new administration would effectively have two Supreme Court slots to fill immediately. The party should commit to nominate one liberal (say, the liberal analog of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch) and to fill the other spot by renominating the liberal-centrist Garland himself.Ayers and Witt were referring to the nomination of Merrick Garland, who was the pick of Barack Obama, then a lame duck president, to fill the slot left vacant following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.LA Times journalist and blogger Michael Hiltzik pushed a similar plan in a piece titled,  How a new court-packing scheme could save the Supreme Court from right-wing domination. The Economist last month also referenced the possibility of Democrats  packing  the Supreme Court:The judgments of a court seen as just another nakedly political body, no different from Congress or the presidency, can easily be dismissed or fought. Franklin Roosevelt mulled packing the court in the 1930s when it frustrated his New Deal ambitions. It is not hard to imagine a Democratic president and Congress doing the same in four years  time, if five Republican-appointed justices repeatedly strike down the ambitious social programmes these politicians promised.Aaron Klein is Breitbart s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

CNN s Don Lemon recently shrugged off the harassment of Sen Ted Cruz by an Antifa group, saying,  that s what he signed up for.  If you run for office, and you propose policies that are detrimental to people, as Americans, you have the right to tell your public officials that you don t like it. And if you re in a space where you re allowed to do that, then you can do it,  Lemon said.Meanwhile, CNN s Chris Cuomo explained Antifa violence by saying that while violence was wrong, those who were doing it to oppose  hate  were  on the side of right.  Two wrongs and what is right. The bigots are wrong to hit. Antifa or whomeveranarchists or malcontents or the misguidedthey are also wrong to hit. But fighting hate is right. And in a clash between hate and those who oppose it, those who oppose it are on the side of right,  Cuomo said in August.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who told protesters at the Supreme Court on Saturday that the nomination and confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh has  launched a movement  for left-wing judges to be installed in the U.S. judiciary branch. Today marks the day when progressives around this country launched a movement for a progressive court,  Warren said.Penny Starr/Breitbart NewsPenny Starr/Breitbart News We progressives have to make these courts   at the Supreme Court level and lower court level our issue,  Warren told the crowd of angry, black-clad protesters who opposed Kavanaugh.On Saturday afternoon the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh with a 48-50 vote making him the 114th Justice seated on the high court.Breitbart News reported the final vote came less than 30 hours after the Senate invoked cloture late Friday morning to end an attempted filibuster by Senate Democrats and one Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). Senators invoked cloture by a vote of 51-49, made possible by the  nuclear option  put in place by former Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) in 2013, lowering the threshold from 60 to 51 for presidential nominations. It may be a dark day for the court, but it s going to be a very bright day for the legal resistance in the country,  Warren said.Warren told the protest, organized by a coalition of leftists organizations, including Planned Parenthood, Demand Justice and the Women s March, co-founded by anti-Semite, anti-Israel Linda Sarsour, that the fight is about power. Because when we fight, we get stronger,  Warren said.  I want to remind everyone what this fight has done.  We have called out men of privilege and power who protect other men of privilege and power,  Warren said.She told the crowd that now they should turn their attention to the midterm elections to wrest the majority in the House and Senate from Republicans. They will dismantle our institutions, our democracy, our voting rights, and we cannot let them do that,  Warren said.  After this fight, we cannot go home.  We have to fight,  Warren said.

Gardner added that his support for Kavanaugh also prompted accusers to come forward with uncorroborated allegations.The Colorado Republican also received an anonymous letter from someone in Denver accusing Kavanaugh of shoving someone against a wall  very aggressively and sexually  in 1998 in front of four people, but the allegation was deemed unfounded and not credible. Every victim of abuse, assault, and violence has been through an unspeakable tragedy and we need to do a better job listening to them, ensuring support is available, and fighting to end abuse of any kind,  Gardner said in a statement before his wife received the gruesome messages.  I hope that the partisan divide we all feel today does not hinder the people that have bravely come forward. The recently confirmed Supreme Court justice and his family have also received death threats as he went through the confirmation process to become a Supreme Court judge.The doxxing attempts against the senator s family come just days after a former Democratic congressional staffer was arrested for allegedly posting home addresses and phone numbers of three Republican senators on Wikipedia.The ex-staffer, Jackson Cosko, 27, recently worked for Rep.

Collins said,  I was certainly undecided and after hearing Christine Ford s compelling and painful testimony I thought Oh, my goodness, he perhaps needs to withdraw.

She added,  I put myself in his shoes. He is coming forth and answering an allegation that includes that he was involved in gang raping and doping girls. I mean, that is so devastating. I think he reacted with anger and anguish as a father of two young girls, a 10-year-old and a 13-year-old. I did believe that he should not have taken the shot at the Clintons and that in his questioning with certain senators responding to their questioners, particularly Amy Klobuchar, that he stepped over the line.

Today is not the end of the world,  he said, before urging people to vote in the upcoming midterm elections.  That is tentatively scheduled for November. But you can do something to change it!  We need to revisit presidential powers,  Carrey said, presumably in reference to Trump s ability to now-nominate two conservative judges to the Supreme Court.  I don t think the founding fathers had a traitor in mind for the highest office.

She continued,  People are going to look at state law and circuit law, and they re now going to look at issues like late-term abortion. They are going to look at sex-selection abortion. They are certainly going to look at abortion after non-partisan scientists and doctors say a fetus can feel pain. This whole matter on the left of abortion anytime, anyone, anywhere, on demand, with absolutely no common sense applied to it whatsoever.

President Donald Trump, who beat his Democrat rival Hillary Clinton by 77 electoral votes (304-227) in the 2016 presidential election, has placed Neil Gorsuch and now Kavanaugh on the court. Both Justice Samuel Alito and John Roberts were selected by President George W.

In a September 2017 interview with CNN, Clinton told host Anderson Cooper that she believed the process was outdated and needed to be replaced.  We ve moved toward one-person, one-vote, that s how we select winners,  said Clinton.  I think it needs to be eliminated. I d like to see us move beyond it, yes. One year later, Clinton once again called for the electoral college to be eliminated in an opinion-editorial for the Atlantic, arguing President Donald Trump was a racist who was damaging American democracy.

Trump celebrated the confirmation of his second Supreme Court justice pick Brett Kavanaugh on Saturday, energizing his supporters ahead of the midterm elections. This is a historic night,  Trump said as he took the stage at a campaign rally in Topeka, Kansas.  I stand before you today on the heels of a tremendous victory for our nation, our people, and our beloved Constitution. The president lamented that Kavanaugh and his family were grossly mistreated during the confirmation process and thanked Republicans for standing by his choice for the Supreme Court. What he and his wonderful family endured at the hands of Democrats is unthinkable,  he said.  In their quest for power, the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob. Trump warned Americans that Democrats were unfit for power, urging them to vote for Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections. Just imagine the devastation they would cause if they ever obtained the power they so desperately want and crave,  he said, referring to the Democrats possibly winning the majority in Congress.Trump floated the possibility of having an additional Supreme Court nominee or possibly two but warned them that Democrats would likely block them if they ever took power. You don t hand matches to an arsonist, and you don t give power to an angry left-wing mob,  he said.The president said some of his advisers suggested he cancel his rally so he could remain in Washington, DC, on the day of the critical vote. I said, No way I m canceling,   he said as the crowd roared with approval.  No way! Trump signed Kavanaugh s commission order aboard Air Force One on the way to Kansas and spoke with the judge on the phone after he was confirmed, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters.Trump was jubilant. They ve always said the biggest thing a president can do is Supreme Court justice,  he said.  Some have had none. We ve had two in less than two years.

It s done,  Gutfeld said.  You won.  Yup, it was not about Kavanaugh at all. It wasn t about the court what about you, the system that protects you and something called due process. But first, first congrats to you, Democrats. This is what happens when you decide to burn the village in order to save it. And because of that Republicans finally found their stones.

I guess the gang rape thing did not work, so that was your backup?  he quipped.The Fox News host went on to emphasize the importance of November s election, which he said would further teach the  mob  a lesson. This is a great day,  Gutfeld said.  Kavanaugh and Trump may well have saved the country by defeating the mob. We are all vulnerable to the mob. The mob is defined by these things: subversion of justice, punishment without evidence, a willingness to discard individual rights and protections for immediate political gain. A mob is defined not by diverse voices, but by people imitating one sound   the sound of rage. And that is why it is so scary. The mob is an unbending beast in which intimidation is t s only commodity, which is why it s not about Kavanaugh at all but about you. It s about your kids, siblings, parents and spouses because the mob can happen to you, which is why this next election is huge. We must teach the mob a lesson. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Surabian offered his remarks in a Saturday interview with Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle on SiriusXM s Breitbart News Special.Surabian described Democrats  and leftists  behavior in opposing Kavanaugh over recent weeks as a  good thing  for Republicans. The one good thing about what happened over the last couple of weeks is [Democrats] ripped off the mask of moderation and revealed the face of radicalism to the American people,  remarked Surabian. LISTEN:Surabian continued,  The average American watching this clown show, this disgrace, is probably more motivated to show up and vote in November.  All the polling shows that they are now more likely   these people who have witnessed this are now more motivated today to vote who weren t motivated before this   [to be] motivated to vote for Republicans. Surabian added,  The good news for us, the good news for Republicans, the good news for Trump supporters is that we weren t the only people who have seen this. The entire public saw it. All American people saw it. Surabian went on,  They saw the disgraceful action of Dianne Feinstein and what she did by waiting until the last minute to drop the accusation. They saw the circus that was the hearing the other day. They saw the media class clapping like lemmings for everything the Democrats accused Kavanaugh of. They saw them eating it all up like the lap dogs that they are. Surabian concluded,  So what was once a hidden bias, what was once behind the scenes is now open for everyone in the country to see for themselves. The Democrat Party today is not the Democrat Party of our grandparents. The Democrat Party today is a radical leftist   almost socialist   party that doesn t give a crap about doing what s right. They don t care about honor. They don t care about integrity. They care about power. That should scare every single person. Surabian warned,  The first thing Democrats will do if they take Congress in November is reopen the investigation and try to impeach Justice Kavanaugh. Surabian urged Republicans to learn to  fight back  following the battle over Kavanaugh s nomination. This is an even bigger moment for the Republican Party, because it s the moment in time where the Republican Party finally realized that if we are going to defeat the left, if we re going to defeat the media, if we re going to defeat the Democrats, then we have to fight,  opined Surabian. Surabian went on,  This wasn t a time to back down. This wasn t a time to roll over. This was a time to start throwing haymakers, and that s exactly what we did, and now we stand here today with a new Supreme Court justice. Surabian cautioned Republicans and conservatives against complacency following Saturday s confirmation of Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice. Keep on fighting,  said Surabian.

Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) October 6, 2018Republicans have condemned the Democrat senator s handling of sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, alleging she kept them secret until just before the vote for political gain. Feinstein has defended her handling of the letter, saying she was respecting Christine Blasey Ford s requests for confidentiality. She denied Republican charges her office leaked Ford s letter accusing Kavanaugh of sexual assault to the press. Kavanaugh denies her allegation. At no point did I or anyone on my staff divulge Dr. Blasey Ford s name to press. She knows that and believes it, for which I m grateful,  Feinstein said Monday.  I find it interesting that the same critics who last week condemned me for not releasing Dr. Blasey Ford s letter against her wishes are now suggesting I did leak the letter. Feinstein s inarticulate denial only further raised suspicions that the California Democrat did indeed leak to the letter   even drawing the ire of  President Donald Trump, who imitated her unconvincing rebuke during a Wheeling, West Virginia, rally last week.   Dianne Feinstein, did you leak? Remember her answer. Did you leak the document?  President said before launching into an imitation of Feinstein s denial.  Uh, uh, what? No. Uh, no. I didn t le uh. Uh, wait one minute. Did we le oh, oh. No, no, we didn t leak it.  I ll tell you what. That was really bad body language. Who knows,maybe she didn t, but that was the worst body language I ve ever seen,  he added.In a press conference Thursday, Feinstein criticized the FBI s handling of its seventh background check into Kavanaugh s past, alleging the probe appeared to be a  product of an incomplete investigation that was limited, perhaps by the White House.  [W]hat I can say is that the most notable part of this report is what s not in it. As we noted by the White House, the FBI did not interview Brett Kavanaugh, nor did the FBI interview Dr. Blasey Ford,  Feinstein told reporters. What we ve heard, from numerous people, over the last few days, seeking to provide information to the FBI, we have seen even more press reports of witnesses who wanted to speak with the FBI, but were not interviewed. Deborah Ramirez s lawyer said he was unaware of any corroborating witnesses who were interviewed. Despite Feinstein and her Democrat colleagues  best efforts to thwart Kavanaugh s nomination, the Senate voted to confirm the Trump court pick 50-48, and was sworn in shortly after by Chief Justice John Roberts and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Brian Babin (TX) and Ted Budd (NC) said Saturday that Justice Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation has fired up the conservative base and that Democrats  behavior during the process has exposed how low they are willing to go to derail President Trump and try to gain back the House in November. I believe this was just another example, another sordid example of the extremes and the extent the Democrats would go to to delegitimize a duly-elected president in an electoral college landslide to try to derail this administration,  said Babin. The volume has been turned up. We re seeing how radical the left has really become,  Budd said.  This is radical, socialistic leftism. Babin and Budd joined Breitbart News Saturday on Sirius XM Patriot Channel 125 for live radio coverage of Kavanaugh s confirmation.Babin said despite Democrats  efforts to smear Kavanaugh, they  absolutely overstepped what they were trying to do.  The American people just absolutely did not stand for this. Americans don t like unfairness, they don t like deceit, they don t like the illegitimate violence that we ve seen, these protests that they ve had an eyeful of over the last several weeks, and I think they just stood up and started calling their senators,  he said.The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh by a 50 to 48 bipartisan vote on Saturday afternoon.Babin said he hoped Americans would keep Democrats  behavior in their memory until the midterm elections on November 6. It just shows the raw power that these Democrats are trying to gain by hook or crook. This is what we do not want to go back to. And with this confirmation, with the great booming economy, with safer communities, with a stronger military, with rolling back regulatory bureaucracy, I don t think the American people are going to want to go back to see Nancy Pelosi become Speaker of the House or Maxine Waters become a committee chairman over their banking industry,  he said.Budd said Kavanaugh s confirmation has fired up conservatives and the base. They re waking up and realizing that midterms are just as important as the presidential years for elections,  he told Breitbart News Saturday host Matt Boyle. This is a battle about those who want to stand up for the truth, [but] it s larger than just conservatives or Republicans   it s a battle for the truth.

This nomination and today s confirmation were about the Constitution and the foundational freedoms it was designed to protect. Today was a major step in the journey to restore the Constitution to its rightful and intended role in our Republic,  Family Research Council President Tony Perkins announced Saturday. Today is a victory for liberty in America. I am overjoyed that the Senate confirmed Brett Kavanaugh, a good man and good jurist. Justice Kavanaugh will serve with distinction as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States for years to come,  Heritage Foundation President Kay Cole James said in a Saturday statement.Kelly Shackelford, President, CEO, and General Counsel for First Liberty Institute, highlighted Kavanaugh s commitment to religious liberty, the First Amendment, and his  respect  for the court as why he was the right choice for the Supreme Court:As a law firm dedicated to defending religious freedoms, we are thrilled that Judge Kavanaugh has finally been confirmed to the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh has a solid history and commitment to protecting the religious freedoms and First Amendment rights of our citizens and has demonstrated in his many years on the bench a deep respect for the proper role of the judiciary.But many conservatives acknowledged the path to nomination was not easy, given that Kavanaugh had to overcome many obstacles from leftists and Senate Democrats looking to sink his nomination. History was made today as Brett Kavanaugh overcame an unimaginable smear campaign to be confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court,  said Perkins.  For the first time in decades, this nomination his nomination brought with it the reality of returning to a truly constitutionalist court. Many on the Left couldn t stand such a thought. And for that, he and his family have paid a tremendous price.  This is an outstanding achievement for President Donald J. Trump, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who overcame the Democrats  obstruction and delay strategies and confirmed Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,  Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund Chairwoman Jenny Beth Martin said Saturday, thanking all the senators who voted to confirm Kavanaugh to the nation s highest court.Some groups decided to investigate the Senate Democrats who tried to bring down Kavanaugh s nomination.Tom Fitton, president of the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, vowed to investigate anti-Kavanaugh senators for violating Senate rules throughout Kavanaugh s confirmation process:We are grateful that a majority of the Senate rejected the leftist smears, abuse of process, and rejection of constitutional norms. Now there must be accountability for this lawless assault on our constitutional republic. Judicial Watch has launched an investigation into the Senate ethics and legal abuses by anti-Kavanaugh Senators. And we will continue to pursue our Senate ethics complaint against Sen. Booker for his admitted violation of Senate rules, the violation of which requires expulsion from the Senate.The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court in a 50-48 vote on Saturday afternoon, giving conservatives the upper hand as the shift in the balance of power on the court could potentially make this the most conservative Supreme Court since 1937.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/trump-on-historic-night-from-kansas-kavanaugh-swearing-in-monday-at-white-house/","President Donald Trump announced at a Kansas rally Saturday night that there would be a Monday night swearing-in ceremony for soon-to-be Justice Brett Kavanaugh. This is a historic night,  Trump told the Topeka crowd, reminding them that they have the opportunity to render a verdict on the Democrats  conduct when they vote in November. He would go on to say,  You don t hand matches to an arsonist and you don t give power to an angry left-wing mob and that s what they ve become.  I stand before you today on the heels of a tremendous victory for our nation, our people, and our beloved Constitution,  the president told the crowd.He continued:Just a few hours ago the U.S. senate confirmed Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. And I proudly singed the Judge s commission aboard Air Force One just before landing. And this Monday night at 7 p.m. in the East Room of the White House we will perform the swearing in ceremony for soon-to-be Justice Kavanaugh. Great man.And he will sit proudly alongside Justice Neil Gorsuch who s doing a great job to uphold your sacred rights and to uphold your God-given freedom.And I want to thank our incredible Republican Senators for refusing to back down in the face of the Democrats shameless campaign of political and personal destruction. Since the moment Brett Kavanaugh was announcedradical Democrats launched a disgraceful campaign to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy. Right from the beginning. Brett Kavanaugh is a man of great character and intellect. He s a totally brilliant scholar who has devoted his life to the law. He is a loving husband, a devoted father, and a faithful public servant and he always has been.What he and his wonderful family endured at the hands of Democrats is unthinkable.  In their quest for power the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob. You saw that today with the screaming and the shouting. Not from the 200 people or less that,  Trump said stopping to remark that the number paled in comparison to the large crowd of rally goers gathered before him in Kansas.  They threw away and threw aside every notion of fairness, of justice, of decency, and of due process.  But each of you will have a chance in just four weeks to render your verdict on the Democrats  conduct, at the ballot box. Gotta vote,  said Trump.  On November 6 you will have the chance to stop the radical Democrats, and that s what they ve become, by electing a Republican House and a Republican Senate. We will increase our majorities. We need more Republicans.  We have been energized,  said Trump.  If Democrats are willing to cause such destruction in the pursuit of power, just imagine the devastation they would cause if they ever obtained the power they so desperately want and grab. President Trump suggested that three, even four more Supreme Court justice positions could be filled in the not-too-distant future.  If you allow the wrong people to get into office, things could change. They could change and they could change fast and we re not gonna let that happen. We can t let that happen. Trump added,  The Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern. Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/donald-trump-women-are-extremely-happy-with-brett-kavanaugh/","President Donald Trump defied the notion that most American women we deeply upset by the Senate confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Saturday. You have a lot of women that are extremely happy. A tremendous number of women,  Trump said to reporters who asked him to respond to the women who were upset by the ruling.The president commented on the narrow Senate confirmation vote to confirm Kavanaugh during his trip aboard Air Force One to Kansas. A handful of leftist women protesters were dragged out of the Senate chamber during the vote, shrieking as Senators moved forward with the confirmation. When you hear those screamers in Congress today, the screaming, you see how orchestrated it is, how phony it is,  Trump said, referring to the protesters.  They practice it together and they do it with the Democrats. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed that Trump called Kavanaugh at the end of the Senate vote. He was sworn into office later Saturday evening.Trump asserted that many women were concerned with the Kavanaugh proceedings were worried about men in their lives. [T]hey re thinking of their sons, they re thinking of their husbands and their brothers, their uncles, and others,  Trump said.  And women are I think extremely happy. Trump said that many women were in some ways more upset than men by the uncorroborated accusations by Christine Ford. Women were outraged at what happened to Brett Kavanaugh, outraged, and I think that s a total misnomer because the women, I feel, were in many ways stronger than the men in his favor,  Trump said.When reporters asked if he believed that Ford misidentified an attack from Kavanaugh over 30 years ago, Trump replied,  100 percent. He pointed to the lack of additional accusers in Kavanaugh s life and career, noting his record of service in other courts. One of the reasons I chose him is because there is nobody with a squeaky clean past like Brett Kavanaugh,  Trump wrote.  He is an outstanding person and I m very honored to have chosen him and he will be there for many years.

If Democrats take control, they will try to plunge our country into gridlock, poverty, and chaos and that s what s going to happen,  Trump declared.  The Democrats want to significantly raise your taxes. Essentially they want to impose socialism, Venezuela, dismantle law enforcement, and eliminate our borders. They want to have nice, open borders. No way.  The Democrats have become the party of crime,  the president said as he has several times in recent days.  Republicans are the party of law and order and justice t he party of opportunity and wealth. The U.S. Senate confirmed Judge Brett Kavanaugh Saturday afternoon, just hours before the Topeka, Kansas rally.

This confirmation journey has been unlike anything I have ever witnessed,  said Penny Nance, CEO and president of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee.  What we saw play out over the last month was nothing more than an outrageous display of partisanship at the cost of a good man s reputation. But at the end of the day, truth and justice were victorious. Nance added:Justice Kavanaugh, thank you for not giving up. We are praying for you and your beautiful family. You made a choice to sacrifice yourself for the good of this nation, and the American people saw that. There is no one more qualified or worthy to sit on this esteemed bench at this time.Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, remarked on the significance of Kavanaugh s confirmation:The balance of the Supreme Court has shifted back toward one that respects the will of the voters expressed through their representatives  a resounding victory for American people, who overwhelmingly trusted President Trump to choose Supreme Court nominees. As Justice Kavanaugh takes his seat on the bench of the nation s highest court alongside Justice Neil Gorsuch, we are confident he will continue to rule with the same fairness and independence that have characterized his entire legal career. We congratulate Justice Kavanaugh on his well-deserved and hard-earned confirmation a resounding victory for American people, who overwhelmingly trusted President Trump to choose Supreme Court nominees.https://t.co/jiMZUBUcer #ProLife #SCOTUS #ConfirmKavanaugh pic.twitter.com/ttrbRfYa1J  Susan B.

Today the Senate did its job, refusing to be held hostage to political games and unfounded accusations, and advancing this highly qualified nominee,  said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America.Hawkins added that the Supreme Court  needs judges committed to the rule of law, not political activism. Nance particularly extended her thanks to Maine Sen. Susan Collins  who often has been at odds with the pro-life base of the Republican Party because of her support for Planned Parenthood and its taxpayer funding. To the senators who endured threats for doing what is right, thank you,  Nance said.  Thank you to Sen. Susan Collins who stood up for all women in that historic speech yesterday. To the staff on the hill who dealt with angry mobs at your desks, thank you. Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said the senators who voted to confirm Kavanaugh  have done the right thing by placing such an eminently qualified judge, with such an impeccable record, on the High Court.  This is truly a great day for America, and brings the judiciary closer to what the founders intended,  he added,  A branch of government that applies the Constitution and the laws, rather than re-writing them. Pavone continued:This confirmation process was the low point in American politics, and placed on full display the way that today s Democrat party is willing to engage in character assassination, distortion of one s record, and childish smear tactics in order to advance its political agenda. It was and should remain profoundly disturbing that so many in public offices have discarded the basic legal premise of innocent until proven guilty.Pro-life leaders also expressed gratitude to President Donald Trump for nominating Kavanaugh. Thank you, President Trump, for choosing such an outstanding and exemplary nominee,  said Nance.Mancini echoed her gratitude to Trump  for delivering on his campaign promise to nominate a fair and independent judge who faithfully adheres to the Constitution. Pavone added he is  grateful to President Trump for nominating Judge Kavanaugh and standing with him.

She offered her remarks during a Saturday interview with Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matt Boyle on a SiriusXM Breitbart News Saturday Special.Boyle asked Guilfoyle to describe the stakes of 2018 s forthcoming November midterm elections. You mentioned that [Democrats] are already talking about trying to impeach Kavanaugh,  said Boyle.  We know that they want to impeach Kavanaugh. They want to impeach Trump. They want to impeach every part of this whole administration. They want to undo everything the voters did. Can you put into perspective for us just how big the stakes are if Nancy Pelosi gets that speaker s gavel? Guilfoyle responded,  You won t recognize this country. That s the problem. They are just subversive elements, all the way.  LISTEN:Guilfoyle noted Rep. Jerry Nadler s (D-NY) call for an  proper investigation  of  credible accusations  against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, should Democrats secure a House majority in 2018 s midterm elections. He described Kavanaugh as  credibly accused  of sexual assault. This is going to be total lawlessness and anarchy,  added Guilfoyle.  And that s what the Democrats want. I can t stress enough  this is not your grandfather s Democrat Party. This is a radicalized power-hungry party that will stoop to any low and level to destroy anybody who tries to align with this president. Guilfoyle described the Senate s confirmation of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court as evidence that Republicans must  fight back  against their political opponents. It s a great day for America,  said Guilfoyle.  Donald Trump showed us that it is okay to fight back. In fact, he gave a master class in it, and I couldn t be happier for the country and for Brett Kavanaugh and for his family. Guilfoyle continued,  Democrats went to new and really reprehensible lows in terms of this witch hunt against a fine man who has now had seven FBI background investigations. He is a premier justice. He served this country admirably. He s had an impeccable life. Guilfoyle went on,  I cannot believe it was as if the execution came before any shred or scintilla of evidence in this case against Justice Kavanaugh. He held the line with the backing of our president, and was really courageous and fearless and did the right thing. Guilfoyle said Republicans successfully fought back against  smear tactics  from Democrats.  I just love the fact that the Republican Party was finally able to fight back,  exclaimed Guilfoyle.  Enough of taking a knee to the Democrats, because if we gave in on this one, then there isn t really anything to stop them from going forward. Guilfoyle described forthcoming midterms as a national referendum on President Donald Trump s administration.Guilfoyle remarked,  With midterm elections looming in November, it is imperative that people get out there and vote. Donald J. Trump, our fantastic president, is actually on the ballot in every way, shape, and form. [Democrats] want to unseat a duly elected president,  warned Guilfoyle.  They want to reverse all the accomplishments. They want to put crying Chuck Schumer in the Senate and Nancy Pelosi to head the House.

The GOP candidate joined political editor Matt Boyle to discuss her campaign and the importance of Republicans keeping the House. My opponent a first-term incumbent has gone along with the liberal agenda. He voted against the tax cut, he would most assuredly vote for impeachment of our president. He tries to cast himself as moderate, but he s anything but.  said Arizona s District 1 candidate. He actually I don t even know how you do this he started off as a Republican, then became an Independent, and now he s a Democrat,  laughed Rogers,  He s all over the map, trying to be all things to all people. The congressional hopeful said the election  comes down to whether or not we want to promote the good news and the prosperity started under the Trump administration, or regress back to the way things were  and that she had met families on the campaign trail every week who had  escaped California  in search of better opportunities.Rogers is also the 5th-generation in her family to have a career in the military. I started out as a clinical social worker in the Air Force and then went to pilot training in Arizona. My husband was an engineer in the Air Force, so I was the flyer, he was the engineer, and we lived probably half of our 20-year careers overseas. We have two children, we had them both when we were in the military, and now we have grandchildren. This is really a calling, and when one takes the oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, this is a life-long commitment, and so I feel called to serve again.  Rogers continued. Voters want their country back,  Rogers affirmed.  I am so glad that this Kavanaugh confirmation is going to come through, and that Susan Collins did the right thing, and Lindsey GrahamI had never been a particular fan of either one of them, but, you know, they ve come through with the right and proper statements to bring due process and the Rule of Law back. On the topic of the midterm elections, Rogers said that maintaining a GOP majority in the House is crucial. Our entire nation is hanging by the slender thread that runs through the House of Representatives, is the way I look at it, and the way all of my voters look at it.  Rogers stated,   the feeling in my district is that we are at a pivot point, that the future of the country rests on whether or not our president is going to remain president. I tell people, we have the Supreme Court, we have the Senate, we have the presidency, but if we don t hold the House, we are in for a just a complete devolution and degradation of due process because of exactly what was on display this past week.

There is no better way to rev up the Republican base than what we ve seen in the last two weeks in a smear campaign against an innocent individual, in a Supreme Court seat that was on the line and almost lost,  McEnany said. Our polling at the RNC has shown that we need to make sure that our voters understand the stakes, that the loss of the House means the reversal of the Trump agenda, the reversal of the soaring economy, and there s no better way to show our voters what the stakes are than the last two weeks that played out,  McEnany continued. The obstruct, the resist, the smear tactics. The talks about impeaching Kavanaugh before he s even been confirmed,  McEnany said.  It s reminiscent of the talks to impeach President Trump, which are baseless. There s no better way to rev up our base than the last two weeks.

Hey Hey, Ho Ho, Kavanaugh has got to go,  the crowd chanted after the 50-48 vote to confirm the federal judge to a seat on the high court was announced.  Breitbart News reported on Saturday that Kavanaugh became the 114th justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, handing President Trump and Republicans a historic victory that shifts the balance of power on the court:The vote came in the middle of the afternoon on Saturday, less than 30 hours after the Senate invoked cloture late Friday morning to end an attempted filibuster by Senate Democrats and one Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). Senators invoked cloture by a vote of of 51-49, thanks to the  nuclear option  first engineered by Democrats under former Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) in 2013, lowering the threshold from 60 to 51 for presidential nominations.Before the final vote was cast, speakers at the protest railed against Kavanaugh, calling him a sexual predator and claiming that the seven FBI background checks and 30-plus hours of testimony from the federal judge were not adequate.  And the protesters, some crying when the news of Kavanaugh s confirmation was announced, vowed to continue their battle against him. Clench- fisted demonstrators chanted that they would vote out lawmakers who supported him in November s midterm elections. Fuck civility,  one sign said.  This woman is no pussy and she votes,  another sign said.   All these angry men,  another sign said, which included a photo of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who rallied to Kavanaugh s defense after Christine Blasey Ford accused him in the 11th hour of the confirmation process of sexually assaulting her decades ago at a high school party.Kavanaugh categorically denied the allegations and a supplemental FBI investigation into her charges found no corroborating witnesses.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Those allegations magnified the clash from a routine Supreme Court struggle over judicial ideology into an angrier, more complex jumble of questions about victims  rights, the presumption of innocence, and personal attacks on nominees.Acrimonious to the end, the battle featured a climactic roll call that was interrupted several times by protesters in the Senate galleries before Capitol Police removed them.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/anti-kavanaugh-activists-fail-to-disrupt-final-vote/","Protesters in the Senate gallery Saturday repeatedly attempted to illegally interrupt proceedings as senators voted to make Brett Kavanaugh the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.The shrieking, anguished shouts of leftists began to fill the chamber in rounds  as it has so often since the very first hearing on Justice-designate Kavanaugh s nomination  from the moment Vice President Mike Pence attempted to the call the vote. Pence, keeping an unaffected demeanor, repeatedly called on the Senate sergeant-at-arms to restore order.The activists continued to shout throughout the vote and even after Pence announced Justice-designate Kavanaugh s confirmation. As a reminder to our visitors in the gallery, expressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate gallery,  Pence said calmly mid-vote.The screaming was mostly incoherent in the television broadcast, but some shouts managed to come through the microphones. For example, when red state Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) stood to cast his vote, a woman could be heard to shout  shame!  repeatedly while another called Manchin a  coward. The activists efforts had no effect on the vote. Kavanaugh was confirmed as the 114th justice of the Supreme Court by a vote of 50-48.It is generally illegal to disrupt Congressional proceedings. Protesters who do so are typically arrested for disorderly conduct or similar charges. U.S. Capitol Police continually removed the groups of shouting protesters at Kavanaugh s final vote as they rose, but arrest and charge information was not immediately available.The Women s March, a left-wing organization founded to oppose President Donald Trump and led in many actions by Linda Sarsour, quickly claimed responsibility for the interruptions, making clear it was their intention to disrupt a congressional vote and prevent Kavanaugh s confirmation:Our members are disrupting the Senate from the gallery right now. #CancelKavanaugh  Women s March (@womensmarch) October 6, 2018We took the Capitol.We sat the streets outside SCOTUS. We disrupted the Senate proceedings. We want to be able to tell the next generation we did everything we could. #CancelKanavaugh  Women s March (@womensmarch) October 6, 2018Some journalists and left-wing commentators quickly expressed their sympathy with the disruptors:The entire last two weeks have felt like one long primal scream https://t.co/JmZM0YpQEV  Kasie Hunt (@kasie) October 6, 2018They literally forced white men in power to plow forward with a nomination of a serial sexual abuser over their screams of no. These women are heroes. https://t.co/e8PWAlBw2Y  Lauren Rankin (@laurenarankin) October 6, 2018In his statement before the vote, in which he opposed Kavanaugh s confirmation, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) reiterated his support for the protesters, calling their disruption  free speech. Kavanaugh s nomination, likely the most contentious in American history, was beset by protesters inside hearing rooms from the very start, including weeks before Christine Blasey Ford s uncorroborated, 36-year-old accusation of sexual assault threw Kavanaugh s nomination fight into unprecedented chaos. Dozens of leftist activists were arrested even before Kavanaugh gave his very first opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee.Then too, Durbin repeatedly expressed support for these illegal protesters, calling it  the noise of democracy.

I m in,  warned left-wing documentary filmmaker Michael Moore tweeted.Kavanaugh was confirmed Saturday   by a simple majority vote of 50-48   after a contentious confirmation process that saw the longtime judge accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct.It was, however, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) s emotional speech on the Senate floor Friday that experts say sealed the deal for Judge Kavanaugh. This tweet is for Dr. Ford. You put yourself through so much and I want you to know it wasn t in vain. You started a movement and we ll see it through. If they won t listen to our voices, then they ll listen to our vote,  talk show host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford who lodged a still-unsubstantiated claim that Brett Kavanaugh attempted to rape her in the 1980s when they were both in high school. In conclusion: People should be fucking terrified and outraged. I sure as hell am,  Actress Alyssa Milano tweeted, echoing many Hollywood celebrities  sentiment that they can get  revenge  for Kavanaugh s confirmation in next month s election.  We need to take back our power by taking back the Senate and the House in November. It is the only way out of this mess. Below is a roundup of the Hollywood meltdown in reaction to today s confirmation vote.Even if Brett Kavanaugh is innocent   which I do not believe   ALL he had to do to bolster the appearance of judicial fitness was to keep his cool for just a few hours.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/donald-trump-alaska-will-never-forgive-lisa-murkowski-for-opposing-brett-kavanaugh/","President Donald Trump warned Sen. Lisa Murkowski that she might face political retribution for her decision to oppose his nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. I think she will never recover from this,  Trump said.  I think the people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did. The president commented about the process in an interview with the Washington Post that was published on Saturday.Murkowski voted against cloture for Kavanaugh s confirmation on Friday. (On Saturday, Murkowski voted  no  on confirmation and later withdrew her vote to be marked  present  so that her Republican colleague in the Senate could attend his daughter s wedding.)The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh on Saturday afternoon with a final vote of 50-48.Trump noted that he won Alaska easily over his failed challenger, Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, which might make it hard for Murkowski to remain in the Senate. He also reminded readers that he helped Alaska immensely by opening up drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.The president had nothing but praise for Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who faced heavy pressure to vote against Kavanaugh but delivered a widely-praised speech in the Senate to explain why she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh. I think what Susan Collins did for herself was incredibly positive,  Trump said in the interview.  It showed her to be an honorable, incredible woman. I think she s got a level of respect that s unbelievable. I really mean it.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/kavanaugh-confirmation-president-trump-saving-2nd-amendment-from-people-like-hillary-clinton/","With Justice Brett Kavanaugh now on the Supreme Court, President Donald Trump continues making good on his pledge to use Supreme Court nominations to save the Second Amendment from  people like Hillary Clinton. During an October 9, 2016, presidential debate, Trump said,  I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.  People that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so importantalso, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. Trump made clear that his Supreme Court picks will  respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, and what it represents. Trump has fulfilled these promises by giving us Justice Neil Gorsuch, confirmed April 7, 2017, and Brett Kavanaugh, confirmed October 6, 2018.Both Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are guided by the seminal decision in District of Columbia v Heller (2008).During confirmation hearings, Gorsuch referenced Heller in describing the approach to ruling on the constitutional protections of specific types of guns, saying:Heller makes clear that we judges are to apply. The question is whether it s a gun in common use, for self-defenseand that may be subject to reasonable regulation. That s the test as I understand it. There s lots of ongoing litigation about which weapons qualify under those standards. And I can t pre-judge that litigation sitting here.Kavanaugh also referenced Heller s  common use  phraseology during this confirmation, explaining that AR-15s and similar semiautomatic rifles are in  common use  because widely possessed. Kavanaugh differentiated between  dangerous and unusual weapons  versus weapons widely possessed for hunting and self-defense, saying,  Semiautomatic rifles are widely possessed in the United States. There are millions and millions and millions of semiautomatic rifles that are possessed, so that seemed to fit common use and not be a dangerous and unusual weapon. The NRA responded to Kavanaugh s conformation by tweeting:  The NRA congratulates Brett Kavanaugh on his confirmation to SCOTUS. Kavanaugh is an eminently qualified jurist who will interpret the Constitution as the framers intended. He respects our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.

Republicans are also benefiting in polling on Senate races because of the left-wing and partisan Democrat campaign against Kavanaugh s nomination, said McConnell.On Saturday, leftists opposed Kavanaugh s nomination in Washington, DC, displaying signs with messages such as:  STOP NORMALIZING RAPE,   ME TOO, ANITA! , and  This administration is like a jobs program for misogynists. Various left-wing and partisan Democrat news media figures derided Sen.

I thought that Susan was incredible yesterday  she gave an impassioned, beautiful speech yesterday and that was from the heart,  Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a campaign rally on Saturday night.Trump said that he spoke with Collins after her speech, which deeply moved supporters of Kavanaugh s confirmation. You could see how hard she worked, how hard she was working, she didn t stop,  he said.The president said he looked forward to Kavanaugh serving on the court. I think he s going to make us all very proud,  he said.Trump described the confirmation delay of the vote as  unattractive  but said that he was thankful that Kavanaugh survived. A lot of very positive things happened in the last week,  he said.  It didn t look that way, but in the end, that s what happened.

Susan Collins and her staff continued to suffer bullying and death threats after announcing her decision on Friday to support confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.In an interview with Breitbart News Saturday, Maine Republican Chairwoman Demi Kouzounas told host Matthew Boyle that Collins and her staff had been physically threatened, sent vulgar messages, and had bizarre things sent to them in the mail. The vulgarity is unbelievable  things like I hope you re raped. I hope that you re stuck with an unborn baby from a rapist,   I mean who says these things? And where is the respect?  she said. Who says these things?  Kouzounas asked with disbelief, pointing out that Collins stood strong against the mob Even though she was bullied, and had aggressive pressure put on her, she didn t crack, she basically stuck to a process and I think delivered a speech that I think every Republican and many Democrats and independents are thrilled with,  she said, praising Collins.Activists also sent Collins 3,000 coat hangers, accusing her of sentencing women to back-alley abortions as a result of her support for Kavanaugh. That s totally disrespectful  It s been a bullying type of rhetoric out there,  Kouzounas said.She suggested that the attacks from the left were turning off more independent voters and even Democrats. They don t seem to understand this crazy left-leaning rhetoric out there,  Kouzounas said.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/lawyer-ford-wont-seek-more-investigations-into-kavanaugh/","Debra Katz, attorney for Christine Blasey Ford, revealed Friday that her client will not urge lawmakers to further investigate allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.In a sit-down interview with CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash, Katz said Ford does not want Democrats to pursue allegations against Kavanaugh if they retake Congress in November.  Professor Ford has not asked for anything of the sort. What she did was to come forward and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and agree to cooperate with any investigation by the FBI, and that s what she sought to do here,  said Katz.Asked if Ford would like Democrats to consider bringing impeachment hearings against Kavanaugh, Katz responded with a simple  no. Lisa Banks, another lawyer for Ford, told Bash that the 51-year-old California psychology professor is at peace with her decision to go public with her decades-old allegation against the judge.  I don t think she has any regrets. I think she feels like she did the right thing,  said Banks.  And this was what she wanted to do, which was provide this information to the committee so they could make the best decision possible. And I think she still feels that was the right thing to do, so I don t think she has any regrets. Further, Banks criticized Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans for pointing out Ford was mistaken when she accused chairman Grassley of failing to accommodate her by traveling to her the West Coast to intimate her.  We, as her counsel, informed her of all options made available to us by the committee. We showed her all of the correspondence,  she told Bash  And what they were offering was sending staffers to speak to her. Dr. Ford wanted to speak to the committee members herself. And I think what you saw in the hearing was that Dr. Ford got a little confused and thought Sen. Grassley was suggesting that he himself would have come to California, which is not what he offered at all. Ford s lawyers also said Ford was saddened by President Donald Trump s remarks about her during a rally in Mississippi earlier this week.  It was very hurtful, as it would be to any woman. Any survivor who had the courage to come forward only to be mocked and belittled by anyone really, but certainly by the President of the United States, it was very upsetting. It was very hurtful,  Banks said.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/nolte-winners-and-losers-of-the-kavanaugh-confirmation/","For a full week after Christine Blasey Ford s allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh became public, I said nothing. While I have a healthy skepticism of politically-timed accusations, there was no way to know.So I kept my mouth shut and looked at the evidence, because that is what Americans are supposed to do. And after a week, it was not only obvious the evidence was lacking, it was just as obvious the evidence all sided with Kavanaugh.Ford s named witnesses all came down on Kavanaugh s side (either they did not remember the 1982 house party where the alleged assault attempt took place, or flat-out said it didn t happen). As for Ford s story, it was equal parts devious and leaky. By  devious  I mean a Kafka-esque web no man could ever extricate himself from   not even with detailed calendars. By  leaky  I mean full of gaping holes. Not just her convenient memory lapses, but endless contradictions, deceptions, and in the case of her so-called fear of flying, outright lies.Accuser number two, Deborah Ramirez? Her accusation was even weaker. Again, the named witnesses all backed Kavanaugh, and even the far-left New York Times was forced to report she had been calling around admitting she could not remember who flashed her at a dorm party in 1983.Accuser number three, Julie Swetnick? Exactly the kind of hot garbage you would expect from a fame-addicted lawyer made famous by a tabloid outlet like CNN.Like it was for many others, somewhere along the line, everything changed. As the accusations crumbled under the weight of evidence and witness testimony, as Democrats moved the goalposts, as our monstrous media became desperate enough to wave around a high school yearbook like a bloody shirt, this stopped being about politics and the future of the Supreme Court and became about the fate of one man   an innocent man, a wrongfully accused man, a publicly persecuted man   which means it suddenly became the most important thing in the world.Watching Brett Kavanaugh stripped naked and publicly humiliated by the organized left and media was excruciating. The obscenity of it, the injustice. Even worse was the tightly-knotted ball of fear growing like a fascist cancer in all decent people, as we lived with the intolerable thought that this abomination might succeed, that the single most appalling act of McCarthyism of my lifetime might actually pay off.I lived through the Clarence Thomas Wars, the Sarah Palin Wars, the public destruction of John McCain and Mitt Romney This was different. This was murder   the first-degree, cold-blooded murder of a man s reputation, his young family, and his entire future using the Soviet-style revolutionary tactics of vile lies in pursuit of power.This was a leftist mob backed by the billions of corporate dollars that flow through CNN, NBC, etc., throwing an innocent man, his wife, and traumatized young daughters into a volcano as a sacrifice to the cause, as a means to appease the hysterics stalking the halls of the Senate screaming,  Witch! WITCH! WIIIIIIITCH!!!!!!!!! Democrats and the media were not even interested in convincing us Kavanaugh had done something wrong. Their only goal was to make him so personally toxic, his guilt or innocence no longer mattered. And the only word for that is demonic.I am not one to lose sleep over politics, and I am certainly not one to admit to such a thing, but this was different   I lost a ton of sleep; I lived with dread, and other than family members, I have never prayed harder for anyone than I did for Judge Kavanaugh:  Please, God, do not forsake this man. Here are the winners and losers of the Dreyfus Kavanaugh AffairWINNERS: The Rule of LawAs Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Sean Hannity Friday, we were at the edge of an abyss, an abyss where smears and the dark art of character assassination were about to become legitimized. Yes, I am a bit uneasy that we came so close to going over that abyss, and even more anxious over the fact that not a single Democrat or member of the establishment media had the moral courage to be the Joseph Welch of their time, to point to their own and ask,  Have you no sense of decency? But for now we have a reprieve, and maybe even a little hope that the hangover from this crushing loss might awaken the conscience in just one Democrat or just one adult in the media.Associate Supreme Court Justice Brett KavanaughBrett Kavanaugh s unforgettable testimony in defense of his own character and future was like the last 20 minutes of Rocky III.  One man against all the odds, against the indomitable power of the state, the corrupt power of the media, and then he looked both in the eyes and sneered,  You ain t so bad. His raw testimony was not only a turning point for Kavanaugh when things looked darkest (in the immediate wake of Ford s testimony), it was a catharsis for those of us who had spent a week being force-fed bitter lies and injustice.With the previous Sunday night s triple sucker punch of Ford, Ronan Farrow, and  Michael Avenatti, the left pushed all their chips into the middle of the table, certain Kavanaugh would fold.He didn t. He called their bluff. You will never get me to quit,  he said  and evil gulped.President Donald J. TrumpSimply put, with this, his second Supreme Court Justice, Trump has secured his presidential legacy. The dream of a 5-4 conservative court is as old as I am, and only Trump could have ensured this, because Trump is the only Republican president who would have ever had the courage to not sacrifice Kavanaugh in the hopes of getting someone else approved before the midterm elections.President Trump showed enormous character where no one else would have.Let me repeat that word Character.Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)As agonizing as the suspense of the last 72 hours were, Senate Republicans planned it to perfection.Put all eyes on Susan Collins, put all the media attention on Susan Collins, and then have this moderate, pro-choice, anti-Trump woman use the national spotlight to deliver a devastating closing argument in favor of Kavanaugh s confirmation.It was a brilliant political move, and she was brilliant, and serious, and informed, and above all American.That was the most American speech I have ever heard on the Senate floor, a speech based on facts, eternal principles, and basic human decency.The pressure Collins was under to go the other way, the incentives from the media to be a feminist hero, the threats, the emotional blackmail and bullying God bless her.If Brett Kavanaugh was Rocky III, Susan Collins was Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Her speech should be taught in every high school in America.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC)Since no Democrat or member of the media would do it, Graham did. These four minutes and twenty-six seconds of moral clarity funneled through righteous rage asked the question as forcefully and as clearly as anyone ever could:  Have you no decency, sir?  From that point, there was no going back. The truth had been released.From then on, Graham was our happy warrior, our Jiminy Cricket dashing through the halls of Congress, popping up on cable news, and spreading the good news about truth and decency in ways that could no longer be denied.I cannot wait for Graham to become Trump s next Attorney General.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY)Never flinched. Never wavered.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ)When Flake threw the wrench in the confirmation gears last week with his call for an FBI investigation devoted to the sexual assault allegations, the nasty  Flake Flakes  headlines flew. Again, I kept my mouth shut. Some part of me believed he had done the right thing. As symbolic as this investigation would be, sometimes symbolism matters.From the sound of it, Collins probably would have voted  no  without the FBI report.But look at the country only 37 percent said they wanted Kavanaugh confirmed, but that number jumps to 60 percent if the FBI investigation comes back clean as it did.Flake said he believed it was good for the country to wait a week, and he was 100 percent correct. What s more, that week was of enormous help to further proving Kavanaugh s innocence because all the new information came out in his favor, and there was a lot of it.This left the monstrous media sputtering about virginity and farting, which again seemed to only piss Susan Collins off all the more.Had Kavanaugh won confirmation last week, it would have looked rigged and unjust to a lot of people.Jeff Flake was not only right, he did a courageous thing.Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA)The hero behind the scenes, the man saddled with the paperwork and Avenatti nonsense, and appeasing McCarthy-ite Democrats in the name of Senate decorum.But the FBI backed up the work of his committee s investigators, and the tireless 84-year-old even found time to compose some of the most satisfying takedowns of the whole sordid affair.The Republican Party To paraphrase a former First Lady, for the first time in my life I m proud of the Republican Party   even some Never Trumpers.The Federalist SocietyThey found a man so qualified, only a witch hunt could bring him down.They found a man so decent, the witch hunt failed.Rachel MitchellThe Maricopa County sex prosecutor was widely criticized for her cross-examination of Dr. Ford, but she wasn t there to preen for the cameras or to play Perry Mason. She wanted Ford on record, she asked all the correct and pointed questions, and if you don t think her devastating, fact-based report didn t help to sway Susan Collins, you have not been paying attention.Breitbart News and New MediaThose who wanted facts over hysteria, evidence over innuendo, and truth over emotional blackmail only had one place to turn and that was New Media, specifically online new media.And yeah, I m going to toot our own horn, because I am also a consumer of news, and as a voracious consumer of Kavanaugh news, it was Breitbart where I always clicked first. Our team did an extraordinary job, not just of documenting the circus and the politics, but in examining the evidence and cutting through the media bullshit.Yay, us. LOSERS: The Organized LeftWhen you read about things like the Salem Witch Trials, McCarthyism, and blacklists, you assume we are too well educated, mature, and ashamed of this history to ever repeat it. Well, repeat it we did, and now, after pouring all their hopes, dreams, schemes, hate, rage, integrity, endless hours of work, and piles of money into this cause, these godless fuckers lost and like the vampires they are, the sunlight of decency has them hissing and howling and writhing in a state of complete shock because their own arrogance and provincialism assured them it could never happen.Oh, and they re stupid too, just plain dumb. Anyone with a room temperature IQ understood from the beginning, way back in July, just how important Susan Collins was going to be in this confirmation effort. And what did these idiots do? To prove they were bought and paid for, to prove they had no principles whatsoever, they showed up at their first protest with  Stop Kethledge  and  Stop Hardiman  signs. Collins immediately saw through them and, other than contempt, never gave them another thought.Eager to double down on their indecency, eager to prove they are anti-science conspiracy theorists immune to facts and evidence, still they protest and rage against the  serial rapist  like a horde of crybabies who have nothing left but to wish that everyone else gets hit by a train. And by doing so, they are forcing Democrats to promise they will impeach Kavanaugh if they win in the midterms   which will only ensure this issue doesn t lose its potency with Republican voters.Rage on, you simple-minded swarm of spoiled sheep, your tactics not only no longer work    they backfired spectacularly.DemocratsBecause nothing they held most dear   open borders, gay marriage, abortion, etc.   was able to win at the ballot box, they abused the courts to force their agenda down our throats.The days of transforming our country through judicial activism are over, and that is a catastrophe for the left.The Establishment MediaThis loss is as devastating to the CNNs, NBCs, NPRs, and Washington Posts as Trump s presidential victory.Every single one of these liars (who have harbored dozens of their own #MeToo perps for decades) went all-in to destroy an innocent man, and now they have lost the remaining ticketholders of their kabuki theater of objectivity At long last, even Never Trump sees them for the monsters they truly are.  And yes, they are the enemy of the people. Well, decent people.What s more, for at least ten days, all of the power of the media   print, online, and broadcast   was targeted at only a handful of senators. Naked, shameless, 24/7 propaganda and appeals to emotion directed at a half dozen people, and still they belly-flopped   primarily because alternative media was just as tireless in putting out the facts.The establishment media vastly out-funds and out-mans alternative media, but we can still kick their candy asses because truth and decency are on our side.Michael AvenattiEven the far-left Washington Post had to concede that Avenatti parachuting into this debate with a fistful of lies about Kavanaugh being a serial rapist backfired big time.Anyone looking for proof the organized left had constructed a campaign of character assassination against an innocent man could not only look at what Avenatti was up to, but how seriously his confederates in the media took his outrageous claims.CNN built Avenatti, so don t forget to thank Jeff Zucker.Lisa MurkowskiThe only Republican Senator to vote against Kavanaugh made up her mind while walking in to vote on cloture, and her only explanation was,  He s not the right man for the court. You can do better, Alaska.Fox NewsThe opinion line-up was fine, it was the news part of Fox News that disgraced itself with a litany of fake news about Dr. Ford being  credible. It is not about the politics or the even the fate of the Supreme Court   the fate of a man was on the line, a whole man, and Fox News, of all places, threw him to the wolves by declaring   without a shred of evidence, without hearing his side   that the sexual assault allegations against him  credible. That is as un-American as it gets.Fox News is dead to me.Never Trump Dead-EndersDavid Frum, Jennifer Rubin, Joe Scarborough, Bill Kristol These are not conservatives outraged over Trump s this or that, these are hysterics and principle-free egomaniacs.Cory BookerThe only thing we learned about Spartacus throughout all of this is that he is no Obama. Say what you want about our former president, he was unflappable, intelligent, composed, and nearly impossible to catch off guard.Booker is a quarter-witted deer in the headlights, and watching Trump eat his lunch in 2020 is going to be GLORIOUS.#MeTooNow that decent people know that the left and media are willing to exploit and pervert what had been a just cause into an obscenity against people who are guilty only of holding  incorrect  beliefs, #MeToo will never be what it was, not even close, and that is a shame.The MatriarchyI am not arguing The Patriarchy is perfect, but we have just spent 18 days living inside The Matriarchy only to discover it is a circle of hell built on a foundation of nightmares   of shrill injustice led by mindless mobs cheered on by brown-nosers like Jake Tapper who conceal their bullying behind  virtue  as they proclaim we ve  heard enough from men. Overall, I cannot think of a worse three weeks for those who wish to put an end to the stereotype about women being spiteful, driven by emotion, and lacking in reason.HollywoodThe industry with a whole lot more #MeToo perps than stars is now so universally despised, their thoughtless rants and snobbish peacocking actually do more to help Trump s cause than any super PAC ever could. We now welcome their unhinged ravings, their mean-spiritedness, their willingness to spoil every good time by strutting in with a soapbox.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/kavanaugh-confirmed-possibly-most-conservative-supreme-court-since-1934/","WASHINGTON, DC  Brett Kavanaugh became the 114th justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday, when the Senate confirmed him by a vote of 50-48, handing President Trump and Republicans a historic victory that shifts the balance of power on the Court.The vote came in the middle of the afternoon on Saturday, less than 30 hours after the Senate invoked cloture late Friday morning to end an attempted filibuster by Senate Democrats and one Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). Senators invoked cloture by a vote of of 51-49, thanks to the  nuclear option  first engineered by Democrats under former Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) in 2013, lowering the threshold from 60 to 51 for presidential nominations.Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) was in his home state during the final vote, walking his daughter down the aisle at her wedding. Daines was willing to take a private jet immediately back to Washington if necessary to cast the deciding vote, but Murkowski  the only Republican to oppose Kavanaugh  agreed to vote  Present  instead of  No  on the final vote, to neutralize the effect of Daines  absence and keep the two-vote margin for Kavanaugh s confirmation.Watch the Senate Vote:President Trump sees appointing conservative Supreme Court justices as one of the reasons he was elected. Polling showed that in the 2016 election, 48 percent of voters said the Supreme Court was a major factor in their presidential vote, and 21 percent of voters said it was their top issue. Those voters chose Trump over Hillary Clinton by a margin of 57 to 41.Saturday s confirmation marks more than the dramatic conclusion to a political battle that has waged for more than three months, and instead could mark an inflection point in a philosophical war that has raged for decades.The Supreme Court has not had a conservative majority since 1934, when the New Deal took hold and the Court moved to the left, giving the federal government vast new powers over economic issues. The Court massively broadened federal powers over commerce, taxing, and federal spending.The Court abandoned the original meaning of several key constitutional provisions during the 1930s: in 1934, the Contracts Clause (Blaisdell); in 1935, the Appointments Clause (Humphrey s Executor); in 1936, the Spending Clause (Butler); and in 1937, the Commerce Clause (Jones & Laughlin Steel). These radically expanded the role of the federal government in people s lives.A conservative majority on the Court has been considered within striking distance since 1993, when two moderate justices were the swing votes on almost every issue that divided along philosophical lines. In 2006, conservative Justice Samuel Alito replaced one of those moderates, Justice Sandra Day O Connor.Since then, the Supreme Court has long been divided with four conservative justices to one degree or another, and four liberal justices on the other. The crucial fifth vote was the sole remaining moderate, Justice Anthony Kennedy.When Kennedy announced on June 27 that he would retire during the summer, both political parties  and especially their respective bases  leapt into action with the most expensive, most brutal Supreme Court confirmation in American history. Both sides understood that issues of overwhelming importance both to conservatives and to liberals could be at stake.Talking heads quickly zoned in on Trump s  List  of 25 potential justices. A week later, President Trump had narrowed it to four finalists: Judges Thomas Hardiman, Amy Barrett, Raymond Kethledge, and Brett Kavanaugh.On July 9, President Trump announced during a primetime address from the East Room of the White House that he was nominating Judge Kavanaugh, who has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 2006.The political Left went into immediate meltdown, with raucous protests outside the U.S. Supreme Court. Alternate protest posters left on the ground included the names of the other three finalists as well, showing that liberals would have had a fit for any nominee President Trump might choose.Experts from both sides dived deeply into Kavanaugh s lengthy paper trail. He has authored an impressive 307 published opinions during his 12 years on the bench, totaling over 6,000 pages of judicial writing. When combined with the opinions he joined written by his colleagues, senators had over 11,000 pages of judicial decisions to examine in assessing Kavanaugh s fitness for the High Court.Beyond that, Kavanaugh submitted over 112 pages of answers to questions from senators, and included 17,000 pages of attachments. When combined with the records released from his public service over the past quarter-century, senators were flooded with a staggering 483,000 pages of material to review on Kavanaugh  more than the past five Supreme Court nominees combined  setting an all-time record.Kavanaugh s hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the first week of September were heavy-hitting and constantly interrupted by protests, but he weathered the storm and appeared to be on a glide path to confirmation.All that changed during the second half of September, when accusers brought forth sordid and salacious accusations of a sexual nature, which had never come up during Kavanaugh s long service or the six FBI background investigations throughout his career.A final curveball came in the form of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who said he would require a final FBI background check into these allegations before voting for the judge on the Senate floor. Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) acquiesced, in light of their razor-thin margin in the Senate.The FBI came back saying that they found no corroboration for the accusations. Flake and several other moderate senators then announced their support for Kavanaugh, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) who gave an impassioned speech about the presumption of innocence and due process.Collins  speech highlighted how toxic judicial confirmation fights have been over the past couple years, deepening the divides in the nation. Experts worry that many of the most qualified candidates for high office  and especially the Supreme Court  will not answer the call to serve since it means lasting trauma for their families and reputations.Regardless of all that, at age 53 Justice Kavanaugh now takes his seat as the newest associate justice on the Supreme Court, and is expected to serve for decades. Major cases already pending before the Court could reveal very quickly whether he is what conservatives have been waiting for these many years.Justice Kavanaugh will begin hearing cases on Tuesday, October 9.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/donald-trump-rips-70-paid-leftist-protester-groups-flocking-supreme-court/","President Donald Trump mocked  tiny  crowds of protesters on Saturday after the Senate voted to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The crowd in front of the U.S. Supreme Court is tiny,  Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday.The president commented on the size of the protest crowds as he traveled aboard Air Force One to a campaign rally in Kansas. Looks like about 200 people (& most are onlookers)  that wouldn t even fill the first couple of rows of our Kansas Rally, or any of our Rallies for that matter!  Trump added.  The Fake News Media tries to make it look sooo big, & it s not! Earlier in the day, the president referred to  paid professional protesters who are handed expensive signs  in Washington, DC, and pointed out the people at the Supreme Court who were supporting Kavanaugh. Women for Kavanaugh, and many others who support this very good man, are gathering all over Capitol Hill in preparation for a 3-5 P.M. VOTE,  he wrote.  It is a beautiful thing to see. Breitbart News reporters at the Supreme Court spotted multiple professional protesters handing out high quality printed signs, T-shirts, and information to people flocking to the city. Other protesters also had homemade signs:Protesters oppose Judge Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation to the Supreme Court.       Look at all of the professionally made identical signs,  Trump wrote on Friday.  Paid for by Soros and others. These are not signs made in the basement from love! Many of the professional signs were linked to the group Unite for Justice, a coalition of more than 70 leftist protest groups, some funded by leftist billionaire George Soros.As Breitbart News reported Friday, a group of Women for Kavanaugh supporters held a prayer session at the Senate for all women suffering from sexual assault. I pray for the brokenness around us,  said Penny Nance, chief executive officer and president of Concerned for America (CWA), in prayer as the group held hands.  I pray for the hurt of the women that we have seen here in this building this week. The crowd in front of the U.S. Supreme Court is tiny, looks like about 200 people (& most are onlookers)  that wouldn t even fill the first couple of rows of our Kansas Rally, or any of our Rallies for that matter! The Fake News Media tries to make it look sooo big, & it s not!  Donald J.

Indeed, there was something called the dreadful counsel that was used in Medieval times, where you could actually dig someone up and put them on trial.  So, sure, you could have a trial for the dead if you wanted, or the confirmed, but it is a dreadful idea. The framers created this process to have some finality. Now, the Democrats may not like the outcome of the vote, but 50   over 50 senators are expected to be satisfied with this record and to confirm this nominee. If we re going to start to do do-overs every time the majority changes, then we will never have a stable court. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

If you believe Republicans, you believe Kavanaugh.

Bitch.  Donna Rogers (@DonnagoodRogers) October 6, 2018Twitter has been slow to respond to death threats against Republicans in the past, at times taking weeks to remove the threatening content. The platform s double standards can also be seen in the way it handles complaints of abuse against conservatives and individuals linked to conservatives. When the daughters of Islam critic Pamela Geller were bombarded with abuse earlier this year, Twitter did nothing. In fact, some of the abusive tweets remain on the site, undeleted.Other notorious examples of Twitter failing to take action against progressives who break the platform s rules include the case of Peter Fonda, who was allowed to remain verified on the platform despite calling for 12-year old Barron Trump to be  locked in a cage with pedophiles.  New York Times journalist Sarah Jeong was also granted verified status on the platform, a distinction that gives her tweets greater visibility, despite breaking the platform s hate speech rules by comparing white males to  dogs pissing on fire hydrants.  By Twitter s own admission, verification is a tacit mark of endorsement from the platform.Meanwhile, Twitter takes the slightest excuse to ban high-profile conservatives who are crucial to mobilizing grassroots Trump supporters and Republicans ahead of the midterms. At times, Twitter has banned conservative figures simply for posting facts that some find offensive. The high-profile right-wingers and critics of progressivism banned from the platform include Tommy Robinson, Chuck Johnson, Hunter Avellone, Roger Stone, and Carl Benjamin. Similar permabans of high-influence progressives are virtually unheard of.Breitbart News has reached out to Twitter for comment.Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

In August, the White House announced the first lady would be visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya, and Egypt to highlight programs successfully teaching children life well-being skills as part of her BE BEST campaign.She called those African nations  beautiful and very different  and said they were chosen so that Trump could work alongside the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and partners that have made  great progress in overcoming some of their biggest challenges. Trump launched her BE BEST campaign  with the goal of combatting some of the issues children face today by shining a spotlight on successful programs and organizations that teach children the tools and skills needed for emotional, social and physical well-being.

Susan Collins (R-ME) was alienated. The left has given up on making its own case,  Carlson said.  Activist no longer try to convince anyone of anything. Instead, they scream and bully. As a tactic, this can be effective. It worked many years for the Mafia, for example. But there is a cost to it, especially when it is on television. Normal people find it scary and unreasonable because that is exactly what it is: scary and unreasonable. The left is going too far, and it is alienating even liberal Republicans like Susan Collins. He went on say the protests brought to light how the left  really thinks.  If there s one thing we learned during the last month, it s what the activist left really thinks,  he added.  And a lot of people are scared by what they really think. Though actually, the term think  may be too generous. A lot of what we re hearing isn t the product of thinking at all.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/local/2018/10/05/2020-kamala-harris-heading-to-iowa-after-blasting-unfit-kavanaugh/","Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is reportedly planning to head to Iowa at the end of the October and will spend time in the first-in-the-nation caucus state during the final weekend before the 2018 midterm elections.According to a report in The Atlantic, the 2020 presidential contender  has been reaching out to Democrats in Iowa  about the planned trip.By planning to visit Iowa just weeks before the 2020 election cycle kicks off, Harris, according to the outlet, is crossing  a symbolic but unmistakably significant line toward owning her interest in a presidential campaign. Speaking on the Senate floor on Friday afternoon about President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Harris blasted Kavanaugh s Thursday evening Wall Street Journal op-ed in which Kavanaugh tried to assure lawmakers about his independence and temperament.Harris said that Kavanaugh had told the Judiciary Committee that he had written his  partisan  speech and his testimony was not some spontaneous outburst. He s a partisan,  Harris said.  Let s believe him at his word. Harris said Kavanaugh has not proven that he can demonstrate  impartiality, integrity, and truthfulness  and said the FBI investigation was not a  search for the truth  but  about politics and raw power to push through an unfit nominee. Harris added that she was  deeply disturbed that the Senate is moving forward  with Kavanaugh s nomination and called the process a  travesty  that did not do Christine Blasey Ford or the American people justice. Every American is entitled to the benefit of the doubt,  Harris said in concluding her remarks.  But nobody is entitled to a seat on the United States Supreme Court. During the Kavanaugh s confirmation hearings, Harris was the first Democrat on the Judiciary Committee to interrupt Chairman Chuck Grasssley (R-IA) during his opening statement on the first day of the hearing. Democrats spent most of that morning interrupting Grassley and trying to turn the hearing into a circus.She aggressively questioned Kavanaugh, accusing him of using  dog-whistles  with words like  abortion on-demand  and  racial spoils system. Harris fundraised off of the hearings as left-wing activists praised her for asking Kavanaugh about whether he believed men could be friends with some women while mistreating others. She also questioned Kavanaugh about whether he has communicated with anyone from President Donald Trump s lawyer s law firm, even warning Kavanaugh to be careful about his response.But even her home-state papers had to concede that Harris s grandstanding on the issue  failed miserably  and ended in the  most anticlimactic way. Harris was also condemned for posting a  sliced-and-diced  video of Kavanaugh s testimony that made it appear like Kavanaugh was saying that he believed contraceptives are  abortion-inducing drugs. Though Harris s official answer when asked about her 2020 ambitions has been that she is  not ruling out  a presidential, left-wing activists have been urging her to take on Trump after praising her grilling of Kavanaugh. In recent months, some overseas bookmakers have made Harris the favorite to win her party s nomination in 2020.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/10/05/michael-avenatti-freaks-after-cnn-editor-blames-him-for-saving-kavanaugh/","Michael Avenatti is livid after CNN breaking news editor Kyle Feldscher credited the TV lawyer with damaging Democrats  efforts to thwart Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation by pushing far-fetched allegations of  gang rape. The dust-up began when Avenatti attacked Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) for her criticism   not by name   of him and of his client, Julie Swetnick, for claiming Kavanaugh participated in gang rapes.  .@SenatorCollins should be ashamed of herself for attacking my client and Dr. Ford,  Avenatti wrote on Twitter.  How did she make a credibility determination as to my client? How is she qualified to do that without ANY investigation? She did ZERO to determine whether my client and her witnesses were credible. During an impassioned Senate floor speech, Collins blasted Swetnick s  outlandish allegation  and said its propagation by activists seeking to stop Kavanaugh s confirmation is a  stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness.  Minutes after she confirmed her intention to vote  yes  for Kavanaugh s confirmation, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) stepped up as the first Democrat to support Kavanaugh.Feldscher responded to the outburst by blaming Avenatti s antics for the presumed success of Kavanaugh s confirmation.  Hard to state how much Avenatti s entrance into this process hurt the Democratic effort to bring down Kavanaugh s nomination,  Feldscher wrote.Hard to state how much Avenatti s entrance into this process hurt the Democratic effort to bring down Kavanaugh s nomination. https://t.co/tcofogweNo  Kyle Feldscher (@Kyle_Feldscher) October 5, 2018Avenatti fired back, calling his analysis an insult to sexual assault survivors.  You are right,  Avenatti wrote sarcastically.  I should have turned my back on my client. Told her to shut up  and stay quiet because people like you apparently believe assault victims are to blame. This line of thinking is disgusting and offensive to all survivors. And it makes lawyers not want to help them,  he added.You are right. I should have turned my back on my client.

Literally never suggested that, but have a good weekend sir.  Kyle Feldscher (@Kyle_Feldscher) October 5, 2018On Septemeber 23, Avenatti announced he was representing a woman with  credible  allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh and vowed to work with Senate Judiciary Committee staffers to have her story told. Days later, the lawyer released a sworn statement written by his client, Julie Swetnick, a longtime Maryland resident with a questionable past, who claimed Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge spiked punch bowls with drugs at parties during the 1980s in an effort to take advantage of women.Over the last two weeks, Avenatti has pushed for the committee and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to interview Swetnick, a request both denied due to a lack of credibility of the claims. In a letter to panel members, a man claiming to be Swetnick s one-time boyfriend, Dennis Ketterer, raised doubts about her testimony.Ketterer told senators that Swetnick said she enjoyed engaging in group sex and said her father revealed to him she  had psychological and other problems.  Avenatti told the Washington Post on Friday that he may file a defamation lawsuit against Ketterer for making those statements.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/heidi-heitkamp-ad-touting-bipartisanship-mysteriously-disappears-after-opposition-to-kavanaugh/","A campaign ad for Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) that touted her bipartisan credentials mysteriously disappeared from Internet the day after the senator announced her opposition to Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.Sen. Heitkamp announced a new ad on Thursday, entitled  Every Day,  in which she touted her independence from the political system and how she agrees with both Democrats and Republicans on varying issues. Too many Democrats don t appreciate our commitment to faith and self-reliance or recognize that we know how to handle guns safely,  Heitkamp said.  And while Republicans too often side with the powerful, Democrats too often judge how we live. And both parties do nothing but fight. NBC News reported on Thursday that the ad serves as part of a six-figure ad buy running on cable and broadcast television and on digital platforms as well.The ad came out the same day that the North Dakota Democrat, who claims to be bipartisan, also announced her opposition to President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Judge Kavanaugh.Heitkamp told a local North Dakota news station,  The process has been bad but, at the end of the day, you have to make a decision, and I ve made that decision. I will be voting no on Judge Kavanaugh. The ad enflamed political controversy, as she claimed to be bipartisan on the same day that she said she will oppose the president s nominee. The North Dakota Republican Party quickly denounced the campaign ad.There remains one hitch for readers who might want to watch the campaign ad the ad no longer exists on YouTube, her campiagn YouTube account, her Instagram page, her Facebook page, nor does it exist on Heitkamp s campaign website. An NBC News article references the ad and even embeds the article on the page, but the video is no longer  available  on YouTube.The North Dakota Republican Party also confirms the existence of the ad, considering they released a press release attacking the ad on Thursday. It remains unclear if the ad will continue to be played on television given that it no longer exists on the Internet.Sean Higgins, Heitkamp s press secretary, tweeted out the NBC news article of the ad in which Heitkamp  flexes her independence. Higgins wrote on Thursday,  Heitkamp in new statewide TV and digital ad:  While Republicans too often side with the powerful, Democrats too often judge how we live.  Heidi s always been a tough, independent voice for North Dakota. That ll never change. #ndsen #ndpol. Heitkamp in new statewide TV and digital ad:  While Republicans too often side with the powerful, Democrats too often judge how we live. Heidi s always been a tough, independent voice for North Dakota. That ll never change. #ndsen #ndpol https://t.co/yAm6nzNtxj  Sean Higgins (@smhigg) October 5, 2018Sen. Heitkamp s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment on what happened to the campaign ad in question.Jake Wilkins, the North Dakota Republican Party communications director, told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement on Friday that it is no surprise that the Heitkamp campaign will try to remove this ad given that her campaign has tried and failed to rewrite her liberal voting record. This is no surprise,  Wilkins told Breitbart News.  With just over a month left until the election, the Heitkamp campaign is desperately scrambling to rewrite her out-of-touch, liberal voting record; but it s not working. Wilkins slammed the Heitkamp ad on Thursday, claiming that she claims to be a bipartisan even though she has lied about her  liberal record.  Wilkins said in a statement on Thursday,  Her new ad Every Day  makes it clear Heidi Heitkamp is going to spend Every Day  lying about her liberal record. Heitkamp was elected to represent the people of North Dakota in the Senate, but she has failed, and a new TV ad can t erase that. Heitkamp s decision to vote against Kavanaugh serves as a dangerous political risk in a state that Donald Trump won by 35 points in the 2016 presidential election. A Fox News poll found that Cramer has a 12-point lead over Heitkamp. In the last Fox News poll, Cramer only had a four-point lead.The Fox News poll also found that if Heitkamp were to vote against Kavanaugh, 34 percent would be less likely to vote for her, whereas only 17 percent would be likely to vote for her.The Judicial Crisis Network (JCN) released a poll Tuesday showing that 56 percent of North Dakotans want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court. A majority of independents, 51 percent, also want the nominee added to the Supreme Court. Fifty percent of women want Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court as well.Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Heitkamp s Republican challenger, slammed the North Dakota Democrat on Thursday, saying that she sided with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and the  extreme left  over North Dakotans. I m deeply disappointed with Senator Heitkamp s decision to vote no on Judge Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court,  Rep. Cramer said in a statement on Thursday.  Clearly, she has decided to vote with Chuck Schumer, and not the people of North Dakota,  Cramer added.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/10/05/leftists-confront-sex-assault-survivor-who-supports-kavanaugh/","Annabelle Rutledge of the conservative Christian group Concerned Women for America came to Sen. Susan Collins s (R-ME) office Friday to tell her story of sexual assault in the hours before the key Senator announced her decision with regard to Judge Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation.Also present in Collins  office were anti-Kavanaugh protesters there to tell their own stories and urge Collins   in vain it would later prove   not to vote against Judge Kavanaugh. This story isn t only for a certain set of people,  Rutledge said to an anti-Kavanaugh activist.  It s not only for progressives, it s not only for Democrats, it s for every single person. I d like to join my voice and share my story and I am here today obviously in support of Judge Kavanaugh.  I am a woman. I also have been sexually assaulted,  Rutledge, who wore a Women for Kavanaugh shirt, explained.  And I care about each one of you guys, and I say that from the bottom of my heart, but I also know something else. And that s that we can t take the pain that we have from each of these experiences and put it on one man. Rutledge rejected the anti-Kavanaugh protesters  notion that voting for Kavanaugh after he had been accused of misconduct was a vote against all victims of sex crime.  That s just not true. You can t take the face of the people who have hurt you and put it on one,  Rutledge began, at which point an anti-Kavanaugh woman raised her hand and said,  I m just gonna stop you right there. As Rutledge spoke her peace, supporting Judge Kavanaugh, other protesters interjected,  he s a criminal,   he s disgusting,  and  he s a liar!  Excuse me, I m a woman, but I m also a sister. I m a daughter. I am a niece. I am a sister to four brothers. I am an aunt to three nephews. And it is extremely terrifying to me that one day someone could have a woman come and accuse them of something,  Rutledge began to explain. Not just one,   it s not just one woman,   they won t let them investigate,  and  it s a sham,  the protesters shouted in response.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/sarah-palin-fires-warning-shot-at-lisa-murkowski-i-can-see-2022-from-my-house/","Former Republican Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin fired a warning shot at Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) after the senator voted against the cloture motion to end debate on Judge Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation, hinting she may run to unseat the longtime lawmaker in 2022 or endorse a challenger. Hey @LisaMurkowski  I can see 2022 from my house,  Palin tweeted.Hey @LisaMurkowski  I can see 2022 from my house  Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) October 5, 2018In one of the most stunning upsets in Alaska political history, Palin defeated the senator s father Frank Murkowski to become the state s governor in 2006. Frank Murkowski, a former two-term senator who was elected governor of Alaska, served one term before Palin defeated him in the Republican gubernatorial primary.Palin, who had been appointed to Alaska s powerful oil and gas commission board by Frank Murkowski, won broad public support from Alaskans due to her record as a reformer and whistleblower who called out the corruption in the Murkowski administration for cronyism with the big oil companies, an action which led to the largest ethics fine in Alaska history. Frank Murkowski also faced criticism for nepotism when he appointed his daughter, Lisa Murkowski, to his vacant U.S. Senate seat.In 2010, Palin, then the former Republican vice-presidential candidate, backed Tea Party Senate challenger Joe Miller over Sen. Lisa Murkowski.Prior to voting against advancing Kavanaugh, Murkowski suggested that she will oppose President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee this weekend.  I believe that Brett Kavanaugh is a good man. It just may be that in my view he s not the right man for the court at this time,  Murkowski told reporters on Capitol Hill. She said she respected her colleagues  support for Kavanaugh, adding,  I also think we re at a place where we need to think about the credibility and integrity of our institutions. After remaining undecided on whether Kavanaugh s nomination should move forward, Murkowski rendered her decision Friday in dramatic fashion. As the clerk read the names in alphabetical order, all eyes were on Murkowski. Senators stood up in their chairs and voted, some of them loudly.But when it came to Murkowski, she stood up, paused, and whispered  no,  her voice barely audible. Then she took her seat, looking down with a stone-faced expression.As the end of the vote neared, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who sits next to Murkowski, leaned over and put her hand on the arm of Murkowski s chair. The two huddled in deep conversation.A spokeswoman for Murkowski could not immediately confirm that the senator will oppose Kavanaugh on the final vote expected Saturday, but indicated it appeared that way. Kavanaugh could still win confirmation if Murkowski is the only Republican to oppose him. Murkowski claimed she agonized over her vote, telling reporters she didn t make up her mind until she walked into the Senate chamber.  This has truly been the most difficult evaluation of a decision that I ve ever had to make, and I ve made some interesting ones in my political career,  she said.Breitbart News  Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

And when not if, when Judge Kavanaugh helps them to chip away at civil rights, voting rights, women s rights, abortion rights. I don t think this is going to sit very well with the country. He continued,  The judge, in his unhinged speech last week, said to the Democrats, you have sewn the wind, and now you ll reap the whirlwind. That s one thing he didn t lie about under oath, Jim.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/michael-avenatti-vows-to-sue-julie-swetnick-ex-bf-for-defamation/","Television lawyer and 2020 Democrat hopeful Michael Avenatti says he is weighing civil and criminal legal action for his client Julie Setnick leveled against Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, even as it appears the Senate will confirm him Saturday.In a brief interview with The Washington Posts Aaron Blake, Avenatti vowed to file a defamation lawsuit against Dennis Ketterer   a self-described former boyfriend of Swetnick who, in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, raised doubts over her allegations. Asked why he chose to publicize Swetnick s claims before the committee could fully vet them, Avenatti scoffed,  Why in God s name would I have gone through the media? The media does not determine the veracity of facts and evidence. According to Ketterer, Swetnick said she liked group sex, and he said her father told him she  had psychological and other problems. Ketterer s full letter states:During a conversation about our sexual preferences, things got derailed when Julie told me that she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time. In fact sometimes with several at one time. She wanted to know if that would be ok in our relationship.I asked her if this was just a fantasy of hers. She responded that she first tried sex with multiple guys while in high school and still liked it from time-to-time. She brought it up because she wanted to know if I would be interested in that.A.I.D.S. was a huge issue at the time. And I had children. Due to her having a directly stated penchant for group sex, I decided not to see her anymore. It put my head back on straight. That was the last conversation we had.Julie never said anything about being sexually assaulted, raped, gang-raped or having sex against her will. She never mentioned Brett Kavanaugh in any capacity.Responding to the letter, Avenatti called Ketterer s claims nothing more than  garbage  and sign of desperation from the Republicans.  The allegations he makes are false and without any basis,  he tweeted.  We demand that the FBI interview my client & him, and that anyone found to have submitted false info be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. In a sworn statement, Swetnick alleged she attended house parties in Maryland during the 1980s, attended by Kavanaugh and friend Mark Judge. According to Swetnick, she claims to have become aware of instances in which Kavanaugh spiked punch bowls and alcohol and quaaludes for the purpose of targeting inebriated women. Swetnick claims she was gang-raped at a gathering where Kavanaugh and Judge were present.MSNBC aired a 10-minute story Monday about reporter Kate Snow s interview with Julie Swetnick, with an excerpt on NBC s Nightly News. The interview was a continued topic of conversation   and further reporting   in the following days. In her story, Snow pointed out differences between what Swetnick told her and the affidavit released earlier by her lawyer, Michael Avenatti. For instance, Swetnick in her previous statement had accused Kavanaugh and his friends of  spiking  the punch at parties with drugs or grain alcohol so girls would lose their inhibitions. In the interview, Swetnick said she saw Kavanaugh standing near the punch but didn t see him or friend Mark Judge spike it.Swetnick also walked back allegations that Kavanaugh and other boys at the party waited their turn to  gang rape  girls who had been drugged. She told Snow she had no specific knowledge that this was happening. She did say that she was  violated  by boys at one party but couldn t say whether Kavanaugh was involved. She said she contacted the Montgomery County, Maryland, police about it; when NBC contacted the police to ask if there were any records, they said it could take up to a month to find them.The morning after the interview, Snow said Swetnick provided the names of four people she said she went to some of these parties with. One of these friends is dead, and one said he does not recall a Julie Swetnick. Two others had not returned NBC s inquiries before the story aired and still had not on Tuesday, the network said.Hours after it aired, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Fox News Channel s Sean Hannity that NBC was a  co-conspirator  in Kavanaugh s destruction. He said NBC News would never have done the story if the nominee were a Democrat. Their journalistic integrity has been destroyed over this case,  Graham said.As previously reported, Swetnick has an extensive history of involvement in legal disputes, including a lawsuit in which an ex-employer accused her of falsifying her college and work history on her job application. Legal documents from Maryland, Oregon, and Florida provide a partial picture of a woman who stepped into the media glare amid the battle over Kavanaugh s nomination for the nation s highest court.Further, court records show Swetnick has been involved in at least six legal cases over the past 25 years. Along with the lawsuit filed by a former employer in November 2000, the cases include a personal injury suit she filed in 1994 against the Washington, D.C., regional transit authority.Despite her past legal troubles, Avenatti claimed he  fully vetted  Swetnick before helping her take her claims against Kavanaugh public.Avenatti released a sworn statement by Swetnick in which she says she witnessed Kavanaugh  consistently engage in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women in the early 1980s.  In the statement provided to the committee, Swetnick alleged she had been sexually assaulted at a party attended by members of Kavanaugh s social circle, but did not accuse him of assaulting her.Swetnick was the third named Kavanaugh accuser to emerge when Avenatti released details of her accusations on Twitter on the eve of Christine Blasey Ford s testimony.Kavanaugh denied the claims made by Swetnick and other women, characterizing the allegations as a  joke  and a  farce. Swetnick, who is from the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., has claimed she is willing to be interviewed by either Congress or the FBI.Some details of the legal disputes she s been involved in aren t known, because documents in the cases are incomplete or no longer available. Records in the lawsuit filed in late 2000 by her ex-employer, Oregon-based software company Webtrends, don t indicate why it was dismissed. Avenatti said there was a settlement in the case but no money changed hands.In its civil complaint in a state court in Oregon, the company said Swetnick, a software engineer, was an employee for a few weeks before its human resources department received a report that she had engaged in  unwelcome sexual innuendo and inappropriate conduct  toward two male co-workers at a business lunch.The lawsuit said that Swetnick in turn accused Webtrends of subjecting her to  physically and emotionally threatening and hostile conditions  and that she claimed that she d been sexually harassed by four co-workers. The co-workers denied the allegations, the suit said.Company officials later determined, the suit said, that Swetnick had provided false information on her employment application. The suit alleged that she had misrepresented the length of time she worked at a previous employer and falsely claimed that she d earned an undergraduate degree in biology and chemistry from Johns Hopkins University.Swetnick was on the other side of a civil case in 1994, as a plaintiff, when she filed a personal injury lawsuit in Maryland against the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. She claimed she lost more than $420,000 in earnings after she hurt her nose in a fall on a train in 1992.Swetnick, who described herself in court records as a model and actor, claimed she had  numerous modeling commitments  with several companies at the time of the accident but missed out them because of her injuries.To support her claim for lost wages, Swetnick named  Konam Studios  as one of the companies promising to employ her. A court filing identified Nam Ko, a representative of  Kunam Studios,  as a possible plaintiff s witness for her case.However, Ko said he was just a friend of Swetnick s and that he had never owned a company with a name spelled either way and had never agreed to pay her money for any work before she injured her nose. He said he first met Swetnick at a bar more than a year after her alleged accident. I didn t have any money back then. I (was) broke as can be,  Ko said.Ko said he has a hazy memory of Swetnick asking to use him as a  character reference  but doesn t recall hearing about her lawsuit.  I thought it was for a job application,  he said.The paperwork filed in the suit includes a letter addressed to Swetnick s attorney from Richard Zamora, who is identified as a marketing executive from a San Jose, California-based company called Fiber Sign Inc. In the letter, dated March 1994, Zamora said the company had been prepared to hire Swetnick as a model and spokeswoman and pay her a $60,000 base salary but offered the job to someone else after learning of her accident.Zamora later asked a court in Florida for a restraining order against Swetnick. The remaining court records don t show the reasons he gave for asking for the restraining order, but indicate that the case was dropped less than two weeks later when neither party appeared in court.Avenatti said the request for a restraining order was  nonsense. Court records show Swetnick s lawsuit against the transit agency was dismissed in 1997 after a settlement was reached. Vincent Jankoski, one of the lawyers who defended the agency, said the case was resolved without paying Swetnick any money after she failed to provide documentation supporting her lost-wage claims.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Susan Collins (R-ME) delivered Friday afternoon on the Senate floor to explain her support of Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation to the United State Supreme Court.Via Collins  Senate website:Mr. President, the five previous times that I have come to the floor to explain my vote on the nomination of a justice to the United States Supreme Court, I have begun my floor remarks explaining my decision with a recognition of the solemn nature and the importance of the occasion.But today we have come to the conclusion of a confirmation process that has become so dysfunctional it looks more like a caricature of a gutter-level political campaign than a solemn occasion.The President nominated Brett Kavanaugh on July 9th.  Within moments of that announcement, special interest groups raced to be the first to oppose him, including one organization that didn t even bother to fill in the Judge s name on its pre-written press release  they simply wrote that they opposed  Donald Trump s nomination of XX to the Supreme Court of the United States.  A number of Senators joined the race to announce their opposition, but they were beaten to the punch by one of our colleagues who actually announced opposition before the nominee s identity was even known.Since that time, we have seen special interest groups whip their followers into a frenzy by spreading misrepresentations and outright falsehoods about Judge Kavanaugh s judicial record.  Over-the-top rhetoric and distortions of his record and testimony at his first hearing produced short-lived headlines which, although debunked hours later, continue to live on and be spread through social media.  Interest groups have also spent an unprecedented amount of dark money opposing this nomination.Our Supreme Court confirmation process has been in steady decline for more than thirty years.  One can only hope that the Kavanaugh nomination is where the process has finally hit rock bottom.Against this backdrop, it is up to each individual Senator to decide what the Constitution s  advice and consent  duty means.  Informed by Alexander Hamilton s Federalist 76, I have interpreted this to mean that the President has broad discretion to consider a nominee s philosophy, whereas my duty as a Senator is to focus on the nominee s qualifications as long as that nominee s philosophy is within the mainstream of judicial thought.I have always opposed litmus tests for judicial nominees with respect to their personal views or politics, but I fully expect them to be able to put aside any and all personal preferences in deciding the cases that come before them.  I have never considered the President s identity or party when evaluating Supreme Court nominations.  As a result, I voted in favor of Justices Roberts and Alito, who were nominated by President Bush, Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, who were nominated by President Obama, and Justice Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Trump.So I began my evaluation of Judge Kavanaugh s nomination by reviewing his 12-year record on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, including his more than 300 opinions and his many speeches and law review articles.  Nineteen attorneys, including lawyers from the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, briefed me many times each week and assisted me in evaluating the judge s extensive record.  I met with Judge Kavanaugh for more than two hours in my office.  I listened carefully to the testimony at the Committee hearings.  I spoke with people who knew him personally, such as Condoleezza Rice and many others.  And, I talked with Judge Kavanaugh a second time by phone for another hour to ask him very specific additional questions.I have also met with thousands of my constituents, both advocates and many opponents, regarding Judge Kavanaugh.  One concern that I frequently heard was that Judge Kavanaugh would be likely to eliminate the Affordable Care Act s (ACA) vital protections for people with preexisting conditions.  I disagree with this contention.  In a dissent in Seven-Sky v. Holder, Judge Kavanaugh rejected a challenge to the ACA on narrow procedural grounds, preserving the law in full.  Many experts have said his dissent informed Justice Roberts  opinion upholding the ACA at the Supreme Court.Furthermore, Judge Kavanaugh s approach toward the doctrine of severability is narrow.  When a part of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds, he has argued for severing the invalid clause as surgically as possible while allowing the overall law to remain intact.This was his approach in his dissent in a case that involved a challenge to the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (PPH v. CFPB).  In his dissent, Judge Kavanaugh argued for  severing any problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact.   Given the current challenges to the ACA, proponents, including myself, of protections for people with pre-existing conditions should want a Justice who would take just this kind of approach.Another assertion I have heard often is that Judge Kavanaugh cannot be trusted if a case involving alleged wrongdoing by the President were to come before the Court.  The basis for this argument seems to be two-fold.  First, Judge Kavanaugh has written that he believes that Congress should enact legislation to protect presidents from criminal prosecution or civil liability while in office.  Mr. President, I believe opponents miss the mark on this issue.  The fact that Judge Kavanaugh offered this legislative proposal suggests that he believes that the President does not have such protection currently.Second, there are some who argue that given the current Special Counsel investigation, President Trump should not even be allowed to nominate a justice.  That argument ignores our recent history.  President Clinton, in 1993, nominated Justice Ginsburg after the Whitewater investigation was already underway.  And she was confirmed 96-3.  The next year, just three months after Independent Counsel Robert Fiske was named to lead the Whitewater investigation, President Clinton nominated Justice Breyer.  He was confirmed 87-9.Supreme Court Justices have not hesitated to rule against the presidents who have nominated them.  Perhaps most notably in United States v. Nixon, three Nixon appointees who heard the case joined the unanimous opinion against him.Judge Kavanaugh has been unequivocal in his belief that no president is above the law.  He has stated that Marbury v. Madison, Youngstown Steel v. Sawyer and United States v. Nixon are three of the four greatest Supreme Court cases in history.  What do they have in common?  Each of them is a case where the Court served as a check on presidential power.  And I would note that the fourth case that Judge Kavanaugh has pointed to as the greatest in history was Brown v Board of Education.One Kavanaugh decision illustrates the  point about the check on presidential power directly.  He wrote the opinion in Hamdan v. United States, a case that challenged the Bush Administration s military commission prosecution of an associate of Osama Bin Laden.  This conviction was very important to the Bush Administration, but Judge Kavanaugh, who had been appointed to the DC Circuit by President Bush and had worked in President Bush s White House, ruled that the conviction was unlawful.  As he explained during the hearing,  We don t make decisions based on who people are, or their policy preferences, or the moment.  We base decisions on the law. Others I met with have expressed concerns that Justice Kennedy s retirement threatens the right of same sex couples to marry.  Yet, Judge Kavanaugh described the Obergefell decision, which legalized same gender marriages, as an important landmark precedent.  He also cited Justice Kennedy s recent Masterpiece Cakeshopopinion for the Court s majority stating that:  The days of treating gay and lesbian Americans or gay and lesbian couples as second-class citizens who are inferior in dignity and worth are over in the Supreme Court. Others have suggested that the judge holds extreme views on birth control.  In one case, Judge Kavanaugh incurred the disfavor of both sides of the political spectrum for seeking to ensure the availability of contraceptive services for women while minimizing the involvement of employers with religious objections.  Although his critics frequently overlook this point, Judge Kavanaugh s dissent rejected arguments that the government did not have a compelling interest in facilitating access to contraception.  In fact, he wrote that the Supreme Court precedent  strongly suggested  that there was a  compelling interest  in facilitating access to birth control.There has also been considerable focus on the future of abortion rights based on the concern that Judge Kavanaugh would seek to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Protecting this right is important to me.To my knowledge, Judge Kavanaugh is the first Supreme Court nominee to express the view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition, but rooted in Article III of our Constitution itself.  He believes that precedent  is not just a judicial policy  it is constitutionally dictated to pay attention and pay heed to rules of precedent.   In other words, precedent isn t a goal or an aspiration; it is a constitutional tenet that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances.The judge further explained that precedent provides stability, predictability, reliance, and fairness.  There are, of course, rare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court would rightly overturn a precedent.  The most famous example was when the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education overruled Plessy v. Ferguson, correcting a  grievously wrong  decisionto use the judge s termallowing racial inequality.  But, someone who believes that the importance of precedent has been rooted in the Constitution would follow long-established precedent except in those rare circumstances where a decision is  grievously wrong  or  deeply inconsistent with the law.   Those are Judge Kavanaugh s phrases.As Judge Kavanaugh asserted to me, a long-established precedent is not something to be trimmed, narrowed, discarded, or overlooked.  Its roots in the Constitution give the concept of stare decisis greater weight such that precedent can t be trimmed or narrowed simply because a judge might want to on a whim.  In short, his views on honoring precedent would preclude attempts to do by stealth that which one has committed not to do overtly.Noting that Roe v. Wade was decided 45 years ago, and reaffirmed 19 years later in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, I asked Judge Kavanaugh whether the passage of time is relevant to following precedent.  He said decisions become part of our legal framework with the passage of time and that honoring precedent is essential to maintaining public confidence.Our discussion then turned to the right of privacy, on which the Supreme Court relied in Griswold v. Connecticut, a case that struck down a law banning the use and sale of contraceptives.  Griswold established the legal foundation that led to Roe eight years later.  In describing Griswold as  settled law,  Judge Kavanaugh observed that it was the correct application of two famous cases from the 1920s, Meyer and Pierce, that are not seriously challenged by anyone today.  Finally, in his testimony, he noted repeatedly that Roe had been upheld by Planned Parenthood v. Casey, describing it as  precedent on precedent.   When I asked him would it be sufficient to overturn a long-established precedent if five current justices believed it was wrongly decided, he emphatically said  no. Opponents frequently cite then-candidate Donald Trump s campaign pledge to nominate only judges who would overturn Roe.  The Republican platform for all presidential campaigns has included this pledge since at least 1980.  During this time, Republican presidents have appointed Justices O Connor, Souter, and Kennedy to the Supreme Court.  These are the very three justices Republican president appointed justices who authored the Casey decision, which reaffirmed Roe.  Furthermore, pro-choice groups vigorously opposed each of these justices  nominations.  Incredibly, they even circulated buttons with the slogan  Stop Souter Or Women Will Die!   Just two years later, Justice Souter coauthored the Casey opinion, reaffirming a woman s right to choose.  Suffice it to say, prominent advocacy organizations have been wrong.These same interest groups have speculated that Judge Kavanaugh was selected to do the bidding of conservative ideologues, despite his record of judicial independence.  I asked the judge point blank whether he had made any commitments or pledges to anyone at the White House, to the Federalist Society, or to any outside group on how he would decide cases.  He unequivocally assured me he had not.Judge Kavanaugh has received rave reviews for his 12-year track record as a judge, including for his judicial temperament.  The American Bar Association (ABA) gave him its highest possible rating.  Its Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary conducted an extraordinarily thorough assessment, soliciting input from almost 500 people, including his judicial colleagues.  The ABA concluded that  his integrity, judicial temperament, and professional competence met the highest standard. Lisa Blatt, who has argued more cases before the Supreme Court than any other woman in history, testified:  By any objective measure, Judge Kavanaugh is clearly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.    His opinions are invariably thoughtful and fair.   Ms. Blatt, who clerked for and is an ardent admirer of Justice Ginsburg, and who is, in her own words,  an unapologetic defender of a woman s right to choose,  said that Judge Kavanaugh  fit[s] in the mainstream of legal thought.   She also observed that  Judge Kavanaugh is remarkably committed to promoting women in the legal profession. That Judge Kavanaugh is more of a centrist than some of his critics maintain is reflected in the fact that he and Chief Judge Merrick Garland voted the same way in 93 percent of the cases that they heard together.  Indeed, Chief Judge Garland joined in more than 96 percent of the majority opinions authored by Judge Kavanaugh, dissenting only once.Despite all this, after weeks of reviewing Judge Kavanaugh s record and listening to 32 hours of his testimony, the Senate s advice and consent role was thrown into a tailspin following the allegations of sexual assault by Professor Christine Blasey Ford.  The confirmation process now involves evaluating whether or not Judge Kavanaugh committed sexual assault, and lied about it to the Judiciary Committee.Some argue that because this is a lifetime appointment to our highest court, the public interest requires that doubts be resolved against the nominee.  Others see the public interest as embodied in our long-established tradition of affording to those accused of misconduct a presumption of innocence.  In cases in which the facts are unclear, they would argue that the question should be resolved in favor of the nominee.Mr. President, I understand both viewpoints.  This debate is complicated further by the fact that the Senate confirmation process is not a trial.  But certain fundamental legal principles about due process, the presumption of innocence, and fairness do bear on my thinking, and I cannot abandon them.In evaluating any given claim of misconduct, we will be ill served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness, tempting though it may be.  We must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy.The presumption of innocence is relevant to the advice and consent function when an accusation departs from a nominee s otherwise exemplary record.  I worry that departing from this presumption could lead to a lack of public faith in the judiciary and would be hugely damaging to the confirmation process moving forward.Some of the allegations levied against Judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important.  I am thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by Professor Ford, but of the allegation that, when he was a teenager, Judge Kavanaugh drugged multiple girls and used their weakened state to facilitate gang rape.  This outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parroted public statements of others.  That such an allegation can find its way into the Supreme Court confirmation process is a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness.Mr. President, I listened carefully to Christine Blasey Ford s testimony before the Judiciary Committee.  I found her testimony to be sincere, painful, and compelling.  I believe that she is a survivor of a sexual assault and that this trauma has upended her life.  Nevertheless, the four witnesses she named could not corroborate any of the events of that evening gathering where she says the assault occurred; none of the individuals Professor Ford says were at the party has any recollection at all of that night.Judge Kavanaugh forcefully denied the allegations under penalty of perjury.  Mark Judge denied under penalty of felony that he had witnessed an assault.  PJ Smyth, another person allegedly at the party, denied that he was there under penalty of felony.  Professor Ford s life-long friend Leland Keyser indicated that, under penalty of felony, she does not remember that party.  And Ms. Keyser went further.  She indicated that not only does she not remember a night like that, but also that she does not even know Brett Kavanaugh.In addition to the lack of corroborating evidence, we also learned some facts that raised more questions.  For instance, since these allegations have become public, Professor Ford testified that not a single person has contacted her to say,  I was at the party that night. Furthermore, the professor testified that although she does not remember how she got home that evening, she knew that, because of the distance, she would have needed a ride  yet not a single person has come forward to say that they were the one that drove her home or were in the car with her that night.  And Professor Ford also indicated that even though she left that small gathering of six or so people abruptly and without saying goodbye and distraught, none of them called her the next day  or ever  to ask why she left  is she okay  not even her closest friend, Ms. Keyser.Mr. President, the Constitution does not provide guidance as to how we are supposed to evaluate these competing claims.  It leaves that decision up to each Senator.  This is not a criminal trial, and I do not believe that claims such as these need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  Nevertheless, fairness would dictate that the claims at least should meet a threshold of  more likely than not  as our standard.The facts presented do not mean that Professor Ford was not sexually assaulted that night  or at some other time  but they do lead me to conclude that the allegations fail to meet the  more likely than not  standard.  Therefore, I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the Court.Let me emphasize that my approach to this question should not be misconstrued as suggesting that unwanted sexual contact of any nature is not a serious problem in this country.  To the contrary, if any good at all has come from this ugly confirmation process, it has been to create an awareness that we have underestimated the pervasiveness of this terrible problem.I have been alarmed and disturbed, however, by some who have suggested that unless Judge Kavanaugh s nomination is rejected, the Senate is somehow condoning sexual assault.  Nothing could be further from the truth.Every person man or womanwho makes a charge of sexual assault deserves to be heard and treated with respect.  The #MeToo movement is real.  It matters.  It is needed.  And it is long overdue. We know that rape and sexual assault are less likely to be reported to the police than other forms of assault.  On average, an estimated 211,000 rapes and sexual assaults go unreported every year. We must listen to survivors, and every day we must seek to stop the criminal behavior that has hurt so many.  We owe this to ourselves, our children, and generations to come.Since the hearing, I have listened to many survivors of sexual assault.  Many were total strangers who told me their heart-wrenching stories for the first time in their lives.  Some were friends I have known for decades, yet with the exception of one woman who had confided in me years ago, I had no idea that they had been the victims of sexual attacks.  I am grateful for their courage and their willingness to come forward, and I hope that in heightening public awareness, they have also lightened the burden that they have been quietly bearing for so many years.  To them, I pledge to do all that I can to ensure that their daughters and granddaughters never share their experiences.Over the past few weeks, I have been emphatic that the Senate has an obligation to investigate and evaluate the serious allegations of sexual assault.  I called for and supported the additional hearing to hear from both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh.  I also pushed for and supported the FBI supplemental background investigation.  This was the right thing to do.Christine Ford never sought the spotlight.  She indicated that she was terrified to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and she has shunned attention since then.  She seemed completely unaware of Chairman Grassley s offer to allow her to testify confidentially in California.  Watching her, Mr. President, I could not help but feel that some people who wanted to engineer the defeat of this nomination cared little, if at all, for her well-being.Professor Ford testified that a very limited number of people had access to her letter.  Yet that letter found its way into the public domain.  She testified that she never gave permission for that very private letter to be released.  And yet, here we are.  We are in the middle of a fight that she never sought, arguing about claims that she wanted to raise confidentially.One theory I have heard espoused repeatedly is that our colleague, Senator Feinstein, leaked Professor Ford s letter at the eleventh hour to derail this process.  I want to state this very clearly: I know Senator Diane Feinstein extremely well, and I believe that she would never do that.  I knew that to be the case before she even stated it at the hearing.  She is a person of integrity, and I stand by her.I have also heard some argue that the Chairman of the Committee somehow treated Professor Ford unfairly.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Chairman Grassley, along with his excellent staff, treated Professor Ford with compassion and respect throughout the entire process.  And that is the way the Senator from Iowa has conducted himself throughout a lifetime dedicated to public service.But the fact remains, Mr. President, that someone leaked this letter against Professor Ford s express wishes.  I suspect, regrettably, that we will never know for certain who did it.  To that leaker, who I hope is listening now, let me say that what you did was unconscionable.  You have taken a survivor who was not only entitled to your respect, but who also trusted you to protect her  and you have sacrificed her well-being in a misguided attempt to win whatever political crusade you think you are fighting.  My only hope is that your callous act has turned this process into such a dysfunctional circus that it will cause the Senate  and indeed all Americans  to reconsider how we evaluate Supreme Court nominees.  If that happens, then the appalling lack of compassion you afforded Professor Ford will at least have some unintended positive consequences.Mr. President, the politically charged atmosphere surrounding this nomination had reached a fever pitch even before these allegations were known, and it has been challenging even then to separate fact from fiction.We live in a time of such great disunity, as the bitter fight over this nomination both in the Senate and among the public clearly demonstrates.  It is not merely a case of different groups having different opinions.  It is a case of people bearing extreme ill will toward those who disagree with them.  In our intense focus on our differences, we have forgotten the common values that bind us together as Americans.  When some of our best minds are seeking to develop ever more sophisticated algorithms designed to link us to websites that only reinforce and cater to our views, we can only expect our differences to intensify.This would have alarmed the drafters of our Constitution, who were acutely aware that different values and interests could prevent Americans from becoming and remaining a single people.  Indeed, of the six objectives they invoked in the preamble to the Constitution, the one that they put first was the formation of  a more perfect Union. Their vision of  a more perfect Union  does not exist today, and if anything, we appear to be moving farther away from it.  It is particularly worrisome that the Supreme Court, the institution that most Americans see as the principal guardian of our shared constitutional heritage, is viewed as part of the problem through a political lens.Mr. President, we ve heard a lot of charges and counter charges about Judge Kavanaugh.  But as those who have known him best have attested, he has been an exemplary public servant, judge, teacher, coach, husband, and father.  Despite the turbulent, bitter fight surrounding his nomination, my fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer 5-4 decisions and so that public confidence in our Judiciary and our highest court is restored.  Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2018/10/05/video-anti-israel-activist-linda-sarour-says-sen-kirsten-gillibrand-works-for-us-on-the-inside/","At a rally yesterday against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Women s March organizer and anti-Israel activist Linda Sarsour introduced Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) to attendees as a politician  who works for us on the inside. Promoting Gillibrand, Sarsour stated (video above):  I want to introduce to you another champion, another one of our people who works for us on the inside. Someone who understands that she works for the people of this country, who s been speaking up against sexual assault and sexual violence before there was a Brett Kavanaugh. Please give it up for the senator. The controversial Sarsour co-hosted the Washington, D.C. rally on Thursday outside the Supreme Court together with another anti-Israel radical and fellow Women s March organizer, Tamika Mallory.Gillibrand s colleague in the Senate, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), also spoke at Sarsour s anti-Kavanaugh event.  I believe Christine Blasey Ford! I am angry on behalf of women who have been told to sit down and shut up one time too many!  Warren declared.Chele Farley, Gillibrand s Republican opponent in next month s election, slammed the New York senator for rallying with Sarsour and Mallory despite the duo s anti-Israel track record. Kirsten Gillibrand is a disgrace, she has abandoned New Yorkers, turned her back on Israel and is clearly focused on running for president in 2020,  said Farley in a campaign statement emailed to reporters. Gillibrand s actions are part of a dangerous and emerging pattern where the far left of the Democratic Party, led by Kirsten Gillibrand, is becoming highly critical of Israel almost as a default position,  Farley added.Gillibrand has other links to Sarsour. Gillibrand authored a profile of Sarsour when the extremist made Time magazine s 100 most influential people last year.Gillibrand hailed Sarsour and three other leaders of the anti-Trump Women s March, which Gillibrand also headlined, as  extraordinary women.  These women are the suffragists of our time,  Gillibrand gushed.Gillibrand s office did not respond when major Jewish groups urged the New York senator to retract her praise considering Sarsour s anti-Israel comments, including tweeting that  Nothing is creepier than Zionism. Sarsour also claimed one cannot be a Zionist and a feminist even though Israel is the only country in the Middle East where women have equal rights and the Islamic nations that Sarsour champions are well-known abusers of women s most basic rights.Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center attempted to appeal to Gillibrand s sensibilities over her support for Sarsour.  I think the Jewish community in New York and across the U.S. has a lot of respect for the senator, but she may want to reevaluate the statement in Time magazine,  Cooper said.  If someone is in effect saying you have to make a choice between being a progressive woman or a Zionist, the senator, reflecting on such comments, would I hope make a different type of statement.  Linda Sarsour spends most of her waking hours working to delegitimize Israel and its supporters,  Daniel Mariaschin, the Executive Vice President of B nai B rith International, commented.  We d ask Senator Gillibrand to recognize that you can t compartmentalize on these things. It isn t enough to say, You know, she worked on the Women s March, and therefore she deserves this kind of recognition.  Gillibrand also keynoted the October 2017  Brooklyn Conference  at the Brooklyn Museum, which featured Sarsour as a speaker on the same day. Another speaker that day was Alicia Garza, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, which supports the BDS movement. The main sponsor of the conference, as advertised in literature for the event, was George Soros s Open Society Foundations. The Open Society supports scores of pro-BDS groups.Mallory, meanwhile, was in attendance at rabid anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan s Saviours  Day address in March where the Nation of Islam chief used the term  that Satanic Jew,  slandered Jews as  the mother and father of apartheid,  and spread the anti-Jewish smear that  when you want something in this world, the Jew holds the door. In June, Mallory claimed that Israel committed a  human rights crime  when the Jewish state was established by  killing, stealing  and  taking the lives of people who were there first. One month earlier, Mallory visited Israel with the George Soros-funded Center for Constitutional Rights and met with supporters of the extremist Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement targeting Israel.Aaron Klein is Breitbart s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

In evaluating any given claim of misconduct, we will be ill-served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness, tempting though it may be. Collins continued that the  outlandish  claim that Kavanaugh participated in gang rapes is a clear example of why the presumption of innocence is important.Collins then turned to the charges made by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. Collins said she believes Ford is a sexual assault victim, but none of the witnesses she named could corroborate her story and no one has come forward to back up Ford s story.Collins concluded that Ford s allegations do not meet the  more likely than not  standard.Collins then lambasted whoever leaked Ford s letter while expressing confidence that Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) didn t leak the letter.She then concluded her speech,  Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/susan-collins-offers-methodical-independent-defense-of-brett-kavanaugh/","Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) delivered a dramatic, passionate, yet methodical defense of Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the Senate floor on Friday afternoon, as she explained her reasons she would vote to confirm his Supreme Court appointment Saturday.Collins kept her decision a mystery until the last moment. Though she had voted Friday morning for cloture, moving the nomination to a final vote, she had not committed to supporting Kavanaugh, and announced that she would make her choice known in a floor speech at 3:00 p.m. ET. Protesters filled the halls, and occupied her office; they chanted from the gallery as she prepared to speak. Many still held out hope that she would vote no and put the nomination one vote from defeat.Instead, Collins walked through one argument against Kavanaugh after another. She left the personal accusations against Kavanaugh to the end, and prioritized his views on legal precedent and the political independence of the judiciary. She knocked down the claims that he would cancel Obamacare s insurance provisions, or that he would repeal Roe v. Wade, or that he would favor President Donald Trump in the event that the president s own conduct came before the Supreme Court.She then turned to the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford and other accusers, defending the presumption of innocence and laying out the reasons that the charges were not convincing enough to keep Kavanaugh from the highest court   including the fact that none of Ford s witnesses corroborated her claims. In the only angry portion of her speech, she attacked whoever leaked Ford s original letter to the media, saying that action  has turned this process into such a dysfunctional Senate. Collins did not mention her recent public spats with the president over his comments about Ford s testimony. She simply focused on the issues, and on the Constitution, concluding:  Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/susan-collins-vote-yes-brett-kavanaugh/","Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), the crucial outstanding vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, delivered an extended defense of his record on the Senate floor Friday afternoon as she announced her intention to vote for his confirmation.Collins criticized Democrats and far-left activists for their behavior during the confirmation, saying that the process was reduced to a  gutter  affair and hit  rock bottom.  Certain fundamental principles about due process, the presumption of innocence, and fairness do bear on my thinking and I cannot abandon them,  Collins said while addressing the central matter of the last several weeks: Christine Blasey Ford s allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a high school party in 1982.While Collins called Ford s testimony  sincere  and  compelling,  she could not disregard the complete lack of corroboration   denials of any memory by every witness who Ford claimed was present at the party, plus Kavanaugh s own  forceful denial. Collins stressed that the confirmation process was not a trial and did not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt to disqualify Kavanaugh. Instead, she only demanded Ford s accusations be  more likely than not  true. Collins did not find Ford s allegations against Kavanaugh to meet even this standard.Furthermore, she tore into allegations from Julie Swetnick   represented by Resistance TV lawyer Michael Avenatti   that Kavanaugh had drugged and facilitated the gang raping of several women. She called these claims  outlandish  and  a stark reminder of why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in the American consciousness. Collins began her eagerly anticipated floor statement began shortly after 3 p.m. to the sounds of shouting and chants from anti-Kavanaugh protesters, like so many of the proceedings over the months-long confirmation process. She launched promptly into an attack on the forces arrayed against Kavanaugh, lamenting their hysterical behavior compared to the five other  solemn  Supreme Court confirmations in which she participated.The moderate Maine senator expressed her outrage at organizations that forcefully opposed Kavanaugh before even copy-and-pasting his name into their material and Democrats who announced their intention to end Kavanaugh s nomination before hearing a word of testimony.Collins then, in stark contrast to the weeks of controversy over uncorroborated accusations about Kavanaugh s behavior as a teenager, dug for over 20 minutes into Kavanaugh s 12-year record as a federal judge and his judicial philosophy as gleaned from extensive Senate Judiciary Committee testimony and her own meetings with the nominee.On privacy, healthcare, executive power, and his ability to fairly judge the president who nominated him, Donald Trump, Collins one-by-one addressed Kavanaugh s opponents  concerns. On the centrally important issue of abortion, the pro-choice Collins gave a lengthy refutation of the notion Kavanaugh would overturn Roe v. Wade.She pointed not only to Kavanaugh s record and explanations of his philosophy on the Roe precedent but abortion proponents  long history of exaggerating the threat to Roe from Republican nominees in general, pointing to signs from David Souter s 1990 confirmation process that read  Stop Souter or Women Will Die.

Right now, the U.S. Supreme Court is split 4-4 on the basic right to keep a firearm in the home for self-defense. Therefore, a vote against confirming Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is a vote against the fundamental right to self-defense.

I mean, the idea that he can t teach at Harvard now because he was suspected. When I was growing up in Brooklyn College as a student, they fired professors because they were suspected of maybe being Communists when they were in their 20s. Suspicion was enough. This kind of sexual McCarthyism is a terrible, terrible precedent. Look, women being assaulted is a horrible, horrible thing.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/10/05/facebook-employees-in-uproar-over-executive-who-backs-brett-kavanaugh/","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has come under fire recently due to a top Facebook global policy executive s decision to support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and appear at his hearing. One prominent executive claims Facebook is an  apolitical  company.According to the Wall Street Journal, hundreds of employees at the social media firm Facebook have expressed their anger about top global policy executive, Joel Kaplan s decision to support Brett Kavanaugh at his upcoming hearing. Employees questioned CEO Mark Zuckerberg directly about the Kavanaugh-supporting executive in a weekly question-and-answer session held last Friday, Facebook s COO Sheryl Sandberg   a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter   also apparently weighed in on the issue.An internal discussion thread was reportedly filled with hundreds of comments. Many Facebook employees were critical of the executive s decision to support Kavanaugh. The topic became an issue after a photo of Facebook s Head of Global Policy Joel Kaplan appeared to show the executive present at Kavanaugh s hearing last Thursday. This resulted in an internal discussion about how Facebook s executives felt about the #MeToo movement, freedom of speech, and President Trump.Zuckerberg was relatively non-committal in his response to the employee s issues, stating that he wouldn t have made the same decision as Kaplan, but that his presence at the hearing did not violate any of Facebook s company policies and that Zuckerberg was aware that Kaplan and Kavanaugh had been longtime friends. This, however, did not satisfy employees and the internal debate still continued with Zuckerberg and Sandberg planning to address the employees issues at a town hall meeting on Friday.One employee stated:  This fire has been burning for a full week now.  Kaplan reportedly appeared defensive in his initial response, stating that he took the day off, but the executive s tone shifted as further controversy over his appearance arose. Many were angered over Kaplan s appearance at the hearing as since the 2016 election, Facebook has discouraged employees from expressing their political opinions publicly, but now the company s head of global policy was appearing at a hearing that had become extremely politicized over recent weeks.Sheryl Sandberg said in an internal post:  I ve talked to Joel about why I think it was a mistake for him to attend given his role in the company. We support people s right to do what they want in their personal time but this was by no means a straightforward case.  Other executives later became involved in the discussion, longtime executive Andrew Bosworth argued at one point that Facebook employees should focus on issues within their control, rather than ones they could not control, such as the Supreme Court nomination process. Other employees made similar arguments that Facebook had other issues to focus on such as their regular security breaches.Bosworth also said that Facebook was an apolitical company and that it may not be a good fit for employees who felt the need to drive political change through their work. Bosworth also linked to mental health resources and helplines for any employees who may need them. This caused an internal uproar and Bosworth deleted his post and made an apology:  I had hoped it would then help people heal and allow our employees to focus on their work without ongoing anxiety,  he wrote.  I was wrong and my post was wrong. Axios reported on the details of the meeting that took place Friday in which Kaplan spoke to coworkers about the controversy. Axios summarized the meeting this way:Facebook sources said Kaplan, Facebook s vice president for global public policy, was solemn and contrite as he said he recognized the difficult situation he had put the company in.Refusing to bow to the attacks, Kaplan explained the tensions between his personal and professional obligations, and said he had a personal obligation to Kavanaugh and his family.Kaplan said he should have talked to Zuckerberg and Sandberg first, according to a Facebook official. Asked whether he had regrets, Kaplan said his core values include friendship and loyalty, and he declined to say if it was a mistake to go.Roberta Thomson, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement:  Sexual assault is an issue society has turned a blind eye to for far too long   compounding every victim s pain. Our leadership team recognizes that they ve made mistakes handling the events of the last week and we re grateful for all the feedback from our employees.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/jeff-flake-backs-kavanaugh-murkowski-flip/","Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) told reporters Friday he would stick with his  yes  vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at Saturday s final vote.Flake, one of the small group of Republican senators who refused to conclusively support or oppose Kavanaugh through the weeks of Senate wrangling over allegations of teenage sexual misconduct, voted to end debate on Kavanaugh s confirmation Friday morning. Shortly after the vote, Flake indicated he would not flip to a  no  vote  unless something big changes :SEN FLAKE says he plans to vote yes tomorrow on Kavanaugh unless something big changes and he doesn t see what would change. Says was a hard decision for everybody.  Alex Moe (@AlexNBCNews) October 5, 2018Flake was joined in his vote for cloture by every other Senate Republican except Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). Along with Sen. Joe Manchin s (D-WV) vote, this was enough to set up a final vote of the full Senate Saturday afternoon. Flake did not address Murkowski s unexpected break, which she claims she decided only as she walked to the Senate chamber for the vote.Facing an uphill primary battle, Flake is retiring at the end of this term, making his role in the Kavanaugh confirmation likely one of the last significant actions of his Senate career. He shot to the forefront of what is likely the most contentious confirmation fight in American history when, as a Senate Judiciary Committee member, he refused to signal his support for Kavanaugh as allegations against him multiplied. Eventually, Flake voted to recommend Kavanaugh for confirmation but conditioned his final vote on the FBI conducting a seventh background investigation on Kavanaugh.That investigation is complete, and all reports indicate the FBI found no evidence to corroborate any of the allegations Kavanaugh s accusers brought.With Murkowski now presumably a  no  vote, Flake s  yes  is likely a prerequisite for Kavanaugh s confirmation. The only remaining plausible swings are Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who voted  yes  in Friday morning s cloture vote and will make her final voting intentions known Friday afternoon on the Senate floor, and Manchin, whose vote for cloture may indicate he will support Kavanaugh in the final vote.Complicating matters is that a solid  yes  vote from Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) is in jeopardy, as he may be unavailable to vote at all due to his daughter s wedding.Without Daines s vote and with Murkowski s vote against Kavanaugh, all threeFlake, Collins, and Manchinas well as Vice President Mike Pence s tiebreak, are needed to confirm Kavanaugh. With Daines, merely two of the three will suffice.

Menendez said,  For my own view, obviously, I m strongly opposed to Judge Kavanaugh. I was opposed to his nomination, before the allegations of Dr. Ford, because his positions on civil rights, on voting rights, on reproductive rights, on siding with big corporations against the little guy, and just simply is not what I believe needs to be on the Supreme Court. He added,  But after I saw Dr. Ford s testimony, and I think it was incredibly powerful, and I think that it was truthful and I believe her. And then I saw his response, which was overtly political, showed him to be what he really is, which is a political operative dressed in the robes of a judge, not someone whose temperament and whose words are befitting of the Supreme Court. So I hope that today s vote isn t indicative of the final vote. I hope that we can still defeat Brett Kavanaugh. (h/t Grabien)Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The information included personal phone numbers, emails, and employer phone numbers. Yesterday, members of the Young Conservatives of Texas tabled with pro-Kavanaugh & anti-#MeToo signs on West Mall. They were swiftly confronted by a growing crowd of students, who made signs in protest, destroyed YCT signs, and chanted slogans like we believe survivors!   the far-left ASN group wrote in a blog post.  With women of color taking the initiative, the protests grew increasingly militant and also confronted the administration and the police enabling the YCT rally. Within two hours, the YCT had fled in the face of the massive backlash. In the post, the group encouraged readers to use the information provided in the blog post to ensure that the protesters face repercussions for defending Kavanaugh. We encourage people to use these to wage campaigns and ensure there are repercussions for the actions they took yesterday. Demonstrating in defense of rapists and making campus hostile to survivors should not go unanswered. At the same time, students should prepare for backlash,  the blog post reads.  Already, one student is facing harassment and threats because of a video circulating from yesterday. Students should expect to organize solidarity campaigns against targeted harassment, and begin securing their own information to avoid harassment. The group encouraged readers to provide them with personal information on conservative faculty and students at the University of Texas at Austin.This week, a group of students destroyed signs carried by pro-Kavanaugh. The sign destruction was caught on camera and published by Campus Reform. You can watch that video below.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is helping the radical group MoveOn.org group raise money for an  emergency campaign  to  stop  the potential confirmation to the Supreme Court of nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Warren penned a blast email for MoveOn.org, which has been massively backed by billionaire George Soros, asking each supporter to  channel your anger into a weekly donation to MoveOn right now and help win the two most important fights we face right now: stopping Brett Kavanaugh and ending GOP control of Congress. Calling Kavanaugh an  entitled judicial hit man,  Warren used the  emergency campaign  email to sow division:  I m angry that while many women had to relive the worst days of their lives last week, powerful men are doing everything they can to help a powerful man get one of the most powerful jobs in the country. Without a trace of irony that she is raising funds for a group backed by a billionaire, Warren claimed that  the wealthy and well connected believe they are entitled to power. They are used to getting their way.  But we know how to confront the entitled and the powerful,  the senator continued.  Our voices, together, have turned a confirmation that Washington had considered a shoe-in into one that we still have a fighting chance to head off. And our votes, together, can rip power away from Republicans in just 33 short days. Warren petitioned:  Chip in $3 a week to MoveOn s emergency campaign to stop Kavanaugh, turn Congress blue, and start organizing for 2020. As Breitbart News reported, activist Robert Reich, who served as Bill Clinton s Secretary of Labor, sent out a blast email on behalf of MoveOn.org on Thursday stating the group s anti-Kavanaugh plot is set to include  direct actions in Washington, D.C., at Senate office buildings, including busing in constituents from key states.  MoveOn.org has taken center stage in opposing Kavanaugh, sponsoring rallies and leading a #StopKavanaugh campaign aimed at mobilizing supporters to call their senators in opposition to Kavanaugh s nomination.On Saturday, Politico reported on progressive groups, including MoveOn.org, making a  last-minute push to stop Kavanaugh. Besides funding from Soros, MoveOn.org has also been financed by the Tides Foundation, a leftwing sponsorship organization that has itself received donations from Soros and has partnered with Soros s Open Society Foundations.Aaron Klein is Breitbart s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Marsha Blackburn s (R-TN) Democrat opponent Phil Bredesen announced his support Friday morning for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation. Presidents have the right to appoint justices who share their valueselections have consequences.  I believe a Senator s responsibility to advise and consent  is not a license to indulge in partisanship, but should focus on the qualifications of the nominee, their ethics and their temperament,  Bredesen s statement reads.  I believed that Judge Kavanaugh initially met this test, and I was prepared to say yes  to his nomination prior to Dr. Ford s coming forward.  While the subsequent events make it a much closer call, and I am missing key pieces of information that a sitting Senator has, I m still a yes.  The Democrat Senate candidate referred to Ford as a  heroine  and said the treatment of the California psychology professor who recently leveled a decades-old allegation of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh, as  disgusting,  adding that he is  determined to help bring about a fairer and far more respectful treatment of these issues. Bredesen statement comes after the full Senate voted in favor of advancing Kavanaugh s confirmation into its final phase. In a surprising move, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) voted yes on cloture for Kavanaugh s confirmation.In a Thursday interview with Al-Jazeera, Manchin signaled he would decide whether to vote in favor of Kavanaugh based on the judge s public service record   not the FBI s investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct. I am looking at the gentleman as an adult from 22 to 53, thirty-one years of professional service,  he told the Qatar-based news outlet.  I am looking at him as a father. As a person in a community, how he interacts with his community. I am trying to put the human side to it. Judge Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court passed 51-49. Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Susan Collins voted in support of Kavanaugh, while Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) broke with her Republican colleagues with a  no  vote.

We ll either state that facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the Senate. The mob can attack and the Senate caves,  he said.  Or we ll stand up and say that serious, thoughtful, fact-based deliberation will still define this body. The Senate majority leader made his remarks on the Senate floor ahead of the cloture vote on Friday morning. The vote passed 51-49.McConnell urged Senators to focus on fact-based evidence instead of uncorroborated allegations, reminding them of the  pivotal day  in the Senate. The ideals of justice that have served our nation so well, for so long, are on full display,  he said.McConnell reviewed the left-wing process of the Kavanaugh accusations, calling them  disgraceful.  He slammed the Senate for focusing on Kavanaugh s  goofy jokes  in a yearbook and his beer-drinking days in high school and college. This is our approach to confirming a Supreme Court Justice? This is the Senate s contribution to public discourse?  McConnell asked in disbelief.He pointed to all of the accusers who recanted their accusations, despite the  Keystone cops  trying to dig up more mud on Kavanaugh. The uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say around here,  McConnell said.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/10/05/sen-jones-kavanaughs-op-ed-was-disingenuous/","Friday on CNN s  New Day,  Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL)  said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s Wall Street Journal op-ed  apologizing for his emotional testimony was  disingenuous. On Kavanaugh s op-ed, Jones said,  It was certainly not persuasive. I think what was persuasive was his testimony the other day which was clearly not off the cuff, which was clearly emotional and it should be. If this did not happen he should vigorously defend himself. He went beyond that. He went into partisan attacks, personal attacks on some senators, totally inappropriate, showing a temperament that is unbecoming a judge, much less a Supreme Court nominee. I think the op-ed piece was trying to throw a little cold water on that. But that is very, very serious. It s one that helped tip the balance for me. He added,   I thought it was somewhat disingenuous because it appeared it was more off the cuff when he was reading. He had clearly had set this out. He set the tone. He knew exactly what he was going to say and he knew exactly the emotions. If he didn t then that s I think more of a problem. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/10/05/late-night-hosts-criticize-fbi-kavanaugh-investigation/","Late-night hosts slammed the FBI s handling of a probe into allegations against President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, describing the investigation as being handled with a  no-toothed comb. On Thursday, it emerged that the FBI background check into Kavanaugh s teenage years found  no corroboration of the allegations of sexual misconduct  against the judge, much to the dismay of left-wing activists attempting to torpedo his nomination.On Late Night, Seth Meyers complained that the FBI had made no real effort to corroborate the allegations against him. They didn t even interview Kavanaugh or Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, they really went over this thing with a no-toothed comb,  Meyers said.  And when they were investigating the other allegations against Kavanaugh they made it clear that they had no intention of talking to people who actually might have more information. Over on Late Show, Stephen Colbert also mocked an apparent lack of effort from the FBI. Republicans seem satisfied,  he said.  Maine s Susan Collins says, It appears to be a very thorough investigation.  No, it doesn t, Susan! They interviewed nine people over five days. I ve had more thorough investigations to find my AirPods! The increasingly political Jimmy Fallon also bemoaned the number of people interviewed during the investigation. A lot of people were surprised the FBI took less than a week to conduct their investigation,  he quipped.  I m not saying the FBI investigation was short but Trump lasted longer with Stormy Daniels.  It s crazy, this is for a seat on the Supreme Court,  he added.  You talk to more than nine people when you order a burrito at Chipotle. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x556j280-egMeanwhile, Daily Show host Trevor Noah seemed despondent at the increasing likelihood that Kavanaugh s nomination will be confirmed. I m an optimist, but it doesn t seem like there s much anybody can do besides wait and see,  he said.  We may as well go out and get drunk, like Brett Kavanaugh, and try to forget that this ever happened, like Brett Kavanaugh.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/gops-lisa-murkowski-endangers-kavanaugh-confirmation/","Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) unexpectedly broke with her party Friday and voted against ending debate on Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, reinserting doubts over his final confirmation.The rest of the Republican Senate caucus   including the two other Republicans who have most publicly wavered on Kavanaugh, Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Susan Collins (R-ME)   voted for  cloture,  to end debate and set up a final Saturday floor vote on Kavanaugh s fate. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) joined with Republicans, yielding 51 total votes and avoiding the need for Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie despite Murkowski s last-minute break. This has truly been the most difficult decision that I ve ever had to make,  Murkowski told reporters, according to Reuters.  I believe he s a good man. It just may be that in my view, he s not the right man for the court at this time. The fourth-term senator has long fostered a reputation as one of the Senate s most liberal Republicans. Throughout the Democrats  ongoing attempt to derail Judge Kavanaugh s nomination, Murkowski has kept her cards close to her chest. Last week, she joined Flake and other reputed undecideds in supporting a seventh FBI background investigation of Judge Kavanaugh to focus on allegations of teenage sexual misconduct. Last Wednesday, she told CNN that such a probe  would sure clear up all the questions, wouldn t it? That FBI investigation made its final report available to senators on Thursday. All reports indicate it contained no corroboration of any of the allegations against Kavanaugh.Nevertheless, Murkowski joined with Democrats in Friday s cloture vote. The move places Kavanaugh s confirmation, which had appeared very likely, in serious jeopardy. There is no indication Murkowski will change her vote to a yes in the final floor vote.With Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) potentially unable to vote Saturday due to his daughter s Montana wedding, Republicans may now need Manchin to cross the aisle again to ensure confirmation, even assuming the other unannounced Republican vote   Collins, who voted for cloture but will not announce her final voting intentions until Friday afternoon   falls their way.Murkowski s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding her cloture vote.Breitbart News s Sean Moran contributed to the reporting in this article.

Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) broke ranks and voted no, meaning that only 50 Republicans voted yes. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) crossed party lines to vote yes, giving cloture a thin 51-49 majority and setting up a final confirmation vote Saturday.Both Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Susan Collins (R-ME), who were previously undecided, voted yes on cloture. However, neither has yet indicated whether he or she will vote to confirm Kavanaugh. (Collins will announce her vote at 3 p.m. ET.)If both Flake and Collins vote no, then Brett Kavanaugh s nomination will be defeated. Likewise, if Manchin votes against confirmation. But if Flake votes yes and Collins votes no, and both Murkoswki and Manchin stay in their respective columns, then there will be a 50-50 tie and the vice president will have to be called in to cast the deciding vote. If he does, it would be the first time in the history of the Supreme Court that a vice president has cast a deciding tiebreaker vote for confirmation.Pence anticipated that he might have to do so nearly a month ago, well before Christine Blasey Ford s uncorroborated claims of sexual assault had been launhed. He acknowledged, in a Sep. 9 interview with CBS News  Face the Nation, that he could be called in to cast his vote. However, he said,  Well, we hope not. We ll see where we are. He tweeted Friday morning, following the cloture vote:Today, a majority in the Senate voted to advance the nomination of a good person & a great intellect to #SCOTUS  Judge Brett Kavanaugh.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/10/05/molly-ringwald-the-republican-party-is-the-rape-party/","Actress Molly Ringwald, the one-time 1980s teen bombshell, has proclaimed the Republican Party the  rape party. Like so many of her Hollywood peers, Ringwald has taken to becoming a Twitter warrior and on Thursday the Sixteen Candles actress jumped to her Twitter account to pass judgment on the Republican Party. It s no longer the Republican Party to me. It s the Rape Party,  she tweeted.It s no longer the Republican Party to me. It s the Rape Party.  Molly Ringwald (@MollyRingwald) October 4, 2018If Ringwald thought she would find a safe space on Twitter, though, she has been disabused of that notion with the hundreds of replies to her tweet taking her to task for her ignorant name calling.It also seems that Ringwald has forgotten that her side of the political aisle has its own  rape party  problems. What with Bill Clinton as its ringleader, the Democrats have such stellar persons as Democrat mega-donor Harvey Weinstein, Anthony Weiner, Ted Kennedy, Keith Ellison, Daniel Inouye, and a host of other lesser-known Democrats such as Donny Ray Williams, Brock Adams, Mel Reynolds, Fred Richmond, and many others, all having rape accusations (and in some cases convictions) hanging over them.Ringwald was also upset that her friend, comedienne Amy Schumer, was arrested for disturbing the peace in Washington D.C. on Thursday.
 Protest and get arrested? This is what Fascism looks like,  she tweeted.Protest and get arrested? This is what Fascism looks like.https://t.co/Y4DrVnHmVt  Molly Ringwald (@MollyRingwald) October 4, 2018Many have recently pointed out that Ringwald s own motion picture oeuvre from the 1980s may be a bit suspect. After all, many of her 80s films celebrated teen drinking, sexual promiscuity, and drug use. Indeed, even the actress herself recently noted that some of her past films are morally suspect. Having children of her own gave her a  different perspective,  apparently.But Ringwald is hardly alone with her dip into hardcore, left-wing politics during this Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process.Actor John Leguizamo had a Twitter meltdown this week, saying that the Republican Party is filled with  sexual assaulters  and  pedophiles. ABC s The View host Joy Behar also recently said that the GOP message to boys is that they are allowed to be  gropers  if they grow up to be powerful.Twitter warrior Alissa Milano chimed in, as well, informing MSNBC of her delicate mental state because she is  filled with rage  that the GOP is  institutionalizing sexual abuse.

Ben Sasse is voting yes on Judge Brett Kavanaugh pic.twitter.com/S0vmmUsx8C  Samantha-Jo Roth (@SamanthaJoRoth) October 5, 2018 I m voting for confirmation because of the evidence and Judge Kavauagh s qualifications. After spending more than 150 hours doing my homework, I complete my reading of the FBI s seventh background investigation this morning,  Sasse said in a statement.  This broken and politized process has further undermined public trust. Washington embarrassed itself for the last month, but it is clear that most Americans are yearning for more than tribal blood feuds. The announcement comes after Sasse delivered an emotional Senate floor speech Wednesday evening in which the Nebraska senator took aim at both Democrats and Republicans for their handling of Kavanaugh s confirmation process. A Supreme Court confirmation vote isn t a grand choice about whether we love our daughters or whether we trust our sons,  said Sasse.  That is not the choice before us. This is a consent decision about one person for one seat. Sasse, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, also took aim at the president s remarks about Christine Blasey Ford, the California psychology professor who last month brought forth a decades-old sexual misconduct allegation against the Supreme Court nominee.  We all know that the president cannot lead us through this time,  the lawmaker said.  We know he is dispositionally unable to restrain his impulse to divide us. In an opinion-editorial published Thursday evening, Breitbart News s senior legal editor, Ken Klukowski, called on Sasse to put his issues with President Trump s America First agenda and brash personal system aside and vote to confirm Kavanaugh, or risk  blowing up the Supreme Court.  Sasse understands the Madisonian Dilemma from The Federalist No. 51, that if men were angels, no government would be necessary, but because those who serve in government are not angels either, the power of government must be constrained,  wrote Klukowski.  One of those constraints Madison identifies is the separation of powers, and another is federalism.

The League urges the Senate to vote NO! #CancelKavanaugh https://t.co/43cJnQPylq  LWV of the US (@LWV) October 4, 2018It also issued a press release Friday touting Kase s arrest, specifically citing the need to influence the midterm elections: Opposing a Supreme Court nominee was an extraordinary step for the League, and our leadership believed that we needed to back those words with action. This situation is too important to sit silently while the independence of our judiciary is threatened,  said Kase, who was hired as CEO in July.  I may be new to the League, but this organization was founded by the women who fought for women s suffrage. They marched in the streets, disrupted the status quo, and, yes, faced arrest and punishment to advance their cause. We honor their legacy by participating in our democracy through this civil disobedience. Last week the board of directors took bold steps for the organization in calling for a complete FBI investigation into all allegations of sexual misconduct and Thursday they went a step farther in officially urging the Senate to reject Judge Kavanaugh s nomination. The process of the Kavanaugh hearings is unlike anything we have seen in the League s 98 years,  said Chris Carson, president of the League.  This nominee has demonstrated that he does not possess fair and unbiased judicial temperament. I am proud of Virginia and our members across the country who are standing with her. On Thursday the League went a step farther by participating in the protests. I want to take the fear out of activism,  said Kase.  This is our Capitol. These are our Senators. This is our government. It is an honor to participate in our democracy and to live our mission: Empowering Voters. Defending democracy.  This is a critical moment for American women,  said Carson.  With midterms a few weeks away, this is the right time and the right moment to take a stand. Women s voices will be heard all across the country and they will be the deciding factor in 2018. A Harvard/Harris poll released earlier this week showed that 31% of women who are registered to vote want to see Kavanaugh confirmed. 44% of female registered voters oppose his confirmation, and 24% are undecided.Joel B.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/joe-biden-trump-supporters-have-cultish-devotion/","Former Vice President Joe Biden told Democrats at Cal State Fullerton on Thursday that supporters of President Donald Trump have a  cultish devotion  to their leader, choosing  party over country  in supporting Judge Brett Kavanaugh.The Los Angeles Times reported: The truth itself is being thrown aside in favor of a cultish devotion to the whims of one man,  Biden told hundreds of campaign volunteers Thursday at a Cal State Fullerton rally, citing the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Look at the behavior of Republican senators during the recent testimony of Judge Kavanaugh. Look at the behavior of this president every day,  he said.  Lies have never been more brazen. Blind rage and brute partisanship has never been more palpable. Biden, who is still considered a dark horse candidate for president in 2020 despite repeated denials, visited California this week to fundraise for Democrats and to campaign for the party s congressional candidates. The Associated Press reported that candidates from five competitive districts attended the rally. Biden also reportedly told attendees that the upcoming midterm elections were  much bigger than politics  Our humanity is being tested. The former vice president s criticism of a Trump  cult  echoes recent claims by Hollywood actress and activist Alyssa Milano that Trump uses a  cult-like force  to communicate with supporters.Ironically, Biden s criticism echoes criticism of then-President Barack Obama, who spoke of his own election as  the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal,  and whose supporters followed him with a quasi-religious devotion, portraying him as a spiritual  Lightworker.  Some journalists even compared Obama to God.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News. He is a winner of the 2018 Robert Novak Journalism Alumni Fellowship.

McLean s lawyer denied the claim.Keyser was one of three witnesses, in addition to Kavanaugh himself, who denied Ford s claim that he and friend Mark Judge had assaulted her at a high school party in the 1980s. Her lawyer wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee last month:  Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford. When Rachel Mitchell, the Arizona sex crimes prosecutor appointed by the committee s GOP majority to lead questioning in last week s public hearing, asked Ford about Keyser s denial, Ford claimed that her friend had  significant health challenges  and that Keyser had texted her to apologize for her contrary testimony and offer support. (One of Keyser s relatives later told the UK Daily Mail angrily that Ford had thrown her lifelong friend  under the bus. )In a subsequent interview with the FBI, conducted as part of the week-long supplemental background investigation requested by the Senate, Keyser reiterated that she did not know Kavanaugh and did not know anything about the alleged high school party.The Journal noted that despite McLean s alleged effort to influence Keyser,  There is no indication Dr. Ford and her legal team were involved in any effort to discuss Ms. Keyser s statement with her. McLean is a former FBI agent who is said to have worked as a spokesperson for Prett Bharara, a former staffer for Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) who went on to become the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York until he was fired by President Donald Trump shortly after the latter took office in 2017.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/midterm-election/2018/10/05/blue-state-blues-chuck-schumer-democrats-are-sounding-scarier-than-trump/","Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) seems to think the 1990s never ended. For the second time this year, he has called on the Democrats  playbook from the Clinton era. And for the second time, he has failed, spectacularly.In January, Schumer shut down the federal government, hoping to win as President Bill Clinton won in 1995-6, only to surrender without gaining anything. Now, just before the midterm elections, his effort to recreate the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill outrage is backfiring.Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)   who hopes to become Speaker of the House again if Democrats win in November   have shown Americans exactly how Capitol Hill would run if they were in charge. Obstruction, protests, left-wing mobs   and, worst of all, the attempted humiliation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, an upright man and devoted public servant.Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition, but that s what the Democrats have on their agenda if they retake Congress.The 2018 midterms were supposed to be all about President Donald Trump and his  style. Then Schumer s team turned the Kavanaugh hearings into the Salem witch trials, and now Democrats sound worse than the president   even to people who hate his rhetoric.That is the reality beneath the striking new poll numbers that show Republican voter enthusiasm surging to match Democrats . Suddenly Republicans have a fighting chance to keep the House, and red-state Democrats are in trouble in key Senate races.There is more at work here than male voters suddenly feeling vulnerable, or feeling empathy for Kavanaugh in his torment. The electorate as a whole has watched Democrats trash basic principles of justice and destroy a good man for political gain.To many   if not most   Americans, that is far scarier, on a personal level, than Trump insulting the Attorney General or insulting journalists.If the principle of  innocent until proven guilty  is destroyed, then none of us is safe from the state.Democrats made their own bed here, in two ways. First, they tried to turn the Kavanaugh hearings into a catalyst for another  Year of the Woman,  which Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has been conjuring since the #metoo movement first appeared on the scene in 2017.Feinstein, who withheld Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s accusations until after the formal confirmation hearings were over, has played a key role in this debacle   one that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) now says must be fully investigated.Second, Democrats have been telling the world for five years that the criminal justice system is fundamentally broken   that cops shoot African-Americans and Latinos with little hesitation and few consequences; that our courts treat poor and minority defendants worse than white defendants; and that private prison operators scheme to keep the flow of inmates high.These claims, true or not, have been effective: they are chiefly responsible for the steep decline in race relations that began in 2013.Brett Kavanaugh is a son of privilege and is already, on the D.C. Circuit, one of the most powerful and esteemed judges in the whole system. But Democrats have been so successful in popularizing the idea that justice is basically a matter of politics and prejudice that it is not hard to see him, sitting before the Senate Judiciary Committee, as a victim, like others.Indeed, nothing has been so persuasive on that point as the spectacle of watching Kavanaughlife nearly ruined in mere days over an unproven accusation.At Schumer s urging, Democrats have pushed ahead, knowing that their base in the so-called  Resistance  wants to see them fight hard. At first, Democrats  tactics were merely disruptive   like coordinating with each other to interrupt the confirmation hearing, or defending the protesters  absurd outbursts from the gallery.But when Democrats started hyping Ford s allegations   coordinating with activist lawyers and the liberal media   they unleashed something much more frightening, recalling the worst days of the McCarthy hearings.Schemer promoted the vicious lie that Kavanaugh faced  multiple, corroborated allegations.  None of the allegations has been corroborated   in fact, they have been contradicted by all the key witnesses.The left tried to laugh when Graham   for years, a voice for bipartisanship in judicial confirmations   finally had enough, and told Democrats the truth to their faces: that they had destroyed the system for the sake of power.Leftists took snapshots of an angry Graham, in mid-tirade, and called him the  hideous hateful face  of male intolerance. They failed to realize they were looking at their own reflection.It should have been hard to outdo Trump for fear. But Democrats did it   and now Republicans now have a chance.They can thank Schumer, who forgot what Republicans learned the hard way in 1998: voters don t like inquisitions.Joel B.

Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said history would not be kind to Republicans in the Senate who hide behind the FBI expanded investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Boxer said,  All those years ago when I came in the year of the woman, you know, in 1992 when I got elected, this goes back to Anita Hill. Whenever there is a woman who comes forward, very credible, very believable, she gets treated horribly. Now, they tried not to do that to Dr. Ford. But all that broke down. She added,  They even had a woman assistant to question her, as Mitch McConnell called her. It was ridiculous. Guess what happened then? There were corroborating witnesses who would have said, yes, Anita is right, Professor Hill is right, and they were cooling their heels. What do we have here? Forty people at my count as I read all the news reports, including NBC, who were waiting to corroborate exactly what the two women who came forward said. And they were left cooling their heels. This is not justice, and so it s more than even the partisanship. There is such a thing as right and wrong. This is really about a woman and yet a second woman who came forward and said this man hurt me. And the first thing the Republicans did was this make-believe investigation, you know, a wink and a nod investigation, Jeff Flake, Sue Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who wisely called for an investigation, should not hide behind it because history will not treat them kindly. The truth has a way of coming out. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Steve Daines (R-MT) spoke with Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday evening to assure the judge that he will there in the U.S. Senate on Saturday if his vote is needed to confirm Kavanaugh as the next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Breitbart News has learned.Daines  daughter s wedding is on Saturday, and he intends to walk her down the aisle at her wedding. But if needed, as Breitbart News has learned per a source close with Sen. Daines, the senator has assured Kavanaugh that there is a plane standing by to transport him to the U.S. Senate to confirm Kavanaugh on Saturday night.GOP MT Sen Daines tells Kavanaugh  he has made arrangements to be there to get him across the finish line as needed.  Daines initially said he may miss the Sat confirmation vote. Daines s vote is essential to get the math to work. Daines s daughter is getting married in MT Sat pic.twitter.com/5naEq36edR  Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) October 5, 2018Daines also spoke with President Donald Trump s eldest son, Donald Trump, Jr., and made the same assurances   that if his vote is needed for final confirmation, a plane is standing by, and he will be there.On Thursday evening, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set the schedule in the U.S. Senate on Friday morning for a contentious cloture vote to clear the deck for a final confirmation vote on Saturday, it was reported that Daines would not be in the Senate on Saturday due to his daughter s wedding.#BREAKING @SteveDaines has a scheduling conflict this weekend. He says he ll be walking his daughter down the aisle at her Montana wedding, regardless of the #KavanaughVote that could take place this weekend. #NBCMontana #mtpol #mtnews #Kavanaugh  Maritsa Georgiou (@MaritsaNBCMT) October 4, 2018The news of Daines not being there on Saturday came less than an hour before Mitch McConnell announced the cloture vote on Friday:The Senate will be in session at 9:30 tomorrow morning. Under the regular order, the vote to advance the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court will be at 10:30.  Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) October 4, 2018Almost immediately, leftists and media figures rejoiced   thinking it would delay the confirmation vote again or, worse for Kavanaugh, spell doom for his chances at confirmation:HAHAHAHAHA.Congratulations to Steve Daines  daughter, but also Republicans can t confirm Kavanaugh (as they plan to do this weekend) without him. https://t.co/RX0RSnkMwk  Sarah Mimms (@mimms) October 4, 2018https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1047985476827828226A Supreme Court nomination vote being pushed back because it conflicts with Steve Daines  daughter s wedding would be such a perfectly American ending to this saga. https://t.co/A1sBPsDcJ4  Paul McLeod (@pdmcleod) October 4, 2018GOP senator Steve Daines can t give his daughter s reproductive rights away on Saturday because he ll be giving her away to her husband in Montana.I m calling it. Irony is dead. https://t.co/h5q6MO65rW  Kaz Weida (@kazweida) October 4, 2018But, as Breitbart News can report here, the senator spoke with Kavanaugh and has arrangements lined up to make it back in time if necessary on Saturday night   something that may set up a contentious Saturday evening where the vote may be held open for some time. And Daines spoke with Trump Jr., who confirmed the news on Twitter:.@SteveDaines is a good friend and hunting/fishing buddy and as far as his vote this weekend is concerned he tells me he has it covered. Coming from this man you can take that to the bank!  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 5, 2018 Anyone who knows Sen. Daines knows that he is a conservative champion who has fought tooth and nail for all of President Trump s judicial nominees,  Andy Surabian, a senior adviser to Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign and former White House official, told Breitbart News.  He helped lead the fight to confirm Justice Gorsuch and never for a moment wavered on Kavanaugh. So it comes as no surprise to me that if his vote is needed this weekend, he will find a way to be in Washington, DC. Daines  vote may not be needed in the end. Currently, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the U.S. Senate. Kavanaugh only needs a bare minimum of 50 votes to be confirmed, meaning if all other Republicans vote for him while all Democrats vote against him and Daines is absent, he would be confirmed, 50-49. If one Republican breaks against Kavanaugh and all Democrats oppose Kavanaugh s confirmation, Daines  vote would be needed and then Vice President Mike Pence would be standing by to cut a 50-50 tie in the Senate.At this juncture, only a handful of senators remain undecided. Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Ben Sasse (R-NE) comprise the GOP side of undecided senators. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) is the only undecided Democratic senator.Sasse is, according to his office, leaning yes, and Flake has shown positive signs, as has Collins   while Murkowski has been quieter. Manchin, meanwhile, faces a tough re-election in West Virginia, where his GOP opponent Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has been hammering him on Kavanaugh, putting enormous pressure on the Democrat to back the highly qualified judge for the Supreme Court. It remains to be seen how each will vote.Now that a potential disaster   wherein an absence by Daines would mean Republicans could afford to lose none of the undecided Republicans if Manchin does vote no   has been averted by the Montana Republican s assurances that he has travel arrangements lined up in case of emergency, it means Kavanaugh is on a clearer path to eventual likely confirmation.Steve Daines tells @tedbarrettcnn that he would fly back after the wedding Saturday, arriving early Sunday morning for a confirmation vote if his vote is needed, so they d have to hold the vote open.  I d come back after the wedding.  https://t.co/I7uyxPSNbo  Manu Raju (@mkraju) October 5, 2018It would, in the end, however, mean more drama in the U.S. Senate as the vote would remain open late into the evening Saturday until potentially early Sunday.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/why-undecided-senators-should-vote-to-confirm-kavanaugh/","Jeff Flake and Ben Sasse are NeverTrump, but they have always called for limited government and faithfully interpreting the Constitution.With the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh discredited, confirming him to the Supreme Court would be the greatest victory for limited constitutional government those senators could ever deliver, advancing their vision for America s future. It could create the first conservative Court in decades.Flake and Sasse come from different backgrounds and focus on different priorities. But for each of them, the issues they ran for office to advance would take a quantum leap forward with Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court.For Flake, ever since his days as the executive director of the Goldwater Institute in Phoenix, his focus has been on a federal government of limited reach, on deregulation, and on free-market economics.For Sasse, it is a more philosophical matter of a government that strictly adheres to the Constitution, and nurturing a culture of private morality and public virtue.The reality is this: There has not been a broad-based conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court for decades. It is likely that Kavanaugh will be the crucial fifth vote to give life to Flake and Sasse s vision. It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for them.Flake understands that limited government endures only when people govern themselves. His statements throughout almost 20 years in public office contemplate the reality that government is legitimized coercion, and so the scope of government needs to be limited in order for people to be free to pursue opportunity and raise their families as they see fit.Sasse understands the Madisonian Dilemma from The Federalist No. 51, that if men were angels, no government would be necessary, but because those who serve in government are not angels either, the power of government must be constrained. One of those constraints Madison identifies is the separation of powers, and another is federalism.Both senators extol Thomas Jefferson s belief that America s republican system enshrined in the Constitution requires  virtuous citizens  to succeed, where values are instilled in the next generation and people act as individuals and families in an honorable and productive fashion, with faith in something greater than self and living a life in pursuit of noble aspirations.Kennedy was often the deciding vote on cases that abandoned free market policies or the Constitution s structural safeguards of liberty. For both Flake and Sasse, Kavanaugh s replacing Kennedy could become a dream come true.For example, in 2005 Kennedy was the fifth vote in Kelo v. New London, where the Supreme Court held that government can seize a private home to give to a developer who demolishes the house to build a strip mall. Conservatives dissented, saying the Constitution s Takings Clause only permits the government to take property for public purposes (like building roads), and only if the owner receives fair market value.And in 2007, Kennedy was the fifth vote in Massachusetts v. EPA, where the Court held that a state has standing to sue the federal government to force the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate CO2 as a pollutant. The conservative justices argued that even if global warming is happening and is caused by human activity, regulating every U.S. source of CO2 leaves 80 percent of greenhouse emissions worldwide untouched, and therefore that Article III of the Constitution does not give federal courts jurisdiction to decide these matters.On these and many other issues, a Justice Kavanaugh would restore the rule of law and give full force to constitutional rights. He is an originalist, who believes in interpreting the Constitution according to the original public meaning of its provisions, and a textualist who believes that federal laws must be interpreted according to the clear meaning of their text, regardless of the judge s policy preferences.At the same time, Kavanaugh s confirmation would not imperil priorities for moderate senators, so they too should feel comfortable voting for him.Kavanaugh s confirmation does not endanger Obamacare. He replaces Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted with the three solidly conservative justices to strike down the Affordable Care Act entirely. The fifth vote to save Obamacare came from a moderate-conservative, Chief Justice John Roberts, who is not going anywhere.Nor should Kavanaugh s confirmation give Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) or Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) pause. Only one sitting justice Justice Clarence Thomas  has said he would overrule Roe v. Wade, and there is little reason to think that with Kavanaugh there would be a five-justice majority to do so.But regarding the scope of federal power and the role of government, Kavanaugh s confirmation would pave the way to keep the courts out of the debate between policymakers and businesses, to permit states and local communities to take the lead on issues where the Constitution does not put Washington, DC, in charge, and to give full effect to enumerated constitutional rights such as free speech, religious liberty, and the Second Amendment.These undecided senators need to resist the temptation to think that if Kavanaugh were voted down, President Trump would nominate someone they like even better. To the contrary, a failed Supreme Court nomination is a kidney punch to any presidency.Aside from the tax cuts, Republicans and conservatives think that the only worthwhile thing Senate Republicans manage to do is confirm President Trump s excellent judges. It is possible that a failed nomination could supercharge the Right to show up to increase their Senate margin. It is more likely that voters would decide that Senate Republicans are pathetic, GOP turnout would collapse, and Democrats could take charge of the upper chamber.Should that happen, then Kennedy s seat would stay open until January 2021 after the next presidential inauguration. If an additional seat opens up, then the Court would continue with only seven justices, instead of eight or nine. Federal law requires only six justices for the Court to have a quorum to decide cases. Expect Democrats to cite that law as justification for blocking nominees as vacancies occur.Even if Flake, Sasse, or other senators are undecided in part because they do not get along with the president, they must realize that blowing up the Supreme Court  and with it the first chance in decades to restore key constitutional rights and safeguards  is not the way to vent their frustration. And the Kavanaughs are a beautiful family who deserve better, in any event.The Senate should confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

In the email, MoveOn.org, which has been massively backed by billionaire George Soros, warned the group s anti-Kavanaugh plot is set to include  direct actions in Washington, D.C., at Senate office buildings, including busing in constituents from key states. The radical organization also wrote in the email it was planning to:Escalate pressure on key senators, especially Susan Collins. Collins is the key swing vote in this process, and MoveOn is continuing to lift up stories from her constituents, support direct actions in Maine, and purchase ads in her state calling for her to stand with survivors, defend reproductive rights, and stop Kavanaugh.Hold Republicans accountable. We will not forget their party s actions at last week s hearing, their unwavering support for Kavanaugh, and their attempts to discredit Dr. Blasey Ford and others when we head to the ballot box in five weeks. Ending GOP control of Congress and electing people who believe survivors. We will end GOP control of Congress and elect people who believe survivors and listen to women because the fight for our fundamental rights is essential. Will you chip in $3 right now and help support MoveOn s emergency campaign to stop Brett Kavanaugh?  the email asked.The blast email smeared Kavanaugh as an  accused sexual predator and right-wing anti-woman, anti-LGBTQ partisan.  If this isn t a sham investigation, I don t know what is,  Reich wrote of the wrapped-up FBI investigation which Democrats themselves had demanded despite the Senate already taking statements from key individuals. In less than a week, Trump, McConnell, and Kavanaugh have managed to make a mockery of the Senate, the FBI, and the Supreme Court,  Reich complained.The ideologue did not mention accusations that the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), deliberately held back for weeks Christine Blasey Ford s allegation and then deployed the charges for political purposes. Beyond that, this charade is an insult to the women of America,  Reich added, failing to mention that the news media s publication of Ford s name seemingly doxed Kavanaugh s female accuser against her wishes.MoveOn.org has taken center stage in opposing Kavanaugh, leading a #StopKavanaugh campaign aimed at mobilizing supporters to call their senators in opposition to Kavanaugh s nomination.On Saturday, Politico reported on progressive groups, including MoveOn.org, making a  last-minute push to stop Kavanaugh. Besides funding from Soros, MoveOn.org has also been financed by the Tides Foundation, a leftwing sponsorship organization that has itself received donations from Soros and has partnered with Soros s Open Society Foundations.Aaron Klein is Breitbart s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/rrepublicans-look-strong-in-competitive-florida-house-races/","Republican candidates are looking strong in the seven competitive House races in districts represented by GOP members in Florida, a key battleground state won by Donald Trump in 2016.That bullish outlook comes from President Trump s rising popularity in the state, an energized base reacting to the Democrat smearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh,  and potential coat tails from two strong candidates at the top of the ballot in key statewide races: Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican nominee challenging incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) in the Senate race, and former Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL-06), who is battling left wing Democrat nominee Andrew Gillum in the gubernatorial contest.Democrats need to pick up at least three seats from Republicans in Florida s 27 member delegation in the House of Representatives in order to have the best chance of obtaining the net gain of 23 seats they need to take back the majority there, but barely five weeks from election day, they are not favored to pick up a single district in Florida.Only eight of the state s 27 Congressional races are competitive, according to the Cook Political Report s most recent rating of competitive House races. One of those competitive racesthe 7th Congressional Districtis currently held by a Democrat, while seven are currently held by Republicans.In July, Breitbart News identified these seven GOP-held competitive seats in Florida as among the 61 GOP-held competitive seats Republicans must win in November (along with flipping three Democrat-held seats) in order to maintain a majority in the House of Representatives.Now in the first week of October, two and a half months later, not a single one of those seven Republican-held seats are currently rated by the Cook Political Report as as  Likely Democratic  or  Lean Democratic,  though the number of must-win GOP-held seats across the country has increased to 65.One of those seven GOP-held seatsthe 27th Congressional District in Miami, currently represented by Rep. Ilyana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL-27)was rated  Likely Democratic  as recently as July, given its heavily Hispanic demographics.But the narrow Democratic primary victory in August by 77-year-old Donna Shalala, the former Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Bill Clinton administration, and the emergence of a rising Republican star as her general election opponent, former Spanish language broadcaster Maria Elvira Salazar, has catapulted the race from  Likely Democratic  to  Toss-up,  as Breitbart News reported last week.The Sunshine State News reported that Salazar  has been remarkably efficient in using her name strength in Congressional District 27 to her advantage, and has turned this into a competitive race. Salazar also speaks both Spanish and English, while Shalala speaks only English, a key disadvantage for her because  the district is heavily Latino, with 57 percent of the registered voters being Hispanic.  Salazar also has an edge beyond her name advantage   she can campaign comfortably in the area to most audiences because she is bi-lingual; Shalala is not,  the Sunshine State News notedJust as Hillary Clinton failed to generate the requisite enthusiasm among Florida voters to win the state s electoral college votes in the 2016 Presidential election, the enthusiasm gap for Shalala among rank and file Democrats in the 27th Congressional District is palpable.On Thursday the Cook Political Report moved the race in the adjacent 26th Congressional District from  Lean Republican  to  Toss-up,  but, as NBC reported on Wednesday, the only poll that shows the race tied comes from the campaign of his Democratic challenger:The tight race has Cuban-American Republican congressman Carlos Curbelo in a virtual tie with his Democratic challenger, Ecuadorian-born Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, according to a recent poll commissioned by her campaign. Earlier polls had the moderate, two-term lawmaker winning by a wider margin.Curbelo and Mucarsel Powell are campaigning to represent Florida s 26th district, which is 70 percent Latino. It stretches from southwest Miami-Dade, all the way down to Key West and includes parts of the Everglades and the Gulf Coast.The open 15th Congressional District, currently represented by Rep. Dennis Ross (R-FL-15), plus the 16th Congressional District, currently represented by Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-FL-16), are currently rated as  Lean Republican  by the Cook Political Report.Three competitive races in Florida are rated as  Likely Republican  by the Cook Political Report: the 18th Congressional District, where Rep. Brian Mast (R-FL-18) is running for re-election, the 25th Congressional District, where Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL-25) is running for re-election, and the open seat in the 6th Congressional District held by gubernatorial candidate DeSantis.Though the old political saw that  all politics is local,  is often used to describe the outcome of Congressional elections, the 2018 midterms now appear to revolve around a single national question: Do you support the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh by President Trump to serve on the Supreme Court?In Florida, as elsewhere, the answer to that key question, increasingly, appears to be  yes. After a precipitous drop of net job approval ratings from +22 in January 2017 to -1 in July 2017, President Trump s net job approval rating in the state has steadied at +2 in September, according to the Morning Consult Poll.On Thursday, Rasmussen Reports released a new poll that shows nationwide President Trump s job approval rating has reached 50 percent, two points higher than the 48 percent job approval rating former President Obama had at the same point in his first term.The recent jump in Republican enthusiasm nationwide in the past week thanks to the Democrat smear tactics deployed in the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, documented in this NPR/Marist Poll released on Wednesday, is taking place in Florida as well, and that is expected to further strengthen the position of the Republican candidates in these seven competitive races over the next several weeks.As for the top of the ticket in the midterms, the latest polls show that Republican nominee Gov. Rick Scott is moving upwards, and that trend is likely to continue, given incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson s decision to vote no on the Kavanaugh confirmation.A Quinnipiac Poll conducted between September 20 and September 24 showed Nelson leading by seven points. The most recent poll, conducted by Mason Dixon between September 24 and September 27, shows that Nelson s lead has dwindled to one point.Former Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL-06), the Republican nominee for governor, had a rough start after pulling off a bit of an upset in the GOP primary, but he has gained ground in recent weeks as the left wing record of the Democrat nominee, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, has come increasingly to light.Gillum s nine point lead in the Quinnipiac Poll conducted between September 20 and September 24 has dropped to just one point in the Mason Dixon Poll conducted between September 24 and September 27.Democrats are still within striking distance of taking back a majority in the House of Representatives come November.But a little more than five weeks before election day, it appears that they will need to look to states other than Florida to pick up the net gains they need to accomplish that.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/kavanaugh-i-am-an-independent-impartial-judge/","Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Brett Kavanaugh defended his testimony in response to uncorroborated sexual assault allegations and his impartial record as a judge.Against that backdrop, I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend my family, my good name and my lifetime of public service. My hearing testimony was forceful and passionate. That is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me. At times, my testimony both in my opening statement and in response to questions reflected my overwhelming frustration at being wrongly accused, without corroboration, of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record and character. My statement and answers also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled.I was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times. I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said. I hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son, husband and dad. I testified with five people foremost in my mind: my mom, my dad, my wife, and most of all my daughters.Going forward, you can count on me to be the same kind of judge and person I have been for my entire 28-year legal career: hardworking, even-keeled, open-minded, independent and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good. As a judge, I have always treated colleagues and litigants with the utmost respect. I have been known for my courtesy on and off the bench. I have not changed. I will continue to be the same kind of judge I have been for the last 12 years. And I will continue to contribute to our country as a coach, volunteer, and teacher. Every day I will try to be the best husband, dad, and friend I can be. I will remain optimistic, on the sunrise side of the mountain. I will continue to see the day that is coming, not the day that is gone.Read the rest of the story at the Wall Street Journal.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/10/04/sam-rohrer-prayer-america-bbn-tonight/","American Pastors Network (APN) President Sam Rohrer shared a prayer requesting God s assistance to guide Americans back to biblical principles on Wednesday s edition of SiriusXM s Breitbart News Tonight. He offered his invocation at the conclusion of an interview with Breitbart Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.Rohrer appealed,  Our dear heavenly Father who is our creator, the establisher of all that we have, the source of all truth, and the basis upon which this nation was founded, our justice system, our system of law, our separation of power, our understanding of right and wrong, and moral truth, all of those things, Lord, come from you. We recognize that you are the source of that. LISTEN:Rohrer added,  We also recognize, Lord, that as a nation, we once embraced that ideology. We once embraced the concept of absolute truth and accountability to a God who created us, but Lord, we have walked away from it, and as our own courts have done, and many in government have done, we have taken that which you have said to be true and we have made it false. Rohrer continued: We have taken the sacred life given to every person, and we have made it legal to murder those who are in the womb of our moms, and Lord, we have shed innocent blood. We have redefined what marriage is in this country despite what you have said. We have witnessed, increasingly, the embracing of deception rather than truth. Running from accountability into pragmatism of all types. Lord, we have done these things to our harm.He went on:  Now we find ourselves as a nation, in trouble, divided   but divided really along the lines, Lord, not of what the purpose of government necessarily is but really on who You are and what Your role is. Rohrer pleaded: I would pray, Lord, on behalf of our nation that was established on Judeo-Christian principles coming right off of the pages of scripture, engraved right on the buildings and walls of Washington, in our very own state capital, we recognize that, Lord   I would ask that you would have mercy upon us and that we would return to You in the recognition that truth exists, that you are the author of it, and that we have walked away from it. We don t have the answers, Lord, but you do. May we run to the source of truth in these days, and may we with open hands lifted, look to You for the direction to give to us now which we can find in Your word, as our founders and those who went before us knew and followed.Rohrer concluded,  We need your help, Lord. Our country is at risk. The very foundations of government are being threatened. We need help beyond the political. We need help beyond the pundits and the press. We need divine assistance today. We come to you. We pray in your name. Amen. Rohrer described APN s mission:American Pastors Network is a ministry that is geared to and focuses on the pulpit and its role in America on proclaiming the truth. It was the pulpit that actually drove the founding of this nation and built into the framework of our law and nation the Judeo-Christian ideology, which was the basis for our law, and it really is the position from which God has established moral truth and moral authority that underpins our law and justice and all that we ve come to appreciate as freedom in this holy experiment in self-government.America s problems will not be solved entirely through politics, warned Rohrer. I also believe, that without a doubt, the political office is not the solution to our problems in America,  said Rohrer.  It really comes from the pulpit, and our relationship and understanding that God is the creator of all that we have and He has established a very clear framework for how the family should function, and the individual, and the church, and civil government; the four institutions of authority.Restoration of America s freedoms must be rooted in a realignment with Judeo-Christian values, assessed Rohrer.Rohrer remarked,  We believe that if there is going to be a return and reclaiming of freedoms already lost in this country, and that which is so tremendously under attack as we see all around us but manifested, I think, in a clear way in this Kavanaugh circumstance. If we don t understand that God has laid out a plan for this nation, we ve been blessed by it, we have departed from it, and unless we return to Him, we stand in great jeopardy of losing all that we have been given. Rohrer linked the battle over Judge Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court linked to metaphysical struggle between good and evil. Now is the time to be standing up with the truth, not to be running from it,  advised Rohrer.  We called for a day of prayer today in regard to the circumstances in Washington because we do believe that this is not just a political struggle that we are watching but that it is literally a spiritual ideological battle between good and evil. it is something we must deal with in a very serious matter, and we think that going to God in prayer is where we must start. Rohrer added,  The example of what we are seeing is the result of rejecting those basic principles that have undergirded our system of justice which was built on biblical principles. Rohrer continued,  Justice, biblically, starts with truth, it is balanced with mercy, and is supplied equitably to all. That s what the bible says, that s also what Lady Justice says in her picture when she s on the Supreme Court building with her eyes covered, the scale is in one hand, truth and mercy there in balance. Our Founders knew that. That s a biblical principle. When that s done, then, in fact, you have justice. Rohrer added,  But what we have been witnessing with this matter in Washington is nothing at all that s related to truth, and it is certainly not being done even in keeping with the protocols of our own law, let alone what biblical principles would say about that. Roher said,  No accusation was ever to be entertained from one person against another only from the mouth of one witness. It had to be established in the mouths of two or three witnesses   who had to be corroborated   in agreement. Two or three witnesses had to say the same thing. Rohrer referenced Deuteronomy 19:15 and subsequent verses related to biblical standards for the consideration of witnesses alleging crimes against others. The purpose of [authorities consulting witnesses] would be to determine the veracity of the claim, of the allegation, to determine where or not the witness was, in fact, legitimate and truthful,  explained Rohrer. Rohrer continued,  It would determine whether there was truth or error, whether or not it was a false witness or a true witness. That did not happen in D.C. It was not about determining the veracity of the witness. It was about how the witness felt and a whole host of other things. Rohrer discussed the importance of determining the veracity of accusations and the presumption of innocence lying with the accused.Rohrer stated: It was so important, in the maintenance of justice, that God told the leaders of Israel that when a false charge was brought up, they were to move swiftly to identify the veracity of the accuser, and the burden of proof was on the accuser, not the accused. And if it was found that that was a false witness, then the law was to be brought against all of the false witnesses, and they were to be given an equivalent penalty to the degree that which they raised the accusation and hoped that the accused would get some kind of punishment.Rohrer added,  God calls it an evil. False accusations are an evil that need to be purged. If it is not done, if it is not purged   and the false witnesses and those that co-conspire along with it   actually given the penalty of law that they wish to heap on someone else, if that does not happen, the justice system completely falls apart. Rohrer warned,  Our entire justice system is being threatened and many of our own caretakers   our senators and others   seem to care little about that. That s a frightening thing.

Penny Starr/Breitbart News We Believe Survivors  buttons were prevalent, a theme that emerged after Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her decades ago at a high school party.Penny Starr/Breitbart NewsHer claim came after the judiciary committee heard 30-plus hours of testimony during Kavanaugh s confirmation hearing, resulting in an additional hearing for Ford s testimony and Kavanaugh s response to it.Penny Starr/Breitbart NewsThat hearing spurred a seventh FBI background check on Kavanaugh, who has been in public service for decades, and FBI background checks on others Ford claimed were involved in the long-ago incident, including high school friend Mark Judge. Judge has already given two sworn statements under penalty of felony that stated he does not recall the party or Kavanaugh assaulting Ford.Penny Starr/Breitbart NewsAfter the final FBI investigation found no corroboration for Ford s claims, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on Wednesday launched the final round of the confirmation battle, filing for cloture to ensure a final vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation by the end of the week.Penny Starr/Breitbart NewsThe organizers of the protest are the same left-wing organizations that have opposed Trump since he was elected in 2016 and are using the ongoing demonstrations to raise funds for their cause and register Democratic voters, including: the George Soros-funded moveon.org; the Women s March, co-founded by anti-Semite and anti-Israel Linda Sarsour; Planned Parenthood; and Black Lives Matter.Video also shows protesters chasing and screaming at Sen.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/democrats-furious-after-fbi-probe-clears-kavanaugh-cover-up-sham-whitewash/","Democrat senators are livid Thursday, decrying the FBI s probe into uncorroborated sexual misconduct allegations against the judge as a  cover-up  and a  sham,  as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation moves into its final stages.Speaking before reporters earlier Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Judiciary Committee member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) criticized the FBI s decision to leave Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford off its list of interviewees, blaming the White House, without citing any evidence, for what they described as a  limited  probe. [W]hat I can say is that the most notable part of this report is what s not in it. As we noted by the White House, the FBI did not interview Brett Kavanaugh, nor did the FBI interview Dr. Blasey Ford,  Feinstein said.  Candidly, what we reviewed today, in a very limited time, I was there. I had to leave. The report is in parts, and I had the opportunity to read some, but not all of it. It looks to be a product of an incomplete investigation that was limited, perhaps by the White House. I don t know. In the same press conference, Schumer claimed his numerous concerns over the FBI s handling of the investigation had  been realized  and accused the White House of  greatly constrain[ing] the investigation from the get-go.  [W]e had many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts. Having received a thorough briefing on the documents, those fears have been realized,  he said.The lawmaker s concerns were shared by Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), who told CNN s New Day that the expectations of the FBI s investigation were not met.  Over the last couple of days, there s been a fair amount of back and forth about what we asked for, what was promised and now today we ll see what s delivered,  said Coons.  I m concerned that if they never interviewed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford or her corroborating witnesses, if they never interviewed many of Judge Kavanaugh s classmates from Yale who came forward to be heard about the alleged incident with Debbie Ramirez, that this isn t the investigation I was hoping for. Rather than vent to reporters, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) voiced his staunch disapproval of the investigation and, akin to his Democrat colleague Sen. Feinstein, alluded to supposed White House interference in the probe, without laying out any specific examples how.  I read the FBI report. This whole thing is a sham,  Merkley tweeted.  This stunted, strangled investigation was designed to provide cover, not to provide the truth.  Shortly after, the Oregon Democrat referenced the Bureau s conclusion as an example of a  horrific cover-up Failed vice-presidential candidate Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) blasted what he described as a  shame  investigation and complained over measures taken by the FBI to contain details of its findings from leaking to the press.  The whole thing is sham. Five days to do the investigation,  Kaine complained.  And so, here is what they do. There is now a report. One copy. Only one copy that s available in the Senate SCIF. So they don t want 100 senators to read it. I m not allowed to discuss it. The public can t see it. It s a complete sham. Flanked by far-left Islamist activist Linda Sarsour, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) told a raucous crowd of anti-Kavanaugh protesters outside a D.C. federal courthouse that Kavanaugh s impassionate defense against uncorroborated accusations of sexual misconduct disqualified him from the Supreme Court.  I watched that hearing last Thursday, and I believe Dr. Ford,  Warren said before the angry demonstrators.  I watched that hearing last Thursday, and Brett Kavanaugh is disqualified.  I watched 11 men   powerful men   try to help another powerful man make it to another powerful position,  she continued.  This is about hijacking our Democracy. During a conference call with reporters, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, whose pointed questioning of Kavanaugh s integrity has earned scorn from President Donald Trump, characterized the probe as a  whitewash.  It smacks of a cover-up,  the Connecticut Democrat claimed.  I am deeply disappointed, not in the FBI, but the work product here that is the result of straight-jacketing by the White House. Leading up to the Bureau s wrap up of the probe, some Democrats had already begun to downplay its findings as to whether Kavanaugh s confirmation should move to the full Senate. In a press conference, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) demanded Republicans replace Kavanaugh with another candidate, pointing to his testimony as proof that the judge lacks the moral fitness to sit on the United States  highest court. My hope is, beyond the vicious partisan rancor that is going on, beyond the accusations, we don t lose sight of what this moral moment is about in this country, and ultimately ask ourselves the question: is this the right person to sit on the highest court in the land for a lifetime appointment?  Booker told reporters on Capitol Hill.  This is a sacred institution and the people who should be on it   whether you disagree with their political or judicial philosophy at all   the people who should be on the Supreme Court should preserve the integrity of the court, and be beyond the reproach of these difficult partisan times.Despite the outrage expressed by Democrats, committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) affirmed in a statement Thursday that the FBI found  no hint  of sexual assault in Kavanaugh s past and said it was  time to vote  to confirm the judge. There s nothing in it that we didn t already know. These uncorroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by Judge Kavanaugh, and neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations. There s also no contemporaneous evidence,  Grassley said.  This investigation found no hint of misconduct and the same is true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during Judge Kavanagh s 25 years of public service. Despite the outrage expressed by Democrats, Republicans intend to hold a Friday procedural vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation. A cloture motion filed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) just after 10:00 p.m. Wednesday allows Republicans to bring an official vote on judge before the full Senate, the final phase of the confirmation process.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/heidi-heitkamp-will-vote-against-kavanaugh/","Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), trailing by double digits in her reelection campaign, revealed Thursday she will not join Republicans in voting to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.In an interview to air Thursday night on Fargo, North Dakota, ABC affiliate WDAY, Heitkamp put an end to speculation she might vote for President Donald Trump s nominee, as she did last year with now-Justice Neil Gorsuch. At a June campaign rally, Trump predicted Heitkamp would oppose any nominee he picked to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. The process has been bad but, at the end of the day, you have to make a decision, and I ve made that decision,  Heitkamp told WDAY s Kevin Wallevand.  I will be voting no on Judge Kavanaugh. WDAY will air Heitkamp s explanation of her reasoning Thursday evening, only 33 days away from her election showdown with Republican nominee Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND).Heitkamp is a quinessential  red state Democrat,  representing a state President Trump won by more than 35 points in 2016. As such, she kept her options open with regard to the Kavanaugh vote, even after much of the rest of her party coalesced around efforts to defeat his nomination with sexual misconduct allegations.Already facing a tough reelection fight, Heitkamp s seat in the Senate fell into even greater jeopardy when the Kavanaugh affair began to drive Republican voter engagement. As Christine Blasey Ford; her lawyers, Deborah Katz and Michael Bromwich; Deborah Ramirez and the New Yorker reporters who publicized her allegation; Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer; Christine Swetnick and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti; Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats, and the entire left-leaning news media were unable to produce any contemporary corroboration to any of the decades-old allegations against Kavanaugh, polls began to show a groundswell of Republican anger that could decide battleground elections like Heitkamp s.Heitkamp in particular seems to have suffered from the  Kavanaugh effect  in the polls. Two successive polls released this week show Cramer leading the race by double digits, while Heitkamp s North Dakotan constituents want Kavanaugh confirmed by a margin of more than two-to-one.The Cramer campaign, in a statement responding to Heitkamp s decision, seemed to suggest opposing Kavanaugh may be the death knell of her campaign.  LET S BE CLEAR    Heidi Heitkamp just failed North Dakota, and voters know it,  the statement reads.  Given that a majority of her constituents want this exemplary nominee confirmed, Heidi Heitkamp is on the wrong side of history, and this will be the last consequential vote of her career. The Cramer campaign statement also characterizes Heitkamp s decision as a rapprochement with the Democratic Party s more left wing leadership.  The President was right. Heidi Heitkamp just sided with liberals Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to obstruct President Trump and oppose the exceptionally qualified Judge Brett Kavanaugh,  it reads.Heitkamp revealed her decision as news filtered out about the completion of the seventh FBI background investigation into Kavanaugh s past. The new investigation had been a Democratic demand virtually since the first public mention of sexual misconduct allegations from Kavanaugh s high school and college days. The probe was finally granted after Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) conditioned his vote on it, creating another week of delay in confirming Kavanaugh.The White House and Senate Republicans made confident statements Wednesday that the new report shows no new corroboration or evidence of misconduct. The FBI report, however, did nothing to satisfy the Democrats who long insisted on it. Senate Democrats immediately smeared the report as  incomplete,   limited,  and  smack[ing] of a whitewash, even a cover-up.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said his fears of an inadequate investigation were  realized  and Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) said the report was  most notable  for  what s not in it. Evidently, the FBI investigation also was not enough to sway Sen. Heitkamp into the  yes  column.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/10/04/michelle-malkin-brett-kavanaugh-bar-fights-breitbart-news/","Michelle Malkin joined Breitbart News Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak in mocking a New York Times report highlighting a 1985 incident in which Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh was questioned by police about throwing ice in a bar altercation during his junior year of college. They made fun of the event on Wednesday s edition of SiriusXM s Breitbart News Tonight.Pollak joked,  Can I just make a pitch for the good old fashioned bar fight as a minimal qualification for office? I think since in California, for example, we are placing quotas so that companies have to appoint women to boards, so women now have an advantage, I think that men should show their credentials by participating in at least one bar fight. LISTEN:Pollak quipped,  Now, there are a couple of ground rules, here. You can t do it as a mature adult. It would have to be, sort of, before age 25, and that you have to win. You can have one loss, okay, you ve got to take a few punches, but you have to have a positive win-loss percentage, above .500, let s say. Pollak added,  I think that a bar fight for the right reason, if you re defending a woman, for example, or you re standing up to white supremacist in a bar, and as crazy as this sounds, I ve actually had to do that, that has to be positive on any resume for the highest court int he land, because there are some kinds of justice   can I say this?   sometimes street justice is the only justice. Malkin jokingly approved,  Joel, I second this motion. My question is, what arsenal qualifies? Because we ve got ice, and that doesn t seem to be going over very well with the media, I m thinking those little paper umbrellas that they put in the cocktails. Pollak used a double entendre,  From a very early age he has supported ice, contrast that to the Democrats who want to abolish ICE. There are certain Breitbart readers, if you tell them he threw the ICE at an illegal alien in a bar, that would be sort of ultimate poetry. Earlier in the interview, Malkin noted the  professional infrastructure  of left-wing and partisan Democrat agitation campaigns while lamenting the non-existence of an equivalent on the conservative side. She drew on a Wednesday-published column of hers entitled,  Investigate the Senate Democrat Wrecking Machine. Malkin said Democrats and leftists  executed their plan brilliantly  in opposition to Kavanaugh s nomination.  Republicans are never prepared for  such organized political campaigns, she added.Malkin said,  Excuses are made [for] why our side never has boots on the ground, and I really do think it s time that somebody invest in full-time conservative protesters to make sure that these optics are balanced with people who support Brett Kavanaugh, support the rule of law, and support due process. Malkin added,  We have to stop   especially those who are considered more mainstream in the conservative movement   demonizing those independent operators out there who are trying to fulfill this role. In so many ways this is what Andrew Breitbart talked about and why there was so much tension within the Beltway establishment part of the right and all the newcomers and true mavericks   what a word that has been perverted by the likes of John McCain and his heirs   but true mavericks who were really willing to put their mouths and their money and their lives on the line to fight for our cause. Malkin said congressional Democrats coordinate with left-wing  advocacy groups  and their news media allies, suspecting the protesters opposing Kavanaugh of having  top-down coordination with Senate Democrats. Malkin stated,  The other inequity, the other imbalance, between the left and the right on this is  accuser procurement. You had an entire Senate Judiciary staff mechanism, I believe   this has been in the works for months, now    sending out the bat signal to all the advocacy groups on the left, and I believe that s feminists, #MeToo movement-types, [and] these encrusted lawyers like Debra Katz. Malkin described the Democrats   procurement  of Debra Ramirez   who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct   as  very shady  and  very fishy. Malkin lauded President Donald Trump s exposure of assorted news media outlets ideological and partisan biases. What President Trump has been saying all along, and more effectively than any other politician more effectively than anyone else, [is] the sham that mainstream American media has become over the last 30 years,  remarked Malkin.Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

Joe Manchin s (D-WV) lead in the polls slipped to only four points over West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey ahead of a critical decision over whether the senator will decide to vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.A poll commissioned by the Senate Leadership Fund, a leading Senate Republican super PAC, showed that Sen. Manchin has 47 percent of the vote, while Morrisey has 43 percent, resulting in only a four-point gap between the incumbent Democrat and his Republican challenger.Five percent of voters remain undecided, with the margin of error for the poll at 4.1 points, making the West Virginia Senate race within Morrisey s grasp to win the Senate election in November.The Senate Leadership Fund poll contrasts with another survey conducted by the Democrat firm Global Strategy Group which found that Manchin leads by double digits.The Republican poll, however, found that President Donald Trump has a 58 percent approval rating in West Virginia. The survey also suggested that 19 percent of Trump voters back Manchin, although most of these voters said that they would be less likely to support Manchin if he opposes Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.Several polls released over the last couple of weeks found that a majority of West Virginians want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court. A survey from the Judicial Crisis Network (JNC) found that 58 percent of West Virginians want Kavanaugh confirmed, compared to only 28 percent who do not want him to join the nation s highest court.Another poll from the West Virginia Metro News found that 58 percent of West Virginians also want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court.Sen. Manchin represents a deep-red state that went for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election by 42 points, and he faces intense pressure to back Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.Politico reported on Thursday that Sen. Manchin continues to remain on the fence; however, the outlet suggested that he is likely leaning towards  Yes. The outlet did suggest  despite reports that Manchin is leaning yes  that he does not want to be the deciding vote to confirm Kavanaugh; however, he would be willing the becoming the  51st or 52nd  vote to confirm.Attorney General Morrisey told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement on Thursday that Manchin is  gutless  for failing to provide leadership on such a crucial confirmation vote as this Kavanaugh s vote. Manchin is gutless and incapable of being the deciding vote for anything that President Trump is seeking to accomplish,  Morrisey said.  Only when Schumer and his liberal donors give him permission and the votes are already there,will Manchin vote the right way.

Donnelly revealed in September that he will oppose Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court because he believes that the FBI should investigate Christine Blasey Ford s accusation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school in the 1980s.One National Journal reporter found that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) sent out a fundraising email requesting her supporters to back Donnelly because the Hoosier Democrat is in such a tight race..@KamalaHarris, in a fundraising email titled,  Re: Kavanaugh s nomination,  asks  to rush a donation of $10 or more to Joe Donnelly s re-election campaign  pic.twitter.com/l9rdgZhY2J  Hanna Trudo (@HCTrudo) October 4, 2018Josh Kelley, a spokesman for Braun, said that Donnelly is  cashing in  on his opposition to Kavanaugh to  advance his political career.  If voting against President Trump s highly qualified nominee wasn t enough, now Senator Donnelly is raising money off his opposition to Judge Kavanaugh,  said Josh Kelley. Late Wednesday night, reports suggested the FBI finished its investigation into the sexual assault accusation against Kavanaugh and found  no corroboration of the allegations of sexual misconduct. The complete FBI report on Kavanaugh would now call into question whether Donnelly s early opposition to the president s Supreme Court nominee will backfire against the Hoosier Democrat.The Indiana Senate race has become increasingly competitive. A Fox News survey found that Donnelly leads Braun by only two points, well within the poll s margin of error.A Fox News survey found that if Donnelly votes against Kavanaugh s nomination, 32 percent of voters said it will make it less likely for them to vote for Donnelly, whereas 30 percent of voters said it would make it more likely they will vote for the incumbent Democrat. The poll also revealed that Braun and Donnelly s supporters have both suggested, at 39 percent each, that they are  extremely interested  in the Indiana Senate race, closing the previous Democrat lead in voting enthusiasm. The media circus Democrats like Donnelly and Kamala Harris have created to smear Judge Kavanaugh is a disgrace, and Hoosiers should be appalled that Donnelly is cashing in on it to advance his political career,  said Kelley.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/exclusive-patrick-morrisey-gutless-joe-manchin-will-vote-for-kavanaugh-because-his-survival-depends-on-it/","West Virginia Attorney General (AG) Patrick Morrisey told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement on Thursday that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) will make the  craven political calculation  to ultimately vote for Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh because his  survival depends on it. Politico reported on Thursday that Sen. Manchin continues to remain on the fence as to supporting President Donald Trump s nominee; however, the outlet suggested that he is likely leaning towards  Yes.  It s clear Manchin doesn t want to be the 50th vote for Kavanaugh, but it seems like he d be OK with being the 51st or 52nd, barring any new developments,  Politico wrote.The West Virginia Democrat also reportedly discussed Kavanaugh s confirmation with the president.AG Morrisey told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement on Thursday that Manchin has given cover for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Democrats   shameful obstruct and resist circus  of the Supreme Court nomination process. Morrisey also said that  Manchin knows that his continued service in the U.S. Senate depends on his vote to confirm Kavanaugh for the nation s highest court.The West Virginia Republican said that Manchin is  gutless  because he cannot be the deciding vote for the president s nominee, but will only vote for Kavanaugh once he has political cover to become the 51st vote. Manchin is gutless, and incapable of being the deciding vote for anything that President Trump is seeking to accomplish,  Morrisey said.  Only when Schumer and his liberal donors give him permission and the votes are already there will Manchin vote the right way. Morrisey added,  Joe Manchin has given cover to Senate Democrats for their shameful obstruct and resist circus of President Trump s Supreme Court pick. West Virginians know that Joe Manchin is complicit in the Senate Democrats  and liberal media s disgraceful smear campaign of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. The West Virginia Republican charged that Manchin remains complicit in Schumer s plan to disrupt the Supreme Court nomination process.Schumer, immediately after Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, announced that he will oppose Kavanaugh  with everything I have  because the  stakes are simply too high. Immediately after Manchin left his meeting with Kavanaugh, the West Virginia Democrat went straight to Schumer s office.Schumer suggested in July that vulnerable Senate Democrats should hold off on their decision whether to support Kavanaugh as long as possible.Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) said,  All Chuck ever says in caucus [meetings], it s pretty well known: Keep your powder dry. Don t commit. Stay as neutral as you can, as long as you can. Several polls released over the last couple of weeks found that a majority of West Virginians want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court. A survey from the Judicial Crisis Network (JNC) found that 58 percent of West Virginians want Kavanaugh confirmed, compared to only 28 percent who do not want him to join the nation s highest court.Carrie Severino, the JCN chief counsel and policy director, said in a press release on Tuesday,  Senators Heitkamp and Manchin need to decide whether they stand with Judge Kavanaugh and President Trump, or with the outrageous smear campaign unleashed by Chuck Schumer and the liberal mob. Another poll from the West Virginia Metro News found that 58 percent of West Virginians also want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court.New poll shows West Virginians support Kavanaugh confirmation by a 30-point margin, 58-28.  cc: @JoeManchinWV #WVSen #SCOTUS https://t.co/kB20SpDOJy  Senate Leadership Fund (@Senate_Fund) September 28, 2018Morrisey told Breitbart News that he believes that Manchin will vote for Kavanaugh for political survival.Morrisey said,  Joe Manchin will vote for Kavanaugh because he knows his political survival depends on it. Joe Manchin is out of touch with West Virginia values, but he isn t stupid. He will make a craven political calculation to vote for Kavanaugh, but only once the outcome has been determined. It is simply cowardice. In comparison to Manchin, Morrisey contended that he can and has led to carry out President Donald Trump s agenda. In a previous interview with Breitbart News, Morrisey said that he worked with the White House to combat sanctuary cities. We already worked with him [the president] on sanctuary cities, we have worked with him on illegal amnesty, and we re working with the president to deregulate the economy,  Morrisey told Breitbart News during a rally in Huntington, West Virginia, in May.Morrisey concluded,  West Virginia deserves a Senator who will lead, not a liberal like Manchin who shows up after the fight is won. President Trump knows he can count on me to fight alongside him for the men and women of West Virginia. In a month from now, West Virginia will send a message to the nation that we re tired of Joe Manchin s record of being another dishonest Washington liberal.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/relative-says-christine-blasey-ford-threw-witness-leland-keyser-under-bus/","Leland Keyser s relative has accused Christine Blasey Ford of throwing her  witness  and lifelong friendKeyser under the bus.  This family member also sounds skeptical of Ford s allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Ford, the woman whose accusations of sexual conduct have crumbled under scrutiny, claimed that Keyser, a lifelong friend since high school, would validate her allegation.Instead, Keyser said in a statement that she not only does not remember the house party where the 1982 incident allegedly took place, but she also has never even met Kavanaugh.Although Ford s story has countless discrepancies already, the fact that all three of her witnesses come down on the side of Kavanaughincluding her lifelong friend, Keyserhas blown the biggest hole in Ford s shaky credibility. (They either do not remember the gathering or refute it completely.)During her testimony last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford was asked about Keyser, and according to the Daily Mail, Keyser s family is furious about what happened next.What Ford told the committee about Keyser struck many as an attempt by Ford to attack her friend with the claim that Keyser would remember the incident if her health were not so bad, or that her health struggles forced her to lie because she does not have the strength to tell the truth. Here is what Ford said:Leland has significant health challenges, and I m happy that she s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs, and she let me know that she needed her lawyer to take care of this for her, and she texted me right afterward with an apology and good wishes, and et cetera. So I m glad that she s taking care of herself.I don t expect that P.J. and Leland would remember this evening. It was a very unremarkable party. It was not one of their more notorious parties because nothing remarkable happened to them that evening. They were downstairs.According to this unnamed family member who spoke to the Daily Mail, Keyser is dealing with significant health issues, and Ford s tossing her into this maelstrom without any notice did not help. Leland was completely blindsided by her name being thrown into it all. The first thing she knew about it was when she woke up on Thursday morning and her name was just everywhere. It was crazy,  the relative said.Keyser s loved one also sounded skeptical of Ford s allegations against Kavanaugh.  I think it s quite convenient that [Ford] named the person who is frankly probably the least physically capable of all of them to stand up and be subjected to questioning or give her account.  It really felt a lot like Christine was the one called to the principal s office to give an account of something and just threw her under the bus,  this person said, adding,  You know, just reached for a name. The Daily Mail reports:[This] relative revealed the mother-of-two s shock at being named as a witness by a woman to whom she has barely spoken in recent years.And they expressed anger at Ford s suggestion that Keyser could not recall the party because of the  significant health challenges  she has faced in recent years. The family member went on to explain that the health challenges  faced by Keyser have not impaired her memory. The loved one also said that  being caught up in the Kavanaugh scandal has proved physically trying at a time when Keyser is not in good health.  She s just trying to get through it and hoping for it all to die down. On at least two occasions, Keyser has denied any knowledge of this 1982 house party or having ever met Kavanaugh   and she has done so under penalty of a felony.Ford named three witnesses. Including Keyser, all three have either said they do not remember the party or that it never happened.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

My heart breaks for Judge Kavanaugh and his family and what they ve been through,  she told KTAR, one of our local stations in Phoenix.  And at this point, based on what I know, unless there s some new revelations in the FBI investigation, I would vote for Brett Kavanaugh. McSally added,  The Democrats are not searching for the truth. The Democrats are searching to derail, delay, destroy, win the Senate back, and stop this from happening. That s what they re seeking. McSally also said she was  frustrated  with the Senate Democrats  treatment of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford. The fact she appeared to not even know they offered to come out to California to meet with her, that it could have happened in private, I think is a travesty,  the Arizona congresswoman said.Furthermore, McSally revealed she dealt with sexual assault while in high school and hopes we will have a national conversation about preventing more sexual assaults. I would hope, as somebody who s dealt with this personally and dealt with it also in the military, that maybe we could have this conversation about, Hey, let s prevent the next assault and abuse from happening,   Rep.

David Perdue (D-GA) said on Wednesday that Republicans should not put up with the harassment and intimidation of left-wing protesters who have descended on Capitol Hill to protest President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, after Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her decades ago at a high school party. These are not genuine people who are concerned about Dr. Ford or anything else. These are paid activists,  Perdue said on The Laura Ingraham Show.  This is a George Soros conspiracy, and it s time we wake up, expose them, stand up, and fight for our country because that s what s at stake here.  It s time for Republicans to stop being the minority party, grow up and stop playing defense,  Perdue said.  This is the time right now. Anti-Kavanaugh protesters harassed Sen. Perdue and his wife at Reagan National Airport on Monday   one in a series of confrontations between activists and lawmakers. The Senate Judiciary Committee delayed a vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation to allow Ford to testify, then further delayed it to let the FBI conduct supplemental background checks on Kavanaugh and others named in her claims.One of Perdue s confronters at the airport was Arizona State Representative Isela Blanc, a Democrat. She and two other protesters are affiliated with The Center for Popular Democracy, funded by left-wing billionaire George Soros.The increasingly aggressive and angry protests have resulted in heightened security around Capitol Hill, including Capitol Police escorts for lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee. Republicans had better not be asleep because these people are mobilized, they re funded, and, quite frankly, this is just the tip of the spear of all of their malign activity,  Perdue said.Perdue cited Democrats encouraging intimidation against political opponents in recent months, including Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) telling Kavanaugh opponents to  get up in the face of some Congresspeople  and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) telling her constituents to confront Trump administration officials at restaurants, gas stations, and department stores and to  push back on them. Perdue also slammed Democrats for continuing their intimidation agenda during Kavanaugh s 30-plus hours of confirmation hearings. I m disgusted with the process this week,  Perdue said.  This level of character assassination, I didn t think we d see again in my lifetime. And Perdue warned that the Democrats  tactics would not change going forward. This is part of a bigger attempt by the Democrats to take this to a new level,  Perdue said.  This is a bigger issue, and it s not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) mocked Republican men as  cowardly, patriarchal people  as she addressed an anti-Brett Kavanaugh protest on the steps of the United States Supreme Court on Wednesday evening.Nancy Pelosi Brett Kavanaugh protest (Penny Starr / Breitbart News)Pelosi made the remark (at 37:42, above) in addressing a gathering of hundreds of protesters backed by groups including Planned Parenthood, the Women s March, Black Lives Matter, and Ultraviolet that all oppose President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee.That opposition only grew more vociferous after Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her decades ago at a high school party. Thank you for your patriotism,  Pelosi said, claiming that defeating Kavanaugh s nomination would protect the Constitution.Pelosi also said Kavanaugh needed to be  vetted  more thoroughly. (Kavanaugh has now endured seven FBI background checks over the course of his career, has worked in sensitive positions for President George W. Bush, and has been a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for twelve years without incident or complaint.)Pelosi repeated the protesters  claim that Kavanaugh had lied to Congress during his 30-plus hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and praised Ford for her honesty and bravery.Pelosi, who hopes to become Speaker of the House again if Democrats retake the House of Representatives in the midterm elections in November, also cited a threat to the #MeToo  movement.  They want to dismantle the #metoo movement,  Pelosi said.  But we are not going to let them.  She also mocked those defenders of Kavanaugh who said he was a  great guy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on Wednesday launched the final round of the confirmation battle, filing for cloture to ensure a final vote on President Trump s nominee by the end of the week.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Are you trying to assault me?  Sharma asked, as she started to shove him. This is really a fuck you to survivors! This is a fuck you to every girl that has been sexually assaulted on this campus!  she shouted in reply. Our goal was to express support for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh and reaffirm the importance of evidence when deciding if someone is guilty of an allegation as serious as sexual assault,  YCT s Vice Chairman Anthony Dolcefino told Breitbart News. Instead of engaging in civil discourse and discussing the topic peacefully, an angry, Leftist mob formed and began screaming expletives, shouting verbal threats, and destroying our signs,  continued Dolcefino.Another video posted to Dolcefino s Facebook page shows the protesters shouting  we believe survivors  and  fuck YCT  while the conservative students attempted to engage in civil discourse.The conservative student group published a statement to their Facebook page on Wednesday:We believe [Judge Kavanaugh] has been victim to a farcical smear campaign intended to destroy his good name and legacy. We wished to engage in good faith dialogue with our peers about this process, however, the campus left had a different idea.Quickly, a mob formed that was interested in nothing but hurling insults at our members, chanting meaningless platitudes, and destroying our property. One particularly deranged leftist even took a bite out of one of our signs.The University of Texas has not commented on the incident as of this writing.Alana Mastrangelo is a contributor at Breitbart News.

Joe Manchin (D-WV) signaled in an interview published Thursday that decades-old sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh will not play a major role in his vote on the judge s Supreme Court confirmation.Manchin, a key Democrat swing vote, lamented the Senate Judiciary Committee s handling of its investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, describing the previous few weeks as  horrible  and a  circus.  I am looking at the gentleman as an adult from 22 to 53, thirty-one years of professional service,  Manchin told Al-Jazeera.  I am looking at him as a father. As a person in a community, how he interacts with his community. I am trying to put the human side to it. The red state Democrat made similar remarks told Fox News  Chad Pergram Wednesday afternoon. I m just looking for some clarity. @Sen_JoeManchin reacts to the FBI s probe of the allegations leveled against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. pic.twitter.com/PqeENxHrB4  Fox News (@FoxNews) October 3, 2018Manchin s remarks come as Democrat Senators have begun ratcheting up criticism of the FBI s findings. Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) expressed concern Thursday morning that the agency did not interview Kavanaugh or his first accuser, California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford. Over the last couple of days, there s been a fair amount of back and forth about what we asked for, what was promised and now today we ll see what s delivered,  Coons told CNN s New Day.  I m concerned that if they never interviewed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford or her corroborating witnesses, if they never interviewed many of Judge Kavanaugh s classmates from Yale who came forward to be heard about the alleged incident with Debbie Ramirez, that this isn t the investigation I was hoping for. On Wednesday, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) criticized the FBI s decision to print just one copy of its report for panel members to view, a move presumably to limit leaks to the press.  Get this   one copy! For the United States Senate,  Durbin said.  That s what we were told. And we were also that we would be given one hour for the Dems, one hour for the Republicans. Alternating. Bizarre, it doesn t make any sense. According to the Wall Street Journal, the White House found no corroboration the allegations against Kavanaugh after reviewing the FBI s interview reports concerning the judge s past. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell filed a motion to cloture, a procedural move which will allow the full Senate to vote on the judge s confirmation on Saturday.

Grassley, who has led the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh, released a statement after he read the FBI report which investigated the accusations that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct against Christine Blasey Ford.GRASSLEY:  There s nothing in it that we didn t already know It s time to vote. I ll be voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.  pic.twitter.com/h1zUeIDP3F  Ryan J. Reilly (@ryanjreilly) October 4, 2018Grassley said regarding the FBI report:There s nothing in it that we didn t already know. These uncorroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by Judge Kavanaugh, and neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations. There s also no contemporaneous evidence. This investigation found no hint of misconduct and the same is true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during Judge Kavanagh s 25 years of public service. [Emphasis added.]In contrast to the allegations laid against Kavanaugh, Grassley said that many of the nominee s friend and colleagues can only attest to Kavanaugh s good nature. Here is what we know: Judge Kavanaugh s former clerks, colleagues, and friends from high school to the present acclaim his personal integrity and character. His neighbors and community members recognize his positive contributions to their schools and churches,  Grassley said.  And his fellow members of the legal profession know him to be a thoughtful and respectful jurist. His juridical record shows that he is fair and rules impartially and without prejudice. The Senate Judiciary Chairman said that now the FBI investigation cleared the accusations against Kavanaugh despite the Senate Democrats  tactics to disrupt the nomination process, senators  ought to wipe away the muck from all the mudslinging and politics and look at this nomination with clear eyes.  He s served with distinction for twelve years on the nation s most important circuit court and dedicated himself to serving the American public,  the Iowa senator said.  We know that he will be an excellent justice because he s been an excellent judge. The FBI report was the last hurdle for reluctant Senate Republicans such as Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), who insisted on a week-long FBI investigation before they signal if they will support the president s nominee.Now senators can have the chance to read the FBI report and decide if they plan to vote to confirm the president s nominee.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) filed the motion to cloture late Wednesday night, which would allow the Senate to vote to confirm Kavanaugh on Saturday.Chairman Grassley concluded that the Senate needs to take action on Kavanaugh. It s time to vote. I ll be voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.

Markey said,  It s obviously a cover-up. The Trump White House, working with the Republican leadership in the Senate, have deliberately circumscribed this investigation so that only a small handful of people will be questioned, and if any leads are in fact developed, that the FBI is not allowed to follow them in order to determine the truth of what happened.

And then they re handing us a document this morning that 100 members of the Senate must read. They ve only made one copy of it for the United States Senate, and then scheduled a vote tomorrow on this issue. This is making a mockery of the constitutional responsibility of the Senate.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/nolte-latest-ronan-farrow-report-further-discredits-deborah-ramirez-brett-kavanaugh-allegation/","The latest reporting from the New Yorker s Ronan Farrow only further undermines Deborah Ramirez s already-discredited allegation of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh.Ten days ago, Farrow and his co-author Jane Mayer pretty much debunked Ramirez s story as they reported on it. Ramirez claims that during a drunken 1983 dorm room party at Yale, Kavanaugh aggressively flashed his genitals in her face.The problems with her story are legion.To begin with, Ramirez admits she was quite drunk that night. She also told the New Yorker that for 35 years she could not remember who exposed himself to her, at least until 1) Kavanaugh was nominated for the Supreme Court, and 2) she sat down for six days with her lawyer (a Democrat politician) to refresh her memory.Ramirez, whom the New Yorker describes as an activist Democrat, admits she has  significant gaps in her memories of the evening,  and that at the party she  became inebriated  and  was on the floor, foggy and slurring her words. Moreover, just as we have seen in the now-debunked allegations coming from Christine Blasey Ford and Julie Swetnick, all the witnesses named by Ramirez to back up her account come down on the side of Kavanaugh.No one remembers the incident. Farrow spoke to five former classmates who should have been able to corroborate Ramirez s claim, and all five, including Ramirez s best friend at the time, say they do not remember it. More than one says they do not believe Brett Kavanaugh would have ever done such a thing.Ramirez s charge against Kavanaugh took an especially big hit when the New York Times reported that Ramirez had been calling her former classmates and admitting to them she could not be certain if it was Kavanaugh who exposed himself to her.Although the Times spent a week trying to corroborate her story, it could not, and no story ever ran.That left one ridiculous piece of corroboration, a former classmate who remembered hearing about the incident secondhand. In other words, he did not see the incident himself, but someone else told him it happened and that Kavanaugh was the culprit.But now, thanks to additional reporting from Farrow, even that has been blown apart.In the previous New Yorker report, this secondhand source chose to remain anonymous. On Wednesday, he revealed himself to Farrow as James Hastings Nichols, a seminary professor at Princeton Theological Seminary.Nichols reiterated to Farrow that he is  one-hundred percent certain  he was told by somebody else that Kavanaugh exposed himself to Ramirez, and that he was told this no more than two days after it happened. I can corroborate Debbie s account,  he told the New Yorker.  I believe her, because it matches the same story I heard thirty-five years ago, although the two of us have never talked. The problem, though, is that Nichols is not a witness. He did not see it happen. Somebody else told him it happened.But that is the least of his problems, becauseThe person who supposedly told Nichols about the incident has no memory of the incident.To Farrow s everlasting shame, he buries his own bombshell, the only real news in his piece under three paragraphs and hundreds of words:[Nichols] said that he had not been able to get any response from that person, despite multiple attempts to do so. The New Yorker reached the classmate, but he said that he had no memory of the incident.To recap:Wednesday s New Yorker piece is, unfortunately, a dreadful and blatant piece of left-wing activism. Farrow had been doing some stellar work in the field of #MeToo, but the only good thing you can say about his work on the Ramirez story is that he did not leave anything out.Although his reporting has completely debunked her allegation, both pieces have been written with the obvious goal of burying those inconvenient facts and derailing Kavanaugh s confirmation; especially this latest piece, which is a plea for further delays through the expansion of an FBI investigation.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

On Wednesday, Republicans laid out a tightly choreographed process to keep it confidential.The report as made available to senators consists of only one paper copy of the FBI s official interview notes and other documents from the six-day probe, according to NBC News. Only the 100 senators and ten specially selected Senate Judiciary Committee staff will be allowed to see the copy. Republicans and Democrats will take alternating one-hour viewing sessions with the one copy.Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), a Judiciary Committee member, has led some of the strongest attacks against Judge Kavanaugh during his confirmation process   especially after the publication of the uncorroborated sexual misconduct allegations that gave rise to this seventh FBI probe. He expressed his displeasure at the process to the Hill. Get this   one copy! For the United States Senate,  Durbin told the Hill.  That s what we were told. And we were also told that we would be given one hour for the Dems, one hour for the Republicans. Alternating.  We tried to reserve some time to read it. That is ridiculous,  Durbin continued.  One copy?! Bizarre, it doesn t make any sense. The rules Republicans laid out no doubt stem from concerns that, in what may be the most politically charged and viciously fought judicial confirmation in modern American history, Democrats may selectively leak material to the news media that appears damning of Judge Kavanaugh or seems to corroborate accuser Christine Blasey Ford s account of a high school party where, she claims, a 17-year-old Kavanaugh groped her.This concern with security keeps with tradition and the explicit dictates of the governing memorandum of understanding on the subjectthat FBI background investigations of nominees be kept confidential. Some in the news media, however, are skeptical even these precautions will prevent leaks:whispers:  yes it will  https://t.co/If2BsTsQA6  Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) October 3, 2018Regardless of any report leaks and what the document contains, a cloture vote to end debate on Kavanaugh s nomination is now expected Friday, setting up a final Senate floor vote this weekend or Monday.

He sought the help of legal elites on the right, led by the Federalist Society, who compiled an impressive list of potential nominees. This isn t a rogue judicial operation to choose presidential cronies. It is the gold standard for legal talent that believes in the original meaning of the Constitution. It s hard to see how any GOP President would have done better, and others have done much worse.Yet this is precisely why Democrats and the left have set out to destroy Judge Kavanaugh not in legal philosophy or competence, which they knew was a political loser, but as a human being, a spouse and father. They need to destroy him personally with accusations but no corroboration, as they tried with Clarence Thomas, so they can deny the open Supreme Court seat to a judicial conservative.Republicans are well aware of Mr. Trump s excesses and falsehoods. But they have also come to understand that the resistance to him isn t rooted in principle or some august call to superior character. They know Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton in 2016 despite her history of deceit. Voters know this is about the left s will to power by any means necessary.Republicans across America can see, and certainly their Senators voting on Judge Kavanaugh should realize, that the left hates them as much or more than they loathe Mr. Trump. Conservatives understand that, for the American left, they are all deplorables now.Hillary Clinton infamously referred to Trump supporters as a  basket of deplorables  during the 2016 election.Read the full editorial, which appears in Thursday s print edition of the Wall Street Journal.Joel B.

Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Senate leadership allowed an extra week for additional investigation into Kavanaugh. President Trump ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to expedite the Senate s request, and to conclude its work by this Friday. The FBI finished its work early, and consequently senators can review the supplemental report beginning Thursday morning.Under Senate rules, the motion must now  ripen  for a day. The full Senate will vote early on Friday on the motion. Although cloture requires 60 votes for legislation, only 51 votes are required for presidential nominees to judicial or executive office.If cloture is invoked Friday morning, the final vote on confirmation will come late on Saturday afternoon.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/03/sarah-sanders-donald-trump-stating-facts-christine-ford/","White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders defended President Donald Trump on Wednesday for mocking Judge Kavanaugh s accuser, claiming he was only pointing out the  facts  of her testimony. I dispute that it wasn t anything other than the president stating facts, facts that were laid out in the prosecutor s memo that she put forward in the Senate,  Sanders said to reporters at the White House during a press briefing.Multiple reporters questioned Sanders about Trump s comments about Christine Blasey Ford during his campaign rally in Mississippi on Tuesday, in which he repeated that she  didn t know  important details of the alleged attack. How did you get home?  I don t remember.  How did you get there?  I don t remember.  Where is the place?   Trump said, recounting Ford s testimony.  I don t remember.  How many years ago was it?  I don t know. I don t know. I don t know.  Sanders referred to Rachel Mitchell, the veteran sex crimes prosecutor chosen by Republicans to question Ford during her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee. In her subsequent memo, Mitchell concluded that  a he said, she said  case is incredibly difficult to prove. But this case is even weaker than that.  Sanders disparaged Democrats for destroying the Supreme Court nomination process with the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. It is a complete and total disgrace,  she said, referring to the behavior of Senate Democrats.Sanders criticized Democrats for publicly attacking Kavanaugh and accused them of leaking the identity of his accuser, Christine Ford. Democrats hold all of the responsibility for that process,  she said.When asked if he still believed that Ford s testimony was credible, Sanders replied,  The president believes that Judge Kavanaugh should be confirmed.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/03/nolte-28-reasons-julie-swetnicks-kavanugh-allegations-are-total-garbage/","Using evidence, witness testimony, and their own testimony (either written or before the Senate Judiciary Committee), Breitbart News has already unraveled the first two allegations launched against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.And as of now, the accusations put forth by Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez have collapsed into a pile of lies, deceptions, and   most importantly   statements by the accusers  own witnesses   all of whom back up Kavanaugh.This leaves only Julie Swetnick, the accuser represented by Michael Avenatti, the attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels made famous by far-left CNN.In a sworn statement dramatically released by her attorney last week, Swetnick made allegations against Kavanaugh that went above and beyond anything we have so far heard. According to Swetnick, Kavanaugh was part of an organized group of gang rapists who spiked punch bowls at high school parties before running sex trains on unsuspecting, incapacitated women.What s more, Swetnick alleges she herself was gang raped at one of these parties and that Kavanaugh was present when it happened.On top of this statement, Swetnick also sat down for an interview with the far-left NBC News.Even though NBC could not corroborate even one part of her story, this unethical news organization (with its own cancerous environment towards women), still ran with it.Maybe that was a good thing, because this interview only served to destroy whatever credibility Swetnick might have had left. And as a result, even those most desperate to destroy Kavanaugh have stopped talking about Swetnick   and for good reason: she stands as toxic proof that a partisan campaign is indeed afoot to smear an innocent man, a wrongfully accused man.Here are 28 reasons why the Swetnick s allegations are horse shit, beginning with her sworn statement:1. Swetnick claimed she attended  well over ten house parties  in DC between the years 1981 and 1983 where Kavanaugh was present.This would mean that as an adult already in college, she was attending house parties with a Brett Kavanaugh who was as young as 15.2. Although Swetnick presents herself as someone who was part of this party scene, as of now, no one who was part of Kavanaugh s social circle at the time remembers her.3. At these parties, Swetnick claims Kavanaugh was regularly  fondling  and  grabbing  girls  without their consent. None of these girls have come forward to allege anything of the kind.4. Moreover, how would Swetnick know the mind of these other girls, if they consented or not?5. Swetnick claims that at these parties Kavanaugh was  verbally abusive towards girls by making crude sexual remarks. So far, some 60 men and women who knew Kavanaugh at the time have said (under penalty of felony) that he was only ever respectful towards them and others.Not a single witness backs this Swetnick claim. No one remembers Swetnick. No one even knows who she is.6. Swetnick claims she has been  told by other women that this conduct also occurred during the summer months  during Beach Week. No one has found these  other women  and it is awfully convenient that Swetnick was able to reference  Beach Week  just after Kavanaugh released his 1982 calendar where  Beach Week  is so prominently noted.7. Swetnick attacks Kavanaugh s Fox News appearance with the false claim he wanted to appear  innocent.  She writes,  This claim is absolutely false and a lie. The truth, however, is that this is a straw man invented by the organized left to paint Kavanaugh as a liar. During the Fox News interview Kavanaugh admitted that at times he drank too much and did things he now finds embarrassing.8. Swetnick says that in 1981-82 she  became aware  of Kavanaugh spiking the punch at these parties with  drugs and/or grain alcohol  in order to take sexual advantage of inebriated girls. Became aware  is not the same as witnessing. How she  became aware  is never explained.9. Swetnick says she did  witness  something she calls  efforts  by Kavanaugh to get unsuspecting women  inebriated and disoriented so they could be gang raped. Here we have an adult woman attending more than ten high school  gang rape  parties organized by a 15 to 16-year-old Brett Kavanaugh, and she not only doesn t go to the police, she continues to attend them.In her NBC interview, though, she attempted to clear this up, but in doing so, only undercut her story all the more. She says people aged 15 to 25 attended these gang rape parties and that it was only in  hindsight  that she figured out girls were being gang raped. Had she known at the time, she now says she would have  burst into the room  to save the victims and then gone to the police.10. Swetnick alleges she herself was gang raped and that Kavanaugh was  present. She does not claim Kavanaugh participated in the gang rape, only that he was present, whatever that means.11. Swetnick claims she told two people at the time about the alleged gang rape.Those two people have not been found.Moving on to this week s NBC interview12. NBC News listened to Swetnick s story and could  not independently verify her claims    not a single one of them.13. NBC News admits,  There are things she told us on camera that differ from her written statement. 14. NBC News could not find anyone who  remembers attending parties with Julie Swetnick and Brett Kavanaugh. 15. NBC News admits Swetnick is  unclear about when she first decided to come forward. This target moves from when Swetnick first learned Kavanaugh was on President Trump s short list of Supreme Court nominees to when Ford came forward   a six-week window.16. Swetnick told NBC Kavanaugh attended these gang rape parties in his Georgetown Prep uniform.In other words, he was wearing his school uniform, not only at weekend or after school parties, but while organizing and executing gang rapes.17. When asked if she saw  Brett Kavanaugh spiking the punch,  Swetnick said she saw Kavanaugh  giving red Solo cups to quite a few girls during that timeframe. So we have gone from spiking the punch for rape purposes, to handing out cups.18. Backing even further away from her sworn statement, Swetnick told NBC,  I saw him around the  punch containers.  Then she says,  I don t know what he did, but I saw him by them. In other words, the only evidence she has that Kavanaugh spiked the punch is that she  saw him by  the punch. AndShe  doesn t know what he did,  but is still accusing him of gang rape.19. In her statement Swetnick claims she saw Kavanaugh and other boys line up outside bedrooms waiting their turn to join in on the gang rapes.Swetnick told NBC that her evidence of this is that she saw  boys standing outside of rooms, congregated together, sort of like a gauntlet.  She added,  I would see them laughing, a lot of laughing. When asked if they were even standing in a line, Swetnick explained,  Not standing in line, but definitely huddled.  She adds that she saw Kavanaugh huddled with  other boys. That is the only proof she has of gang rapes: boys at parties huddled together laughing and near a punch bowl.20. After describing her own alleged gang rape at one of these parties, she can only say that Kavanaugh was  hanging about  the area where she  started to feel disoriented. 21. She has no idea if Kavanaugh raped her or if he spiked her drink.22. Swetnick claims she told the Montgomery County Police about the alleged gang rape and named the officer she spoke with.That officer cannot verify anything because he is now deceased.23. Swetnick claims she told her mother about the rape the next day.Her mother cannot verify any of this because she is now deceased.24. Swetnick claims she might have told other people but cannot remember their names.25. Swetnick frequently names Mark Judge, Kavanaugh s high school friend, as a co-conspirator.Under penalty of imprisonment, Judge called the allegations  ridiculous  and adds that he doesn t even know Swetnick.26. Swetnick said  everybody in the County remembers those [gang rape] parties. Neither NBC nor anyone else can find a single person in the County who remembers those parties.27. Swetnick provided NBC with four names of friends who would verify these parties occurred.One friend said he does not know Swetnick. Another friend is deceased. The other two did not respond.28. NBC spent days looking into Swetnick s story and  has not been able to place her in that time period, at those house parties, in that group of friends. Forget the gang rape allegations, no one can even place Swetnick as someone who hung out in Kavanaugh s social circle.While Swetnick cannot find anyone to corroborate any part of her story, even something as basic as her being part of Kavanaugh s crowd, people who have come forward with the claim to know Swetnick have a lot to say about her.I am not adding any of this to the list because we do not yet know the full story, but a former boyfriend says he had to file a restraining order against Swetnick (NBC was able to verify this). A  former employer claimed in a 2000 lawsuit that Swetnick not only falsified her resume, she falsely accused two men of sexual misconduct as a means to cover up her own sexual misconduct.On Monday, a man who once ran for Congress as a Democrat, claimed Swetnick s father told him she had serious psychological problems. Believe all women.  Somewhere Atticus Finch shudders. Take a good long look around at what life looks like with The Matriarchy in charge. We have now spent two weeks inside this toxic world, which means we now know it is a McCarthy-ite horror show, nothing less than warmed over Stalinism in a burnt bra.To paraphrase Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), God help us all if these people obtain power.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

Are you saying Judge Kavanaugh is the victim in all this?  Jim Acosta asked Sanders. I think both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh are victims at the hands of the Democrats. I think it is absolutely disgraceful what they ve done and exploited this process,  Sanders answered. They exploited Dr. Ford, they re exploiting all of the women that have come out to make any type of accusation,  she continued.  This isn t the process that should have been done, and certainly everybody deserves to be heard, but that includes Judge Kavanaugh, and that should be part of this process, and the facts have to be looked at, and I think you have to look at the prosecutor s memo. Those are where you see all of those facts laid out, and I think she makes a compelling case. Sanders also said,  I don t have any problem stating facts, noI know that s something you probably do have a problem with, but I don t. Acosta fired back, saying,  Actually Sarah, we do state the facts, and I think there have been many occasions when you don t state the facts. Jim Acosta often makes himself the star of presidential press briefings and other events. Last week, he was called on by Trump, and then proceeded to tell Trump that he should call on a woman next. Thank you very much. If you don t mind, after I m finished, ifone of our female colleagues could go after me, that would be great,  he told Trump.

The opioid bill passed overwhelmingly through the House last Friday.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said on Wednesday that the legislation is  set to deliver major relief to the American communities that have been decimated by the scourge of substance abuse and addiction.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/03/cnn-ids-fords-ex-runs-denial-in-first-mention-of-his-explosive-letter/","CNN, in its first-ever mention of the sworn letter potentially discrediting Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford, identifies the redacted author by name and offers a denial of the letter s allegations from Ford s long-time friend.On Tuesday, Fox News first obtained a sworn statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee from a man who claimed to know Ford for roughly eight years in the 1990s, six of them as her romantic partner.CNN, like several other left-leaning news outlets, posted no reporting about the potentially narrative-shifting letter on Tuesday. The network s very first mention of the letter came in a piece by Geneva Sands and Josh Campbell Wednesday afternoon leading with a Ford friend and ally s denial of the letter s contents. Further down, CNN identifies the ex-boyfriend, whose identity had been kept redacted by Judiciary Committee staff, by name and attacks his credibility.The letter, attested to under penalty of felony, calls into question key aspects of Ford s narrative, including her supposed fear of flying, claustrophobia, and need to have multiple exits to the homes in which she lives. The letter claims that, in six years of dating, Ford never suffered from any of these things, nor did she ever mention Brett Kavanaugh or having been sexually assaulted.Potentially the most consequential assertion contained in the ex-boyfriend s letter, however, was that Ford had coached a close friend, Monica McLean, on how to take polygraph tests for her government security clearance investigation, using her training in psychology. McLean eventually became an FBI agent, and is now retired from that position.The Republican majority s Senate Judiciary Committee outside counsel during Ford s testimony, Arizona sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, asked Ford a series of strikingly specific questions about her history with polygraphs, including whether she had ever  given tips or advice to somebody looking to take a polygraph test.  Ford responded with a denial for each of these questions.If the allegations in the letter are true, Ford may have perjured herself during the hearing set up on her behalf to let her air allegations that a 17-year-old Kavanaugh had forced himself on her and groped her over her clothes at a high school party somewhere around the summer of 1982.McLean, the ex-FBI agent Ford is alleged to have coached for her polygraph,  is furious that her reputation is now being called into question by a lie  that has thrust her into the national spotlight,  according to CNN.

And of course, the whole circumstance under which she ended up testifying in front of the Supreme Court, excuse me, in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is highly suspicious. Senator Feinstein sitting on her letter, then leaking, somehow it got leaked to the press, ended up in the Washington Post. And then against her wishes, she ends up in the middle of this three-ring circus, something she did not authorize and did not want. And unfortunately, that s where she found herself. So listening to her testimony was something she wanted us to do. We wanted to hear from her. I thought we treated her as I would have wanted my daughters or my wife or my mother treated if they were in a similar situation. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/03/republicans-outraged-by-brett-kavanaugh-circus-now-match-democrats-in-voter-enthusiasm/","A new poll indicates that Republicans have closed the Democrats  formerly wide gap in voter enthusiasm, thanks to the ongoing crisis surrounding the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Wednesday found that 80% of Republicans now say the November elections are  very important,  compared with 82% of Democrats   a statistical tie, well within the polls 4-point margin of error.The poll was conducted on October 1st (Monday), as the FBI was conducting its supplemental probe of allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh. The 12-year veteran of the D.C. Circuit was recently accused of groping a girl when he was in high school   a claim he denies. Republican Senators have called Democrats  attempt to derail Kavanaugh s confirmation a  circus    a point on which both the GOP establishment and the conservative base seem to have found elusive agreementIn July, only 68% of Republicans said the midterm elections were  very important,  compared to 78% of Democrats.In addition, NPR notes:  Democrats  advantage on which party Americans want to control Congress has also been cut in half since last month. Democrats still retain a 6-point edge on that question, but it was 12 points after a Marist poll conducted in mid-September. It adds:  [W]ith Democrats already up fired up for this election, the Kavanaugh confirmation fight has apparently had the effect of rousing a dormant GOP base.The poll results confirm anecdotal evidence from many districts. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said Sunday that the Kavanaugh controversy had helped the party dramatically. Fundraising for Republicans has also reportedly skyrocketed.While Democrats also believe the controversy will be helpful to their party in November, chiefly by motivating female voters who opposed Trump, those voters may have already been very interested in participating in the elections.Joel B.

Look at [this] chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist s arrogated entitlement,  Fair wrote in the since-deleted tweet.  All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps. Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes. In a statement published on Tuesday, Georgetown President John J. DeGioia failed to mention Fair by name. Instead, DeGioia vaguely condemned the use of  violent imagery, profanity, insensitive labeling of individuals based on gender, ethnicity or political affiliation.  He went on to suggest that Fair would only face disciplinary action if her speech affected her work at the university.We protect the right of our community members to exercise their freedom of expression. This does not mean the University endorses the content of their expression.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/03/ann-coulter-whatever-it-takes/","The Democrats  current position on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh is: We cannot have someone addicted to beer on our highest court! What if a foreign power were to ply him with this nectar in a can? Talk about taking control of our government! Suppose they throw in a case of Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier?A bitter college roommate is going whole hog, wailing, He lied about being a beeraholic.By the media s account, Kavanaugh was a bounder, a brawler and a drunk. And yet he still managed to graduate at the top of his class, go to Yale, then to Yale Law and work in the highest positions in government.I am in awe of his manliness. Hemingway has nothing on this guy! He should be our president. To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln after being told Ulysses S. Grant was a drunk, let s find out what Kavanaugh drank and send a barrel of it to every college student.At least the Democrats seem to have moved on from the Crazy Ladies Who Must Be Believed.Kavanaugh s first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, doesn t remember the time or place of the alleged high school groping, and all four witnesses she named deny any memory of such a party.Forcing our first one-week delay, we were told that the poor lady was so traumatized by being groped in high school that she couldn t fly. It was the worst thing that ever happened to her, compelling her to do what any reasonable person would under the circumstances: Add a second front door to her house.She was supposedly terrified of small spaces, and an airplane, one of her friends told CNN,  was the ultimate closed space where you cannot get away. Then we found out that Ford regularly jets off to Hawaii, Costa Rica, the South Pacific islands and French Polynesia  to go surfing, one of the most terrifying activities around.It sounded like a joke. I was so shattered and broken, I could only go rock climbing in the Grand Tetons. After that, I d repair to my room and curl up in a fetal position. Then I d go rock climbing again.An ex-boyfriend has come forward to say that in six years of dating Ford, she never mentioned a sexual assault, had no fear of flying, lived comfortably in a tiny home with only one front door, once coached a friend on how to take a polygraph, contrary to her sworn testimony   and also lied about stealing $600 from him.Kavanaugh s second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, jumped in to help, dusting off a memory of the nominee pulling a Bill Clinton on her as a freshman in college   but only after she spent a week huddled with her attorney,  assessing her memories  and calling classmates to ask if they thought it was true.And did she have corroboration? She doesn t need any! She s a  survivor.  Even The New York Times   the newspaper that believed the Duke lacrosse rape case until about five minutes before the prosecutor was disbarred   said Ramirez didn t have enough evidence to meet its standards.His third accuser, our heroine Julie Swetnik, is the woman produced by porn lawyer Michael Avenatti. She claims that she repeatedly attended gang rape parties in the 1980s   and she saw Brett Kavanaugh there!An ex-boyfriend says Swetnik once threatened to kill him and his unborn child; she had a restraining order taken out against her; was sued by an employer for engaging in  sexually offensive conduct,  making  false and retaliatory allegations  against co-workers and also lying about her educational background and work history.A Democrat and Emmy-winning meteorologist wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee stating that, soon after he met Swetnik in the 1990s, she proposed group sex to him. Some years later, her own father told him to stay away, citing Swetnik s psychological problems.She is now the Democrats  leading contender for 2020.Poor Kate Snow of NBC News thought she had landed the interview of a lifetime when she sat down with Swetnik. Within about three questions, it became clear that she was talking to a lunatic. At that point, most of Snow s energy went into hoping for a building-wide power failure to shut down the cameras.Of the four witnesses Swetnik provided to NBC, whom she claimed would confirm her story, one denied knowing any Julie Swetnik, one was dead, and two did not respond to the network, perhaps wishing they were dead too.By the end of the interview, Snow s purse was missing.But the Democrats are energetic devils. They ve been poring over Kavanaugh s high school yearbook and exclaiming, He s a beeraholic!With grim passion, they say, how dare you laugh at this? If he were a teetotaler, they d say, We can t have someone on the court who s so nerdy. How can this weird aesthete sympathize with murderers and insider traders?They ve already won a second week s delay by having two deranged women scream at Sen. Jeff Flake in an elevator.After wetting himself, Flake insisted on a seventh FBI investigation. For weeks, the Democrats have been demanding an investigation   of an incident without witnesses, on a date unknown at a place unknown   by saying, Oh, you big babies, the FBI investigation of Anita Hill only took three days!The FBI wrapped up its investigation of Kavanaugh in a few days and then sat around wondering how long it had to wait before producing the report. So now the  it will only take three days  crowd is saying, Keep investigating! We don t know how long the probe should be, but the minimum standards of decency require that it last at least until there s a new president.Whatever they find, they will argue in the alternative and just keep doing it and doing it. If Kavanaugh stepped on a bug, PETA activists would be screaming at Flake in an elevator.The Democrats have a pair of twos, but they expect Republicans to fold. Why? Because that s what Republicans always do!Unfortunately, this time, Kavanaugh s supporters are not accepting surrender.COPYRIGHT 2018 ANN COULTER

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/10/03/ann-coulter-democrats-are-the-party-of-manifest-lunatic-julie-swetnick/","Ann Coulter, author of Resistance Is Futile!: How the Trump-Hating Left Lost Its Collective Mind, described Democrats as  the party  of  manifest lunatic  Julie Swetnick, in a Tuesday interview with Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour on SiriusXM s Breitbart News Tonight. I do not want the Democrats to be able to separate themselves from Julie Swetnick. This is the party of Julie Swetnick. We ll go with Brett Kavanaugh,  Coulter said.  I ll take that going into the midterms. I can t get enough of this lady. #ICYMI Listen to @AnnCoulter  s Full Interview on @BreitbartNews Tonight with @RAMansour #KavanaughInvestigation  @SiriusXM #Patriot 125 https://t.co/YVMywSjSzx  SiriusXM Patriot (@SiriusXMPatriot) October 3, 2018Swetnick, who is represented by lawyer Michael Avenatti, alleges that Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh participated in mass gang rape parties while he was in high school in the 198o s. Mansour and Coulter discussed the latest revelations about Swetnick from a statement by Dennis Ketterer, one of her former boyfriends, which was released by the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday afternoon.LISTEN:Ketterer s statement included the following claims:During a conversation about our sexual preferences, things got derailed when Julie told me that she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time. In fact sometimes with several at one time. She wanted to know if that would be ok in our relationship.

I asked her if this was just a fantasy of hers. She responded that she first tried sex with multiple guys while in high school and still liked it from time-to-time. She brought it up because she wanted to know if I would be interested in that.Coulter said,  Apparently someone else stepped forward, in addition to the boyfriend [Swetnick] threatened to kill his unborn child, in addition to the company she worked where she was sued for both sexual harassment and making false claims of sexual assault. Mansour explained,  This guy actually was a Washington, DC, meteorologist who won an Emmy. So it wasn t just anybody. His name was Dennis Ketterer. He was a Democrat who ran for Congress, too, so this isn t some right-winger.  When he s running for Congress, he s thinking, Well, okay. I didn t want to have threesomes with another guy with this girl, but maybe she d like to volunteer on my campaign,   Coulter explained, noting that Ketterer ended up speaking with Swetnick s father who told him that his daughter had psychological problems. [Ketterer] apparently was like 350 pounds, and when [Swetnick] approached him and hit on him in a bar, he was like, Why is she hitting on me? This isn t the sort of woman who would hit on me,   Mansour explained.  He says point blank, My impression was that she was an opportunist, and that she was going after me because I m on TV.  Coulter quipped,  Her opening gambit was, Would you have a threesome with me and another guy?  This is why the Julie Swetnick 24-hours-a-day station is going to be a huge hit, and I am insisting on it. Mansour joked,  It could be pay-per-view.  I want her to testify for 12 hours,  Coulter added.  If they can t find anyone, I ll be refilling her water glass, I ll bring her all the caffeine she needs. I do not want this woman to stop talking.  I don t have the 24-hour TV station, yet, but I insist that Breitbart radio turn itself over from now until election day,  Coulter continued. I do not want the Democrats to be able to separate themselves from Julie Swetnick. This is the party of Julie Swetnick. We ll go with Brett Kavanaugh. You ve thrown everything you have at him. We think he may have stepped on a bug once, and PETA is going to come after him. But you guys are the party of Julie Swetnick,  Coulter said. This is no longer the party of FDR, Kennedy, and Truman. This is the party of Julie Swetnick,  Coulter emphasized.  I ll take that going into the midterms. I can t get enough of this lady.  What is it, now, where you can basically just scream, I was raped!  and we re all supposed to suspend due process and the presumption of innocence? What the hell is going on here? If Julie Swetnick isn t proof enough that women lie, what else is?  Mansour asked. Do not knock Julie Swetnick. My heroine, Julie Swetnick,  Coulter joked. Did you see that interview with Kate Snow?  Coulter asked.  Of course you did, because they ve been replaying it all day on MSNBC, which is totally weird. I ve never had my interests aligned with the interests of MSNBC, so I don t know what they re thinking over there. But the look in that poor Kate Snow s eyes as she s interviewing this obvious grifter, going into the interview thinking, Whoa, this is going to be gold,  and then five questions in, Kate Snow is just praying, Please let the power go out in this building. Please let this entire thing be shut down.  And poor MSNBC is just humiliating her by running it over and over and over again, and they re proud of it. Mansour noted that when Snow asked Swetnick if she could provide any names of witnesses to back up her allegations that there were mass gang-rape parties taking place in Maryland in the 1980s, Swetnick offered four names, of whom,  one person is dead, the other person has never heard of her, and the two others won t answer the phone.  If you can get Michael Avenatti on the phone, I think there might still be some insane asylums where he might find some new clients,  joked Coulter. I love this guy,  said Mansour of Michael Avenatti.   I want him to run in 2020 because he would be so entertaining.  Maybe an Avenatti-Swetnick ticket,  quipped Coulter.Coulter mocked ubiquitous news media descriptions of Christine Blasey Ford as  credible.  Everybody was calling Ford credible,  said Mansour.  This is a woman who basically claimed that she had to travel across the country in a Conestoga wagon because she was afraid of flying, and then when she s there testifying, she s like, Oh yeah, I fly all the time.   That was a really big lie,  said Coulter of Ford s claimed fear of flying.  That was not only evidence of her trauma that she couldn t be alone in an enclosed space, but that s why we had to wait for a week for her to show up? And it turns out the whole thing is nonsense. She s flying to Tahiti all the time, going surfing, an activity that most people consider frightening. She s not exactly curled up in a little ball, Miss Surfer Girl. Coulter remarked,  Let s compare [Christine Ford] with manifest lunatic Julie Swetnick, who has all the confidence of an insane person. That s what I expected Ford to be like, and I will admit she was not that. Coulter mocked Democrats  belief that an FBI investigation will confer credence to uncorroborated allegations:  Apparently, the FBI is done [with their investigation], and they re just sitting around saying, Okay, how long do we have to hold this? How long do we have to pretend we re still working here? When do you guys want it?  Coulter went on,  Democrats don t want [the FBI report] made public, presumably so they can lie about what s in it. Now, I m trusting [Utah Senator] Orrin Hatch on this, but I think the whole idea of this was, we have to clear this guy s name, it has to be clear for the entire country, so in the abstract, I don t really see the point of keeping it secret. I do find it very curious that it s Democrats who want to keep it secret.  This is the first time [Democrats] don t want to leak something,  Mansour replied. They ll leak the parts they like,  Coulter replied.  We know they re going to selectively leak. I m kind of thinking the whole report should be released.  I think they should just go ahead and confirm Kavanaugh, and then spend any time they can save from the Russia investigation   because you know that s so important   I just want to know all about Julie Swetnick,  Coulter joked.Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

Milano said,  I m filled with a lot of rage. It started last night. I couldn t sleep at all last night. I can t believe this is where we are. We are making distinct choices about what we want to be as a country. We re making distinct choices about the people we re putting in positions of power, whether it be Trump or Kavanaugh or our institutions. Sexual abuse has been institutionalized in this country, and it is heartbreaking for me. I don t think we can allow another generation of women and children to feel as though their government isn t listening, that doesn t care, and they are invisible. I m filled with rage, for Sarah to go on and say he was just stating the facts. The sky blue. I can state that fact. If I do it totally a little off, like the sky is blue, I m mocking someone that may have said that. Tone is everything right now. We are making a choice. The Republican party is making a choice to back this man and this administration in this time, right now, right here and history will reflect upon this time as being devastating. I will tell you this; 34 days till the midterm election, there were 800,000 new voters on voter registration day. I think women, I think survivors, I think men are not going to allow this to continue. We re going to take back the House and maybe even the Senate. She continued,  I will also add that 80% of victims of sexual assault do not report at all. We re talking about a very minuscule point of women that are falsely reporting. Also, men are having a hard time right now. I mean, come on. I feel as though he s completely belittling the intelligence of the American people. She added,  Do they agree with him or is he using some sort of cult-like force to try to make them see that? I m not sure if you were to have a real conversation with any American whether they be Democrat or Republican, that they would side with this kind of behavior where we ve reached a low we re mocking people and their stories of hurt and of pain. Who are we? Who do we want to be as a country? What are we trying to project to the young people of this world, to the young people of this country? It s heartbreaking to me. I think yes, we re in a time that s very gray. This is the #MeToo generation. What is happening right now is we re defining boundaries. Boundaries that have never been defined before. As Trump might say that white men have it very difficult right now, I m saying that women, young people, have had it difficult for generations and generations and generations. We will not be silenced any longer. If that means that men have a hard time right now, then I m sorry, this is the way the pendulum has to shift for us to have the equality and security in our country and our societal views of what it means to be a woman. We are considered less than. We cannot stand for it anymore. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/03/nolte-new-evidence-eliminates-christine-blasey-fords-residual-credibility/","Breitbart News has already gone into great detail to lay out the facts that unravel the allegations Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Since these individual reports, Ford s story has continued to crumble.Real Clear Politics has looked at the records surrounding Ford s claim that an extensive 2012 remodel of her home involving two front doors triggered her memory of Kavanaugh s alleged 1982 assault attempt.Documents, however, show that the remodel took place in 2008 and that the second front door was not an odd request from a traumatized woman fearing she could not escape, but someone looking to make extra income renting out part of her home   possibly in violation of local zoning laws.A sworn statement released by a man alleging to be Ford s former boyfriend appears to have answered one very important question. During her testimony last week, why did sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell ask Ford if she had ever helped someone prepare for a polygraph? It was such an out-of-nowhere question, a seeming waste of time.Ford answered that she had  never  helped anyone prepare for a polygraph.Well, now we likely know why. The Senate Judiciary Committee might have known about this former boyfriend, and that under penalty of imprisonment, he would tell them Ford once used her skills in psychology to help a friend prepare for a polygraph.If this is true, Ford could be guilty of perjury.The boyfriend also alleges that nearly a year after they broke up, Ford used one of his credit cards to charge $600 and then lied about it. It was only after he threatened to get fraud investigators involved that she admitted to it.As far as the already-debunked claim about Ford being afraid to fly   a claim that delayed the Kavanaugh confirmation a full week   he writes,  [W]e traveled around the Hawaiian islands including one time on a propeller plane. Dr. Ford never indicated a fear of flying. During the ten years he knew her and the six years they were a couple, she never mentioned any kind of sexual assault, a Brett Kavanaugh, or a fear of closed spaces. In California, he writes,  she ended up living in a very small, 500 sq. ft. house with one door. For this reason, Senate investigators are again demanding Ford s attorneys release all the information pertaining to her polygraph test and her therapist notes. In the court of public opinion and through our monstrous media, both have been used as evidence against Kavanaugh, but no one has investigated either.As of now, Ford s legal team is refusing to release anything.ADDED: The friend in question denied to the far-left CNN that Ford helped her prepare for a polygraph. But unlike Ford s former boyfriend, she made this claim to an anti-Trump cable channel and not while under oath.As of this writing, Ford s legal team is still refusing to release either her polygraph information or therapist notes to the Senate Judiciary Committee.In fact, as you can see below, Ford s team is using the request for this pertinent information to delay the proceedings further. Ford will only provide this information if the FBI agrees to  schedule  an interview with her. Considering the games she played to delay her testimony for a full a week (the lies about being afraid to fly), heaven only knows how long ito would take to  schedule  that interview.There is no need for the FBI to speak with Ford, she has already testified in-depth, but they are now playing more games, as opposed to providing the evidence that is supposed to bolster her allegations:Ford s lawyers tell Grassley that they will provide her therapy notes, polygraph data to the FBI once she is interviewed (that hasn t happened as of now) pic.twitter.com/t1N6jhDPwE  Seung Min Kim (@seungminkim) October 3, 2018Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

[Dick] Durbin refused to read my investigation and record with the independent counselcompletely refusedeven [though] they were asked by the committee, and the committee said, This woman has credible evidence,   Broaddrick told Breitbart News.She also pointed out the hypocrisy of Democrats for focusing on the Kavanaugh allegations while not giving equal time to the sexual misconduct allegations against Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN).

I don t care how many members they chase, how many people they harass here in the halls  we will not be intimated by these people.  pic.twitter.com/JqwhEaWN6h  Joshua Dov Caplan (@joshdcaplan) October 3, 2018 Colleagues, including my friend, the Democratic leader, have tried to get Judge Kavanaugh to withdraw from this process because of these uncorroborated and sometimes absolutely ridiculous allegations,  McConnell began.  When that did work, then the far-left tried to bully and intimidate members of this body, Republican United States senators. They ve tried to bully and intimidate us. Without referencing the senator s name, the Senate Majority Leader lamented how organized far-left protesters recently drove Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his wife Heidi out of a Washington, D.C.-area eatery, Fiola, over the lawmaker s support for Kavanaugh. One of our colleagues and his family were effectively run out of a restaurant in recent days by these people. And other reported that protesters physically blocked his car door,  McConnell said.  Some have seen other organized far-left protesters camp out at there homes. He continued:  I m not suggesting we re the victims here, but I want to make it clear to these people who are chasing my members around the hall here or harassing them at the airports or going to their homes we re not going to be intimidated by these people. There is no chance in the world they re going to scare us out of doing our duty. I don t care how many members they chase, how many people they harass here in the halls, we will not be intimated by these people, how many people they harass here in the halls. I want to make one thing perfectly clear. We will not be intimated by these people. As the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) winds down its probe into decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against Kavanaugh, Republican leadership is said to be planning on bringing the Supreme Court nominee s confirmation to the full Senate to vote next week. As Breitbart News reported, Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and Susan Collins (R-ME), three Republican key swing votes, have yet to decide if they will support his confirmation.

Scarborough added the mainstream media s bias then leads to Trump  light dynamite and blow the whole thing up.

I had one beer, that s the only thing I remember,  the president said, mimicking the 51-year-old California psychology professor.  I don t know. I don t know. Upstairs, downstairs, I don t know. I don t remember. Moments later, President Trump lamented how the left has rushed to condemn Kavanaugh over the allegations despite a lack of corroborating evidence.  I looked at him, and I looked at the man that we appointed just before him, Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was put through the paces but nothing like what s happening now, which is just crazy. They have gang rape  many times,  the president told rally attendees.  Well, that turned out to be false.

Swetnick, who is represented by Resistance TV lawyer Michael Avenatti, recently made headlines after accusing Brett Kavanaugh of being present at high school parties where there were gang rapes. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations, saying,  I don t know who this is and this never happened. Dennis Ketterer claims that during his relationship with Swetnick, he had a conversation with her about how she liked group sex.A Utah man named Dennis Ketterer reached out to the Hatch office this week with information about accuser Julie Swetnick, and her allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.His full statement made under pentaly of felony to @senjudiciary can be found here > https://t.co/0dSwAHlnVe pic.twitter.com/YSbuONkA5W  Senator Hatch Office (@senorrinhatch) October 2, 2018The letter reads:During a conversation about our sexual preferences, things got derailed when Julie told me that she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time. In fact sometimes with several at one time. She wanted to know if that would be ok in our relationship.I asked her if this was just a fantasy of hers. She responded that she first tried sex with multiple guys while in high school and still liked it from time-to-time. She brought it up because she wanted to know if I would be interested in that.A.I.D.S. was a huge issue at the time. And I had children. Due to her having a directly stated penchant for group sex, I decided not to see her anymore. It put my head back on straight. That was the last conversation we had.Julie never said anything about being sexually assaulted, raped, gang-raped or having sex against her will. She never mentioned Brett Kavanaugh in any capacity. [emphases added]Ketterer then claims in his letter that Julie Swetnick s own father told him years later that she  had psychological and other problems. He also reveals that he was a victim of sexual abuse himself, writing,  I know what it s like to be sexually assaulted and not be believed. I was nine years old when it happened at the hands of my grandfather s best friend. Finally, he ends the letter by simply stating,  based on my direct experience with Julie, I do not believe her allegations against Mr. Kavanaugh. His letter has already prompted a response from Resistance TV lawyer Michael Avenatti. The letter from Dennis Ketterer is garbage  the GOP is desperate,  he tweeted.  The allegations he makes are false and without any basis. We demand that the FBI interview my client & him, and that anyone found to have submitted false info be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

[Kavanaugh] apologized to Amy Klobuchar for snapping at her. What would you do if you were accused of all these things, had your life ruined?  Here s what I think,  Graham said,  Amy Klobuchar should apologize to Kavanaugh and his family for being part of a smear campaign that I haven t seen in over 20 years in politics. Graham also said the  Kavanaugh bump is real,  that his view of the polling shows the ongoing smear campaign against Kavanaugh has energized Republicans like never before. Every race in these Trump/red states held by a Democrat [senator]   there s been a surge by Republicans,  Graham said.Referring to Democrats, he added,  You ve been able to do something, my friends on the other side, I could never do: unite this party.  Whether you re a Trump Republican,  McCain Republican, Romney Republican, Bush Republican, you re mad as hell because we re all united that this is unfair, [and] what they re doing to this good, decent man cannot stand. Graham then sent a message to the holdouts in the GOP, those three senators   Flake, Murkowski, and Collins   who have still not said they will vote to confirm Kavanaugh.  To do it, you had to destroy a good man, and the only way he stays destroyed? If we buy into this crap. Graham said he believes Sens.

Graham seemed less sure about Sen. Flake (R-AZ).  He voted yes in committee, but now, he s talking about temperament and yearbook entries.

They have gang rape  many times,  he said.  Well that turned out to be false. So many different charges. Guilty until proven innocent    that s very dangerous for our country. Without directly referencing Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, President Trump lamented how  evil people  had  shattered  the lives of the Kavanaugh family by politicizing shaky accusations against the judge.  A man s life is in tatters. A man s life is shattered. His wife is shattered, his daughters, who are beautiful, incredible young kids  they destroyed people,  the president said.  They want to destroy people. These are really evil people.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/donald-trump-mocks-kavanaugh-accuser-christine-dont-remember-ford/","President Donald Trump mocked Christine Ford on Tuesday, the woman who accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.Trump mocked Ford for testifying that she had one beer, but then said  I don t remember  when asked about the exact date, time, or place of the alleged assault. I had one beer, that s the only thing I remember,  Trump said, imitating Ford s testimony.  I don t know. I don t know. Upstairs, downstairs, I don t know. I don t remember. He signaled his disgust with the allegations that extended Kavanaugh s confirmation vote in the Senate. A man s life is in tatters, a man s life is shattered,  Trump said.  His wife is shattered   his daughters who are beautiful, incredible young kids. He cautioned that the new standard set by the left was dangerous for the country. They destroy people, these are really evil people,  he said, and added.  Guilty until proven innocent  that s very dangerous for our country. The fired-up crowd cheered,  We Want Kavanaugh! We Want Kavanaugh!  as Trump continued his speech.He also repeated his insults of Democrats in the Senate who were attacking Kavanaugh, including  Da Nang  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who  cried like a baby  when he was caught lying about his record of service in Vietnam, as well as insults of Sen. Corey Booker and Sen. Dianne Feinstein.Trump also pointed to Sen. Patrick Leahy s use of alcohol. Oh, he s never had a drink in his life,  Trump joked.  Check it out. Look under Patrick Leahy slash drink. He also named Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, but added,  I ll leave him alone.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/ex-boyfriend-says-dr-ford-coached-friend-for-polygraph-had-no-fear-of-flying/","A man who dated Brett Kavanaugh s primary accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, for six years claims she had no fear of flying, no fear of small spaces or rooms with single exits, and once used her psychology training to prepare a friend for a polygraph examination, according to a Tuesday Fox News report.In a sworn statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee dated Tuesday, the California man claims to have met the then-Christine Blasey  in 1989 or 1990,  then had been romantically involved with her for about six years from 1992 to 1998. In that time, he claims to have witnessed Ford, then studying psychology, coach a close friend as she prepared for government administered polygraph exams. Fox News s Shannon Bream posted a redacted version of the letter on Twitter:BREAKING:  Fox s @johnrobertsFox obtains letter from Ford ex-boyfriend alleging:  dated for 6 yrs, never told of sex assault, Ford coached friend on taking polygraph, flew frequently w/o expressing any fear of flying/tight spaces/limited exits.  Doesn t want to b/c  involved . pic.twitter.com/jVeW0qaJD0  Shannon Bream (@ShannonBream) October 3, 2018The man s claims appear to contradict Ford s testimony under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, where she told outside counsel Rachel Mitchell that she  never  gave  tips or advice to somebody looking to take a polygraph test. Prosecutor Rachel Mitchell:  Have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test? Christine Blasey Ford:  Never.  pic.twitter.com/k5Pm424f22  Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) September 30, 2018The alleged ex-boyfriend also claims that Ford frequently flew, including in small propeller aircraft, without complaint over the course of their relationship and had no fear of small spaces or rooms with only one exit. Ford s claims that phobias of these things have plagued her since the early 1980s as a result of a 17-year-old Kavanaugh attacking her have been central elements of her story.Further, the man claims Ford never mentioned being a victim of sexual assault in the eight years they knew each other and never once mentioned Kavanaugh s name. Finally, he claims their relationship ended amid infidelity and credit card fraud on her part. He does, however, claim that he  finds Ford believable  and did not  want to become involved  with the investigatory process.Exactly when the Senate Judiciary Committee staff came into possession of the letter is not clear. Mitchell s specific questioning about polygraph prepration during Ford s committee testimony, however, may indicate committee staff had some knowledge of the allegations laid out in the letter at least as early as last week.This is a developing story.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/10/02/hirono-sexual-predator-trump-has-a-mistrust-of-women/","Tuesday on CNN s  Anderson Cooper 360,  Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) commented on President Donald Trump mocking the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford against Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh tonight during a rally in Mississippi.Hirono said,  We can always count on the president to go down to the lowest common denominator, mock people, call people names, attack them. This is what he does. And the thing that Dr. Ford did remember, with 100% recollection, was that it was Brett Kavanaugh who attacked her. When asked about Trump s comments earlier today that it is a scary time for men, who can be falsely accused, Hirono said,  No. That really flows from a total mistrust of women. They must think that we all sit around making up stories about them. We have a few other things that we like to do, such as getting on with our lives and making a living and all of that. So I also know that his son said the same thing and I guess the apple doesn t fall very far from the tree. And you know, this from an admitted sexual predator. She added,  So, actually, it is the women in this country, mainly, who have been the victims of these kinds of assaults from men, since practically, I want to say, time immemorial. And for them to act like the victims is the reason that women, mainly, who have these kinds of horrible experiences, do not come forward because they are mocked, they are not believed. They are told, we don t want to hear from you. That has to stop. There are a lot of angry and determined women in this country now. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/10/02/nolte-after-enabling-franken-covering-up-weinstein-bombshells-nbc-mocks-kavanaugh-via-snl/","Over the weekend, Saturday Night Live gleefully piled on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and did so less than a year after this very same SNL came out in full-throated support for credibly accused serial groper Al Franken.Let s back up a bitThe reason Democrats and their establishment media allies are now launching conspiracy theories about Kavanaugh  lying  about his teenage drinking is that the sexual misconduct allegations against him have collapsed. Simply put, by any objective measure, Kavanaugh has been wrongly accused, smeared, a victim of sexual McCarthysim. In my four decades of watching politics, never before have I witnessed a moral obscenity such as this.The opposite, however, is true of disgraced former Sen. Al Franken (D-MN).Franken is not only credibly accused, we have photographic evidence of him   not as a teenager, but as a 55-year-old man   groping a sleeping woman s breasts.What s more, and this is important, almost all of Franken s other half-dozen or so accusers are Democrats, leftists, and even supporters of his.One alleged victim (number eight) says Franken groped her at a Media Matters gala celebrating Barack Obama s 2009 presidential inauguration.Another claims Franken groped her while she posed for a photo with him at a left-wing event in 2007.Yet another says the soon-to-be senator grabbed her butt that same year at a Democrat fundraiser.Stephanie Kemplin, an army veteran, says Franken grabbed her breast while she was having her photo taken with him in 2003.Lindsay Menz wanted a photo with Franken  in 2010 and says he abused the occasion to  put his hand full-fledged on my rear. A former Democrat congressional aide accused Franken of attempting to kiss her without consent because, as she claims he put it,   It s my right as an entertainer. So, we not only have a PHOTOGRAPH of Franken groping a woman, we have some half-dozen Democrat women coming forward to accuse Franken. By any measure, this is as credible as sexual misconduct allegations get, and yet And yetAND YETSaturday Night Live ran to Al Franken s rescue. Even though the groping photograph had already been released, even though multiple women had already come forward to allege the same, 36 former SNL staffers signed a letter in support of Senator Handsy. Thirty six! All of them women.But this very same SNL, the SNL that wrist-flicked photographic evidence and multiple allegations against Franken, was eager to pile on the wrongfully accused Kavanaugh; and if that is not rich enough for you, the man playing Kavanaugh was Matt Damon   who is also a Franken apologist, who also dismissed his serial misconduct as a  terrible joke. Oh, and let s not forget who the Big Star of this very same SNL is   you know, Mr. Alec Baldwin, the raging homophobe whose history of mistreating women (including his own daughter) reaches back decades.But now we get to my favorite part of all this, and that would be Rapey NBC   the network that broadcasts the garbage fire of grope-enabling that is SNL.Yes, NBC, that den of sexual misconduct, that hive of misconduct-enablers that has chewed up and spit out countless female victims.Yes, Rapey NBC, the former home of Matt Lauer, of Dan Swinzen, of Larry Gaetano, of Harold Ford Jr., of Mark Halperin, of Matt Zimmerman, of David Corn all now gone from view because the allegations against them were just that credible.But it took the #MeToo movement to get them out.And after they were finally out, how many cries of  Everybody knew!  did we hear?Too damn many.Somehow it gets worseStill employed at NBC is Chris Matthews, an accused sexual harasser who reportedly settled a lawsuit.Somehow it gets worserNBC hired sports anchor Mike Tirico after he had been credibly accused of stalking, groping, and making explicit comments to female colleagues.And now we get to the worsterest (yes, that s a word because it  identifies  as such), and I am of course talking about the alleged cover up   not only to protect the big shots at Rapey NBC, but to protect Harvey Weinstein.Let s start with the fact that Rapey NBC refused to hire outside investigators to look at its countless sex scandals, which is why we get headlines like,  NBC News Investigated NBC News and Found No Culture of Harassment at NBC News. Yes, Rapey NBC investigated Rapey NBC and found nothing amiss, even though  Everyone knew! And let s never forget that the same Rapey NBC that just savaged an innocent man   and not only on SNL, but with the news division publishing a uncorroborated, unverified, un-vetted allegation against Kavanaugh that was quickly recanted   is the same NBC that had audio tape of Harvey Weinstein admitting to groping women and refused to run the story.On top of that, Rapey NBC had all kinds of corroborating witnesses alleging Weinstein was a sexual predator, and instead of running the story, Rapye NBC let Ronan Farrow, his game-changing story, and the eventual Pulitzer that went with it, walk right out the door.Not to worry, though, because Rapey NBC assures us this has nothing to do with the fact that the president of NBC News, Noah Oppenheim, is a wannabe screenwriter who had been spotted attending swanky events with Weinstein.And I m sure it has absolutely nothing to do with Andrew Lack, the chairman of NBC News, and his reported history of looking the other way when it comes to sexual harassment under his watch. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/nomination-expert-hundreds-of-people-have-been-asked-about-kavanaugh-drinking-habits-by-fbi/","Gregg Nunziata, former chief nominations counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on a conference call with reporters on Tuesday that  hundreds  of people have been asked in six different FBI background checks whether they believe Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has an alcohol or substance abuse problem. In these background investigations   and now there s been half a dozen of Kavanaugh over his life   it s a standard question for every single witness they talk to: Do you have any knowledge of alcohol or substance abuse by the nominee?   Nunziata said when Breitbart News asked how the agency vets individuals on this issue. We can know without knowing what s in that file   we can know that hundreds of people who have known the judge over his career have been asked that specific question and that information would already be in the file,  said Nunziata on the call, hosted by the Judicial Crisis Network.Kavanaugh has served in several high-profile, high-level positions in the government, including as an assistant to former President George W. Bush and as a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for the last 12 years.Only after Kavanaugh s 30-plus-hour confirmation hearings concluded did Christine Blasey Ford s claim that he sexually assaulted her at a high school party in the early 1980s become public.And when the committee held a hearing to allow Ford to tell her story and Kavanaugh to respond, Democrats repeatedly questioned the nominee about his drinking habits. That has continued with Democrats even calling for the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh s drinking habits.But, according to Nunziata, it is a standard part of any FBI background check to determine if someone seeking a position in the federal government has an alcohol or substance abuse problem.After Ford and Kavanaugh testified last week, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), a Trump critic who is not running for reelection and is said to have presidential ambitions, called for a one-week supplemental FBI investigation to interview Kavanaugh and Ford further and others implicated in alleged incidents that happened decades ago.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has said that Kavanaugh s nomination, which was moved out of committee, will be voted on this week.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/10/02/michael-steele-kavanaughs-aberrant-behavior-at-hearing-a-cultural-moment-gop-is-ignoring/","Tuesday on MSNBC s  Deadline,  former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said Republican politicians and President Donald Trump are  ignoring  Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh s  aberrant  behavior during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.Steele said,  Let s start with what the president said; at a base level, there is truth in the idea that we don t want to create an environment in which anyone can be accused of something falsely or wrongly to get back, payback, you know, for bad date or something like that, God forbid. But then the question becomes so then what is the resolution of that? How do you begin to solve that particular question? What are you contributing, Mr. President, to helping us as a nation deal with something that is so profoundly important in light of the nominee you have put forward and the issues that have been raised there? So the answer to that is, Nothing. I have nothing to contribute other than to bloviate about how bad this is for white men.  He continued,  He s not the right messenger given the baggage that he brings to the table on this issue. There s still at least 18 to 20 unresolved accusations against the sitting president of the United States on this very issue. Of which we have him on tape giving us a sort of how-to in terms of what he does and how he approaches women in his relationships. Host Nicolle Wallace said,  Grab them in the bleep. Steele continued,  Exactly. So you have that piece. The other piece, though, is how you put in motion and set up the conversation of Judge Kavanaugh. It s not any longer about the allegations. That s going to be resolved by the FBI. Now we have to step back and look at how the man performed. How he responded as a judge under fire in a critical situation which was very clearly an aberrant response. I was sitting there with the jaw open, Like dude really?  Particularly when he went after Senator Klobuchar in a very personal way. That to me should bring a pause to everyone. You know, Nicolle, it won t. Our team is prepared to die on the hill for this man and take with it every value that we have in that relationship with women. On actor Matt Damon s parody of Kavanaugh, Steele added,  If he does make it to the bench, that then becomes the caricature of his tenure on the bench. You re the no going to get past news articles. You re not going to get past video images comparing that Saturday Night Live  sketch to, you know, the man in the moment. And I think that s the problem about this that the president, the White House, and Republicans, particularly McConnell on the hill, just don t care about and are ignoring. That, yes, we re going to push this through, we re going to plow through this but going to bring with it a great taint. I think it is a cultural moment.

Jeff Flake (R) criticized Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, but said he is waiting to hear from the FBI before making a decision on whether to confirm him. I just hope that we find fact. I have an open mind, just like I had in the hearings, and we ll see what they come back with, I don t want to prejudge it,  he said at an event on Tuesday hosted by the left-leaning outlet The Atlantic.Flake told the outlet over the weekend that he was planning to confirm Kavanaugh unless the FBI finds something.  Yes. I m a conservative. He s a conservative. I plan to support him unless they turn up something and they might,  he had said.The Senate is poised to vote on Kavanaugh s confirmation, after the conclusion of a one-week investigation by the FBI on allegations of sexual misconduct made against the nominee.But Flake caused confusion Tuesday after he said Kavanaugh s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week was  sharp and partisan  and  we can t have that on the court.  I was very troubled by the tone of the, of the remarks. The initial, uh, defense that Judge Kavanaugh gave was something like I told my wife, I hope that I would sound that indignant if I were, uh, if I felt that I was unjustly, you know, maligned,   he said. But then it went on, and the interaction with the members was sharp and partisan, and that concerns me, and I tell myself, Give a little leeway because of what he s been through.  But, on the other hand, we can t have this on the court. We simply can t,  he added.Flake appeared to disavow those comments moments after walking off stage, according to a reporter from The Atlantic, who said she asked him if his comments meant he would not vote to confirm Kavanaugh even if the FBI found nothing to corroborate sexual misconduct allegations made against him. I didn t say that   Flake told the reporter.  I wasn t referring to him. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) postponed a vote to confirm Kavanaugh to this week, after Flake supported advancing his nomination to the full Senate on the condition the FBI would be given one week to look into the allegations.Flake said the FBI s investigation would be limited in time and scope, only to the two  credible  allegations against Kavanaugh, but he also said he hoped the FBI would follow up on any leads from their initial interviews.During the event on Tuesday, where he spoke next to his good friend Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), he rued the partisanship of today s politics, and said he hoped to stay involved after he leaves the Senate in November.

While discussing Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, anchor Jake Tapper said,  You write glowingly about Ted Kennedy. But I want to ask you, because, I ve heard Ted Kennedy s name invoked in the last week or two and Bill Clinton s name invoked in the last week or two, by conservatives saying, Democrats ceded the moral high ground on a lot of these sexual assault and sexual harassment issues by standing by people like Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy because of the good things, in their view, that they did. Kerry responded,  I don t think that s an accurate way to say it. Many of us were very critical of President Clinton on the choice he made with respect to what happened in the White House. We just didn t believe   I didn t believe, and I speak for myself, that it was an impeachable offense. That s the issue. Tapper then asked about Kennedy, and Kerry answered,  Similarly, people have been critical through the years, where   and he was critical of himself. He stood up and owned moments where he knew he d stepped over the line. So, I think that   and he wasn t about to be nominated to a lifetime position. In fact, he said to the people of Massachusetts, if you think I shouldn t stay here, then, you know   and he took those returns and then he was elected another six times. That s a very different thing from a lifetime confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States, where you may have to rule on some of these issues that come up.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/nbcs-kate-snow-my-interview-shows-julie-swetnick-has-credibility-issues/","NBC News national correspondent Kate Snow said Tuesday, Julie Swetnick, the third woman to accuse Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, has credibility issues following their sit-down interview.A transcript is as follows: MELVIN: Credibility, does [Julie Swetnick] have credibility issues?SNOW: I would say yes, because, there are, just to be clear, things that she said to me that differ from her initial statement, which was a sworn statement from last week submitted to the [Senate] Judiciary Committee. That in many people s minds raises a credibility question. Republicans have repeatedly raised that she s been involved in lawsuits and some other things that they say question her credibility. The interview itself, again if you watch the whole thing, you ll see even her description of how and why she came forward and when is a little unclear. It s a little bit hazy. There were moments in the interview, if you watch it, I think you ll see that she seems a little unsure.MELVIN: So, her motivations for coming forward for right now, we don t know precisely what those are?SNOW: Well, she says she wants to be interviewed by the FBI. To tell her side of it, she has a story to tell and she says she wants it heard. She doesn t see why her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, they don t see why the FBI wouldn t talk to her because as Avenatti said to me, if she s telling the truth, the FBI is going to see that and if she s lying, the FBI will see that.  What are they scared of was his point of view.MELVIN: How did she explain the differences between what she said to you and the claims she made in that sworn statement?SNOW: I think she would say she s just being more descriptive now. For example, the punch, everybody s heard this notion that the punch was spiked at these parties. In her statement last week, she said that she had heard this, that Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge his friend, were spiking the punch. In my interview with her, she didn t go that far. She said well, I saw them around the punch bowl  and I asked her directly, did you see Brett Kavanaugh spike the punch and try to get girls drunk or put quaaludes in the punch and she said no, I never saw that.  So, there s a discrepancy between the two things.

Jeff Flake (R-AZ) convinced fellow Republicans to back an FBI investigation of Kavanaugh, the NRCC s fundraising skyrocketed.On September 29, the NRCC sent out a text, requesting donations, which read,  Hi, it s URGENT! We need 324 more conservatives to show their support for Trump & his majority before TONIGHT. Will you take a stand? In response to the text, the number of donations the NRCC received increased by 175 percent, the amount of money raised grew by 194 percent, the average gift grew by 111 percent, and the average raised off of the text grew by 226 percent.The Politico article follows separate reports from Republican strategists who contended that the Kavanaugh confirmation process has dropped a  grenade into the electorate,  energizing the Republican base.An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that Republicans have nearly matched Democrat interest in the midterm election.Glen Bolger, a GOP pollster, tweeted on Friday,  Seeing a significant jump in GOP voter interest in the elections this week.

Josh Holmes (@HolmesJosh) September 28, 2018Several polls from red states such as North Dakota, West Virginia, and Missouri revealed that they want Kavanaugh confirmed to the nation s highest court. In one poll from the Judicial Crisis Network (JCN), 56 percent of North Dakotans want Kavanaugh confirmed, while only 26 oppose his confirmation. Fifty-eight percent of West Virginians want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court, compared to 28 percent who do not want the Senate to confirm Kavanaugh.Breitbart News reported that these polls suggest that if Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) were to vote against Kavanaugh, they could see a significant electoral backlash.A similar phenomenon was noted in a Remington Research Group survey which found that 49 percent of voters said that they are less likely to vote for Sen.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/report-fbi-kavanaugh-probe-to-finish-by-wednesday/","The FBI s seventh background investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaugh, prompted by Sen. Jeff Flake s (R-AZ) insistence, will conclude Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, according to a Tuesday Wall Street Journal report.Citing sources familiar, the WSJ claims the probe will finish sooner than the supposedly hard Friday deadline Flake laid out in his impromptu announcement at last Friday s Senate Judiciary Committee vote that he would need a new FBI investigation before he voted on Kavanaugh s confirmation on the Senate floor.The investigation, a demand from Senate Democrats and the broader political left since shortly after Kavanaugh s first accuser Christine Blasey Ford s 36-year old allegation went public, became a reality after Flake met with Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) just ahead of Friday s committee vote. Although Flake voted, along with the rest of the committee s Republicans, to recommend Kavanaugh for confirmation, he was allowed to speak ahead of the vote and stated he would not vote without a new FBI investigation to last not longer than one week.Since Friday, the FBI has been interviewing parties related to the various allegations from Kavanaugh s high school and college years, most prominently his high school friend and alleged accomplice Mark Judge. This represents the seventh time the FBI has looked into Kavanaugh s background since he began working on sensitive matters as a government attorney in the early 1990s. The sixth investigation concluded this summer in relation to his Supreme Court nomination.Since the start of this latest investigation, Democrats and the left-leaning press have focused increasingly on Kavanaugh s history with alcohol, as opposed to the actual allegation of sexual misconduct. For example, the New York Times published a piece on Kavanaugh having possibly thrown ice at someone during a bar room scuffle in 1985, apparently in an attempt to discredit the nominee s characterization of his youthful partying.In  a press conference call Tuesday morning, the Judicial Crisis Network, the leading outside group supporting Kavanaugh s nomination, pushed back on notions that Kavanaugh s history with alcohol had been insufficiently examined in the six previous FBI investigations. In these background investigations   and now there s been half a dozen of Kavanaugh over his life   it s a standard question for every single witness they talk to: Do you have any knowledge of alcohol or substance abuse by the nominee?   Gregg Nunziata, former chief nominations counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee said in response to a Breitbart News inquiry.  We can know without knowing what s in that file   we can know that hundreds of people who have known the judge over his career have been asked that specific question and that information would already be in the file. Earlier on Tuesday, the Senate leadership of each party gave a press availability in the capitol. There, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) made clear that he expected the FBI to finish the probe  soon  and reiterated his guarantee that the final vote on Kavanaugh would come  this week. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), at the same podium, emphasized that any delays in Kavanaugh s vote were not Democrats  doing, but that of Flake and fellow reputed swing-vote Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Susan Collins (R-ME). He issued new demands on the White House that they publicly disclose the directive for the new investigation. He also chose a new tack in his opposition to Kavanaugh s nomination, focusing not on the various uncorroborated allegations of sexual misconduct from Kavanaugh s teenage years, but on the  partisanship  he displayed at his fiery appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week.Breitbart News s Penny Starr contributed to the reporting in this article.

While compelling emotionally, Christine Blasey Ford has no witnesses and no facts to back up her story.There was no legitimate reason the allegations were not summarily evaluated, and a Judiciary Committee vote was taken last week.I was honored to be able to attend Friday s Kavanaugh hearing  a hearing that should never have taken place. It was intense, dramatic, emotional, and outrageous, but nothing changed. The allegations are not sufficient to derail Judge Brett Kavanaugh s nomination.Leftist law breaking, rule breaking, violence, and disruption have already marred the public Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. The Senate has allowed this circus to continue, and in the process has delayed a timely confirmation vote on Judge Kavanaugh.The vote to confirm can t come soon enough. That the Senate hasn t voted yet is shameful.The Senate Judiciary Committee issued a statement requesting that the administration instruct the FBI to conduct a supplemental FBI background investigation with respect to the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court.The Senate request was for the FBI to investigation  credible allegations.  There are no  credible allegations. Nevertheless, President Trump authorized the supplemental investigation as requested.If fairly conducted, this  supplemental investigation  could have been over yesterday. The Committee requested that the FBI investigation take no more than a week. This will not satisfy Leftists trying to destroy Kavanaugh.After witnessing the spectacle in person yesterday, the Senate owes Judge Kavanaugh an apology. And perhaps the best apology would be a vote finally to confirm him.Tom Fitton is president of Judicial Watch.

When their credibility has been challenged by intimates, people that knew the candidate well, as a classmate. When his temperament has been revealed in an emotional moment, where he used language that, frankly, shocked a lot of us. And then ultimately, not whether he s innocent or guilty   this is not a trial   but ultimately, has enough questions be raised that we should not move on to another candidate?Ultimately, the Supreme Court is not an entitlement. Just because you went to Yale or were president of your class doesn t entitle you to the Supreme Court. This is a sacred institution and the people who should be on it   whether you disagree with their political or judicial philosophy at all   the people who should be on the Supreme Court should preserve the integrity of the court, and be beyond the reproach of these difficult partisan times.

Little did the leftists know as they tried to destroy Clarence Thomas they were creating the most effective grassroots warrior against the left of our generation. And this last week with Kavanaugh, I can t imagine how many more thousands of Andrew Breitbarts were born.Conversions and spiritual awakenings are very familiar to those who are Christians. From the beginning, our faith has relied on people who didn t believe having some form of revelation or experience that motivated them to become one of us.No character in the history of Christianity has a more dramatic story of conversion, or a more significant post-conversion contribution to the faith, than does the Jewish-born Saul, call him Paul, call him St. Paul.Saul, a notorious persecutor of Christians on behalf of Rome, was riding on the road to Damascus with his henchman to do just that when, as they neared the city, an incredible display of light appeared, so vibrant it knocked Saul from his horse.Blinded temporarily, Saul heard the voice of Jesus ask him why he was behaving so badly? This led to Saul s conversion, a clever name change, and to a missionary journey that places him at the top of the list of all-time Christian evangelists.Much like Paul, a famous convert to liberty, and the one who played the most important post-conversion role in standing up to the ruling class and powerful institutions was Andrew Breitbart, founder of Breitbart News.Breitbart s conversion story is available to listen to in his own words and this is a great week for every American liberal to click on  Play. Andrew was raised in California and was a product of that reflexively liberal climate. He admits to taking being a liberal for granted until, in his early 20 s, he witnessed a horrific national event:The confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas and the random insertion of Anita Hill into the process.Andrew watched and wondered what was going on. He couldn t understand how the NAACP would stand by and let a black man be accused of something like this and not stand up to protect his rights. He couldn t understand why the National Organization for Women would blindly support someone coming forth so late with accusations.Andrew thought those groups were supposed to be about fairness and protecting the rights of the underdogs.Silly Andrew.Once awakened, Andrew Breitbart became curious, he became informed, and he became active.  Boy did he become active! Today, Breitbart News stands virtually alone in presenting an uncompromising exposure of Team Left tactics and giving a large platform to the works of James O Keefe, John Nolte, and others.What is on display to Americans in the Brett Kavanaugh proceeding should be able to produce a few million Andrew Breitbart-types (getting another Andrew Breitbart is too much to ask). For people who are following these proceedings from the Team Left bleachers, here are some things I suggest you keep an eye on:Where is the ACLU insisting that someone cannot be considered guilty simply under the weight of an accusation?Why is the media not doing any feature stories using mothers of sons who are worried about the future their kids will face?Where was the coverage of the woman s march at the Capitol prior to the Thursday hearing showing women demanding Kavanaugh be treated fairly? Where were the Democrats, champions of women s rights, demanding that these women be heard?Why is the FBI, a federal agency operated at taxpayer expense, being used as part of a show investigation when it has already investigated Judge Kavanaugh for months?These are the kinds of questions Andrew Breitbart would have been asking himself if he had been watching this as a California  dude  in his early 20 s. These are the kinds of questions he would be asking America if he were still with us today.I predict that the Kavanaugh confirmation proceedings, which resemble burlesque more than they do any sort of dignified process, will produce a significant number of converts. With my ear to the wind I hear not only the spirit of Andrew Breitbart screaming for political fairness, I also hear St. Paul preaching the immorality of condemning a man solely on specious accusations.Being a partisan requires the complete suspension of intellect. You must say to yourself,  I know I m going to be confronted with challenging facts today that subvert my position, but by God I promise to ignore all of them.  St. Paul, when confronted with bright light and Christ s voice, was able to open his blind eyes to see God. Andrew Breitbart confronted with blatant partisanship opened his eyes to see the American Dream.American liberals, when you open your eyes you aren t going to believe what you see. If you experience a spiritual awakening and are ready to convert, we will be waiting for you when you get here.

Clinton said,  I want the FBI to conduct as thorough an investigation as they possibly can within whatever restraints are imposed upon them, but I think for anyone who believes there s such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want judges, particularly those on our highest court, to approach issues, plaintiffs and defendants with a sense of fairness, that there s a lot to be concerned about. She continued,  I was in the Senate for eight years. I voted against nominees from President George W. Bush on the basis of, you know, their positions. But I don t remember any of them, nor the most recent appointment by President Trump of Neil Gorsuch, behaving in such a way. I regret they take the stand they take. I worry about the consequences of their will affecting so many people and their lives and our country as a whole, but this latest example is in a different category. We have not seen anything quite like that for a long time. You know, Clarence Thomas vigorously defended himself, as some of them can remember. It was a very painful and difficult time for Anita Hill and many watching because it felt like, and probably was, a denial of the legitimacy of women s stories. In this case, though, the performance, the behavior, was quite out of bounds. I don t ever remember anything like that. She added,  So there is such a thing that you seek in judges of a judicious temperament, people who are able to discipline themselves to be open to the evidence wherever it might lead, to be fair to all the litigants appearing before them. I m a recovering lawyer. I used to practice law, and I was in different kinds of courts, and this was quite unusual what we saw the other day, and certainly, the senators should, on both side of the aisle, take that into account.

Claire McCaskill s (D-MO) re-election bid in Missouri s midterm election; 49 percent of voters say they are less likely to vote for her now.McCaskill announced she will be a  no  when the full Senate votes on Kavanaugh s confirmation, the National Review reported.The poll also shows her Republican opponent, Josh Hawley, ahead by two points   48 percent to 46 percent.The Remington poll surveyed 1,555 likely voters on Wednesday and Thursday, both the day before and the day of the public Senate Judiciary Committee hearing featuring Ford and Kavanaugh s testimonies.Breitbart News reported on Saturday about a Missouri Scout poll that shows the same results: Hawley s two-point lead over McCaskill just days after she announced she would vote against Kavanaugh. The Missouri Scout poll shows that Hawley leads McCaskill by a margin of 48 percent to 46 percent.The Missouri Scout survey was conducted on the same days as the Remington poll.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  (R-KY) has said a vote will take place this week after the FBI wraps up its supplemental investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, which now includes allegations of drinking problems.Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), and Joe Donnelly (D-IN) are other red-state Democrats whose election bids might be impacted by the hearings and their votes on Kavanaugh.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

Under his signature on the cartoon, Britt added,  Illinois Times  and  Creators.com. Creators.com is Creators Syndicate. Illinois Times is a free weekly paper in the Springfield area.After the backlash began to brew, Illinois Times released a statement distancing itself from Britt:Clarification regarding the Judge Kavanaugh cartoon by Chris Britt:While Chris Britt is a regular contributor to Illinois Times, he is not an employee and also engages in work for other publications across the country. The recent cartoon involving Kavanaugh s daughter was posted on Chris  own Facebook page; it did not appear in our publication or on our website[.] The Illinois Times name should not have appeared on the cartoon in question and we have asked Chris Britt to remove it.For his part, Britt appears to have deleted his Facebook page after publishing the cartoon.The cartoon has also not yet been added to his Creators Syndicate page, where the rest of his work is, including this baseless attack on Kavanaugh, a cartoon depicting President Trump flying his plane into the World Trade Center, and another where a heroic FBI agent points a gun at the President of the United States and calls him a  dirtbag.

Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) face significant electoral pressure as another poll released on Tuesday confirmed that a majority of their constituents want Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh confirmed.The Judicial Crisis Network (JCN) released a poll on Tuesday revealing that a majority of Manchin and Heitkamp s constituents want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court.Fifty-six percent of North Dakotans want Kavanaugh confirmed to the nation s highest court, while only 26 oppose his confirmation. A majority of independents, or 51 percent, also want the nominee added to the Supreme Court. Fifty percent of women also want Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Fifty-eight percent of West Virginians want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court, compared to 28 percent who do not want the Senate to confirm Kavanaugh. Fifty-nine percent of independents want the judge confirmed, while only 26 percent do not.Carrie Severino, the JCN chief counsel and policy director, said in a press release on Tuesday:Clear majorities in North Dakota and West Virginia  including women and Independents  support  Judge Kavanaugh s confirmation. Senators Heitkamp and Manchin need to decide whether they stand with Judge Kavanaugh and President Trump, or with the outrageous smear campaign unleashed by Chuck Schumer and the liberal mob.The JCN also launched a $400,000 TV and digital ad campaign to urge Sens. Manchin and Heitkamp to  listen to their constituents  and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Sens. Manchin and Heitkamp previously broke with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court:Another poll released on Monday detailed how three-fifths of North Dakotans want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court amid Heitkamp s plummeting polling numbers. Only 27 percent of North Dakotans do not want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court. The survey showed that Rep.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/nyt-brett-kavanaugh-may-thrown-ice-someone-1985-bar-fight/","The New York Times unveiled a new allegation against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Monday: he was questioned by police about throwing ice in a bar altercation during his junior year of college.The Times was alerted about a 1985 scuffle at a bar near Yale University following a UB40 concert by Chad Ludington, Kavanaugh s one-time Yale drinking companion who came forward Saturday to claim Kavanaugh was not being completely truthful about the extent of his college-aged drinking during his Senate testimony.In following up, the New York Times obtained a New Haven, Connecticut, police report about the fight from 1:20 a.m. that September. Kavanaugh was not, according to the report, arrested, and no charges stemmed from the altercation. He was, however, questioned after a 21-year-old bar patron named Dom Cozzolino claimed Kavanaugh threw ice at him  for some unknown reason. According to Ludington, the incident broke out because Cozzolino started swearing at him, Kavanaugh, and a third Yale student, Chris Dudley, because he thought they were staring. Ludington claims they were trying to figure out in Cozzolino was Ali Campbell, the lead singer of UB40.The Times writes that the police report notes Cozzolino had a cut on his ear, which he claimed resulted when Dudley hit him with a glass. Dudley disputed this in the report.According to Ludington, Dudley hit him after Cozzolino swung at and then grabbed Kavanaugh in response to the incident with the ice.  I then tried to pull Chris back, and a bunch of other guys tried to pull the other guy back,  Ludington told the Times. I don t know what Brett was doing in the melee, but there was blood, there was glass, there was beer and there was some shouting, and the police showed up. Dudley, who later became an NBA basketball player and came within one-and-a-half points of winning the Oregon governor s race as a Republican in 2010, has strongly backed Kavanaugh, disputing insinuations that the nominee s youthful drinking was problematic. Dudley told the Washington Post that Kavanaugh partied  just like any college kid in America  and told BuzzFeed,  I never, ever saw him blacked out, never.  Brett would drink, but he d also be the guy who never missed a class. There s a reason he was top of his class. Ludington described Kavanaugh as  a frequent drinker, and a heavy drinker  who was  often belligerent and aggressive.  He admits that he, too, lived a partying lifestyle in college.  I do not believe that the heavy drinking or even loutish behavior of an 18- or even 21-year-old should condemn a person for the rest of his life. I would be a hypocrite to think so,  he said in his first public statement about the matter.Ludington is now a North Carolina State University history professor. The Times initially reported him as a Democrat donor but removed that information, evidently when it became clear the donations came from his father, who has a similar name. A significant portion of his scholarship deals with the history of wine and drinking. Past papers include  The Politics of Drunkenness in Britain, 1780-1820  and  By God, he drinks like a man!: Wine, Masculinity and Britishness. One of the co-authors of the New York Times story revealing the ice-throwing allegation also features in the wider debate about Kavanaugh. Emily Bazelon, like Kavanaugh, is a Yale undergrad and law school alum, having started at the prestigious university as Kavanaugh was in law school there. She apparently included her own knowledge of the 1980s Yale bar scene in the story, describing the site of Kavanaugh s alleged ice slinging as  a well-known local bar that served big slices of pizza, and cheap beer, especially after 9 p.m. She has been vocal in her opposition to Judge Kavanaugh, expressing her displeasure when professors at Yale Law, where she is a part-time lecturer, praised Kavanaugh s accomplishments and intellect just after his nomination:As a @YaleLawSch grad & lecturer, I strongly disassociate myself from tonight s praise of Brett Kavanaugh. With respect, he s a 5th vote for a hard-right turn on voting rights and so much more that will harm the democratic process & prevent a more equal society. 1/2  Emily Bazelon (@emilybazelon) July 10, 2018After the Times published her piece, the Yale Law graduate, Bazelon, claimed, without citing her source, Ludington, that she was  told  Kavanaugh might, in fact, have been arrested, only to have it expunged later:No report of an arrest. Could have been expunged, I m told. https://t.co/W3J4wr2Sp7  Emily Bazelon (@emilybazelon) October 1, 2018President Donald Trump continued to beat back the attacks against his nominee under combative questioning from CNN s Kaitlan Collins at his announcement about North American trade Monday morning.  I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man with drinking,  Trump said of Kavanaugh s hearing testimony.  How  bout the last twenty years? Because nobody said anything bad about him in the last twenty years. They go back to high school.  The president continued his support for Kavanaugh at his Monday Tennessee rally for GOP Senate nominee Rep. Marsha Blackburn.  They ve been trying to destroy him since the very first second he was announced because they know Judge Kavanaugh will follow the Constitution as written,  Trump said at the Johnson City, Tennessee, rally.  He s a good man, great student, great intellect, never had a problem. All of a sudden, Oh, let s go back to high school ; then maybe you should go before high school.

The poll also found that Morrisey leads with independent voters by four points.Morrisey continues to argue that Sen. Machin is complicit in the Senate Democrats   disgraceful treatment of Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh. The West Virginia AG said that Manchin has been following Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer s (D-NY) strategy to prevent Kavanaugh form joining the nation s highest court. Regardless of how he votes, Joe Manchin has proven to be complicit in Senate Democrats  disgraceful treatment of President Trump s Supreme Court pick,  said Morrisey.  The voters of West Virginia can fully expect the resist and obstruct circus to be unleashed if Joe Manchin, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and Maxine Waters take control of Congress. Schumer, immediately after Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, announced that he will oppose Kavanaugh  with everything I have  because the  stakes are simply too high. Immediately after Manchin left his meeting with Kavanaugh, the West Virginia Democrat went straight to Schumer s office.Schumer suggested in July that vulnerable Senate Democrats should hold off on their decision whether to support Kavnaaugh as long as possible.Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) said,  All Chuck ever says in caucus [meetings], it s pretty well known: Keep your powder dry. Don t commit. Stay as neutral as you can, as long as you can. Morrisey contended that Manchin holding his vote until the last-minute has given Schumer room to maneuver, and hopefully, tank the nominee.Morrisey charged,  The bottom line, Manchin should be ashamed for giving Schumer and Senate Democrats the room to maneuver  to ultimately try to destroy President Trump s Supreme Court nominee.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/10/02/nyt-assigns-emily-bazelon-to-kavanaugh-coverage-after-she-declared-opposition-to-nomination/","The New York Times published a news article Monday co-authored by Yale Law School Fellow Emily Bazelon about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh   despite previously declaring her opposition to the judge s nomination.(UPDATE   1:19 P.M.) In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, a New York Times spokesperson says the paper should have commissioned a newsroom reporter to cover the alleged Kavanaugh incident instead of Bazelon.  Emily Bazelon is a writer for The New York Times Magazine who occasionally writes op-eds for the opinion section. She is not a news reporter,  the Times  statement reads.  Her role in this story was to help colleagues in the newsroom gather public documents in New Haven, where Emily is based. In retrospect, editors should have used a newsroom reporter for that assignment. To be clear, the story is straightforward, fact-based and we fully stand behind it. According to the Times pieces, Kavanaugh tossed ice at a man during an altercation at a New Haven, Connecticut bar after a UB40 concert in 1985. The future Supreme Court nominee, who was later questioned about the alleged incident by police, was not arrested or charged in relation to the brief scuttle.The Times failed to disclose that the article, co-authored by Emily Bazelon and Ben Protess, was written by at least one individual who has publicly announced her opposition to Kavanaugh. As a @YaleLawSch grad & lecturer, I strongly disassociate myself from tonight s praise of Brett Kavanaugh,  Bazelon tweeted on July 9   the day President Donald Trump announced Kavanaugh s nomination.  With respect, he s a 5th vote for a hard-right turn on voting rights and so much more that will harm the democratic process & prevent a more equal society.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/poll-60-want-kavanaugh-confirmed-if-fbi-dismisses-allegations/","If the FBI clears Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct allegations this week, 60 percent of Americans want him confirmed to the Supreme Court.The Harvard CAPS/Harris poll of 1,330 registered voters also found some other interesting nuggets that are good news for Kavanaugh and his supporters.The top line numbers show that 40 percent found only Christine Blasey Ford s Thursday testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee  credible.  Ford testified that when they were both teenagers, Kavanaugh attempted to assault her at a 1982 house party.By comparison, only 23 percent said they found only Kavanaugh s rebuttal testimony  credible. However, 27 percent of those polled found both Kavanaugh and Ford  credible,  which means a total of 50 percent found Kavanaugh credible, compared to 67 percent for Ford.Here is where things get interesting But the credibility of their testimony does not appear to be the decisive factor,  pollster Mark Penn writes.  Rather, the question comes down to corroboration as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should ascend to the high court. As of now, in the wake of the testimony, only 37 percent want Kavanaugh confirmed, but only 44 percent say he should not be confirmed. ButBecause  corroboration  is the only standard a wide majority of Americans care about, if this FBI investigation clears him, a whopping 60 percent want Kavanaugh confirmed.Moreover, once those polled were informed  that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation, this shifts to 57 percent who favor confirmation. In other words, once voters know the full truth (the truth the establishment media are hiding from them), they overwhelmingly side with Kavanaugh   those who call for his confirmation jump from 37 percent to 57 percent.There are other numbers bubbling beneath the surface inconvenient to the false reality manufactured by the media. To begin with  69 percent agree with Kavanaugh s pronouncement and Sen. Lindsey Graham s (R-S.C.) statement that the proceedings have been a national disgrace. Secondly, the poll found that a whopping 75 percent believe Sen. Dianne Feinstein  should have turned over Ford s letter months earlier so that this debacle might have been avoided. A full 63 percent believe Kavanaugh will eventually be cleared and confirmed.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/woman-who-confronted-jeff-flake-in-elevator-leads-soros-funded-activist-group/","NEW YORK   Ana Maria Archila, one of the two women who confronted Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake in an elevator on Friday, helps lead a progressive organization funded by billionaire George Soros that heads an $80 million activist effort characterized as part of the anti-Trump  resistance  movement.Archila and a second woman, 23-year-old Maria Gallagher, both said that they survived sexual assault when they challenged Flake as he entered an elevator prior to his Senate Judiciary Committee vote on whether to approve the nomination of President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.Ultimately, Flake prompted a new FBI investigation into Kavanaugh as a condition for moving forward with the nomination. When asked whether the elevator confrontation contributed to his decision, Flake told the Atlantic that the moment had been  poignant  for him and  it certainly struck a chord. Flake credited his decision mostly to what he said was his desire to preserve the Supreme Court.  I don t know if there was any one thing, but I was just unsettled,  he added.Outside the elevator on Friday, Archila yelled at the senator:  What you are doing is allowing someone who actually violated a woman to sit on the Supreme Court.  This is not tolerable,  she added.  You have children in your family. Think about them. Archila is not just an ordinary concerned citizen. She is a professional activist. She serves as co-executive director at the Soros-funded Center for Popular Democracy (CPD) and maintains the same position as the group s activist arm, the Center for Popular Democracy Action.As reported by the Washington Free Beacon, Archila penned a piece posted on the CPD s website taking credit for actions that left Flake  visibly shaken: She wrote:Just a few hours ago, a courageous young woman and I confronted Senator Jeff Flake on an elevator about his statement that he would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In a now-viral video, Flake could not even look us in the eyes when we shared with him our experiences of sexual assault. He would not make eye contact with me when I asked him to think about my children, and his own children.Shortly after, CNN reported that Flake was visibly shaken after his encounter with us. Our words, and the words of thousands of women who have shared their stories, moved him. Within hours, the senator announced he would seek an investigation from the FBI into Dr. Ford s accusations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate s confirmation vote.CPD is highly involved in anti-Trump activism. In May 2017, CNN reported that the Center for Popular Democracy Action fund unveiled an  $80 million effort to coordinate the work of dozens of smaller progressive groups from around the country  as part of what the news network characterized as the anti-Trump  resistance  movement. Just as she does with the parent group, Archila serves as co-executive director at the Center for Popular Democracy Action Fund.Since it is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit political organization, the CPD action fund is not required to publicly release its donor list. However, the fund and its associated main group, Archila s Center for Popular Democracy, both have been financed by Soros, as the Free Beacon reported.In October 2014, literature that was part of a CPD event listed Soros s Open Society Foundations as one of CPD s  three biggest funders.   The Foundations provided the CPD with $130,000 in 2014 and $1,164,500 in 2015, tax documents show.In 2016, Soros s Open Society Policy Center provided $705,000 to the Center for Popular Democracy s Action Fund.CPD s agenda items run the gamut of general national progressive politics, including  Racial Justice,   Combating Wage Theft,   Organizing for Climate Justice,   Organizing for Education Justice,   Immigrant Rights,   Wall Street Accountability  and  Voting Rights. The CPD and the Make the Road New York immigrant activist group, which has also been led by Archila, partnered last April to form another anti-Trump activist outfit calling itself Corporate Backers of Hate. That Corporate group aims to  name and shame  any companies they claim are either working with Trump or making money from what the group claims is Trump s  anti-immigrant, anti-worker  agenda.The anti-Trump Corporate group s website is set up for activists to send messages to the CEOs and board members of nine major companies, including IBM, Disney, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs. We are convinced they have the capacity to move the Trump Administration,  Archila told Time magazine of the project last year.  And to the extent that they are quietly placating the behavior of this White House, they are just as complicit as Ivanka Trump. Writing at National Review, John Fund documented Archila s ties to the CPD and also noted she is a national committee member of the Working Families Party, which has long had close links to the now-defunct, controversial ACORN.Fund criticized the media for failing to detail Archila s activism beyond cursory mention of her group:I have no doubt that the vast majority of protesters who want to stop Brett Kavanaugh are sincere and are merely exercising their constitutional rights. But imagine if two women had cornered a Democratic senator in an elevator and demanded an investigation of who had leaked to the media Christine Blasey Ford s letter alleging that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her. (Senator Lindsey Graham said today that he planned to investigate the leak.) There would have been sputtering outrage in media circles, and reporters would have breathlessly hunted down any ties between the women and outside groups.It s a sign of media bias that the people from the well-funded groups behind the anti-Kavanaugh protests are described merely as  activists  and that their political motives and origins are largely unexplored.Aaron Klein is Breitbart s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Here s what I would tell the president, I would appeal the verdict of the Senate to the ballot box. This good man should not be destroyed. If you legitimize this process by one vote short, woe be unto the next person. I d hate to be the next person nominated. I would feel horrible that we destroyed Kavanaugh. So what would I do? I would re-nominate him, and I would take this case to the American people, and I d ask voters in Indiana and Missouri and North Dakota and other places where Trump won saying who he would nominate if he got to be president and see if the voters want to appeal the verdict of their senator.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/joe-manchin-pressure-mounts-wv-kavanaugh-vote/","Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) was told by passers-by at Sunday s West Virginia Pumpkin Festival in Milton, WV, to vote in favor of confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court.Manchin has abstained from committing to vote one way or another, claiming to want more time to consider Kavanaugh s nomination.One festival patron told Manchin,  If you don t vote for him, I won t vote for you.  Manchin replied,  I get that a lot. Another shouted,  Vote Kavanaugh!  to which Manchin responded,  I hear you. A Public Opinion Strategies poll published last Friday shows a majority of West Virginia voters supporting Kavanaugh s confirmation. The Judicial Crisis Network, which commissioned the poll, released its breakdown:Overall, West Virginia voters want Brett Kavanaugh confirmed with a margin of 58%  28%This includes the majority of independent voters with a margin of 59%  26%This includes the majority of women voters with a margin of 52%  35%President Donald Trump held a rally in Wheeling, WV, on Saturday in support of Manchin s Republican opponent and current West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. He told rally-goers,  a vote for Morrisey is a vote for me  [and a vote for] West Virginia values and keep[ing] America great.  He also described Manchin as a supporter of  mass amnesty  who sides with  radical open-border  Democrats.During the rally, Morrisey described Manchin as a  dishonest Washington liberal,  while promising to  advance Trump s agenda  if elected to the Senate.Last week, Morrisey said in a statement that Manchin is complicit in Senate Democrats   disgraceful treatment  of Kavanaugh and that Manchin followed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer s (D-NY) orders since Kavanaugh s nomination.Morrisey slammed Senate Democrats  tactics to disrupt and defame Judge Kavanaugh during the Supreme Court nomination process. The West Virginia Republican contended that the Democratic senator was complicit in Senate Judiciary ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer s (D-NY) strategy to prevent Kavanaugh from joining the nation s highest court. Regardless of how he votes, Joe Manchin has proven to be complicit in Senate Democrats  disgraceful treatment of President Trump s Supreme Court pick,  said Morrisey.  The voters of West Virginia can fully expect the resist and obstruct circus to be unleashed if Joe Manchin, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and Maxine Waters take control of Congress. A Thursday-published poll from 1892 Polling shows Manchin and Morrisey tied in support among likely West Virginia voters, with both at 45 percent. Breitbart News reported on the poll:The poll also finds that Morrisey leads amongst independent voters by four points 41 to 37 percent; however, 22 percent of independent voters have yet to make up their minds.Thursday s poll also found that President Donald Trump has a 57 percent approval rating and 38 percent view Trump unfavorably. Trump won West Virginia during the 2016 presidential election by more than 40 points.An average of West Virginia polls via RealClearPolitics shows Manchin with a 9.3 point lead over Morrisey as of this article s publication. Its own analysis of the Mountain State s forthcoming senatorial election is as follows:Joe Manchin remains in good shape, although polling showing him at 46 percent has to concern him some. The undecideds are undoubtedly Trump voters in this state, and could be difficult for him to win back.  This is likely to be Manchin s toughest race to date.Morrisey described Schumer as obedient to Schumer s directives during a Saturday interview with Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matt Boyle on SiriusXM s Breitbart News Saturday.LISTEN: [Joe Manchin] has given Chuck Schumer everything he needs to obstruct and to create the circus that they put together over the last few weeks,  said Morrisey.  Manchin s waiting until the outcome is decided before he reveals his vote, and I think that s gutless.  Rather than call out the circus for what it is Manchin continues to give Chuck Schumer space. He s not said anything or declared a position on this issue. Breitbart News Saturday broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.

Kennedy also reacted to a clip of an interview of Julie Swetnick by stating,  This entire thing makes me want to heave. If you think this is about searching for the truth, you ought to put down the bong. After seeing a clip of Swetnick s interview with NBC, Kennedy said,  This entire thing makes me want to heave. If you think this is about searching for the truth, you ought to put down the bong. This is not about the truth. This is about gamesmanship and power, political politics. It s just that simple. Ms. Swetnick, there s no corroboration. She says that she attended ten gang rapes, at which Judge Kavanaugh was supposedly involved. She didn t report any of them. She is represented by Mr. Avenatti, who has done his dead level best to make all of this about Mr. Avenatti. He continued,  I don t think anybody in the Milky Way could be surprised that the Democrats are yet again moving the goalposts. There is nothing we can do to get our Democratic friends to consider voting for Judge Kavanaugh. The only way to make them happy is to pull him down and I guess dig up Bill Douglas and nominate him, and anybody else who thinks otherwise is just kidding themselves. Look, this is what the Democrats say, they say that Brett Kavanaugh is a rich, drunk, lying, sexual predator. He s been through six FBI background checks, each of which is a cross between an endoscopy and colonoscopy, and none of this was turned up. Now he s going through the seventh one, which the Democrats demanded, and we re not even halfway through, probably, and now they re unhappy with that. Kennedy later added,  [I]t s time for everybody to woman up and man up and be a senator and cast your vote in front of God and country. [I] fully trust the FBI. I want to wait and see what they turn up, but I have a feeling they re going to do just what we ve already done, just what they did six previous times. And by the way, it keeps getting lost in this, the Senate Judiciary investigators did a full investigation. All   the FBI is going to redo what they ve already done. He concluded,  And when we finish with the FBI investigation, the Democrats will argue, well   they re going to argue he doesn t have the demeanor. Well, they called him a rich, drunk, lying, sexual predator, and the man took offense to that. And they say as a result he doesn t have the demeanor to get on   to be on the Supreme Court? They must really think the American people are stupid. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/poll-heitkamp-under-water-gops-cramer-by-10-in-north-dakota-senate-race/","A new poll released on Monday by Valley News Live, the NBC-TV affiliate in Fargo, North Dakota, and Strategic Research Associates, shows that Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) has jumped to a ten point lead over incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) in the North Dakota Senate race.The poll of 650 likely voters in North Dakota conducted between September 17 and September 27 shows that Cramer now leads Heitkamp 51 percent to 41 percent, with eight percent undecided. It has a margin of error of 3.5 percent.Cramer has increased his lead over Heitkamp by six points in the past few weeks.A Fox News poll conducted between September 8 and 11, two weeks before the dramatic testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford on September 27 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, showed Cramer with a four point lead, 48 percent to 44 percent, which was within the poll s margin of error.Heitkamp is one of two Democrat senators who have not yet announced how they will vote on the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The full Senate is expected to vote up or down on his confirmation this Friday.The poll also shows that likely voters in North Dakota overwhelmingly support confirming Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court:In another question that VNL asked, 60% of the likely voters in North Dakota support the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. 27% were opposed.Keep in mind, the poll was conducted during the disclosure that the judge may have engaged in sexual misconduct, while in high school or college, before last week s testimony by Kavanaugh and one of his accusers, before the Senate Judiciary Committee.In 2016, President Trump won the state s three electoral college votes by a margin of 36 points over Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton.Heitkamp s campaign has stumbled in recent weeks.Last week, she tried to dismiss an attack that criticized her support for sanctuary cities as a  scare tactic,  as Breitbart News reported:Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is taking heat for her refusal to  crack down on dangerous sanctuary cities  in an ad released Tuesday.The North Dakota Republican Party ad opens with a narration:  President Trump wants to stop illegal immigration   but Heidi Heitkamp must not.  Heitkamp faces a tough challenge from Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer.President Donald Trump flashes onto the screen with his comments on Heitkamp at a recent rally:  Heidi voted in favor of the deadly, very very dangerous, horrible, sanctuary cities. The ad points to three opportunities Heitkamp had to vote to defund sanctuary cities but did not.  When Heidi was confronted with her record of failure, she dismissed the issue as a scare tactic,   the ad states.Earlier in September, Heitkamp s brother, Joel Heitkamp, a North Dakota talk radio host, said in a tweet President Trump will help victims of Hurricane Florence because  they re white. After #PuertoRico the people on the east coast should worry about the response to #hurricane #Florence. Wait, they re white so #Trump will be there for them. No worries! #790KFGO #hopetheyrsafe  Joel Heitkamp (@JoelKFGO) September 12, 2018Sen. Heitkamp is a frequent guest on her brother s radio show.On Monday, the Cramer campaign took advantage of the momentum in the race by launching a new ad that criticized Heitkamp for voting against President Trump s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Here s the full transcript of that ad:I m Kevin Black, president of Creedence Energy Services. President Trump s tax cuts kicked in pretty quick, and our company jumped at the chance to grow.Did the tax cut make a difference?You bet.Black: We hired 12 new people, and now we are up to 28 good-paying jobs. Our nation is booming, and our economy is creating thousands of new jobs.Black: That s why I m voting for Kevin Cramer. Black: I can t believe Heidi Heitkamp would repeal the tax cuts. Try telling that to my new employees.The Cramer campaign statement notes that while he voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,  Senator Heidi Heitkamp voted against the tax cuts that have benefited North Dakota more than any other state. Heitkamp said she does not regret her opposition to these cuts, and her Democrat party in Washington wants them repealed. You can watch the ad here:

Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) criticized the one-week deadline in the expanded FBI probe of Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Blumenthal said,  It s the right direction, but whether they go far enough and quickly enough remains to be seen. Those 25 witnesses that I sent to the White House and to the FBI along with almost all my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Democratic side, are the minimum that ought to be interviewed. As you well know, witnesses can lead to other witnesses that have to be pursued. So I believe that Jeff Flake truly wants a real investigation, not a check the box sham. And that s what the FBI ought to be doing. Difficult, though, because as you said very well, this deadline is tight and arbitrary. In fact, too accelerated and too artificial to really get the job done. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/josh-hawley-calls-for-special-counsel-to-investigate-feinstein-for-leak-obstructing/","Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, the Republican nominee challenging Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) in this November s Senate race, called for the establishment of a special counsel to investigate Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and her staff for the leaking of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s confidential letter in which she accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her 36 years ago. I am calling for a special counsel to investigate the conduct of Sen. Feinstein, her staff, and all other relevant parties, for violating the confidentiality of Dr. Ford and obstructing the work of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Potentially also of obstructing an FBI background investigation,  Hawley said in a press call Monday morning.Hawley also called on McCaskill to join him in that call for special counsel. I know that Sen. McCaskill and Sen. Feinstein are very close. Sen. McCaskill has worked with Sen. Feinstein on immigration and related issues, and, of course, Sen. McCaskill is very closely aligned with Chuck Schumer. However, I call on Sen. McCaskill today to put partisanship aside and support a special counsel to investigate these potential abuses,  Hawley said. Sen. McCaskill has said they she does not approve of the way the allegations came forward and, quoting her now, she said, It would have been much more ideal if this issue had come up sooner rather than later.  If those statements are true, Sen. McCaskill should support an investigation of the behavior and the tactics used by her Senate Democrat allies,  Hawley noted.McCaskill announced on September 19 that she was opposed to confirming Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. A recent poll in Missouri shows that Hawley now leads McCaskill in that race by two points. The last few weeks have brought disgrace to the United States Senate. The Constitution gives the Senate the high responsibility of confirming justices to the Supreme Court,  Hawley said in a press call Monday morning.Hawley s full statement, which he delivered on the press call, can be read here:The last few weeks have brought disgrace to the United States Senate. The Constitution gives the Senate the high responsibility of confirming justices to the Supreme Court.The Democrats have turned this responsibility into a partisan circus.They ve tried to smear the name of a good man. They have violated the express wishes of Dr. Ford in this process, and all for the purpose of stalling this nomination until after the midterm elections, and gaining power.The behavior of Sen. Feinstein, in particular, and her staff, and all the Senate staff has been inexcusable. It raises troubling ethical questions.Dr. Ford s letter was hidden from the committee for months, while an FBI investigation was ongoing.Then, only after the FBI background investigation was complete, and only after Judge Kavanaugh had set for hours of testimony and answered over 1600 written questions, did Dr. Ford s letter suddenly leak to the press, all without her approval, or her consent. And, we learned at the hearing last Thursday that Sen. Feinstein and her staff recommended a partisan lawyer to Dr. Ford while the letter was being withheld from the committee and the FBI, and while, in fact, they were, Sen. Feinstein was meeting with Judge Kavanaugh. These were deliberate maneuvers by partisan Democrats and their staffs to exploit Dr. Ford and ultimately block Judge Kavanaugh s confirmation process.All of this for political gain, and at the price of smearing Judge Kavanaugh. And Claire McCaskill has gone right along with it every step of the way. She told supporters in June, we now know, in a leaked video, that it was vital to save the Supreme Court from President Trump. Chuck Schumer, of course, promised that he would do whatever it took to sink the Kavanaugh nomination, and here we are.This behavior is not only a disgrace to the Senate, it raises very troubling ethical questions, possibly legal questions.And that s why today I am calling for a special counsel to investigate the conduct of Sen. Feinstein, her staff, and all other relevant parties, for violating the confidentiality of Dr. Ford and obstructing the work of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Potentially also of obstructing an FBI background investigation.I know that Sen. McCaskill and Sen. Feinstein are very close.Sen. McCaskill has worked with Sen. Feinstein on immigration and related issues, and, of course, Sen. McCaskill is very closely aligned with Chuck Schumer.However, I call on Sen.

If those statements are true, Sen. McCaskill should support an investigation of the behavior and the tactics used by her Senate Democrat allies. My view is the American people deserve to know how Dr. Ford s confidentiality was violated, and what exactly Sen. Feinstein and her Democrat colleagues and staff were doing behind the scenes for months,  Hawley said. (emphasis added) If Sen. McCaskill is in search of the truth, she should join me today in supporting the investigation of Sen. Feinstein, staff, and all relevant parties,  Hawley concluded.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/kamala-harris-presents-letter-claiming-kavanaugh-friend-repeatedly-raped-jane-doe-in-car/","The Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last Wednesday regarding a letter delivered to Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) in which an anonymous woman claims she was repeatedly raped by the judge without providing any details to investigate.According to committee transcripts released Sunday, the accuser, who signed the mysterious letter as  Jane Doe,  alleges Kavanaugh and a friend raped her  several times  after giving her a lift home from a party   making no attempt to claim a time or place for the lurid story.The accuser claims Kavanaugh groped her, slapped her, and force her to perform sexual acts.  They forced me to go into the backseat and took 2 turns raping me several times each. They dropped me off 3 two blocks from my home,  the accuser wrote, claiming the pair told her,  No one will believe if you tell. Be a good girl. The letter, marked with the word  urgent,  did not include a return address, nor did it offer clues regarding the accuser s background.  A group of white men, powerful senators who won t believe me, will come after me  if I reveal the incident, the accuser wrote, prompting observers to speculate the sender could be a minority.The accusation was met with a vehement denial from Kavanaugh, who characterized the allegation as nothing short of  ridiculous.  Nothing ever  anything like that, nothing,  the Supreme Court nominee told senators concerning the accusation.  I mean, that s  the whole thing is just a crock, farce, wrong, didn t happen, not anything close. Read the full letter below (Spaces added for easier reading):Dear, Senator Grassley, et al.The current situation regarding the accusations made by Dr. Ford against Brett Kavanaugh have prompted me to write you today. I have moved on with my life since he forced himself on me as well. The times were so different, and I didn t expect to be taken seriously, embarrass my family, be believed at all. I was at a party with a friend. I had been drinking. She left with another boy, leaving me to find my own way home. Kavanaugh and a friend offered me a ride home. I don t know the other boy s name. I was in his car to go home. His friend was behind me in the backseat. Kavanaugh kissed me forcefully.I told him I only wanted a ride home. Kavanaugh continued to grope me over my clothes, forcing his kisses on me and putting his hand under my sweater. No,  I yelled at him. The boy in the backseat reached around, putting his hand over my mouth and holding my arm to keep me in the car. I screamed into his hand. Kavanaugh continued his forcing himself on me. He pulled up my sweater and bra exposing my breasts, and reached into my panties, inserting his fingers into my vagina. My screams were silenced by the boy in the backseat covering my mouth and groping me as well. Kavanaugh slapped me and told me to be quiet and forced me to perform oral sex on him. He climaxed in my mouth. They forced me to go into the backseat and took turns raping me several times each.They dropped me off two blocks from my home. No one will believe if you tell. Be a good girl,  he told me. Watching what has happened to Anita Hill and Dr. Ford has me petrified to come forward in person or even provide my name. A group of white men, powerful senators who won t believe me, will come after me. Like Dr. Ford, I m a teacher, I have an education, a family, a child, a home. I have credibility. Just because something happens a long time ago, because a rape victim doesn t want to personally come forward, does not mean something can t be true.Jane Doe, Oceanside, California.On Monday, the White House issued revised guidance to the FBI that agents can interview anyone they deem relevant as part of their investigation of Kavanaugh. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to reopen Kavanaugh s background investigation Friday after several women accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.Speaking at a White House Rose Garden event, President Trump told reporters that he continues to support Kavanaugh, describing him as a  fine man.   I think he s a great scholar  he focused on being number one at Yale, on being number one in high school, at being number one at law,  the president added.  I can so understand that. Kavanaugh has strongly denied all allegations, issuing the following statement through the White House on Friday: Throughout this process, I ve been interviewed by the FBI, I ve done a number of background  calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me. I ve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate. According to multiple reports, the investigation could wind down as earlier as Monday or Tuesday.GOP senator tells me that @senatemajldr told WH Friday the 3 key GOP Senators wanted the FBI to interview 4 people: PJ Smyth, Leland Keyser, Mark Judge & Deborah Ramirez. Senator tells me with that limit  FBI could be done by today or Tuesday #Kavanaugh  Dana Bash (@DanaBashCNN) October 1, 2018In a Senate floor speech Monday afternoon, Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) vowed lawmakers will vote this week on Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court.  The goalpost keeps shifting, but the goal hasn t moved an inch. Not an inch,  said the Kentucky senator.  Let me make it very clear. The time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a close. Judge Kavanaugh s confirmation is out of committee. We re considering it here on the floor We ll be voting on it this week. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

I m calling for the Minnesota Office of the Attorney General to conduct an immediate investigation into the allegations of domestic abuse made against Keith Ellison,  a statement released by Housley reads.  As the state s chief legal division, the attorney general s office can provide an impartial investigation into the serious allegations.  Recent calls for a congressional ethics investigation, made by Keith Ellison and echoed by my opponent, amount to nothing more than political cover; Ellison will have left Congress by the time an investigation could be completed,  the statement continues.The Minnesota Republican Senate candidate says the  substantiated  allegations of sexual assault against Ellison raise series questions about whether Ellison has the mental fitness to serve as the state s Attorney General.Housley is running against Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN), the Minnesota Lieutenant Governor appointed to replace then-Sen. Al Franken (D-MN), who resigned from the Senate after he was hit with multiple accusations of sexual assault.In the wake of decades-old allegations recently leveled against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh,  Democrats have remained all but silent regarding claims of domestic abuse against Ellison by ex-girlfriend Karen Monahan.Last month, the Minnesota Democrat and Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee announced he would request the United States House Committee on Ethics to probe Monahan s allegations.  Today I am announcing that I will submit a request for a House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations against me raised by a former partner,  Ellison said in a statement last Wednesday.  I am taking this step now because I am innocent and eager to see this entire matter resolved. In an interview with the New York Times, Monahan alleged she was the subject of  narcissist abuse  at the hands of the Ellison, who has been in Congress since 2007. Narcissist abuse is very difficult to understand,  Monahan told the paper.  It s the gaslighting, it s the habitual lying, it s the making it seem like it was my fault for even asking why something happened.  It was crazy-making,  she added.  My hair was falling out, I was anemic   narcissist abuse is horrid.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/the-nuclear-option-when-evidence-no-longer-matters/","These are lonely times. The whole world, it seems, is talking past each other, not listening. Whatever vestiges of civility were left after the 2016 election has vanished.People are openly judged as trash and liars   entirely based on their gender.Which is kind of strange, considering that gender is supposed to be so fluid these days. Perhaps the world would calm down if we just all went the way of Bruce Jenner.If all men would just become women, humans would presumably no longer be able to procreate. (Ladies, you have not quite rendered us useless yet!) And then humans would die off like the greedy dinosaurs we are and the planet would be left to the peaceful, righteous and just animals.TRIGGER WARNING: If this is what you think you want, do NOT watch footage of wild animals on the Serengeti. It is savage justice where might makes right. It is more appalling than Harvey Weinstein s casting couch or former President Bill Clinton s intern program. It s even worse than a toga keg party at Yale Law.We are so broken today that everybody says last week s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing featuring Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and his accuser did not change a single mind. That is not true.My mind was entirely changed by the gut-wrenching testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.Going in, I thought she was a lying opportunist who popped up on the scene at the very last minute to derail Judge Kavanaugh s nomination to the Supreme Court. By her own admission, the first time she ever uttered the man s name to someone else was when she thought he might get nominated to the Supreme Court.When she spoke, however, I could not help but find her believable   if a bit daffy.Then Judge Kavanaugh spoke. He was every bit as convincing. Understandably, he was furious over the injustice of being accused of something he knows he did not do. (Despite the babbling of Democrats on the committee, rage against injustice is a GOOD quality in a judge, not a bad quality.)So, what do you do when you have two believable witnesses describing starkly different versions of events from nearly 40 years ago? You look at all the other evidence.From the outset, Judge Kavanaugh is at a disadvantage since he has to prove a negative. Even worse, the accusation against him doesn t even come with a date or a location.Still, Judge Kavanaugh comes off as a better witness because Dr. Ford s testimony   as earnest as it seemed   is riddled with holes and saddled with inconsistencies. Even worse, Dr. Ford s story has altered over time.Who was there? Where? How many people? Was the guy she was  going out with  at the time there or not?And then there are the tricks of memory. Surely, traumatic incidents burn more deeply. But this is a person who could not even answer who is paying her legal bills.And we are expected to trust her precise memory from 36 years ago and use that memory to utterly destroy a man who has spent his entire adult life building an impressive career and impeccable reputation?At the very, very, very least, we should summon the spirit of the late Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter, who famously invoked Scottish Law to find impeachment charges against ex-President Bill Clinton  not proven. Only this time, the verdict would actually fit. Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.

But this case is even weaker than that. Dr. Ford identified other witnesses to the event, and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them. For the reasons discussed below, I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee. Nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.Mitchell also pointed out that in addition to a discrepancy in the number of people at the party and other conflicting details of what unfolded there, all of the witnesses Ford named have either outright denied her claims or have not corroborated them.Mitchell s report also concluded that  the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr. Ford s attorneys likely affected Dr. Ford s account. Mitchell heads the Special Victims Division at the Maricopa County Attorney s Office in Phoenix, Arizona, which covers sex crimes and family violence. Republicans on the committee chose her because of her decades of experience prosecuting sexual assaults.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/reports-fbi-investigation-into-brett-kavanaugh-allegations-may-wrap-up-tuesday/","A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) probe into allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh could wind down in the next 24 hours, according to reports.Fox Business Network reporter Edward Lawrence and CNN political correspondent Dana Bash reported Monday afternoon that the FBI could wrap up its investigation into Kavanaugh as early as Tuesday, three days prior to its Friday deadline agreed upon by the Senate Judiciary Committee. GOP senator tells me that @senatemajldr told WH Friday the 3 key GOP Senators wanted the FBI to interview 4 people: PJ Smyth, Leland Keyser, Mark Judge & Deborah Ramirez. Senator tells me with that limit  FBI could be done by today or Tuesday,  Bash tweeted.At the request of the committee, President Donald Trump on Friday ordered the FBI to probe allegations against Kavanaugh, and his Supreme Court nominee vowed to cooperate with investigators.  Throughout this process, I ve been interviewed by the FBI, I ve done a number of background  calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me,  Kavanaugh said in a statement released through the White House.  I ve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate. The New York Times reported on Monday that the White House authorized federal agents to  expand  the scope of the probe while still keeping its Friday deadline. The reported change allows the Bureau to interview  anyone it deems necessary  to answer questions about accusations against Kavanaugh, all brought forth after his confirmation hearings had already concluded.Speaking before reporters in the White House s Rose Garden on Monday, President Trump reiterated his support for a fair and thorough investigation into the Supreme Court nominee.  We don t want to go on a witch hunt, do we?  the president asked reporters, a reference to special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into possible collusion between Russia and Trump campaign. My White House will do whatever the senators want,  Trump affirmed.  The one thing I want is speed. Asked if he would object to the FBI interviewing accuser Julie Swetnick, who is represented by TV attorney and 2020 Democrat hopeful Michael Avenatti, the president replied,  It wouldn t bother me at all. Now, I don t know all three of the accusers. Certainly, I imagine they re going to interview two. The third one I don t know much about.

Libertarian candidate Murray Sabrin has three percent support. The poll has a 4.25 percent margin of error, making this is a dead tie between Hugin and Menendez.Menendez, who was reprimanded by a Senate ethics panel after corruption charges were dismissed following a mistrial, has a net 24 percent unfavorability rating. Hugin, in contrast, has a 13 percent net favorability rating, though 43 percent of New Jerseyans said they were not familiar with him.Michael Klein, the executive director of the Stockon University center for polling, said in a statement on Monday,  With a two-point lead falling within the poll s margin of error, the Senate race at this point is up for grabs.  Bob Hugin has been attacking Senator Menendez on ethics with a heavy advertising campaign. However, with so many voters still unfamiliar with the Republican, Menendez will likely try to define his challenger in negative terms,  Klein added.Fifty-nine percent of voters say that the corruption charges against Menendez play an extremely important or a significant factor in their vote for the U.S. Senate race. Eighty-eight percent of Republicans support Hugin, while only 80 percent of Democrats support the incumbent Democrat senator.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/maxine-waters-demands-kavanaugh-disclose-any-treatment-for-alcohol-abuse/","As the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) probes decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) is calling on investigators to look into whether the judge ever sought treatment for alcohol abuse. Kavanaugh, so many have come forward describing your abuse of alcohol,  Waters tweeted on Sunday.  I think it is important that the American people know if you have ever sought treatment for alcohol abuse. Kavanaugh, so many have come forward describing your abuse of alcohol. I think it is important that the American people know if you have ever sought treatment for alcohol abuse.  Maxine Waters (@RepMaxineWaters) September 30, 2018Earlier Sunday morning, the longtime California Democrat claimed Kavanaugh was a  puppet  of President Donald Trump, who, alluding to his passionate testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday, demonstrated a  lack of respect for others.  Aren t Supreme Court justices supposed to be independent, and are they not expected to demonstrate the proper judicial temperament?  Waters then asked her nearly 865,000 followers.Kavanaugh has proven that he is a puppet of Donald Trump. He got his marching orders and he promptly displayed Trump s lack of respect for others. Aren t Supreme Court justices supposed to be independent, and are they not expected to demonstrate the proper judicial temperament?  Maxine Waters (@RepMaxineWaters) September 30, 2018In an interview with MSNBC s AM Joy, Waters reiterated her opposition to Kavanaugh s confirmation, once against describing the judge as President Trump s  puppet.  We have to fight. We have to not only fight to make sure that women get the respect that they deserve, but when you have a credible person like Christine Blasey Ford, it helps us to point out that no matter how credible they are, no matter you how well spoken they are, no matter how smart they are, that these senators do not intend to allow sexual harassment to be the reason why someone will not be confirmed,  Waters said in her usual defiant tone.  And so I think that this has played out in a way that will only strengthen us and strengthen women and those who care about justice to fight and to confront them and protest against what we re seeing. Waters  comments come as the media continues to whip itself into a frenzy over Kavanaugh s drinking habits, tracking down individuals who claim to know details concerning Supreme Court nominee s hard-partying ways in college.According to The Washington Post, its reporters tracked down two individuals claiming to be familiar with Kavanaugh s college years and say the nominee s denial of heavy drinking in an interview with Fox News are inaccurate. Brett was a sloppy drunk, and I know because I drank with him. I watched him drink more than a lot of people. He d end up slurring his words, stumbling,  Swisher, who says she was friends with Kavanaugh during college, told the Post.  There s no medical way I can say that he was blacked out. . . . But it s not credible for him to say that he has had no memory lapses in the nights that he drank to excess. Swisher s College roommate, Lynne Brookes, accused Kavanaugh of attempting to  paint himself as some kind of choir boy.   You can t lie your way onto the Supreme Court, and with that statement out, he s gone too far. It s about the integrity of that institution,  she told the paper.In an interview with Fox News last Monday, Kavanaugh denied all allegations of sexual misconduct and pushed back on claims that he was frequently inebriated at parties thrown during his high school and college years. [Y]es, there were parties. And the drinking age was 18, and yes, the seniors were legal and had beer there,  the Supreme Court nominee told host Martha MacCallum.  And yes, people might have had too many beers on occasion and people generally in high school  I think all of us have probably done things we look back on in high school and regret or cringe a bit, but that s not what we re talking about. In an opinion-editorial published by Slate last Tuesday, William Saletan argues the culture at Kavanaugh s high school   Georgetown Preparatory School   paired with accusations brought forth by Christine Blasey Ford and Debra Ramirez   justify an FBI investigation into the Judge s alleged drinking habits.Saletan writes:On Thursday, Kavanaugh faces a Senate hearing about Ford s allegations. He will try to draw a line. At a rehearsal with White House aides last week, he  grew frustrated  with questions about his drinking and his sexual behavior, according to the Washington Post.  I m not going to answer that,  he said. Judge doesn t want to answer questions either. The Republicans who control the committee are planning to leave Judge out of the hearing.That s unacceptable. The alcohol theory is arguably the most plausible explanation of what happened. It s less crazy than Ford inventing a story and putting herself through hell so Trump can nominate a different conservative judge to the Supreme Court.If the committee won t delegate this job to the FBI, senators must do it themselves. Ask Judge and Kavanaugh about their history with alcohol. Talk to the people who drank with them or saw them drunk. If you think alcohol could have corrupted Ford s memory or Ramirez s memory, ask about their drinking too. This is an investigative avenue with a strong evidentiary basis and many potential witnesses, and it puts everyone s denials in doubt. To confirm Kavanaugh without checking it out would be a betrayal of justice.Of course, the consumption of alcohol has not been a federal offense since the end of Prohibition in 1933.Some who knew Kavanagh during his high school days have pushed back against claims that the now-Judge drank too much. Drinking was prevalent in high school, but some guys handled it better than others, and Brett always maintained his composure,  Tom Kane, described as a  close friend  of Kavanaugh, told the Post.  He was not a stumbling drunk. He was never all that interested in getting wasted. Former NBA player Chris Dudley and former college classmate of Kanavaugh said the Trump pick is the target of an all-out smear campaign. I went out with him all the time. He never blacked out. Never even close to blacked out,  Dudley said.  There was drinking, and there was alcohol. Brett drank, and I drank. Did he get inebriated sometimes? Yes. Did I? Yes. Just like every other college kid in America.

Mazie Hirono (D-HI) said the expanded FBI investigation into Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh should include whether Kavanaugh was  a very belligerent, aggressive drunk  in his youth.Hirono said,  As most normal people would think, that whether or not Judge Kavanaugh lied to the committee, which should be a total nonstarter for anybody wanting to go to the Supreme Court, is not even the area of focus. It s so limited, I called it basically I think the word farce would not be far off to talk about this so-called investigation. It is not going to get us anywhere near the truth. But the other thing that I found totally bizarre and astounding was when Judge Kavanaugh accused the Democrats of engaging in a plot to do him in, and he dragged in Hillary Clinton and all that. This is a conspiracy theory. This is what he believes. This is what he s going to take to the Supreme Court. And he also was so partisan that it was unbelievable. He even wrote a law review article in 2016 where he said a judge should be totally nonpartisan. That s not what was shown to us. She continued,  There were inconsistencies about his drinking and information we have from various of his classmates, that he was a very belligerent, aggressive drunk. So I would like the FBI to go and interview all of these people, and we have to draw our conclusions, but it was unbelievable, the portrayal of himself as some kind of a boy scout, all he cared about was studying, going to church, doing projects and playing basketball or sports. It was pretty unbelievable to me. And very clearly, when he was asked specific questions about the meaning of the terms in his yearbook, what the meanings of those words were. And as Comey said, when you lie about something like that, it just points to the need to dig deeper. She added,  I think there s a pattern of him not being candid with the committee, it goes back to his nomination hearings in 2006. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

I happen to know some United States senators,  Trump said.  One on the other side, who is pretty aggressive, I ve seen that person in very bad situations  somewhat compromising. When asked by a reporter who he was talking about, Trump joked,  I think I ll save it for a book, like everybody else, and I ll write it, OK? The president commented on the sudden focus on Kavanaugh s testimony on his drinking habits during a press conference at the Rose Garden at the White House. I watched the senators on the Democrat side and I thought it was a disgrace,  Trump said.  Partially because I know them. I know them too well and you know what? They are not angels. Trump also pointed specifically to Sen. Richard Blumenthal for lying about his service in Vietnam. He lied!  Trump said.  I don t mean a little bit  he s a guy who lied and now he s up there talking like he s holier than thou. Trump also pointed to Sen. Cory Booker, claiming that he had failed as the mayor of Newark and admitted to bad behavior in high school and college.He said he suspected that Sen. Dianne Feinstein leaked information about Kavanaugh s anonymous accuser, citing her confusing  body language  when she denied being a source.Trump said that Kavanaugh had led an  exemplary  life and that it was disappointing that his enemies had to go all the way back to high school to attack his record. He s a good man with a great family, I think he s been treated horribly,  he said.Trump noted that everyone s behavior from high school and college could be used against them. There are bad reports on everybody here,  Trump said.  Except for Mike Pence, by the way, and if we find one on him that s going to be the greatest shock of all time. Trump praised Kavanaugh for being honest and forthcoming about his drinking, noting that it was a difficult standard to enforce. I saw a lot of people drinking,  he said.  They drink beer and go crazy and they were in High School, they were 16, 17 years old,  he says.  I saw a lot of it. Does that mean that they can t do something they want to do in their life? It s a very tough thing. Trump said that he never had a drink, even in high school and college. I ve never had alcohol  Can you imagine if I had what a mess I d be?  he asked.  I d be the world s worst.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/prosecutor-christine-blasey-ford-doesnt-know-if-polygraph-was-on-day-of-grandmothers-funeral/","The final Senate report from Rachel Mitchell, the sex crimes prosecutor who interviewed Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford, questions Blasey Ford s  struggle to recall important recent events  such as whether she took her polygraph test the same day as her grandmother s funeral.Appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday, Blasey Ford   the California professor who brought forth an allegation of teenage sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh, President Trump s Supreme Court nominee   said she did not know whether her polygraph examination less than two months ago occurred on the same day her grandmother was buried. This discrepancy is listed among nine categories of strikes against Blasey Ford s testimony which led Mitchell to conclude her account did not meet the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.When asked why Jerry Hanafin, the polygraph administrator, conducted the examination at a hotel near the BaltimoreWashington International Airport, instead of his Virginia office, Ford revealed time constraints left her unable to travel far for the test. I had left my grandmother s funeral at that point at Fort Lincoln Cemetery that day and I was on a tight scheduled to get to make a plane to Manchester, New Hampshire,  the 51-year-old professor told Mitchell.  He was willing to come to me, which was appreciated.  So you were administered a polygraph on the day that you attended your grandmother s funeral?  Mitchell asked. Correct, or it might have been the next day,  Ford responded.She then turned to her attorney, Debra Katz, and said she did not remember the exact day the test was taken. Dr. Ford could not remember if she was being audio- or video-recorded when she took the polygraph,  the memo reads.  And she could not remember whether the polygraph occurred the same day as her grandmother s funeral or the day after her grandmother s funeral. According to Mitchell, administering a polygraph to an individual who is  grieving  is  inappropriate. As Breitbart News has previously reported, Blasey Ford was only asked two broad questions during her polygraph exam:  Is any part of your statement false?  and  Did you make up any part of your statement?  Ford was not asked any specific questions about the specific allegation,  Breitbart s John Nolte pointed out   no questions to name Kavanaugh as her attacker or about the details of her story.  There are also no test or baseline questions where the subject is intentionally asked to lie. The memo s release comes after the White House ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to launch a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, a request made by Jeff Flake (R-AZ) moments before the committee was slated to vote that Kavanaugh s confirmation be sent to the full Senate for a vote. I think it would be proper to delay the floor vote for up to but not more than one week in order to let the FBI do an investigation, limited in time and scope to the current allegations that are there, limited in time to no more than one week,  Flake said.  And I will vote to advance the bill to the floor with that understanding. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders would announce hours later that President Donald Trump would accommodate the request and asked the FBI to probe the claims.  I ve ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh s file,  President Trump said in a statement.  As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week. In a separate statement released through the White House, Kavanaugh said he stood ready to cooperate in the investigation.  Throughout this process, I ve been interviewed by the FBI, I ve done a number of background  calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me,  said Kavanaugh.  I ve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate.

Trump further stated that the FBI should be led by what the Senate wants.NBC News National Correspondent Peter Alexander asked,  [S]hould the FBI interview all three of Brett Kavanagh s accusers? Trump responded,  It wouldn t bother me at all. Now, it depends, I don t know all three of the accusers. Certainly, I imagine they re going to interview two. The third one, I don t know much about, but it wouldn t bother me at all.  If there is any credibility, interview the third one. Trump later added,  I think the FBI should interview anybody that they want, within reason. But you have to say within reason.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/christine-blasey-ford-not-credible-prosecutor-mitchell-senate-report/","Rachel Mitchell, the veteran sex crimes prosecutor chosen by Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to question Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh, has filed a report that points out Ford s inconsistencies and apparent deceptions. In the legal context, here is my bottom line,  she writes.  A he said, she said  case is incredibly difficult to prove. But this case is even weaker than that. I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence. She adds,  Nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.  This means Ford s story does not reach the 50-50 level of being more likely to have occurred than not.Read the full report:Mitchell Memo by on Scribd<U+FEFF>On Sunday, Breitbart News published an extensive list of Ford s inconsistencies, including the fact she told the Committee she is afraid to fly when the truth is that she flies frequently for both business and pleasure. Mitchell s report is even more comprehensive, with nine different general objections (marked with underlined text) substantiated by dozens of contradicting claims and unanswered questions.Ford s deviations in her timeline about when the assault occurred are important. Did the event occur in the  mid-eighties  or  early-eighties,  was she in her  early teens  or  late teens,  and why did she cross out the  early  in  early 80s  in the statement for her polygraph report?Mitchell lays it all out:Ford s timeline of the trauma she claims the event left her raises questions:This is relevant because her final two years of high school were the two years immediately after the event.Mitchell moves on to lay out how Ford s version of what happened has been every bit the moving target as the timing of the event.  When speaking with her husband,  Mitchell writes,  Dr. Ford changed her description of the incident to become less specific. Now it is an attempted sexual assault.Mitchell explains that Ford s  inability to remember  where the house where the event took place  raises significant questions.  As does her inability to remember how she  got from the party back to her house. In other words, how did Ford get home? She had no cell phone. She testified that she did not call anyone to pick her up while she was in the house. She testified that she ran out of the house without telling anyone, so no one in the house gave her a ride home. How did she arrange a ride home?Mitchell moves on to Ford s  account of the alleged assault,  and how she  has not offered a consistent account[.] In the Feinstein letter, though, Ford makes it sound as though hearing the conversation downstairs was her signal that it was safe for her to leave the bathroom.Mitchell then points out the glaring inconsistencies in Ford s account of who and how many people attended the 1982 house party.Why would Ford fail to note in her polygrapher statement that her best friend Leland Keyser was at the party, a woman who is still a lifelong friend.Despite their friendship. Keyser maintains (under penalty of a felony) she has no memory of this house party and that she has never even met Kavanaugh.Mitchell also focused on Ford s memory of recent events.Ford claims she cannot even remember crucial events around her polygraph test, which she took in August, less than 60 days prior to her Committee testimony:Mitchell adds that  It would also have been inappropriate to administer a polygraph to someone who was grieving. Mitchell reminds the Committee that  Dr. Ford refused to provide any of her therapy notes to  them, which means we will never know the truth of anything, not only because Ford will not provide the notes, but because she claims she cannot recall if she showed the Post the actual therapist notes or her version of them.Mitchell lays out Ford s comments about her claim she is afraid of flying, a fear that delayed everything for a full week.Mitchell goes on to not only lay out the facts that again point to a delaying tactic, but undercut Ford s claim she wished to remain anonymous:Elsewhere in her report, Mitchell points out the inconsistencies in Ford s repeated claim she wished to remain anonymous and would have preferred a private interview:Ford s team turning down the Committee s offer to have her give testimony privately, at her home in California, also delayed things.Finally there is the issue of Ford s three  witnesses,  all of whom refute her account.Before attaching a detailed timeline, Mitchell concludes with,  The activities of congressional Democrats and Dr. Ford s attorneys likely affected Dr. Ford s account.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

The myth out there is that this is a job interview. Nonsense,  Dershowitz said.  First of all, if it was ever a job interview you don t start the job interview with half of your potential employers saying, We re not going to hire you under any circumstances.  Second, once a person is accused publicly of specific, focused crimes that are career-destroying, that job interview metaphor disappears. You have to now prove the allegations by clear and convincing evidence with due process. Dershowitz went on to argue that liberals have already presumed Kavanaugh guilty because he is a white man and Ford is a female survivor, adding  all the rules are called off  when it involves a white man being accused. We know he is guilty because he is a white man, she s a woman, she s a survivor. That is the end of the inquiry,  he explained.Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

It s also currently the third autocompleted suggestion in searches for  ki  and the fourth suggestion in searches for  k  as of this writing.That s right   by typing a single letter into search, Twitter is suggesting that its users might be interested in a hashtag about the murder of a federal judge and SCOTUS nominee.The search suggestion was spotted by Instapundit earlier today and has been confirmed by Breitbart News.So the first autofill on #Kill is #KillKavanaugh.  @jack, how is this happening. pic.twitter.com/R2vhYtTpe2  Instapundit.com (@instapundit) September 30, 2018 KillKavanaugh  search suggestions were also observed by Breitbart News in seemingly harmless searches for  ki  and  k.  In hashtag suggestions,  #KillKavanaugh  currently tops the list of suggestions when users type  #Ki.  Although many current tweets on the hashtag are critical of both the hashtag and Twitter s double standards, earlier tweets use the hashtag unironically and uncritically. Several of these tweets have not been removed by Twitter, and the accounts that tweeted them do not appear to have been punished by Twitter in any way, despite the fact that some users say they have reported them.  It can be argued that some   but not all   of these tweets are metaphorical, calling for the nomination to be  killed  rather than the person, in the same way that a piece of legislation might be metaphorically  killed.  But refusing to take action against those tweets would still be an example of Twitter s double standards: the platform has in the past permanently banned free speech maximalist users when they employed similar metaphors, using the least charitable interpretation of their remarks. This is the website that has silenced James Woods for tweeting a meme about soy boys that Jack Dorsey and his San Francisco menagerie argue could  impact an election. Twitter has in the past been slow or unwilling to address abusive or violent tweets against conservatives and Republicans. When the daughters of Islam critic Pamela Geller were bombarded with abuse earlier this year, Twitter did nothing. In fact, some of the abusive tweets remain on the site, undeleted. In 2016, death threats against sitting Republican senators were allowed to remain on the platform for weeks.Meanwhile, Twitter continues to permanently ban top conservative commentators and activists simply for posting unwelcome facts, severely hampering the conservative grassroots  ability to mobilize supporters ahead of crucial elections.Breitbart News reached out to Twitter for comment but has not received a response.Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/30/pollak-brett-kavanaughs-temperament-righteous-indignation-in-the-face-of-injustice/","The Democrats and the media, having attacked Judge Brett Kavanaugh with accusations that he claims are false and that they cannot prove, now say he has disqualified himself from the Supreme Court because of his  temperament  and partisanship.In fact, Kavanaugh s temperament is perfect. We do not want judges who express indifference to injustice. On the contrary, we want judges who show righteous indignation in the face of injustice, and who apply legal principles to the defense of liberty.The left is perfectly capable of defending anger and outrage when deployed in service of its own ends. On Friday, when two women trapped Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) in an elevator, holding the door so that he could not leave, the left and the media celebrated.Few bothered to note that one of them, Ana Maria Archila, is a professional left-wing activist who runs a George Soros-funded organization, and she had never told anyone that she had been sexually assaulted until she told Flake. Her outrage was accepted immediately as an authentic crie de coeur, and she was interviewed by countless media outlets.No, Archila is not being considered for the Supreme Court. But she is also not facing a slew of sudden, sordid, unproven and unprovable accusations that would not only stop her from obtaining the job she seeks, but also remove her from every job she currently holds. That ought to put Kavanaugh s outrage in perspective.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Saturday that she would seek to remove the otherwise soft-spoken Kavanaugh from the D.C. Circuit if Democrats re-take the House in November, and left-wing Harvard Law School students are asking the university to reconsider his teaching appointment. USA Today even suggested   before backing down   that he avoid children playing sports until he is confirmed.Democrats have sought to destroy his life and his name, forever. That is excessive and unjust, given the weakness of the accusations against him and his evident belief that he is telling the truth.In that light, Kavanaugh s response was not only justifiable, but arguably mild. Few human beings could withstand what he has been through, and even though he stands to be confirmed to a lifetime post, the idea that Supreme Court justices must qualify by tolerating sordid inquiries into their personal lives as minors is absurd.In his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. explained:  There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair.  Democrats, and the media, expected Kavanaugh would withdraw in despair once confronted by a life-changing accusation, however weak.He refused, defending his name and principles, especially that the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty   a principle the left pretended, until recently, to share.Those who forced him to do so now fear Kavanaugh may seek revenge from the bench, if confirmed. He will not   he is better than that, and them   but they only have themselves to blame.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/09/30/james-comey-in-nyt-op-ed-fbi-can-save-america-from-kavanaugh/","Fired FBI director James Comey has once again returned to the spotlight, this time in the form of an op-ed published the New York Times where Comey argues that the FBI will have no problem investigating decades-old allegations against Brett Kavanaugh in the next week.In the opinion piece, titled,  James Comey: The F.B.I. Can Do This,  Comey urges Americans to put their trust in the FBI as they seek to investigate uncorroborated sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. President Trump s decision to order a one-week investigation into sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court nominee, comes in a time of almost indescribable pain and anger, lies and attacks,  Comey writes.He continues by listing his grievances against President Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, then blaming Republican voters for not sharing his opinions on the two men.We live in a world where the president routinely attacks the F.B.I. because he fears its work. He calls for his enemies to be prosecuted and his friends freed. We also live in a world where a sitting federal judge channels the president by shouting attacks at the Senate committee considering his nomination and demanding to know if a respected senator has ever passed out from drinking. We live in a world where the president is an accused serial abuser of women, who was caught on tape bragging about his ability to assault women and now likens the accusations against his nominee to the many  false  accusations against him.Most disturbingly, we live in a world where millions of Republicans and their representatives think nearly everything in the previous paragraph is O.K.Comey, who has attempted to make himself into a nonpartisan hero, is now attacking Republican voters for not being sufficiently bothered by Kavanaugh  shouting attacks at the Senate committee,  never mind the fact that he just had to endure a week of utter hell as his name and reputation was destroyed, he was relentlessly smeared in the media, and his family received violent messages and threats.No, the real victim here is the poor members of the Senate, because Kavanaugh occasionally raised his voice to protest the vile attacks against him.The fired FBI director s real point in penning this article, however, is to assure the liberal readership of the Times that if nothing else has stopped Kavanaugh s confirmation, the FBI can.Comey is literally bragging about how the FBI has the power to do the Democrats  dirty work for them and stop Kavanaugh s confirmation. Although the process is deeply flawed, and apparently designed to thwart the fact-gathering process, the F.B.I. is up for this. It s not as hard as Republicans hope it will be. Comey then brags about the FBI s power, writing that it can  speak to scores of people in a few days,   confront people with testimony and other accounts,  and  [test] them and [push] them in a professional way.  Yes, the alleged incident occurred 36 years ago. But F.B.I. agents know time has very little to do with memory,  Comey writes, citing the fact that people always remember how the weather is on their wedding day, seemingly comparing getting married to attending a drunken teenage party.Comey then writes that FBI agents know that  little lies point to bigger lies  and then accuses Kavanaugh of  obvious liesabout the meaning of words in a yearbook. In the final paragraph, Comey concludes the op-ed with a barely veiled warning.Once they start interviewing, every witness knows the consequences. It is one thing to have your lawyer submit a statement on your behalf. It is a very different thing to sit across from two F.B.I. special agents and answer their relentless questions. Of course, the bureau won t have subpoena power, only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions. But most people will speak to them. Refusal to do so is its own kind of statement.There are a number of reasons why someone approached by the FBI wouldn t want to submit to, as Comey himself says,  relentless  questioning. Chief among them would be the fact that many people honestly do not remember what occurred 36 years ago and don t want to talk to FBI agents about their hazy memories of high school parties that occurred over three decades ago.But it s impossible to read what Comey wrote and not think that there s a more sinister implicationif you don t want to talk to the FBI, maybe you have something to hide.We are now in full-on totalitarian  nothing to hide, nothing to fear  territory. The left will clearly stop at nothing to destroy Kavanaughlet s hope their dirty tactics don t work.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/09/30/nolte-fox-news-cowards-spread-fake-news-christine-blasey-ford-credible/","On Thursday, Judge Andrew Napolitano handed the mob all the rope they could possibly ask for, courtesy of Fox News, saying,  All of us agree that this witness is exceptionally credible. No one argued with him.Listen, I am not here to signal my own virtue. I am not David French, or Matthew Dowd, or Jake Tapper. The reason I have defended those whose politics and character disgust me has nothing to do with virtue and everything to do with self-preservation.I have never liked Roy Moore; I have still defended him. Charlie Sheen s mug shot should be pasted next to  degenerate  in the dictionary; I have still defended him. Woody Allen, George Takei, and Bryan Singer are moral and political illiterates; I have still defended them. And in the specific cases of Allen, Moore, and Singer, vigorously and in great detail.You know what I was wrong. Let me back up a bit.It s actually not about self-preservation, at least not anymore.Maybe it was at first, maybe it was a hundred years ago, before  The Woke  fascists who have captured our culture and media began slapping scarlet letters on free thinkers; before we became a country where panel after panel on MSNBC and CNN would condemn Atticus Finch for not believing the woman, before Twitter and Facebook would  unperson  Winston Smith over a joke.Maybe a hundred years ago I believed that if I didn t join the mob, I would be safe when the mob came for me, because I could say to the mob,  Hey, I m not a part of this. I said Brian Williams deserved a second chance. I ve never called on anyone to be fired. I oppose boycotts. I ve defended you and you and even you. How so very naive.Nope. it is no longer about self-preservation. And again, it not about virtue or principle or pride. It is now only about thing: when the mob comes for me, at the very least, I can comfort myself in the knowledge I am not reaping what I sowed.And that s why I waited a week before making any kind of comment about the allegations Christine Blasey Ford leveled against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and that s why I listened to her full testimony before commenting on that which brings me to Fox News.Watch this crapNo, no Wait. Before you watch that crap, let me set the sceneThe Fox News clip below is from Thursday not Thursday evening after both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh had their full say, not even Thursday afternoon after Dr. Ford completed her full testimony. No, this is the very first break in her testimony, early in her testimony, very early in her testimony, a mere 15 minutes into her testimonyAnd what is on the line here? Forget about the politics or the future of the Supreme Court.  Forget about all of that, because there is something much bigger at stake here: a man, an individual his name, his reputation, his future, his place in history, his guilt or his innocence, and the way his own children will remember him.There is no smaller or more vulnerable minority than The Individual, and in a decent country populated with decent people, nothing should be more important than that; than the right of that one man or that one woman to enjoy, among other things, the presumption of innocence until proven otherwise most especially in the court of public opinion.And with all that in mindWatch this crap:Your ears are not lying to you. A mere 15 minutes into an all-day event, Chris Wallace, a man who poses as a journalist, the man who hosts one of the oh-so venerated Sunday shows, actually said:[Ford s testimony] is extremely emotional, extremely raw, and extremely credible. No could listen to her deliver those words and talk about the assault and the impact it had had on her life and not have your heart go out to her.  This is a disaster for the Republicans.Later, Woke Wallace dropped this non sequitur of a virtue signal:Over the course of this week, like I think a lot of American families, my family <U+2015> a lot of it on email <U+2015> has been discussing this and disagreeing and arguing about it. And two of my daughters have told me stories that I had never heard before about things that happened to them in high school.Later that same afternoon on NPR CNN MSNBC Fox News:Judge Andrew Napolitano said,  I think Dr. Ford is exceptionally credible. Way to judge, Judge.Karl Rove described Ford as  credible,  without any pushback.We expect this kind of shrill, thoughtless, dive bombing from a CNN or MSNBC. In fact, were I to turn on either of those networks to find anything close to moral decency, I wouldn t know what to do with myself. But here is Fox News Fox FREAKIN  News fashionably proclaiming uncorroborated and unsubstantiated testimony from a woman accusing a fellow human being of an attempted sexual assault not just as credible, but as  extremely credible  and  exceptionally credible. And again, forget the politics, and think only of this: for just a moment pretend you are this man, a man with a wife, parents, friends, daughters and without a shred of evidence, without even having heard all of her testimony, without having heard the rebuttal testimony, Fox News is telling them the sexual assault allegations against you are  extremely credible. This is monstrous behavior, unforgivable, un-American the stuff of lynch mobs, of quislings and it is the fakest of fake news.By any standard of truth, fairness, classical liberalism, evidence, and facts, Dr. Ford is not only not credible, she is nothing close to credible.Let me count the waysDr. Ford s allegations are not only not credible   they are ludicrous, a jokeEven what she does remember is so full of holes you could bounce Brian Stelter through it:No one who believes in truth can declare this nonsense credible. But beyond that, where is the instinct of human decency that makes it impossible to cruelly and publicly smear a man as having  credible  sexual assault allegation leveled against him when those allegations are the very definition of horse shit.For God s sake, what are these Fox News cowards basing the words  credible  on? On something as unreliable as presentation and performance How many witnesses against the wrongly accused are credible? How about we flip the script and remember that Bill Cosby s credible presentation and performance as America s Dad allowed him to serial rape for 50 years.Or does Fox News actually know just how un-credible Dr. Ford is, but rather than fight for truth, for The Individual, they prefer to surrender to the mob because that s easier, safer, less stressful, and what you are supposed to do. A man s life and career and name and reputation are on the line, his accusers actions and accusations are, by any standard, equal parts deceptive, dishonest, and implausible And there was Fox News spreading the fake news that 2 + 2 = 5.P.S. Maybe it s time for President Trump to step calmly away from the Fox News.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

Ted Lieu (D-CA) said Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh was  unfit for the court  because his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee showed he believes in conspiracy theories.Lieu said,  They are basically saying they don t believe Dr. Ford s testimony. She was 100% sure was Brett Kavanaugh. When people say there is no evidence for this, that makes no sense. We routinely in America have trials that are determined based on testimonial evidence under oath. Her testimony is evidence. In addition, there is a lot of things that corroborate her testimony. Mark Judge is a friend of Brett Kavanaugh, and they both drink a lot, they were both in the same area and had social gatherings where they interacted. There are a lot of corroborations. She mentioned it also in 2012 and 2013. She is not a left-wing Clinton conspiracy so for Brett Kavanaugh brought that up shows why he is unfit for the court. He added,  You have to watch his testimony in front of the U.S. Senate to know that he is very partisan. Beyond that, he believes in conspiracy theories. That is a problem. When you see Dr. Ford s testimony, it s very clear she is not part of some vast left-wing conspiracy. She was assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh. She told people in 2012 and 2013 and for him to think she is part of a conspiracy makes me question what kind of impartiality he can show on the U.S. Supreme Court.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/30/tom-cotton-dems-turned-advice-and-consent-into-search-and-destroy/","Sunday on CBS s  Face The Nation,  Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) echoed Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh s words and said Democrats behavior through the confirmation process for Kavanaugh was a  search and destroy mission. Partial transcript as follows:JOHN DICKERSON: We are joined now by Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton. Welcome Senator. After watching the hearings- you were a supporter of Brett Kavanaugh s, how did you process the new information that came out in the hearings?SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well John, first off, let s understand what we had to have this hearing. Miss Ford made these allegations in a confidential letter to Dianne Feinstein in July, shortly after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated. The very night he was nominated, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said that he would do everything in his power to stop the nomination. And that s what happened. For three months, the Democrats have turned the advise and consent process into a search and destroy mission. These allegations are completely unsupported by any evidence. What evidence there is to a 36 year old claim, all support Judge Kavanaugh s denial. But the- the Democrats have disgraced this process and the United States Senate in the orchestrated smear campaign of character assassination they ve run against Judge Kavanaugh.DICKERSON: Their argument of course, was that Dr. Ford asked to have this held in confidentiality and that they tried to do that. And that s what it wasCOTTON: So- so let meDICKERSON: But I- I actuallyCOTTON:  No no no no no. No, John let me talk to you about that. Let me talk to your listeners about- or your viewers about that. There is a well established process of confidentiality on the committee. Dianne Feinstein could have showed that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them, as the leaders of that committee could have shared it with the FBI who could have discreetly conducted this inquiry in July and in August without betraying Miss Ford s confidences. And they have betrayed her. They pointed her to lawyers who lied to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her. All that- now all of that is water under the bridge. Those lawyers are going to face a D.C. bar investigation into their misconduct. Dianne Feinstein and her staff is going to face an investigation for why they leaked that. All of this could have been done discreetly it happens hundreds of tim- hundreds of times every year in the Judiciary Committee.DICKERSON: It doesn t happen- it doesn t happen hundreds of times with- with issues that are this sensitive but let sCOTTON: No, John it doesDICKERSON: SenatorCOTTON: it s designed for issues that are sensitive John.DICKERSON: Senator I m worriedCOTTON: It s designed for issues like this.DICKERSON: you re not going to get a chance to talk about Miss Ford s testimony and Mr. Kavanagh s testimony. You watched it I assume, what was your- what was your take away from that?COTTON: Judge Kavanaugh hundred percent denied these allegations. There is not a single bit of corroborating evidence. Every evidence that we do have to include the people that Miss Ford herself named either don t recall this incident or they deny that it happened.DICKERSON: Did you find Miss Ford.- Dr. Ford credible?COTTON: Miss Ford was sympathetic and she was sincere. She has been victimized by the Democrats in this process, John. They betrayed her own requests for confidentiality. They leaked this to the media at the last minute because they are on a search and destroy mission for Brett Kavanaugh.DICKERSON: You said when we last talked in November,  I think it s important that women feel they can come forward. That s a good change in the norms and the expectations of our society.  A woman came forward here. And you re saying basically she said nothing credible. How can women come forward, if when they do they re- they re told they re not credible?COTTON: She came forward confidentially to Dianne Feinstein. Dianne Feinstein did not share that with the proper authorities. Chuck Grassley, her counterpart, with whom she served for decades in the SenateDICKERSON: I understand thatCOTTON: and the FBI that could have reviewed these matter confidential- confidentially. Then they leaked it to the mediaDICKERSON: alright, but SenatorCOTTON: creating- creating the circus environment you ve seen for the last two years.DICKERSON: So that a woman thing about coming forward will have it immediately turned into a partisan issue, as you ve done it, her- her issues are not being discussed by you. You haven t discussed them since you ve been here. Why would a- would a person want to come forward if immediately the response is to get ground up in this partisan thing? You re blaming it on the Democrats, fine. But she s still a human being who has come forward. How should she beCOTTON: JohnDICKERSON: How do you process what she said?COTTON: John, any impact that this entire episode has had on women s willingness to come forward and report sexual assault, which I encourage them all to do immediately after it happens, is caused by the Democrats, is caused by Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer not respecting her requests for confidentiality. Now, when you come forward with an accusation as serious as this it has to be tested against the evidence and against proof and we would have known that confidentially inside the Judiciary Committee in AugustDICKERSON: is the FBI wasting its time investigating?COTTON: I don t know what- I don t know what the FBI is going to find that the committee has not already found. That- the committee staff has already interviewed all the witnesses that Ms. Ford cited. They interviewed Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh for six hoursDICKERSON: well, they haven t interviewedCOTTON: on Thursday.DICKERSON: Mr. Judge. He sent them a letter. That wasn t an interview.COTTON: But butDICKERSON: So you re not right about that.COTTON: So they ve either interviewed them or they ve received lettersDICKERSON: well, that s different.COTTON: letters under penalty of perjury. I- IDICKERSON: Well, but that s different. Now, these are actual interviews.COTTON: So I d be surprised if any of these people under penalty of perjury change their statements that they ve already given to judiciary committee.DICKERSON: Well, surprise, but that s why we have investigations. Wrestle stuff to the ground, have a neutral fact pattern. Clearly the members of the Committee on the Republican side want Kavanaugh to be confirmed. So why should people who want him to be confirmed be in charge of an investigation? Why not have neutral observers wrestle the facts to the ground, which is what s happening now? So it s not a waste of time.COTTON: John. We already know what everyone who is alleged to be at the party has said. They ve submitted statements or been interviewed under penalty of perjury. I would be shocked if any of them change their statement under penalty of perjury to the FBI. But if this makes a few senators more comfortable about going forward and voting on Judge Kavanaugh s very highly qualified nomination in-in the face of an orchestrated Democratic smear campaign, thenDICKERSON:   Was he  COTTON:    That may end up as a good thing.DICKERSON: Was Judge Kavanaugh truthful in everything he said in his testimony?COTTON: I found him to be truthful throughout his testimony. I found him to beDICKERSON:   What if it turns out he-he wasn t  COTTON: I found him to be appropriately indignantDICKERSON:   sure  COTTON: -At the smear campaign. And I-I m disappointed in what Chris Coons said on that video leading in. It reminds me of the old proverb,  This animal is very wicked. It defends itself when attacked DICKERSON:   Yeah  COTTON: If they didn t want him to come in-come in and be angry and indignant at their false accusations, they should have thought about that before they accused him of being a serial sex criminal for the last two weeksDICKERSON: Let me ask you this. If it turns out that he was not truthful about something that has nothing to do with what allegedly happened thirty six years ago, truthfulness is still something you want in a Supreme Court nominee though, is that relevant?COTTON: What-what are you talking about John?DICKERSON: But if it turns out in the course of the FBI investigationCOTTON:   So  DICKERSON: If his-if his assertions COTTON:   So are you siding with the Democrats and now want to have an open ended fishing expedition?DICKERSON: I think that s not fair, Senator.COTTON:   What are you talking about?  DICKERSON: I m asking you if in the investigation it turns out that something outside of that is- if his testimony turns out to not beCOTTON: Well look, as John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham said, if there s some shocking new bit of, not accusation, but evidence and proof, then of course I m open to evaluating that evidence but I said I strongly suspect that every statement that was made to the Judiciary Committee under penalty of perjury is the exact same statement that s going to be made to the FBI.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/30/maxine-waters-kavanaugh-should-not-be-confirmed-he-is-trumps-puppet/","Sunday on MSNBC s  AM Joy,  Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) said Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaughs testimony before the Judiciary Committee showed he was  nothing but a tool and a puppet to the president United States of America. Waters said,  We have to fight. We have to not only fight to make sure that women get the respect that they deserve, but when you have a credible person like Christine Blasey Ford, it helps us to point out that no matter how credible they are, no matter you how well spoken they are, no matter how smart they are, that these senators do not intend to allow sexual harassment to be the reason why someone will not be confirmed. And so I think that this has played out in a way that will only strengthen us and strengthen women and those who care about justice to fight and to confront them and protest against what we re seeing. She continued,  Kavanaugh is very interesting. I think one of the most serious things that we have learned about him is he is trying to be confirmed to the highest court in the land, but he is not an independent. What he did is he went back up to the White House, and the president told him what goes back and say and how to act. So if he is nothing but a tool and a puppet to the president United States of America, why would we want him on the highest court of the land. It doesn t bode well for America.She added,  It sounded as if it was coming straight out of Trump s mouth, so he had his orders. And he came back, and he did exactly what he was told to do. I think that is a serious problem with anybody who is wishing to be confirmed to the highest court of the land. He cannot be trusted. And if he is nothing but a mouthpiece for Trump, we know what that means for democracy. We know what that means for a lack of justice that is going to come out of the Supreme Court by someone like him. It is outrageous that he would allow himself to basically take those kind of orders and come back and execute them. Everybody could recognize what that was all about. And the difference between even how he first comported himself and after he had gone to the White House, it is so obvious that he is not independent and will never be independent. To bring politics into it and to talk about Hillary Clinton and the Democrats? No Supreme Court justice should act that way. He cannot be trusted, and he should not be confirmed.

 Christine Blasey Ford demonstrated a huge amount of courage speaking out this week,  the campaign s statement reads.  She did not initially come forward because she was scared of the response. She was right to be scared. 
 Not only has the right wing smear machine started, but she is receiving serious threats against her and has had to engage a security force to protect her family,  it continues.  This is all really expensive and she needs our help. We need to protect the voices of brave people who speak out  especially when they are part of our community. Although the campaign is no longer accepting donations, the fundraising effort smashed its $150,000 target by raising $528,315 from roughly 11,500 people in under two weeks. A statement of gratitude from the family will be forthcoming in the next 48 hours with a fuller explanation, but in the meantime, do keep your comments coming. I am sharing them with her. Lesh is known to be politically active. Earlier this month, the Grateful Dead singer performed at a fundraising concert for HeadCount, a non-profit organization which aims to push voter registration and turnout among minorities.In February, Lesh also appeared at a candlelight vigil in California for victims of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, alongside other gun control campaigners. I m feeling such rage right now, such anguish and grief thinking about these brave spirits cut off before their time,  the Grateful Dead singer said at the time.  We cannot allow this. Who are we if we cannot protect our children? Who are we if we don t stand up, raise our voices, demand to be heard?

Amy Klobuchar (MN) said she was  stunned  by how Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh acted during her questions on his drinking habits in his teenage years at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week.Klobuchar said,  I was stunned about how he acted at that hearing. This is basically a job interview for the highest court of the land. All I was trying to get at are some of the issues you were discussing with Kellyanne Conway. And that is that everyone has said that they respected Dr. Ford for coming forward, that her testimony was compelling and credible. Both accounts can t be true. She added,  And so one idea here is that he simply was drinking more than he was saying over this time period and that he didn t remember what happened. So I was simply trying to get at that and really couching it in the fact that I had alcoholism in my own family. My dad who is 90 now struggled with it throughout his life and finally got treatment and is sober and got help from aa. So I was actually trying to get at the truth. And so that s why I was stunned by how he answered it. But, of course, he later apologized. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Wegmann reported:The subject line of the email was  corroboration needed.  It came the day before Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee to address allegations of sexual assault.Andrea Caputo Rose, executive of a Washington, D.C.,-based legal recruiting firm called Rose Legal Search, was scrambling to find someone to corroborate the meaning of certain entries in Kavanaugh s high school yearbook. Anyone who could confirm the salacious meaning, Rose wrote in an email obtained by the Washington Examiner, should contact Debra Katz, the lawyer of one of Kavanaugh s accusers. Debra Katz needs to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms used by Brett Kavanaugh in his yearbook page meant  such as FFFF  Devil s Triangle  and Renate Alumnus,  Rose wrote.  If you can speak to any of these and are willing to sign an affidavit, please contact her at [redacted] and [redacted]. Rose did not responded to numerous requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Katz told the Washington Examiner that  Debra Katz did not know about this email or its contents before Ms. Rose sent it, and did not ask for it to be sent. The affidavits were apparently not obtained before last Thursday s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, but Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) questioned Kavanaugh about his yearbook, regardless.Democrats are trying to accuse Kavanaugh of perjury after he identified the term  Devil s Triangle  as a drinking game, and said that the term  boofing  referred to flatulence.Critics say that  Devil s Triangle  refers to a sexual threesome between two men and one woman, and  boofing  refers to anal sex.Former FBI director James Comey referenced those claims in a tweet:Small lies matter, even about yearbooks.

I thought she was credible. Look, what impresses me is Dr. Ford kept saying, just do an investigation. Get the FBI to go check with the other witnesses. Get them to go out and interview people. Get people under oath on this. I felt Mr. Kavanaugh looked like somebody who felt he was entitled to a Supreme Court Seat and he was outraged that we would even investigate a claim like Dr. Ford s and he didn t, he just thought he could deny it, go on a political attack and be done.

So, what really worries me here, what are they hiding? This is a man who does not want to be fully investigated. He wants to make his claims and wants no one to challenge him. That s just not how it should work. This is a lifetime appointment to a job that will touch every human being in this country. We have to count on him to make decisions of judgment.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/30/third-brett-kavanaugh-accuser-was-sued-in-2000-for-false-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct/","Julie Swetnick, the third woman to accuse Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, was sued in 2000 for making false accusations of sexual misconduct against co-workers, and for sexual misconduct of her own, though the case was dismissed.Swetnick issued a statement last Wednesday through her attorney, Michael Avenatti, alleging that Kavanaugh was  present  at gang rapes at high school parties in the early 1980s. She provided no corroborating evidence, and questions immediately arose as to why a string of gang rapes would have been unreported until now, as well as why she would have been going to high school parties during a time when she was in college.Subsequently, reports emerged that she had been accused of making false accusations of sexual misconduct in the past   and that she herself had been accused of sexually inappropriate behavior in the workplace.The Oregonian reported:Julie Swetnick, one of the women accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, faced allegations of her own misconduct during a short stint at a Portland tech company 18 years ago.The lawsuit was dismissed shortly after it was filed late in 2000, court documents show. In emails to The Oregonian/OregonLive, Avenatti called the allegations against his client,  Completely bogus. In the suit, Webtrends alleged Swetnick claimed to have graduated from Johns Hopkins University but the company said it subsequently learned the school had no record of her attendance. Webtrends said she also  falsely described her work experience  at a prior employer.The suit also alleges Swetnick  engaged in unwelcome, sexually offensive conduct  while at Webtrends and  made false and retaliatory allegations that other co-workers had engaged in inappropriate conduct toward her. The Daily Caller elaborated:Swetnick s alleged conduct took place in June 2000, just three weeks after she started working at WebTrends, the complaint shows. WebTrends conducted an investigation that found both male employees gave similar accounts of Swetnick engaging in  unwelcome sexual innuendo and inappropriate conduct  toward them during a business lunch in front of customers, the complaint said.Swetnick denied the allegations and, WebTrends alleged,  in a transparent effort to divert attention from her own inappropriate behavior  [made] false and retaliatory allegations  of sexual harassment against two other male co-workers. Based on its investigations, WebTrends determined that Swetnick had engaged in inappropriate conduct, but that no corroborating evidence existed to support Swetnick s allegations against her coworkers,  the complaint said.After a WebTrends human resources director informed Swetnick that the company was unable to corroborate the sexual harassment allegations she had made, she  remarkably  walked back the allegations, according to the complaint.Politico also reported last Wednesday that Swetnick s former boyfriend had filed a restraining order against her in 2001, and that he told the publication:   She s not credible at all.  Not at all. Avenatti called Politico s report  attacking a sexual assault victim. Avenatti is also representing porn star Stormy Daniels against President Donald Trump and preparing his own 2020 presidential run, and has predicted that Trump will not finish his first term.Though Swetnick s allegations were greeted with some skepticism, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) cited them during last Thursday s hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee with Kavanagh and Christine Blasey Ford, who says he groped her in high school.Joel B.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/29/virgil-weve-seen-this-craziness-before-an-ancient-historian-tells-us-how-how-it-ends/","Can American public life get any crazier?  Get any more circus-like?  Any more gladiatorial combat-like?   It seems that all we see and read about these days are accusations, investigations, confrontations and, as Brett Kavanaugh put it,  character assassinations.   Welcome to the JungleIndeed, the fight over Kavanaugh s Supreme Court nomination provides a snapshot of the national maelstrom.   As Kavanaugh said in his September 28 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee,  This has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit . . . My family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed . . . This confirmation process has become a national disgrace. Perhaps most memorably, directing his fury at Senate Democrats, the D.C. Court of Appeals judge added,  You have replaced advise and consent  with search and destroy.  One of the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Lindsey Graham, notably echoed Kavanaugh s attack on the Democrats, describing their last-minute leak-and-ambush tactics as  the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics.   Sen. Ted Cruz agreed with Graham, labeling the Kavanaugh hearings as  one of the most famous shameful incidents in the history of the U.S. Senate. To be sure, the Senate Democrats including, of course, the weirdly gladiator-minded Senator Spartacuswere bloody mad, too, albeit perhaps because their familiar  borking  tactic wasn t working as well as they d hoped.  Yes, the anger on both sides of the aisle was obvious.  As a New York Times reporter tweeted:  What I saw today was a fury between members of opposite parties that is as profound and unnerving as I ve ever seen.  They re not faking it.   In the meantime, out in the liberal grassroots, the anger was even more obvious or egregious: Jill Filipovic, a  scholar  at a D.C. think-tank, tweeted,  Divorce your Republican husbands.   And the actress Mira Sorvino called for  revolution.   In other words, pretty much the usual. For his part, MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes took a more sober tone:  A legitimacy crisis is unfolding before us and it s only a question of when the cataclysmic moment comes when no one can deny it anymore. We needn t agree with Hayes on much of anything to still be struck by his dire words,  cataclysmic moment,  and political science-y jargon,  legitimacy crisis.   A legitimacy crisis comes when people lose faith in the political system.  And there s a lot of lost faith going around, for myriad reasons, including just to name a very few the Iraq War, the Wall Street bailout, and the doings of the Deep State. Of course, the ultimate consequences can be, yes, cataclysmic.  Indeed, amidst all the talk of  coarsened culture  and  partisan polarization,  one even hears talk, from serious people, about a possible civil war.  Thus we are reminded of Abraham Lincoln s declaration of June 16, 1858:  A house divided against itself cannot stand.   And we all know what happened less than three years later.  Yet if the Civil War is a common historical reference point for Americans, as they  look to the past for clues about the future, it is not the most apt reference point.  Why?  Because the Civil War was mostly touched off by slavery, and that s long gone.  And yet the absence of slavery doesn t mean that there aren t plenty of other potential flashpoints.  Indeed, if we look back at history, we can learn some sobering lessons as to how societies can unravel. Gloomy Wisdom from a Greek In particular, we might look to the Greek historian Polybius.  He can t directly address the current state of affairs, since he died in 118 B.C., and yet his wisdom still speaks to us, loud and clear.  In fact, his analysis of political events during polarizing times is timeless.  One of his key themes was the way in which societies transition from one system to another.  For instance, how is it that a democratic system falls apart, to be replaced by another kind of system a worse system? Mindful of the history of the ancient Greek and Roman republics, Polybius observed that a successful democracy had to observe certain groundrules to guide popular participation.  That is, a democracy had to be more than just majority rule; if it was just that, it would prove to be unstable and short-lived.   In his view, simple majoritarianism wasn t democracy at all; it was, instead, to use another Greek word, an ochlocracy.  That is, mob rule.  (Interestingly, the Latin translation of   ochlocracy  was mobile vulgus, from which we get the word  mob. )  This distinction, between democracy and mob rule, is critical.  In The Histories, Polybius noted,  It is not enough to constitute a democracy that the whole crowd of citizens should have the right to do whatever they wish or propose.   Instead, he argues, a successful democracy requires  traditional and habitual  virtues of self-restraint, including  reverence to the gods, succour of parents, respect to elders, obedience to laws.   Only in such a disciplined context, he continued, can majority rule succeed.  Indeed, only then  we may speak of the form of government as a democracy.  In other words, for a democracy to flourish, certain preconditions have to be met,  including a basic cultural commitment to deliberation and restraint.  If this sounds  conservative  to the modern ear, well, so be it, although we can note that Polybius mades no prescription as to, say, tax rates, trade laws, or foreign policy.  He was simply laying down the societal predicates for an effective democracy.  And if that sounds conservative, well, it s the conservatism of prudence and moderation, not conservatism bound to any larger ideology.  Importantly, the American Founders agreed with Polybius; indeed, they specifically relied on him as an intellectual guide.  For instance, James Madison, author of the U.S. Constitution, cited Polybius in a letter to Thomas Jefferson in 1787, and again in Number 63 of the Federalist Papers, published the following year.  (The Federalist Papers, of course, were the articles and pamphlets written in support of the ratification of the Constitution.) Indeed, it s fair to assert that much of the argument over the Constitution was framed in Polybian terms that is, how to keep a democracy from degenerating into a mob-ocracy, and from there, into anarchy and debacle.  In the 18th century, the common word for  mob  was  faction.   And it was faction, and factionalism, that the Founders feared the most.  And so factionalism was very much on the mind of Madison as he authored the Constitution, a document outlining a rules-based democracy.   Such rules are vital, Madison wrote in Federalist Number 10, because  a pure democracy . . .  can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction.   Continuing in that vein, Madison warned that factionalism was, inevitably, a formula for civil war:  The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame. And so, he continues, absent proper constitutional restraints, once the majority gets up a head of steam,  there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party.   Unchecked mobs? Demanding violent sacrifices?  That s indeed the stuff of lynchings, even open combat. Madison s antidote to the  mischiefs of faction  was, again, the Constitution, with its carefully calibrated enumeration of powers, spread across three branches of government executive, legislative, and judicial.  In other words, Madison s vision was of a republic, not a pure democracy, or, as some might call it, a democratic republic.  Yet by any name, Madison s goal was clear: to compartmentalize popular passions and thereby protect the United States.  Revealingly, the title Madison gave to Federalist #10 was,  The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection.  Madison knew that two millennia earlier, Polybius had written about what happens when faction and insurrection run amok:  The mob . . . as soon as it has got a leader sufficiently ambitious and daring . . . produces a reign of mere violence.   To be sure, today we aren t living under a  reign of mere violence  although House Majority Steve Scalise would have good reason to differ.  Yet still, we might look around and ask: How far away are we from a mob-ridden dystopia?  Without a doubt, we already have plenty of psychic violence we saw a lot of it last week, and not just on Capitol Hill. For instance, Lauren Baer, the Democratic nominee for Congress in Florida s 18th Congressional district, spoke on behalf of mob  values  when she said,  I stand in solidarity with women and men who share their stories.  Every single allegation of sexual assault and sexual harassment should be heard and believed.  [emphasis added]   To which the rest of us might say, Quick!  Someone get Ms. Baer a copy of the classic novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, which is, of course, all about a false rape accusation.  In the meantime, Brett Kavanaugh must know what it s like to be the subject of Baer-type frenzy. As Polybius writes, when democracy has yielded to mob rule, it s all downhill:  Then come tumultuous assemblies, massacres, banishments, redivisions of land. And yet here s where Polybius gets even more interesting.  As he puts it, just at the moment when the formerly democratic society is  losing all trace of civilization,  the trend-line changes.  But it changes, he adds, not back to democracy, but rather, toward tyranny; the mob  has once more found a master and a despot.   In a grim way, this all makes sense: Ordinary people don t want to live in chaos; in the face of unchecked violence and banditry, just about any kind of order is preferable.   And that preference opens the door to tyranny, which may be popular even very popular at least for a time.  Thus we see the heart of Polybius  argument: If it s not properly tended, a democracy devolves into mob-ocracy, which then gives way to tyranny. The Modern Polybius By now, some will have noted that Polybius  grim historical sequence has a  familiar ring.  Indeed, all over the Internet one sees words of warning, attributed to the Scots historian Alexander Fraser Tytler:The average age of the world s greatest civilizations from the beginning of history has been about 200 years.  During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From abundance to selfishness; From selfishness to complacency; From complacency to apathy; From apathy to dependence; From dependence back into bondage. In point of fact, Tytler never said exactly this, although he expressed similar sentiments in an 1801 volume that frequently cited, yes, Polybius.  Actually, though, the above words come from an American businessman, Henning Prentis, writing in the 1940s.Yet there s not much point in getting bogged down over exact authorship.  Indeed, Polybius deliberately wrote in such a way that any thoughtful observer, in any era, could apply his wisdom: If a man have a clear grasp of these principles he may perhaps make a mistake as to the dates at which this or that will happen to a particular constitution; but he will rarely be entirely mistaken as to the stage of growth or decay at which it has arrived, or as to the point at which it will undergo some revolutionary change. What matters whether the wisdom comes from Polybius, Tytler, Prentis, or anyone else today is that we grasp the moral of the history: We must not let democracy degenerate into chaos, because if we do, the result won t just be more chaos but, rather, tyranny.   As we have seen, that s exactly the fate that Madison and the Founders wished to avoid.  Now, today, in our time, we re on notice: If we don t reverse the path to  chaos, the American republic, too, will be entered into the annals of history as just another sad failure.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/29/democrat-to-voters-fbi-investigation-for-scotus-nominee-standard-procedure-for-decades/","A Connecticut Democratic member of Congress sent out an email letter to voters in his district in which he said it has been  standard procedure for decades  to have Supreme Court nominees with new allegations against them investigated by the FBI.U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney wrote to voters in his district Friday that Christine Blasey Ford s  powerful and credible testimony should give every member of the U.S. Senate pause before moving forward on this nomination for a lifetime appointment to our nation s highest court. Courtney continued:That is why I strongly support the proposal today by Republican Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona who is asking that a final vote [on] Kavanaugh s nomination be delayed until after the FBI has completed an investigation into the accusations of sexual misconduct against him. It has been standard procedure for decades to refer any new allegations made against a Supreme Court nominee to the FBI for review, and it would be completely unprecedented if an investigation was not undertaken in this instance.Courtney, however, is feeding false information to the voters of his district. The standard procedure, in fact, is for the Senate Judiciary Committee to investigate new allegations, not the FBI. The Senate Judiciary Committee has its own investigative staff.Thomas Jipping, deputy director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, observed at the Daily Signal that, first, Democrats have already made clear their motivation for another delay: they hope the continued cloud of controversy over Kavanaugh will defeat his nomination and hold the vacant seat on the Supreme Court open until, presumably, they win control of the Senate.Secondly, Jipping pointed out the demand for another FBI investigation  is not valid and based on a complete misunderstanding of the bureau s role.  Kavanaugh s opponents want people to think that the FBI is on standby, ready to run down all the leads and figure out what really happened,  he wrote.  That may be what a law enforcement agency does in the criminal justice system as seen on TV but not in the confirmation process. Jipping continued:In fact, as CBS News recently described it, the FBI  conducts a background check at the request of the White House, mainly to determine whether the nominee would pose a risk to national security interests of the United States, according to the Justice Department. That has already been done. It s worth noting that this  full-field  FBI investigation has been conducted every time Kavanaugh was hired or appointed to a significant government position. Six times between 1993 and 2018, the FBI went talking to people about Kavanaugh. Six times, all after the incident that Ford alleges, the FBI never heard anyone even whisper a word about sexual misconduct. Kavanaugh s opponents not only want people to think that the FBI has a criminal justice role in the confirmation process, but they mislead people to think that if the FBI does not jump in, there will be no investigation of Ford s allegation,  Jipping wrote.To present a truthful account of the FBI role in allegations against Supreme Court nominees, Courtney would have to direct voters in his district to the words of another Democrat  former Vice President Joe Biden  who, as the U.S. senator from Delaware in 1991, told the Senate Judiciary Committee twice that an FBI investigation was worthless as a determination of the facts:The last thing I will point out, the next person who refers to an FBI report as being worth anything, obviously doesn t understand anything. FBI explicitly does not, in this or any other case, reach a conclusion, period. Period.The reason why we cannot rely on the FBI report [is] you would not like it if we did because it is inconclusive. They say, He said, she said, and they said.  Period. So when people wave an FBI report before you, understand they do not, they do not reach conclusions,  Biden said. The mantra of FBI investigation  by Kavanaugh s opponents is misleading in its purpose and has no validity,  Jipping continued.  The confirmation process is already structured and equipped to evaluate even unexpected allegations as they arise and will do so as, in Kavanaugh s case, it nears a conclusion. Common sense request from the @ABAesq who endorsed Kavanaugh. The Senate and the country need an FBI inquiry before any votes take place. #KavanaughConfirmation https://t.co/ViXWpGTbCG  Rep. Joe Courtney (@RepJoeCourtney) September 28, 2018In his letter to voters, Courtney also cites the call for another FBI investigation from  the nonpartisan American Bar Association (ABA) which previously declared Kavanaugh to be qualified for the Supreme Court. However, Courtney failed to inform voters in his district that ABA president Robert Carlson is not a member of the organization s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary  which reviews Supreme Court nominees and already gave Kavanaugh its highest rating  and the controversy within the ABA over Carlson s call for another FBI investigation.The Wall Street Journal editorial board observed:Mr. Carlson is not a member of that committee, and he is not supposed to speak for the ABA unless the legal group has made a policy decision. In this case he is trying to sandbag his own ABA colleagues. Paul Moxley, the Utah lawyer who chairs the ABA s judicial committee, made that clear on Friday when he wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Mr. Carlson s letter  was not received  by his ABA committee  prior to its issuance.  Mr. Moxley added:  The ABA s rating for Judge Kavanaugh is not affected by Mr. Carlson s letter. In other words, Mr. Carlson is free-lancing for partisan purposes and the Senate should ignore him. For the rest of us, however, this is one more reason to bar the ABA from any judicial vetting. Some of us still remember the ABA s shoddy treatment of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.Similarly, in a statement sent to Breitbart News, Ronald A. Cass, Dean Emeritus at Boston University School of Law and President of Cass & Associates, PC, wrote:As a former member of the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, representing the DC Circuit, I was impressed with the American Bar Association s work on this nomination.I am, however, deeply disappointed to see the recent statement of the ABA s President, who does not serve on this Committee and has no authority to speak for the Committee or the Association on qualifications of judicial nominees, calling for a pause in Senate proceedings on the Kavanaugh nomination pending further investigation.The Standing Committee, which is the sole entity within the ABA charged with evaluating federal judicial nominees and conveying its assessments to the Senate, works in a bipartisan manner, takes its work very seriously, does thorough investigations and careful considerations. After a thorough investigation, it unanimously accorded Judge Kavanaugh its highest rating. To suggest, as the ABA President implicitly does, that it overlooked important information is both contrary to what is in the public domain today and disrespectful of the men and women who serve on the Standing Committee.In a column at Breitbart News, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) wrote the delay afforded by another FBI investigation serves a political purpose. What Senate Democrats really want is more time to smear Judge Kavanaugh, regardless of the toll it takes on his wife, his daughters, and our country,  the senator said.Democrats  have never been about getting the facts or finding the truth,  Cassidy asserted.  If they were, they would have alerted law enforcement months ago, as soon as they learned of the claims. Instead, they waited until the last minute to leak them in order to delay the vote.

That tweet has been deleted,  the paper wrote in a Saturday evening tweet.USA Today also provided a short editor s note at the beginning of the sports column  clarifying  the intent of the article, merely stating that it was  the writer s opinion :Editor s note: Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh has told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee he loves coaching his daughters  girls basketball teams, but said in testimony Thursday  thanks to what some of you on this side of the committee have unleashed, I may never be able to coach again.   The intent of this commentary was to address that question. The column was re-edited to more closely reflect that intent and labeled to reflect it as the writer s opinion.The article focused on Kavanaugh s emotional testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday when Kavanaugh said that California psychology professor Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s allegations brought to the committee s attention by Senate Democrats ruined his reputation to the point where he may never be able to coach girls  basketball again. The U.S. Senate may yet confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, but he should stay off basketball courts for now when kids are around,  wrote sports columnist Erik Brady.Thousands of people slammed the paper for its  disgraceful  journalism before USA Today updated its article, but some people have not been so forgiving of the paper:@USATODAY deleted the original tweet about this shameful piece because it got ratio d into oblivion, not because they are trying to correct their disgusting take. They obviously make no apologies for their gross implication against Judge Kavanaugh and are doubling down. https://t.co/zD9mupT71F  Jack Sun (@jacque_sun88) September 29, 2018https://twitter.com/Source_Persil/status/1046205062614155264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1046205062614155264&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitchy.com%2Fdougp-3137%2F2018%2F09%2F29%2Fusa-today-deletes-tweet-and-edits-disgusting-hit-on-brett-kavanaugh-backlash-only-intensifies%2FYou did go far enough in J School to know what Libel & Slander are, right?

Uh, uh, what? No. Uh, no. I didn t le uh. Uh, wait one minute. Did we le oh, oh. No, no, we didn t leak it.  President Trump then said,  I ll tell you what. That was really bad body language.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/29/one-of-kavanaughs-late-accusers-is-referred-for-prosecution-for-lying/","The Senate Judiciary Committee made a criminal referral Saturday for the Rhode Island man who claimed Judge Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted his friend on a boat in 1985, asking that he be prosecuted for lying to Congress.In a letter, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) asks Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray that the accuser, whose name was redacted, be investigated for  potential violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001 and 1505, for materially false statements [he] made to the Committee as part of its investigation of allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. The accuser s name has been redacted in all Senate documents since this allegation first became public with the release of a transcript from Kavanaugh s Monday conference call under penalty of felony, in which he cateogorically denied it. Journalists, however, were quickly able to find the social media account referenced along with the allegation. The account identified itself as  Jeffrey Catalan  and had been used to make calls for President Donald Trump to be overthrown by a military coup and accusations the president had murdered someone  in 1983. The account describes its owner as a  Graphic Artist, Artist, photography and writer. Hippie, First Responder, Father and Grandpa  from Tiverton, Rhode Island.The Jeffrey Catalan account promptly retracted the allegation Wednesday night, claiming he made  a mistake  when he claimed a 20-year-old Judge Kavanuagh sexually assaulted a woman on a boat and that he then severely beat Kavanaugh for it. Grassley s Saturday letter references this retraction, confirming the identification of the accuser as  Jeffrey Catalan,  although, because of the redaction, it is still not clear if that is the man s real name. Catalan,  referred to as a  Rhode Island constituent,  called Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse s (D-RI) office on Monday morning. He claimed that in Newport, Rhode Island, in August of 1985, he and a friend had confronted two other men named  Brett and Mark  and gave them a beating that left Brett and Mark with severe injuries. They, according to the call, had gone down to find Brett and Mark by the pier because an unnamed female friend told them she had been sexually assaulted by the pair on a boat after meeting them at a local bar.Catalan claimed he knew that  Brett,  the man he severely beat 33 years ago, was Judge Kavanaugh after seeing Kavanaugh s high school yearbook photo on the news jogged his memory.Whitehouse s office considered the allegation credible enough to pass it on to the Judiciary Committee as a whole, leading committee staff to question Kavanaugh over the alleged incident later on Monday. Whitehouse himself, as is clear from a letter to the committee released Saturday, also sent the allegation to the FBI and gave the accuser a contact of his in the media to help break the story.As with the at least four other accusations of sexual misconduct for which the Judiciary Committee has investigated Kavanaugh, the judge flatly denied it occurred.  I was not in Newport, haven t been on a boat in Newport. Not with Mark Judge on a boat, nor all those three things combined. This is just completely made up, or at least not me. I don t know what they re referring to,  he told committee investigators.With Catalan s retraction, it was clear enough to Grassley that the man had likely lied to Senator Whitehouse. Lying to congressional staff about an official matter they are investigating and deliberately obstructing a congressional investigation are both felonies, even when the intentionally misleading statements are not made under oath. The Committee is grateful to citizens who come forward with relevant information in good faith, even if they are not one hundred percent sure about what they know,  Grassley wrote in his letter.  But when individuals provide fabricated allegations to the Committee, diverting Committee resources during time-sensitive investigations, it materially impedes our work. Such acts are not only unfair; they are potentially illegal.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/29/barr-truly-terrible-damage-wrought-jeff-flake/","Any member of Congress is capable at any time of doing harm to his or her political party or even the country itself.Casting a vote undermining a carefully crafted piece of legislation after committing to colleagues not to do so. Making a public statement clearly at odds with universally accepted norms. Engaging in conduct that is unlawful, unethical, or both. Refusing to apologize when such an act clearly is necessary and appropriate. These are but a few actions in which a senator or member of Congress can engage that can hurt their party colleagues or, in extreme cases, the country.Rarely, however, can someone in as important a position as a sitting United States senator do such great harm as that by Arizona s Sen. Jeff Flake in telling his Republican Party, and indeed the entire country, that he would refuse to vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the floor of the Senate   even after voting to have the nomination reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee on which he serves   unless the FBI conducts another investigation; this one focused on the allegations leveled against Kavanaugh after the week-long hearings conducted by the committee earlier this month.Many Republicans in Congress and the administration, while critical of Flake s last-minute but not altogether unexpected shenanigans, downplay the potential cost of subjecting Kavanaugh and his family to yet another week of the Hell to which they already have been subject. The silver lining on which these Republicans focus seems to be their conclusion that all the witnesses who already have come out in support of the judge s side of the story, will be consistent and tell the FBI the exact same thing in the course of this new investigation. Unfortunately, in the real world, what someone says one day does not always jibe precisely with what they might choose to say on another day to a different person. Even if that discrepancy is not made with ill intent, and notwithstanding that an interviewee s recollection or retelling of an event may not be significant, rest assured that the Left will seize on any such instance as yet more evidence of Kavanaugh s guilt and as reason to further undermine his credibility.Even more problematic is the possibility that   despite the judge s obvious excellent, if not phenomenal memory and impressive attention to detail   he personally says something at odds with his testimony already on the record or that he stated in an earlier interview with the FBI or any other federal official. Can you envision the firestorm of renewed calls by senators and House members for not only his defeat in the Senate vote, but as grounds for his later impeachment? You can hear the wails already:  A Supreme Court justice who has perjured himself and lied under oath. This cannot stand! Flake s truly idiotic demand that his Senate vote can be had only if yet more investigation be done of what surely is the most investigated judicial nominee in our country s history, will come back to haunt the nation long after this vote is taken. And the political damage this lone senator has wrought will reverberate in the fast-approaching mid-term election, regardless of whether Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed by the Senate, and definitely not to the advantage of the GOP.In demanding precisely what every Democrat on the Judiciary Committee had sought, but which the Republicans had   amazingly   held the line against, Flake gave the other party credibility and cover they would not otherwise have. Now, thanks to Flake, every Democratic candidate will be able to claim that their incessant calls for further investigation of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh were  bipartisan.  And technically, such a claim would be truthful.As anyone who possesses even a rudimentary knowledge of contemporary politics knows to a certainty, regardless of what the coming investigation of Kavanaugh s accusers yields, the Democrats will continue their harangue against the GOP, the President, and the Judge himself. If the good Sen. Flake thought he might be purchasing for himself some goodwill from his colleagues on the other side of the aisle, or perhaps lining up left-leaning clients for his post-senatorial career, he is sadly mistaken. The Left will shun him now that he has given them what they craved. The GOP will remember him as a Benedict Arnold. And he will fade into the Arizona sunset as a modern-day Icarus blinded by his own misguided yearning to be admired.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/29/trump-fbi-kavanaugh-investigation-blessing-in-disguise-democrats-acting-terrible-dishonest/","President Donald Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House Saturday that he believes the FBI investigation into Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh is  going very well. The president stopped just before boarding Marine One on his way to rally supporters in West Virginia for the Republican challenger to Sen. Joe Manchin, candidate Patrick Morrissey.  I think it s going very well. The FBI as you know is all over talking to everybody,  Trump told the reporters.  I would expect it will turn out very well.  There has never been anybody looked at like Judge Kavanaugh,  said Trump. He remarked on the good job that the FBI is doing.  They have free reign, they can do whatever they have to do, whatever it is that they do. They ll be doing things we have never even thought of,  Trump went on.  And hopefully at the conclusion, everything will be fine. President Trump reaffirmed his belief that Kavanaugh has not done anything wrong.  I think he s great. I don t think there s ever been any person who s been under scrutiny like he has,  he said.  I think it s been a very tough process. He s a good man. He s a great judge. A great judge. Highly respected for many many years. At the top of the list. I hope that everything works great.  I really believe when the public looks at these situations that have taken place over the last three or four days, and what the Democrats are doing and more importantly how they are acting. So terrible. So dishonest,  said Trump. He pointed to Democrats  Keeping papers and documents and not releasing them until after the hearings are over. Trump said of Sen. Jeff Flake forcing the FBI investigation,  he s fine. Actually, this could be a blessing in disguise. Having the FBI go out and do a thorough investigation, whether its three days or seven days, I think it s going to be less than a week. President Trump said the FBI investigation  will be a blessing in disguise. It will be a good thing. Responding still to reporter questions, he said,  I don t need a backup plan. I think he s going to be fine. Trump said  the FBI has a chance to reveal a lot of different things.  He expressed hope that the investigation will uncover who leaked Kavanaugh accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s papers.  Was it Sen. [Dianne] Feinstein? Certainly, her body language was not exactly very good when they asked her that question.  He indicated that he believes a Democrat  leaked the papers.

Jeff Flake (R-AZ) said he would vote to move Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation vote out of committee so long as the FBI conducts a one-week investigation into unresolved matters stemming from Christine Blasey Ford s allegations. Trump later ordered the FBI probe.Though Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) has the lead in the RealClearAverage of polls conducted before this week s hearings, much can change after this week. A recent poll found that 58% of West Virginians want Kavanaugh confirmed, and Trump s rally in a state in which he has consistently had the highest favorability ratings can only give Morrisey a boost going into the home stretch. Morrisey has been hammering Manchin for siding with Flake and being  undecided  on the vote until the one-week FBI investigation into Ford s allegations concludes.Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates. All times eastern. 8:38 PM: Trump asks voters to register to vote by October 16 to vote for Morrisey. He talks about the brave pioneer men and women who built West Virginia.

Points out record-low African-American unemployment rate and wonders how he can lose in 2020.8:16 PM: Trump blasting past politicians for building up China with unfair trade policies.  The stupid days are over,  Trump says. He also accuses Obama of almost going to war with North Korea (thankfully his  time was up ) and  millions of people would have died.  He says he has gotten hostages back and there is no more nuclear testing and rockets and missiles going up  I like Kim and he likes me,  Trump says.  We ve come a long way since you know the term.

Trump says the  Democrat Party  is the  party of crime,   radical socialism,  and  open borders.  He says Democrats want to  raid Medicare  and  destroy Social Security  to pay for their  radical socialism.  He says Democrats will give Medicare to people who don t deserve it like  illegal aliens coming into our country  while Republicans want to protect Medicare to our great seniors who have earned it and fought for it. He says he will always protect people with pre-existing conditions. He says all of the Republicans are coming into his position.  Pre-existing conditions are safe,  he says. (Manchin is strong in West Virginia because of health care issues.)7:56 PM: Trump says  a vote for Morrisey is a vote for me  Also says it s a vote for  West Virginia values,  for the America-first agenda, and to  keep America great.

Morrisey says the radicals in WashingtonSchumer, Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Joe Manchindo not want to see Trump succeed and want to obstruct just like they did this week against Kavanaugh. Ladies and gentleman, we must confirm Judge Kavanaugh,  Morrisey says.7:45 PM: Trump introduces Morrisey as someone who is going to give West Virginians a vote for what we want and  there will be no question about it.  Morrisey says Trump is making America and West Virginia great again. He says for far too long, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and   Washington liberal Joe Manchin  and all the coastal elites have advanced liberal policies, practiced political correctness, and not put America first. He says West Virginia has a  very important decision to make  this election and ties Manchin to Clinton and Obama. He was West Virginia can stand someone who puts  you first, America first, and West Virginia first.   The stakes in this election couldn t be higher,  he says. He calls Manchin  dishonest Washington liberal  Manchin. He says he is a  conservative fighter  with a  record of results  who will  advance Trump s agenda.  He says a vote for Manchin empowers the radical liberals seen in the Senate circus this past week. He says Manchin has a history of abandoning West Virginacites gun control, life, paychecks (said no to Trump tax cuts), amnesty, opposing the border wall. He says Manchin supported Clinton even after she made clear she wanted to  take away our coal, our oil, and our gas jobs. Shame on Joe Manchin and that s why liberal Joe s gotta go.  We re gonna build that wall,  Morrisey says, later adding,  we ll all stand for the national anthem. 7:42 PM: Trump thanks West Virginians for taking him in ( you took me in ).

Trumps says when you see people who are  mean,  and  angry  and  untruthful  And then he blasts Feinstein and mocks her answer about whether she leaked Ford s confidential letter.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) demanded in a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) on Saturday that the FBI investigate Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh s statements made under oath during Thursday s hearing to see if he is telling the truth.Lying to Congress is a federal crime.The FBI must examine the veracity of Kavanaugh s statements under oath in addition to the sexual assault allegations against him. Kavanaugh s truthfulness with the Senate goes to the very heart of whether he should be confirmed to the court. pic.twitter.com/TsNOTm4fxK  Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) September 29, 2018 Lying to Congress is a federal crime,  Sanders tweeted Saturday morning.  The FBI must examine the veracity of Kavanaugh s statements under oath in addition to the sexual assault allegations against him. Kavanaugh s truthfulness with the Senate goes to the very heart of whether he should be confirmed to the court. Sanders wrote in the letter that the FBI must not only investigate the accusations made by California psychology professor Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Debora Ramirez, and Julie Swetnick, but they should also look into Kavanaugh s testimony before the Judiciary Committee. In order for the FBI investigation regarding Judge Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to be complete, it is imperative the bureau must not only look into the accusations made by Dr. [Christine Blasey] Ford, Debora Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, it should also examine the veracity of his testimony before the Judiciary Committee,  Sanders wrote in the letter. A fundamental question the FBI can help answer is whether Judge Kavanaugh has been truthful with the committee. This goes to the very heart of whether he should be confirmed to the court,  Sanders  letter continued.The Vermont senator also called for the FBI investigation to take longer than one week, citing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s decision to delay holding a hearing for Merrick Garland s nomination to the Supreme Court for almost a year. If you are concerned with a delay in this confirmation process, remember that Senate Republicans refused to allow the Senate to consider Merrick Garland s nomination to the Supreme Court for nearly a year,  Sanders wrote.One of Kavanaugh s accusers, Dr. Ford, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, and Kavanaugh also testified before the committee responding to her allegations that he sexually assaulted her at a high school party in 1982.The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Friday in an 11-10 party-line vote to send Kavanaugh s confirmation to the Senate floor but decided to take into account Sen. Jeff Flake s (R-AZ) call for a one-week delay on the floor vote so the FBI could conduct an investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations.President Trump ordered the FBI to  conduct a supplemental investigation  into Kavanaugh that would last no longer than  one week.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) utilizing the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh to fundraise for Harris s Democratic colleague from Indiana, Sen. Joe Donnelly, who is facing a reelection battle. I walked out,  Harris boasts in the fundraising appeal.  Republicans rushed Judge Kavanaugh s confirmation with a sham hearing yesterday morning, less than 24 hours after Dr. Christine Blasey Ford had the courage to tell her story in front of the entire country. It s a disgrace. So, instead of sitting through the farce  I walked out. Harris launches into a bid petitioning MoveOn.org members to  rush  contributions as little as $3 to Donnelly:I know I m not alone in this fight; millions of Americans are with me. And as of yesterday morning, I m proud to say that my colleague, Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly, is with me. After hearing Dr. Blasey Ford testify and seeing the GOP effort to push through this confirmation, Sen. Donnelly has said he ll vote no on Kavanaugh.But Sen. Donnelly is in one of the toughest reelection fights this year and we know his opponent, a right-wing candidate who ll march in line with Senators McConnell and Grassley and Donald Trump will attack him for this vote. That s why I m asking:Can MoveOn members around the country help in getting Joe s back?Click here to rush a contribution of $3 to Joe Donnelly to help have his back and end Republican control of the Senate in November.The hyperlink in the email takes subscribers to a MoveOn.org contribution page at ActBlue, the online fundraising giant used by Democrats and progressive groups.MoveOn.org has been massively backed by billionaire George Soros. It has also been financed by the Tides Foundation, a leftwing sponsorship organization that has itself received donations from Soros and has partnered with Soros s Open Society Foundations.MoveOn.org has taken center stage in opposing Kavanaugh, leading a #StopKavanaugh campaign aimed at mobilizing supporters to call their senators in opposition to Kavanaugh s nomination. Call your senator and tell them to #StopKavanaugh,  MoveOn.org demands.  Brett Kavanaugh could gut or overturn Roe v. Wade and the Affordable Care Act, can t be counted on to hold Trump accountable for any criminal activity, and has repeatedly sided with corporations and the wealthy over workers and protecting our environment. On Saturday, Politico reported on progressive groups, including MoveOn.org, making a  last-minute push to stop Kavanaugh.  What we re looking to do right now is to find ways to carry the energy, especially in what s transpired in the last 18 hours,  Erica Mauter, campaign director at MoveOn.org, told Politico.  Phone calls are important, but actually showing upyou feel other people s energy, it s not just you. Aaron Klein is Breitbart s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/29/murray-senate-gop-faces-question-of-whether-senate-is-place-where-women-are-respected/","During Friday s Democratic Weekly Address, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) stated that Senate Republicans face a few questions, including,  Is the United States Senate a place where women are listened to, heard, and respected, or is it still just one more place where women s voices will be swept under the rug, where our voices are ignored, attacked, and undermined? Transcript as Follows: Hi, I m Senator Patty Murray from Washington State.Like so many women and men across the country, I watched Dr. Ford testify on Thursday with tears in my eyes. Her courage is truly incredible, and she is an inspiration to women and girls and sexual assault survivors across the country. Now that we have seen Dr. Ford share her experience so bravely and vividly, and we have heard what Judge Kavanaugh has to say regarding just one of the allegations he faces, the eyes of the nation are on this Supreme Court nomination, and the Republicans who control the Senate face a few very simple but absolutely critical questions. Is the United States Senate a place where women are listened to, heard, and respected, or is it still just one more place where women s voices will be swept under the rug, where our voices are ignored, attacked, and undermined? Will the United States Senate do its job when it comes to our constitutional advice and consent role and truly look into this nominee and make sure he is fit to sit on our nation s Supreme Court, or will we rush through this process, not allow all the voices to be heard or information to be brought forward, and try to jam this nominee through, no matter what?People across the country are watching closely, and I am hoping that Senate Republicans allow us to get these questions right. Because, let s take a step back here,
multiple women have bravely come forward to share their experiences regarding Judge Kavanaugh and sexual assault. These women were immediately attacked. President Trump and some Senate Republicans said they were making it up, that if their claims were true they would have reported it when it happened, that they were mixed up.  Part of a smear campaign, engaged in a drive-by shooting of Judge Kavanaugh, and much   and worse. It has been truly horrific. And now, instead of listening to these women, digging into these serious allegations, and doing their jobs, Senate Republicans seem intent on rushing this nomination through to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, no matter what he may have done.But here s the bottom line, and it s something that should not be partisan or controversial, the United States Senate should do its job. Senate Republicans should allow us to do our jobs. They should allow a full FBI investigation of these allegations, which all of the women have welcomed and called for, but that Judge Kavanaugh and the people trying to protect him are trying to prevent from happening. If he has truly nothing to hide, and he truly wants the facts to come out, he should welcome this. They should hold more hearings with the women who have come forward, along with all the relevant witnesses to testify under oath. And they should slow this down and end this mad dash to a confirmation. The only reason to rush would be to protect Judge Kavanaugh and prevent the truth from coming out, no matter what he has done. That would be absolutely wrong and it would be unacceptable.I first decided to run for the Senate when I saw an all-male Judiciary Committee mistreat Anita Hill in 1991 during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. I ran to be a voice for the women and men across the country who thought it was absolutely wrong for her to be ignored and attacked and swept aside and disbelieved. And now, 27 years later, women and men are watching. Our daughters, sons, and grandkids are watching. They re paying attention. They are asking those questions I asked before, will women be listened to? Will women be heard? And this time, I hope the United States Senate gets it right.Thank you.

I have seen men cry like kavanaugh, the one who cried at my feet after smashing my face thru a glass coffee table, the one sobbing and screaming until i understood it was my fault for making him angry enough to attack me,  the Animal Kingdom star wrote, as Kavanaugh gave emotional testimony against 35-year-old allegations made by Dr. Christine Ford. I would love to play poker w Kavanaugh. He just sat down and the tells on display are shocking. Guilty as fuck,  she said. Make no mistake, kavanaugh s emotion is real. He is a guilty man living with the shame of exposure. Choke on it. Barkin was one of the many Hollywood figures to come forward with allegations about disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein s behavior. While she revealed she was never subject to his sexual advances, she said in a New Yorker interview last October that Weinstein often verbally abused her, calling her a  cunt  and  cunt bitch  while as they worked together on his film Into the West. The Sea of Love star is well known for her far-left activism. In 2012, she sneered at the untimely death of Andrew Breitbart claiming he died of the  Peruvian flu,  while describing his conservative supporters as as  evil assholes  and  pro murder.

I love coaching more than anything I ve ever done in my whole life,  Kavanaugh said in his opening statement on Thursday.  But thanks to what some of you on this side of the committee have unleashed, I may never be able to coach again. The Supreme Court nominee also said, speaking through tears at the Thursday hearing, that his ten-year-old daughter offered to pray for Dr. Ford.The article also attempted to compare scandals where coaches who train children in gymnastics were convicted a crime to the Kavanaugh allegations because he passed background checks and continues to coach basketball at his daughter s private school and in the Catholic Youth Organization.Archdiocese of Washington spokesman Edward McFadden told USA Today that  adult volunteers with extensive contact with children  go through background checks, and would have to be convicted of a crime before not being allowed to coach. He has no record and has no criminal background. He s gone through the (training) process. He can coach,  McFadden said.But the article takes it a step further, claiming that accusations without evidence should warrant no investigation. Credibly accused sex offenders should not coach youth basketball, girls or boys, without deeper investigation,  the article states.Although the columnist wrote the article as an opinion piece for the paper, USA Today promoted the article on social media as a straight news article. The piece prompted social media users to slam the paper for its  disgraceful  article:This is disgraceful, @usatodaysports. The man was accused of atrocities with no evidence, no corroboration, no proof. He s undergone 6 FBI investigations in his life. Maybe wait to criminalize someone till you have damn good reason?

Keep minorities and women down. All white men, oh, and Ben Carson,  Chelsea Handler tweeted.Republican Party = white male party. They don t care about women and they don t care about the future.

Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) September 28, 2018This follows another tweet sent Friday where Handler said that Judge Brett Kavanaugh threw a  hysterical temper tantrum  during his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday.Yesterday, we watched Brett Kavanaugh, a grown man who wants to be a part of the highest court in the land, throw a hysterical temper tantrum. All while he was sober. Think about that.  Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) September 28, 2018Indeed, Judge Kavanaugh defended himself in his passionate opening statement in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups,  Kavanaugh said.Handler s online presence is frequently unhinged. In July, the left-wing political activist begged Twitter to remove President Donald Trump s account.Can @Twitter just remove Trump s account, already? No leader of any country should be tweeting threats to people and other countries. That would actually force him to talk more and explain policies and answer questions on tape, and we all know how that goes.

What could be more important than fighting for the rights of our daughters, mothers, and sisters not to be thrown in jail for making decisions about their own bodies and futures?  Handler wrote in a press release. We need to do everything possible to defeat this nomination. We need to speak out. We need to call our senators. We need to take to the streets.

[A]t this point, Kavanaugh isn t just a Supreme Court nominee,  Carlson said.  He is a folk hero to many people   an inspiration to millions. People who have spent the last two years being browbeaten and bullied by their moral inferiors were buoyed by what he said yesterday. These are people who have been told they re worthless and bigoted. They have been unfairly maligned because they are in the way of other people gaining power. They ve been commanded to shut up and obey. Kavanaugh stood up for those people yesterday. He raised a middle finger to the tormentors, and they love him for it.  Kavanaugh is more popular with Republican voters tonight than any single Republican senator,  he added.  And he is incalculably more popular than the Senate as a whole. Kavanaugh probably wouldn t describe it this way, but he has a constituency   a powerful one. And they will long remember if Republicans defend him in his moment of need.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/pro-life-leaders-slam-sen-joe-donnelly-on-kavanaugh-no-vote/","National pro-life leaders say Sen. Joe Donnelly is making a serious career mistake in his decision to vote against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List), said:Joe Donnelly s decision to vote against Judge Kavanaugh is a profound betrayal and Indiana voters will remember this at the ballot box in November. Instead of standing with Hoosiers  who showed their trust in President Trump to nominate Supreme Court justices when they elected him by a 19-point margin  Donnelly caved to pressure from Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin and the radical abortion lobby.Read Joe s statement on the Kavanaugh nomination: pic.twitter.com/JvjTOKEDyF  Senator Joe Donnelly (@SenDonnelly) September 28, 2018Donnelly, who claims to be pro-life, announced his decision Thursday, stating he had  deep reservations  about Kavanaugh s nomination. He criticized Senate majority Leader Mitch McConnell for not agreeing to an FBI investigation of Kavanaugh, though in 1991, then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE) told the Senate Judiciary Committee twice that an FBI investigation was worthless as a determination of the facts:The last thing I will point out, the next person who refers to an FBI report as being worth anything, obviously doesn t understand anything. FBI explicitly does not, in this or any other case, reach a conclusion, period. Period.The reason why we cannot rely on the FBI report [is] you would not like it if we did because it is inconclusive. They say, He said, she said, and they said.  Period. So when people wave an FBI report before you, understand they do not, they do not reach conclusions,  Biden said. Joe Donnelly is about to make the biggest mistake in his career if he does not change his mind  which he still has some days to do,  Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life told Breitbart News in a statement. He added:For one thing, any senator who votes  No  on Judge Kavanaugh will be legitimizing the most shameful smear campaign ever to occur in American politics, and discouraging every future nominee from saying  Yes  to the call to serve in the federal court system.  And another reason this is a mistake for Senator Donnelly is that I will personally  and without apology or ambiguity  use all my communication platforms to urge every voter within my reach in the state of Indiana to vote against him in November.Dannenfelser also said the SBA List field team  has spent months on the ground in Indiana where we will be active through Election Day, reaching out to pro-life voters who don t always get to the polls, as well as persuadable Democrats, Independents, and Hispanic voters.  Hoosiers deserve better than Joe Donnelly,  she added.Donnelly is facing off against Hoosier businessman Mike Braun in a competitive race in November. Donnelly s decision to oppose President Trump s highly qualified nominee is a grave mistake, but proves he is more concerned with standing with his liberal Democrat leaders than standing for Hoosiers,  Braun said.  I continue to strongly support Judge Kavanaugh s confirmation to the Supreme Court. SBA List s ground activity is part of an historic effort to visit more than two million homes across the battleground states of Indiana, Ohio, Florida, Missouri, West Virginia, North Dakota, and Montana ahead of Election Day 2018.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/09/28/joe-digenova-kavanaugh-inquisition-is-our-future-with-democrats-in-power/","Former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova framed Thursday s Senate Judiciary Committee hearings with Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh as glimpses of America s future with Democrat congressional majorities. He offered his remarks in a Friday interview with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow on SiriusXM s Breitbart News Daily.DiGenova said,  What you saw on display by the Democrats on that committee was the raw political power that they will wield against people of goodwill, and all you have to do to know that is what s going to happen is look at what the IRS did to conservative groups under Lois Lerner and John Koskinen. DiGenova continued,  This is the future of our country if the Democrats get control of the House and Senate. They are vile people. There is nothing good anymore to be said about the Democratic Party. They have eschewed all integrity [and] honesty in pursuit of power. They are an ugly people, and they need to be beaten down politically and defeated. LISTEN:DiGenova described the dual Ford-Kavanaugh hearings as politically damaging for Democrats. I think the Democrats  worst nightmare occurred, and that is that Christine Blasey Ford testified,  said diGenova.  It was a terrible mistake, because what you saw was a terribly troubled woman with deep emotional problems. DiGenova described Ford s testimony as  adolescent  and  literally unbelievable.  Just think about this,  began diGenova.  This is a woman in her fifties, who 35 years ago said someone attempted to sexually assault her. She then cannot tell you where it happened, when it happened, how she got there, how she left. She left her best friend there, presumably to be raped by these two mad men. DiGenova went on,  Her testimony was adolescent in nature. Her emotional state after 35 years was literally unbelievable. In my opinion, the best thing that happened to Judge Kavanaugh with the public disclosure of these now clearly false allegations was that people got to see her. They got to see her, and they got to see him. DiGenova praised Sen. Lindsey Graham s (R-SC) criticisms of Democrats within the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he is a member. The top of the day was Sen. Lindsey Graham, who in my opinion, gets the profile in courage award of the decade,  remarked diGenova.  He saved a Supreme Court nomination and shamed fellow Republicans who might otherwise have been doubtful into understanding the stakes, the grown-up stakes, when you allow a bunch of Democratic thugs who betrayed their oath of office to the United States Senate, and who should all be up on ethics charges in the Senate. DiGenova continued,  He saved the Senate. This was a great moment in American history and I am so glad that the cameras were rolling for the moment when Lindsey Graham threw off the mantle of John McCain and became his own person. That was a new Lindsey Graham yesterday. He is not the same person he was last week. I have to tell you, I am so proud of Lindsey Graham and what he did. You just cannot believe what it s like in this town, what it was like last night. That was one of the great moments in American history, and I am so thrilled that it was on tape, and to watch the Democrats with their mouths agape, unable to respond, except for the unbelievably stupid and lame response from Dianne Feinstein, a woman who is now infamous for her duplicity and dishonesty. DiGenova described Ford as  deeply troubled  and an  emotional wreck. DiGenova said,  It is clear to me, after having been a prosecutor and a congressional counsel overseeing confirmation hearing for judges, this woman, whatever may be her state of mind, is a deeply troubled person. DiGenova added,  There is not a scintilla evidence of physical, intellectual, corroborative evidence to her story. In fact, it is a fantasy. It never happened. There is no evidence it ever happened. Her unconfirmed personal report given her own admission of her mental and emotional problems makes her story simply unbelievable.DiGenova continued,  She was an emotional wreck. If you want to say that s credibility, fine. She was an emotional wreck, but that was self-induced. There was nothing on the record to confirm that Judge Kavanaugh did anything. DeGenova remarked on what he said was Ford s  mental instability.  It was a sign of Ford s mental instability that attorney Rachel Mitchell was able to draw out of her by developing confidence very quickly through a non-threatening dialogue,  observed diGenova.  [Ford] actually admitted, without difficulty, that she flew all over the world, had no problem doing it, and did it for fun and for business,  added diGenova.  Mitchell was able to draw that out and establish one of the most disturbing sets of facts, was that it was a lie that she couldn t fly to Washington.  I give A-plus to Miss Mitchell.  She drew the Democrats into a false sense of security. DiGenova praised Kavanaugh s statements and responses to Senators  inquiries.  [Kavanaugh] actually surpassed Clarence Thomas,  assessed diGenova.  I was completely taken aback by the ferocity of his defense.  It threw the Democrats for a loop. They did not know what to do. When all was said and done, the Democrats didn t know what to do,  commented diGenova.  They didn t know how to question him. The Democrats went on display with what they think is their best and it ended up being their worst face  hey, may have done more damage to their 2018 electoral prospects by that unprofessional, undignified, sleazy performance, than any group of campaign commercials ever could have done. DiGenova concluded,  I think Judge Kavanaugh was so good and so honest and so compelling that by the time Lindsey Graham was able to make his historic presentation to the chamber and the world, it was over. Everybody expected Kavanaugh to roll over and play dead, and he would have none of it. This was a brilliant performance by a jurist who is not known for anything other than quiet, non-tempestuous contemplation. He pulled out of the bag what I call righteous Catholic indignation. This was, in essence, a burning at the stake. What they were doing with Kavanaugh was burning him at the stake, and he would have none of it. Democrat senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee are  despicable,   unethical  and  fundamentally dishonest,  said diGenova. When you look at that group of people on the Democratic side, they are a despicable, unethical bunch,  opined diGenova.  I am just so pleased that these hearings turned out the way they did because America got a look at what the Democratic Party has become. These are fundamentally dishonest people [and] power-hungry.  The Democratic Party is no longer a party. It is a gang of thugs.  It showed how desperate and how fundamentally dishonest the Democrats are,  said diGenova.Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/american-bar-association-kavanaugh-confirmation-should-be-delayed-until-after-fbi-investigation/","The American Bar Association has called on the Senate to delay Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation to the Supreme Court until after the FBI completes  an appropriate background check  regarding Christine Blasey Ford s sexual assault allegations. We make this request because of the ABA s respect for the rule of law and due process under law,  ABA President Robert Carlson wrote to Iowa Republican and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and California Democrat Dianne Feinstein. The basic principles that underscore the Senate s constitutional duty of advice and consent on federal judicial nominees require nothing less than a careful examination of the accusations and facts by the FBI,  Carlson said.  Each appointment to our nation s Highest Court (as with all others) is simply too important to rush to a vote. Previously, the ABA unanimously rated Kavanaugh as  well qualified  for a position in the Supreme Court.  For 12 years, everyone who has appeared before me on the D.C. Circuit has praised my judicial temperament,  Kavanaugh said in Thursday s hearing.  That s why I have the unanimous well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association. South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham also cited the ABA s confidence in Kavanaugh on Thursday.  If you lived a good life people will recognize it, like the American Bar Association has   the gold standard,  he said.  His integrity is absolutely unquestioned. Kavanaugh has asserted his feelings regarding the allegations and the delay of his confirmation in a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, calling the process  a national disgrace.  Republican Arizona Senator Jeff Flake   the likely swing vote in Kavanaugh s nomation   earlier announced today that he will vote to confirm but then said he wanted a limited FBI investigation of Ford s claims before a final vote.

Mazie Hirono (D-HI) said the FBI investigation into the sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh should also probe  what kind of parties  he went to in his youth.Hirono said,  I just found out just reasonable recently that the committee is asking for an investigation and that the White House is going to go along with it. I think that there now will be an effort to better define what kind of an investigation it should be. Even if I know that you reported that it is up to the FBI, but the FBI does have some parameters that I think we can describe. And I would like to make sure that at least the three credible reports are investigated.  She added,  And we also need to know, what kind of parties did he go to? And clearly Mark Judge needs to be questioned very carefully because I think that he very much skated over all of the allegations of the kind of drinking he did, almost to the point of passing out, as some people who are very close to Judge Kavanaugh have testified during both his high school, as well as his college years. She added,  As far as I m concerned, the FBI investigation has to be very thorough, complete. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

A thorough FBI investigation is critical to developing all the relevant facts,  attorney Debra Katz said in a statement released Friday evening.  Dr. Christine Blasey Ford welcomes this step in the process, and appreciates the efforts of Senators Flake, Murkowski, Manchin and Collins   and all other senators who have supported an FBI investigation   to ensure it is completed before the Senate votes on Judge Kavanaugh s nomination. No artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on this investigation. NEW Stmt from Dr Ford s Attorney:  A thorough FBI investigation is critical to developing all the relevant facts.

Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) September 28, 2018The request came after Senate Republicans met to discuss an 11th-hour request presented by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who recommended the full Senate vote to confirm Kavanaugh be pushed back in order for a seven-day FBI probe to take place. I think it would be proper to delay the floor vote for up to but not more than one week in order to let the FBI do an investigation, limited in time and scope to the current allegations that are there, limited in time to no more than one week,  the Arizona lawmaker said prior the committee vote.  And I will vote to advance the bill to the floor with that understanding.  Shortly before 2:00 p.m., the committee voted 11-10 to recommend the judge be the next Supreme Court Justice.Hours later, the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced President Donald Trump ordered the bureau to investigate the matter.  I ve ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh s file,  the president s statement read.  As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week. Prior to releasing the president s statement, Kavanaugh, through White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah, communicated his readiness to cooperate with the investigation.   Throughout this process, I ve been interviewed by the FBI, I ve done a number of background  calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me,  the Court pick said.  I ve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate.

Instead, they waited until the last minute to leak them in order to delay the vote.That is why any FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh should include potential coordination between the Democrat operatives and lawyers that assisted in bringing them forth.What Senate Democrats really want is more time to smear Judge Kavanaugh, regardless of the toll it takes on his wife, his daughters, and our country.Democrats will not suddenly require evidence to declare Judge Kavanaugh guilty of being the worst kind of criminal. They will not suddenly abandon their assumption that all accusations against Republicans are credible and to be believed.If the FBI turns up nothing significant, they will say what Joe Biden said in 1991, that the FBI does not reach conclusions. They will say the FBI did not have enough time to conduct a thorough investigation.What they will not do is admit they were wrong to accuse Judge Kavanaugh of being a gang rapist, or a rapist, or a sexual assaulter, or a drunk, or a perjurer, or a hothead unfit for the bench.If the delay facilitates new allegations from Michael Avenatti or someone else, it will not matter how ludicrous they are. Democrats will instantly call them credible, demand more delays, more FBI resources, and more hearings. They will attack anyone who disagrees.Delay, delay, delay. That s all they want, because their goal is to do anything and everything to smear any nominee   anyone   and block Republicans from appointing another justice to the Supreme Court.We cannot and should not let that happen.Dr. Bill Cassidy, MD, a Republican, is the senior senator from Louisiana.

I ve ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh s file,  Trump said in a statement released by the White House.  As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week. A group of Senate Republicans led by Sen. Jeff Flake urged Senate Majority Mitch McConnell to delay the Senate confirmation vote, citing his hope for more civility to the process.Flake took a last-minute stand after conferring with Senate Democrats on Friday afternoon, publicly stating his wishes for the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh for recent accusations of sexual misconduct.Kavanaugh signaled his willingness to cooperate with the investigation, despite repeated delays. Throughout this process, I ve been interviewed by the FBI, I ve done a number of background  calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me,  he said in a statement released by the White House.  I ve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate. Trump has shown surprising deference to Senate Republicans who continue to concede to the efforts by Democratic senators to delay the vote. Earlier Friday, he said he was willing to let the Senate continue the process, despite rumors of another delay. I m going to let the Senate handle that,  he told reporters at the White House.  They ll make their decisions, and they ve been doing a good job, and very professional.

Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) this weekend.  And if you think I am bluffing, you have not been paying attention the last 7 months,  he added.

I cannot imagine what you and your family have gone through,  Graham said to Kavanaugh, then turning to Democrats, saying,  Boy y all want power  I hope you never get it.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/senate-judiciary-committee-recommends-kavanaugh-confirmation-flake-calls-week-delay/","The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-10 Friday to recommend Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be the next associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, with Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) making a last-minute stand that the final full-Senate vote be delayed for not more than one week.Flake agreed to join with fellow Republicans Friday morning, only to retreat to the committee anteroom for nearly an hour to conference with Democrats before the vote. When he emerged for the vote, chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) allowed Flake to speak. Flake then announced he would vote yes on Kavanaugh for committee recommendation but with the stipulation that he would support another delay before the Senate floor vote that otherwise could have taken place as soon as Monday.Flake was unequivocal that the delay, to allow additional investigation by the FBI, be limited to no longer than one week, meaning a final vote by next Friday. He also insisted the investigation be  limited in scope. The Justice Department has repeatedly characterized the FBI s role as limited to investigating potential federal crimes, of which there are none in this case, and conducting background investigations to collect information on nominees, which has already been done, including with regard to Christine Blasey Ford s allegations. The exact perimeters of a new investigation were not clear from Flake s comments.After a brief walk-out, Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Mazie Hirono (D-HI) reneged and voted against Kavanaugh with the rest of their Party.The vote brings to close what could be the penultimate chapter in a chaotic, bitter, and polarizing confirmation process. After more than 30 hours of public testimony, hours more of closed-door hearings, and an excess of 1,200 written questions, Democrat senators and left-leaning news outlets made a national scandal out of a sexual misconduct allegation that ranking member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) kept to herself for nearly two months.Ford s allegation, that a 17-year-old Kavanaugh groped her at a high school party more than 35 years ago, begat a series of additional allegations of increasing severity, culminating in a sworn affidavit by Michael Avenatti s client, Julie Swetnick, that Kavanaugh helped arrange drug-induced gang rapes in the Washington, DC, area for years.In one of the most closely watched Senate committee hearings in recent years, both Ford and Kavanaugh addressed the alleged incident in hours of testimony under oath, Ford adamantly standing by her allegation and Kavanaugh indignantly and categorically denying any such incident.The chaos that has characterized Kavanaugh s entire confirmation process returned briefly after the Judiciary Committee voted, with Democrats seizing on Flake s speech to reiterate their call for additional investigation and Grassley abruptly adjourning the meeting after they had spoken their peace.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/stuttering-nancy-pelosi-calls-for-lower-tax-before-catching-herself/","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) accidentally called for  lower tax  before catching her misstatement by looking at her script. The slip occurred during her weekly Friday press conference in Washington, DC.Pelosi said,  We have an agenda for the people: Lower tax   lower healthcare costs by reducing the cost of prescription drugs, bigger paychecks by building the infrastructure of America, and cleaner government by reducing the role of dark special interest money in politics. WATCH: Pelosi further mispronounced  done deal  by enunciating  dundee. WATCH:Despite referring to Judge Brett Kavanaugh as an  assaulter,  Pelosi claimed to support due process: Do they not have daughters? Do they not have wives? Do they not have sisters? Do they not have mothers? It s a strange group, that when someone comes forward, they mock the allegation and praise the assaulter.
I believe in due process. Somebody makes a charge against you, there should be due process. That s all people are asking for. Let s find the truth. We have to come down on the side of respect for the allegations that are made. Pelosi described Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee as disrespecting women who were sexually assaulted:  The Republican men of the Senate have sent an unmistakable message to women and girls everywhere: If you come forward, you will not be respected and you will not be listened to. She also described Senate Republicans  selection of a female prosecutor to question Ford as  patriarchal :Republicans using a woman prosecutor was an act of complete cowardice on their part. It was an act of patrimony, patriarchal. They can determine who asks the questions. They don t honor their own responsibilities and they re afraid of the truth, and they re afraid of the dignity of Dr. Ford.None of the journalists in attendance asked Pelosi about her overall health.Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.

Jon Tester (D-MT) stood with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) over Montanans to oppose Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.Sen. Tester announced on Friday that he will oppose Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, citing Kavanaugh s alleged beliefs on privacy, campaign finance, andthe allegations of sexually assault against him.Rosendale charged in a statement on Friday that Montanans should not be surprised by this announcement; he said that Tester has frequently sided with Senate Minority Leader Schumer over Montanans.Rosendale said:No one should be surprised by this. We always knew Jon Tester was never going to vote for Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Time and time again, Tester stands with Chuck Schumer and Washington Democrats over the people of Montana. Tester has opposed both of President Trump s Supreme Court nominees and supported all of President Obama s Supreme Court nominees, including Sonia Sotomayor who said, The right to possess a gun is clearly not a fundamental right.  We can t trust Jon Tester on the Second Amendment. If you support President Trump and want to protect our Second Amendment Rights then the choice is clear this November,  Rosendale added.Instead of trying to honestly evaluate Kavanaugh based on his merits, Rosendale said that the Senate Democrats have tried to destroy the nominee s reputation and charged that the Senate should vote to confirm Kavanaugh right away.Rosendale said on Thursday,  This 11th-hour political circus to destroy a good man s reputation and hurt his family is disgraceful. The Senate should immediately vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The Montana Senate race has become increasingly competitive. A new poll released last week found that Tester and Rosendale are in a virtual tie at 44 percent each. Given that a majority of Montanans approve of Trump and that the president won the state by 20 points in the 2016 presidential election, Tester faces increasing pressure to vote for Kavanaugh rothe Supreme Court.Given the increasingly competitive race, Rosendale told Breitbart News last week that Tester is not the same populist he once claimed to be. Montanans are ready for a change, and that s exactly what these numbers are showing. Folks are seeing that Jon Tester is not the same man he once was,  Rosendale said.  Case in point, he s the #1 recipient of lobbyist cash out of all 535 members of Congress.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/09/28/wsj-editorial-board-the-left-has-killed-the-presumption-of-innocence/","The Wall Street Journal editorial board published a column last week that argued that liberals are no longer interested in the presumption of innocence.The column opens with two quotes, one from Sen. Maize Hirono (D-HI), and Anita Hill, who was once the subject of a similar Congressional hearing during the Clarence Thomas nomination. As Judge Kavanaugh stands to gain the lifetime privilege of serving on the country s highest court, he has the burden of persuasion. And that is only fair,  Hill said earlier in September.As Ms. Hill and Sen. Hirono aver, the Democratic standard for sexual-assault allegations is that they should be accepted as true merely for having been made. The accuser is assumed to be telling the truth because the accuser is a woman. The burden is on Mr. Kavanaugh to prove his innocence. If he cannot do so, then he is unfit to serve on the Court.This turns American justice and due process upside down. The core tenet of Anglo-American law is that the burden of proof always rests with the person making the accusation. An accuser can t doom someone s freedom or career merely by making a charge.

During the panel discussion on the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh, Behar said,  The people on the Republican side, it looks like to me, do not want to investigate this any further. They just want to hold onto their power. They know that this country is getting darker. White Europeans are now 61% of the population. She continued,  61% are white caucasians, in 2045 it will be 49% so it s going down. It s almost like they re worried that old white people are going to lose all their power. So they don t care if she s lying or not lying or he s lying. They just want to hold onto their power. Pretty soon we ll be like South Africa, Apartheid, where 10% of the white people were running the country. It seems like the trajectory we re on here. Whoopi Goldberg said,  That may be the trajectory we re on but that s not what we re going. Behar added,  This is what they want, I m saying. These people are only interested in retaining white power in this country. It s so obvious that they need to have the FBI investigation. It s so obvious to everyone.

And I think yesterday with the lack of temperament and lack of dignity in his presentation, that Judge Kavanaugh was doing an imitation of President Trump. She continued,  I think there s criticism in terms of the attitude that they did have. I mean we did see some outbursts on their part and they shall we say lack of respect, I m trying to be as respectful of them as possible, it s hard.

The businessman said Sen. Donnelly s  liberal colleagues used uncorroborated allegations to create a media circus designed to smear and destroy Judge Kavanaugh s reputation. Braun charged,  Donnelly s decision to oppose President Trump s highly qualified nominee is a grave mistake, but proves he is more concerned with standing with his liberal Democrat leaders than standing for Hoosiers.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/28/feinstein-kavanaugh-was-aggressive-and-belligerent/","During a speech before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday, Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) stated that Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh  was not someone who reflected an impartial temperament, or the fairness and even-handedness one would see in a judge. This was someone who was aggressive and belligerent. Feinstein said,  Candidly, in the 25 years on this committee, I have never seen a nominee for any position behave in that manner. Judge Kavanaugh used as much political rhetoric as my Republican colleagues, and what s more, he went on the attack. After quoting some of Kavanaugh s statements from the day before, Feinstein stated,  This was not someone who reflected an impartial temperament, or the fairness and even-handedness one would see in a judge. This was someone who was aggressive and belligerent. I have never seen someone who wants to be elevated to the highest court in our country behave in that manner.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/wall-street-journal-editorial-board-confirm-brett-kavanaugh/","After all the smoke had cleared Thursday, the Wall Street Journal s editorial board called for Brett Kavanaugh to be confirmed.The board criticized Sen. Dianne Feinstein s decision to keep Christine Blasey Ford s allegation private  for six weeks,  only to make a public spectacle that turned the hearing into a  circus. Like Kavanaugh himself, the board did not reject that emotion or pain displayed by Ford, Rather, they noted that not a shred of evidence was put forth to tie Kavanaugh to Ford s claims.The board wrote:  Yet there is still no confirming evidence beyond her own testimony, and some of what she says has been contradicted. The female friend Ms. Ford says was at the home the night of the assault says she wasn t there. The number of people she says were there has varied from four to five and perhaps more, but every potential witness she has cited by name says he or she doesn t recall the party. They added:She still can t recall the home where the assault took place, how she got there or how she got home that evening. She has no witnesses who say she told them about the alleged assault at the time until she first spoke of it at a couples therapy session 30 years later in 2012. Mr. Kavanaugh s name doesn t appear in the notes of her therapist.The board then transited to Kavanaugh s defense of himself and noted that he was righteously indignant because he had been publicly accused, and pre-judged in some quarters, for something he adamantly denied doing. They noted,  As for Judge Kavanaugh, his self-defense was as powerful and emotional as the moment demanded. If he was angry at times, imagine how you would feel if you were so accused and were innocent as he says he is. The Wall Street Journal headline says simply,  Confirm Brett Kavanaugh.

The letter was witnessed and sent by his attorney:As I stated in my attorney, Barbara Van Gelder s September 18, 2018 letter, I did not ask to be involved in this matter nor did anyone ask me to be involved. We have told the committee that I do not want to comment about these events publicly. As a recovering alcoholic and a cancer survivor, I have struggled with depression and anxiety. As a result, I avoid public speaking.Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school, but we have not spoken directly in several years. I do not recall the events described by Dr. Ford in her testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee today. I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes.I am knowingly submitting this letter under penalty of felony.Judge was the subject of several Democrats  questions to Kavanaugh because of Judge s alcoholic-fueled lifestyle as a young man, which he chronicled in a fictional account published in the late 1990s, entitled Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk.Many Democrats called for Judge to come before the committee under oath to discuss Ford s allegations against Kavanaugh. Judge has already submitted a letter to the committee denying he witnessed Kavanaugh sexually assaulting Ford.The committee is scheduled to vote Kavanaugh out of committee today ahead of a full Senate vote.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/jesuit-magazine-withdraws-endorsement-for-judge-kavanaugh/","The Editors of America Magazine have withdrawn their endorsement of Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that even if he is innocent  this nomination is no longer in the best interests of the country.  While we previously endorsed the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh on the basis of his legal credentials and his reputation as a committed textualist,  the editors of the Jesuit weekly state in their editorial Thursday,  it is now clear that the nomination should be withdrawn. The issue has moved beyond Kavanaugh innocence or guilt, America contends, to the symbolic value of the case. In addition to being a fight over policy issues, which it already was, his nomination has also become a referendum on how to address allegations of sexual assault,  they declare.The message from the Jesuit editors would seem to be: if any group or individual opposes a candidate for any public office and brings accusations located sufficiently far in the past as to be impossible to adjudicate, the ensuing cloud of uncertainty is sufficient to disqualify that candidate.The inevitable result of this line of reasoning is to push discussion away from candidates  demonstrable credentials and to encourage attempts to discredit him or her through unverifiable accusations, presumably of a sexual nature.The editors argue that ideally Senate confirmation hearings might focus on evaluating a nominee s judicial character or qualifications as a legal thinker.  But that time is long past. Ideology has so suffused the political process that realism dictates playing by the same rules.  Neither the country nor the court are well served by this arrangement, but refusing to recognize it does nothing to help reverse it,  the magazine states. What is different this time is that this nomination battle is no longer purely about predicting the likely outcome of Judge Kavanaugh s vote on the court,  the editors state.  It now involves the symbolic meaning of his nomination and confirmation in the #MeToo era. The merits of the Kavanaugh case must yield to its symbolic significance for larger social trends, the editors suggest, and his nomination is just a casualty in this battle. The hearings and the committee s deliberations are now also a bellwether of the way the country treats women when their reports of harassment, assault and abuse threaten to derail the careers of powerful men,  they state.The editors fail to address the compelling line of argumentation of Kavanaugh himself, who shows the other side of the coin.In his letter to the committee of the Judiciary, Kavanaugh claims that the accusations made against him  are smears, pure and simple. And they debase our public discourse.  But they are also a threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country,  he adds.  Such grotesque and obvious character assassination if allowed to succeed will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service. In their editorial, the Jesuits choose not to entertain this very probable fallout from the case, preferring to focus on Kavanaugh s inability to disprove the charges.Since Dr. Blasey s accusations have not been  conclusively disproved or shown to be less than credible,  it is time for  Kavanaugh s nomination to be withdrawn,  they state.Kavanaugh s failure to conclusively disprove his guilt, America claims, is sufficient grounds to retire his nomination. Here, the presumption of innocence does not hold.Which is, if nothing else, a sad commentary on the state of the Jesuits and their willingness to betray any principle for the sake of expedience.Follow Thomas D.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/09/28/late-night-hosts-rip-into-ahole-brett-kavanaugh-praise-christine-fords-testimony/","Late-night comedians ripped into President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday evening, while praising Dr. Christine Ford s testimony as she alleged sexual assault at the hands of Kavanaugh from over 30 years ago.On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah described the testimonies as  the only story anyone was talking about today,  before focusing in on a clip of Dr. Ford describing intricate parts of her brain. Oh snap! Oh! People were asking how the lady  can trust her brain, turns out she s a brain scientist,  Noah said.  Those senators were probably like, Oh yes, we re also familiar with the hippopotamus. We all know that  let s move on, let s move on. He went on to attack Kavanaugh for being angry and emotional. I don t know if he s got something going on in his life, but he seemed really angry,  Noah said.  Good lord, this guy such an asshole he looked like he was auditioning for a Snickers commercial. The Late Show, Stephen Colbert suggested it had been  the most divisive day in America since Laurel and Yanny, if Yanny was trying to get on the Supreme Court and Laurel had some really disturbing stories to tell about him.  [Christine Ford] went first, and her testimony was deeply moving,  Colbert continued.  Don t take my word for it, ask the liberal snowflakes over at Fox News. Over on Live!, Jimmy Kimmel said the hearings made for emotional television, while also praising Ford s helpful demeanor. People were crying in front of their televisions so hard you d have thought Milo Ventimiglia got killed by a crock pot,  he joked.  She was everything the Democrats hoped she would be. She was polite, likable and well-spoken. Maybe more than anything, it was striking to see someone questioned before the Senate who actually answered questions. I think that s a first. Seth Meyers of Late Night also weighed in on Ford s description of how the brain works. She s in the middle of testifying in the intense glare of the national spotlight about an alleged sexual assault committed by a Supreme Court nominee and she just taught everyone how the brain works,  he quipped.  She gave a detailed anatomy of the hippocampus and the memory centers in the brain to a room of guys who look like they eat brains. Meyers also took issue with how Kavanaugh described the testimony as a  political hit.  Holy shit, I m surprised he didn t start attacking George Washington. If he s so honest, why does he wear a wig?   Meyers joked.  Republicans always act like they re in a slasher film and the killer around the corner is Hillary Clinton. The Tonight Shows Jimmy Fallon suggested that Trump realized  it wasn t going well  while watching the testimony aboard Air Force One. Trump watched the hearing while flying on Air Force One,  he said.  You could tell it wasn t going well because halfway through Trump tried to walk outside to get some air.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/patrick-morrisey-joe-manchin-complicit-in-senate-democrats-disgraceful-treatment-of-brett-kavanaugh/","West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said in a statement on Friday that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) is complicit in the Senate Democrats   disgraceful treatment  of Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.Morrisey slammed Senate Democrats  tactics to disrupt and defame Judge Kavanaugh during the Supreme Court nomination process. The West Virginia Republican contended that the Democratic senator was complicit in Senate Judiciary ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer s (D-NY) strategy to prevent Kavanaugh from joining the nation s highest court. Regardless of how he votes, Joe Manchin has proven to be complicit in Senate Democrats  disgraceful treatment of President Trump s Supreme Court pick,  said Morrisey.  The voters of West Virginia can fully expect the resist and obstruct circus to be unleashed if Joe Manchin, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and Maxine Waters take control of Congress. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) slammed Feinstein in a fiery speech on Thursday that the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh amount to  the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics. Kavanaugh, in his opening statement on Thursday, lambasted Senate Democrats for turning the Supreme Court nomination process into a political witchhunt. Kavanaugh said,  This confirmation process has become a national disgrace  You have replaced advice and consent  with search and destroy.  Sen. Manchin faces immense pressure to confirm Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. A September poll found that 51 percent of West Virginians, 50 percent of West Virginia independents, and 45 percent of West Virginia want Kavanaugh confirmed for the Supreme Court.A survey released on Thursday found that Manchin and Morrisey are now tied for the West Virginia Senate race.In contrast to Manchin, Morrisey led a 26-state coalition of Attorneys General urging the confirmation of Kavanaugh.Morrisey contended that Sen. Manchin has followed Schumer s orders on Judge Kavanaugh since the beginning of the confirmation process. Twenty-three minutes after President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, Schumer said he will oppose Kavanaugh s nomination  with everything I have  because the  stakes are simply too high. Immediately after Manchin left his meeting with Kavanaugh, the West Virginia Democrat went straight to Schumer s office.Schumer suggested that vulnerable Senate Democrats hold off on their decision whether to support Donnelly as long as possible.Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) said,  All Chuck ever says in caucus [meetings], it s pretty well known: Keep your powder dry. Don t commit. Stay as neutral as you can, as long as you can. Morrisey contended that Manchin holding his vote until the last-minute has given Schumer room to maneuver, and hopefully, tank the nominee.Morrisey charged,  The bottom line, Manchin should be ashamed for giving Schumer and Senate Democrats the room to maneuver  to ultimately try to destroy President Trump s Supreme Court nominee.

Joe Manchin (D-WV) is under pressure now that Brett Kavanaugh has spoken in his own defense, leaving the Senator with the choice of voting for a SCOTUS nominee who will defend West Virginian s gun rights or ignoring West Virginians to stand with California liberals.Making the pressure even greater is the fact that President Trump will be holding a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia on Saturday. West Virginians voted for pro-gun Trump over anti-gun Hillary Clinton by a percentage of roughly 70 to 30, which means the residents of the state have already chosen protection of the Second Amendment over liberalism.Moreover, Manchin is in a tough race. His pro-gun opponent, Patrick Morrisey, is tied with him in polls and Morrisey has not been shy about pointing out the fact that Manchin has been rejected by the NRA.Manchin s NRA rating is a D.Manchin came into office via a 2010 special election. He campaigned as defender of West Virginia gun rights only to become one of the Democrats  staunchest gun control proponents in late 2012. Following the December 14, 2012, attack on Sandy Hook Elementary, Manchin had garnered enough favor with Barack Obama that PBS reported he was chosen as gun control point man for Obama s White House.Although the Sandy Hook attack was carried out with stolen firearms, Manchin s response was more background checks for retail sales. Making matters worse, Manchin admitted his gun controls would not have prevented Sandy Hook from occurring in the first place, yet he was willing to spend all his political capital to secure it.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

However, Turley said Kavanaugh came out strong and attacked Democrats for mishandling the confirmation process, which he said  changed that dynamic.  [I]nstead of attacking [Ford], he attacked the Democrats,  said Turley.  That was very effective for the right group of people. It s not going to change the mind of people who believe Dr. Ford, but I think it did spark the base and they re going to have their voices heard this morning.

There were just two human beings in pain. He blasts the  cynical games  that have damaged Ford, Kavanaugh, and their families irreparably. He says this is no country for creepy old men, or young men, or middle-aged men. But he also says he doesn t want to live in a country without due process where the accuser and accused are not entitled to respect, fairness, and due process. He says the people who betrayed Ford s trust and did not tell her she could testify in California should bow their heads in shame and hide their heads in bags for the rest of their lives. He also quotes Matthew 16:26 to close his remarks:  For what is a person profited if he gains the whole world and he loses his soul? 12:48 PM: Drama Queen Booker now dramatically announces that he is going to leave the hearing because he cannot participate in something that history will not judge favorably.

Booker, who has written about groping a woman in high school, says the process has been a  sham.  He proudly talks about how he  willfully  and  knowingly  violated the rules re:  releasing documents  (publicity stunt). Booker  resents  that Republicans accused Ford of  partisanship.  He says it shifted the debate from  raw partisanship  to  something deeper.  Booker praises Grassley for being genuinely concerned about Ford s humanity behind closed doors even when the klieg lights were off.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/09/28/cnn-chris-cuomo-brett-kavanaugh-virgin-yale/","CNN s Chris Cuomo asked a female classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh if he was  known at Yale as a virgin  in a Thursday evening interview.The far-left anchor for the cable news channel asked this embarrassing question of Lynne Brookes, who attended Yale with Kavanaugh. I don t believe it s disqualifying to have partied in high school or in college,  Cuomo said.  But him telling the truth about himself is a more relevant standard. Was Brett Kavanaugh known at Yale as a virgin?  What pic.twitter.com/XwGbhkDW2W  Jimmy (@JimmyPrinceton) September 28, 2018Brookes, who was obviously caught off guard by the inappropriate and personal question, could only respond:  I have no idea. Then, as if to make her even more uncomfortable, Cuomo let her hang for a beat before he managed to stammer out,  I just want to know because that s something he points out about himself that I know, having gone to the same school. Cuomo then questioned the honesty of Brookes by telling her,  It s not so big a school, It s got a big name. But it s not that big a community. It s pretty small. It s the kind of thing that would have been known. Apparently, Cuomo knows just how sexually active every single one of his classmates was. Thousands of students attend Yale. Who could or would put in the effort to know such a thing?Newsbusters reports that later in the show, the deeply partisan Cuomo  raged  against Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) for defending Kavanaugh at Thursday s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. What the hell is he so angry about? What is going on with Lindsey Graham?  Cuomo asked rhetorically, before shaming Graham for not appearing on his basement-rated show.  I keep inviting him on the show to make the case. Cuomo then instructed Graham about who he is supposed to be angry with, and it was not the Senate Democrats who created this fiasco. He should be angry at the people to his left and right from his own party,  Cuomo demanded.  If you want to get red in the face, it should be with shame that you should own, Senator, and the people in your party who put it to this point.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/report-prosecutor-rachel-mitchell-would-not-charge-kavanaugh-or-even-pursue-a-search-warrant/","Arizona sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell told Republican senators in a conference meeting Thursday evening that she would not charge Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after hearing testimonies of the Judge or his accuser Christine Blasey Ford.Mitchell, who took a leave of absence from Maricopa County s Deputy County Attorney and division chief the County Attorney s Office s Special Victims Division to join the Senate Judiciary Committee s team of attorneys for the hearing,  broke down her analysis  of both testimonies to GOP lawmakers. In a nearly 30-minute presentation, Mitchell went over the  facts that were established and not established  and concluded that not only would she not charge Kavanaugh based on the record of evidence from both parties, but would not even pursue a search warrant for the judge, which in virtually all cases would require the standard of probable cause to be met, Politico reported.Brooke Singman of Fox News quoted one source as saying  Mitchell was very clear with senators that based on evidence presented, she couldn t bring the case anywhere near a court room.  In a day like few others in Senate history, California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford quietly recounted her  100 percent  certainty Thursday that President Donald Trump s nominee for the Supreme Court had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers   and then Brett Kavanaugh defiantly testified he was  100 percent certain  he did no such thing.That left senators to decide whether the long day of testimony tipped their confirmation votes for or against Trump s nominee in a deeply partisan fight with the future of the high court and possibly control of Congress in the balance.Showing their own certainty, Republicans quickly scheduled a recommendation vote for Friday morning in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where they hold an 11-10 majority. They are hoping for a final Senate roll call next week, seating Kavanaugh on the court shortly after the October start of its new term.In the committee s packed hearing room Thursday, for hours upon hours, both Kavanaugh and Ford said the alleged assault and the storm of controversy that has erupted 36 years later had altered their lives forever and for the worse.Ford recounted for the senators of the alleged assault in a locked room at a gathering of friends when she was just 15. The memory   and alleged  uproarious laughter  during the act   was  locked  in her brain, she said. Ford delivered her testimony with deliberate certitude, though admitting gaps in her memory as she choked back tears at some points and said she  believed he was going to rape me.  All of Ford s named witnesses, including high school close friend Leland Keyser, denied having any knowledge of the alleged incident. The 53-old professor says she does not know the date or location of the alleged incident.Hours later, Kavanaugh passionately denied her allegation, striking a defiant tone and choking up several times, particularly when discussing his family. He decried his confirmation opposition as a  national disgrace.  You have replaced advice and consent  with search and destroy,   he said, citing the Constitution s language defining senators  duties in confirming high officials.Kavanaugh, who has two daughters, said one of his girls said they should  pray for the woman  making the allegations against him, referring to Ford.  That s a lot of wisdom from a 10-year-old,  he said.  We mean no ill will. Following Kavanaugh s testimony, President Trump tweeted in support of the judge, making clear that he was standing shoulder to shoulder with his nominee.  His testimony was powerful, honest and riveting,  the president wrote.  The Senate must vote! The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/nolte-christine-blasey-ford-brought-no-evidence-but-plenty-of-contradictions/","Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempting to sexually assault her in 1982 when they were both teenagers, sounded credible to a lot of people. Even those who want to see Kavanaugh confirmed are writing and talking about how credible she sounded, how real and raw.At the risk of sounding callous   So what? Now that we live in this Orwellian world where if you do not express the CorrectThink, your humanity is suspect, maybe people are saying this because that is what we are supposed to say. Well, all I know is that I did not find her at all credible   and I am not going to say anything different.I certainly sympathized with Dr. Ford, and she did change my mind about one thing. I no longer believe she was part of a grand plan to destroy Kavanaugh. Rather, I do believe she wanted to remain anonymous, I do believe she is a victim of the Senate Democrats who re-victimized a woman who has already been damaged in some terrible way.But was she a credible witness, believable?Not even close.Even what Dr. Ford remembers doesn t add up.According to Dr. Ford: She attended a house party miles from her home. She had one beer. There were four or five other people at the party, including her best friend, Leland Ingham Keyser. Brett (Kavanaugh) and Mark (Judge) were already drunk and belligerent. She went upstairs to use the bathroom. Suddenly she was attacked from behind and shoved into a bedroom. Brett and Mark turned the music up so no one would hear her scream as they attempted to rape her. She got away. Locked herself in a bathroom. She waited until it was safe; until she heard Brett and Mark  ping pong  off the walls down the stairs. After it was safe, she ran down the stairs and left the house. She cannot remember who drove her to the party or how she got home.The only way her story adds up is if you are trying to weave the stuff of Kafka, where the accused cannot grab hold of something to clear himself, not even with an alibi because there is no where or when. In this respect, it is all a tad too neat.As harrowing as her story is, upon close examination, nothing about it makes any sense.Then we come to the most damaging elements, the facts and contradictions that actually do undermine Dr. Ford s credibility:And soHow Christine Blasey Ford can sound credible to anyone interested in facts, consistency, corroboration, witness testimony, fairness, due process, the Constitution, or evidence is beyond my comprehension. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Claire McCaskill (D-MO) decided last week that she will vote against Kavanaugh, suggesting that Kavanaugh s alleged beliefs on campaign finance reform disqualifies him from the Supreme Court. The Missouri Democrat admitted that Ford s sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh was  troubling,  although it did not play a factor in her decision.Nelson, McCaskill, and Jones  early decision on Kavanaugh drives a stark contrast against other red-state Senate Democrats such as Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), and Jon Tester (D-MT), who could all end up voting in favor of Kavanaugh s nomination. These Senate Democrats face competitive races against their Republican challengers, and they hope to get re-elected in states that President Donald J. Trump won handily.Nelson s vote planned vote against Kavanaugh might backfire as reports from Thursday night suggested that Sens. Donnelly, Manchin, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Susan Collins (R-ME) all plans to vote the same way, giving Kavanaugh a potential bipartisan majority to confirm him, and would alienate red-state voters against the Florida Democrat.Donnelly, Manchin, Murkowski and Collins are all expected to vote the same way, per senators and aides  Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 28, 2018

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/blue-state-blues-the-democrats-absurd-fbi-obsession/","Democrats tried to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaugh s credibility on Thursday, and block his confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court, by questioning why he would not join them in demanding that the Federal Bureau or Investigation (FBI) conduct a supposedly  nonpartisan  and  independent  inquiry into Christine Blasey Ford s recent claim that he groped her in high school, over 35 years ago.It was the one effective point of attack   and the one question on which Kavanaugh looked somewhat weak. He said in his stirring opening statement   which will enter the history books as one of the great moments in American oratory   that he welcomed an FBI investigation.Yet Democrats ignored that and pressed forward as if he had never said that. The execrable Sen Dick Durbin (D-IL) demanded, finger wagging and all, that Kavanaugh tell White House Counsel Don McGahn to stop the confirmation process   as if the president controls the Senate, and the judge controls the president   until the FBI could investigate.Kavanaugh was repeatedly forced to defend the Senate Judiciary Committee s decision as if it were his own. It fell to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to point out, in his equally memorable speech, that committee Democrats could have approached Republicans to demand an FBI investigation when they first learned about Dr. Ford s claims in July, but instead chose to hold them in reserve and leak them later, damaging both the accuser and the accused.Still, why not now? Kavanaugh tried to explain that the FBI would not, and could not, tell the committee more than it already knew. He noted that every possible witness had already submitted statements under oath, all contradicting Dr. Ford s claims; that the FBI does not reach conclusions or make recommendations when it investigates judicial nominees; and that the ten days  delay between his request for a hearing to clear his name   a delay partly caused, he might have added, by Dr. Ford s lawyers misleading the committee about her fear of flying   had been worse than hell for him and his family.Committee chair Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) also quoted then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE)   twice   telling the committee during the Clarence Thomas hearings in 1991 that the FBI s assessment was worthless as a determination of the facts and that it was up to the committee to arrive at its own conclusions.Yet Dr. Ford s refusal to join Democrats in calling for another investigation made it look, at least to those inclined to disbelieve him, as though he had something to hide. And he did   though it was nothing to be ashamed of: Kavanaugh was  hiding  the fact that he wants the job.He also knows full well that every hour of delay reduces his chances of success, because the Michael Avenattis of the world have instant access to cable news studios; because if Democrats can push a vote off until after the midterm elections, they may delay it indefinitely; and because the moderate Republicans in whose hands his fate rests are generally too cowardly to stand up to sustained pressure.Perhaps Kavanaugh also suspects that no investigation will be enough for Democrats who think fart jokes in high school yearbooks are relevant to determining his credibility. (They did not ask Dr. Ford about her yearbooks.)But there is something even more absurd about involving the FBI at this stage of the confirmation process, and it was not mentioned by anyone in the hearing room on Thursday. Namely: the idea that the FBI could be considered  non-partisan  or  independent  is a joke after all we have learned about its role in the 2016 presidential election.Yes, some of the bad apples are gone. But it is far too soon for Americans to feel comfortable about the agency s integrity. Any conclusion   even one that supported Kavanaugh   would instantly be seen as a result of partisan bias. That is why FBI Director Christopher Wray has wisely sought to keep his agency out of this particular fight.Moreover, while the FBI does provide information on judicial candidates to the White House and Senate, asking it to intervene at this late stage is the same as asking it to determine the outcome. That violates the separation of powers by outsourcing the Senate s constitutional responsibility to the executive branch and law enforcement.More than two years ago, the FBI threw an election, and the country, into turmoil. After all we have been through, the fact that Democrats still want the FBI to make major political decisions is beyond absurd. It is frightening.Joel B.

Bush stands by his support of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh following his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Freddy Ford, Chief of Staff to former President George W. Bush, told Politico Thursday evening. Yes, he does,  Ford told the news outlet when asked if the former president still believes Kavanaugh should ascend to the United States  highest court.In a statement to Politico last Tuesday, Bush affirmed he and the former first lady Laura Bush support the Trump court pick in the wake of a decades-old sexual misconduct allegation brought forth by California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford.  Laura and I have known and respected Brett Kavanaugh for decades, and we stand by our comments the night Judge Kavanaugh was nominated,  the statement read.One unnamed Bush-era official with a personal relationship with Kavanaugh said that while they found the committee s treatment of the Judge was  unfair,  it was wrong to believe Republicans are sure to bail on the nominee.  I don t think the process was unfair, but I think the rush to he is toast  narrative that was dominating even before he even had a chance to testify was unfair,  the ex-Bush White House aide said.  It is, like, unless she came across as an insane person, he was going to be toast.  Asked if he still supported Kavanaugh after Thursday morning, he said,  Hell yes! As detailed in his testimony, Kavanaugh was an associate counsel and a staff secretary for then-President Bush. In 2006, Kavanaugh s former boss nominated him to serve as judge on U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.Former President Bush has also reportedly been calling Republican senators whipping votes for Kavanaugh s confirmation, a huge boon for the embattled judge s chances. The key votesare not easily swayed by the president. At least some of these members have received calls from former president George W. Bush in recent days, aides say.

All in the name of a blood sport called partisan politics, played by the most dishonest vipers ever found under the earth.The only bright speck in the whole circus of Judge Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation hearings has been the honorable behavior of Republicans on the SenateJudiciary Committee. Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, bent over backward to accommodate a woman who came forward with alarming accusations against Judge Kavanaugh.She was given a full, thorough and respectful hearing to level her serious accusations.Though her claims are strenuously disputed, entirely uncorroborated and riddled with inconsistencies and shifting versions, the woman deserved to make her case. Mr. Grassley made sure she was able to.She was not shouted down by protesters. She was not silenced. Nobody called her a murderer.We have come a long way since Paula Jones was called a liar and trailer-park trash by Bill Clinton s war dogs after she accused the then-governor of exposing himself to her and sexually harassing her. Those charges were corroborated, and Mrs. Jones was ultimately vindicated.But James Carville s disgusting treatment of her could never be erased.Mr. Grassley does not play those vile games. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about others.Over the past two weeks, sitting senators have publicly and enthusiastically denounced the single most fundamental tenet of fairness in America: the notion that an accused person is presumed innocent until proved guilty.Judge Kavanaugh was accused of a very serious crime. Instead of being allowed to rebut the charges and clear his name, the accusations were allowed to sit and fester like a dead body rotting inside an upstairs room of an un-air-conditioned house in the Southern heat.By the time the authorities arrived, the body was unrecognizable. Judge Kavanaugh had deformed into a monster.It is little wonder.As soon as Judge Kavanaugh was nominated, Democrats warned that women would suffer and millions would die if he was elevated to the Supreme Court.During his confirmation hearings, Sen. Cory Booker, New Jersey Democrat, set the tone of the ridiculous circus, excitedly declaring it his  I am Spartacus!  moment. No, sir, Mr. Booker. You are not Spartacus   except in that you will ultimately lose.You are Caligula.You wear your silly Roman toga, whipping up this bacchanalia of personal destruction. This orgy of leaks and lies and smears and innuendo. This debauched festival of political grandstanding, self-adulation and senatorial fornication.Say it now, Mr. Booker:  I am Caligula! Then came Judge Kavanaugh. He refused to back down from the bullies. He remained to defend himself, his sterling reputation, his strong wife, his wonderfully decent daughters and his family.He torched the committee, the entire Senate, the whole confirmation process with a ferocious in-your-face rebuke the likes of which sitting senators rarely endure.He absolutely filleted them all. The most touching moments of his testimony were about when he was a boy, trying to become a good man. Like his father. Who kept calendars. To remember things. But also to entertain the family with treasured memories.Democrats on the committee not only tried to destroy a man. They tried to destroy the boy he once was.When Judge Kavanaugh was finished, Democrats on the committee looked like scalded dogs. Staffers sat in back with stony faces.They were left with nothing but questions about how much Judge Kavanaugh likes to drink beer, what he wrote in his high school yearbook and flatulence.Caligula s quiver was empty. His sword bent.All that is left now are loud clanging noises as Caligula exits the arena, vanquished.<U+2981> Contact Charles Hurt at churt@washingtontimes.com or on Twitter @charleshurt.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/contentious-judiciary-committee-vote-looms-as-kavanaugh-survives-senates-ford-hearing/","Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump s second nominee to the United States Supreme Court, survived a contentious hearing on Thursday in which he defended against allegations of sexual impropriety leveled at him earlier in the day by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford from more than three decades ago.Now, in the wake of the hearing, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Friday morning on Kavanaugh s confirmationthe first in a series of three tests the federal appellate judge must pass before taking a seat among the other eight Justices on the U.S. Supreme Court.The committee has 21 members, 11 Republicans and ten Democrats. All ten Judiciary Committee Democrats are expected to oppose Kavanaugh s nomination. Ten of the Judiciary Committee Republicans are likely or confirmed yes votes for Kavanaugh, with just oneSen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ)uncertain at this point, even though Flake has signaled in the direction of being in favor of the nomination.During the contentious Thursday hearings, Flaketoward the very end of Kavanaugh s impassioned testimony, which came after Ford s earlier appearancemade brief comments suggesting he had not come down on the matter either way. When Dr. Ford came forward with her account, I immediately said that she should be heard and asked the chairman to delay the vote that we had scheduled,  Flake said during the hearing.  The chairman did, and I appreciate that. She came, at great difficulty for her, and offered compelling testimony. WATCH: SEN. FLAKE DURING SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARING:Flake continued, addressing Kavanaugh directly:You have come and done the same. I am sorry for what s happened to you and your family, as I am sorry for what has happened to hers. This is not a good process, but it s all we ve got. I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that in the end, we are 21 very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent and in the end there is likely to be as much doubt as certainty going out of this room today. As we make decisions going forward, I hope people will recognize that the rhetoric that we use and in the language that we use going forward that we will recognize that there is doubtwe ll never move beyond thatand that we just have a real humility on that front.Earlier in the hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) made his own passionate plea for senators not to fall for the traps being laid by Democrats. In part of it, Graham made a plea directly to his fellow Republicansand specifically to Flake.WATCH SEN. GRAHAM DURING SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARING: To my Republican colleagues, if you vote no,  Graham said while looking directly at Flake,  you are legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my entire time in politics. Graham was looking DIRECTLY at Flake when he said  my Republican colleagues    Flake s arms were folded at his chest, he was looking down.  Seung Min Kim (@seungminkim) September 27, 2018After the hearing concluded, Flake ended up meeting with other undecided senators in the fuller U.S. Senate, from both parties. He did not announce how he intends to vote, but he did meet with Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Joe Manchin (D-WV).HIGH DRAMA: Flake, Collins, Murkowski and Manchin  the senators who will determine whether Brett Kavanaugh gets a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court  are privately huddling NOW. @tedbarrettcnn  Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 27, 2018Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Jeff Flake and Joe Manchin are all meeting NOW before the GOP conference meeting, per @tedbarrettcnn  Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) September 27, 2018Flake reportedly remains split on how to vote ahead of Friday s committee vote:SEN. FLAKE remains extremely torn about how he ll vote on Judge Kavanaugh s nomination. He says he needs to review a lot before tomorrow morning, including sworn affidavits. Flake wishes GOP didn t rush through the process so senators could have more time to analyze.  Marianna Sotomayor (@MariannaNBCNews) September 28, 2018But Flake also said the question is where the burden of proof lieson the accused or the accuser. In America s judicial system, the burden is on the accuser and most certainly not the accusedmeaning Flake seems to be leaning toward a yes vote:Flake is torn:  They both did well and he offered a defense like you would expect from someone who felt that they were wrongly accused. and she offered compelling testimony as well. But I have to go with what is the standard here. Where is the burden. It s tough  @TheOtherKeppler  Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 28, 2018However, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), a Judiciary Committee Democrat, said on CNN during an interview with Chris Cuomo that  I do  believe Flake is still in play, and argued that Flake should oppose the judge s confirmation. But Coons also conceded that Manchin s vote, a key Democrat who could prove decisive in the confirmation process if he does decide to support Kavanaugh in the end, is also still in play, as Manchin keeps meeting with undecided GOP senators.Republicans, after the undecided senators concluded their meeting, headed into a caucus meeting with the entire GOP conference, where they then emerged and announced their plans to move forward with Friday s committee vote.Assuming Kavanaugh gets through the committee voteto which Flake s eventual support is criticalthen it would set up a timeline whereby procedural votes on the confirmation would occur over the weekend, and final confirmation would happen on the Senate floor next week.Senators emerging from meeting say plan is to vote Friday in committee and hold first procedural vote on floor on Kavanaugh nomination Saturday, teeing up confirmation vote next week. Important note: It s not assured they have 50 votes yet but GOP leaders prepared to roll dice  Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 28, 2018It was after the committee vote announcement on Thursday evening from Senate Republicans that fellow undecided Republican Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), who earlier was one of the senators who had called for what became Thursday s hearing, announced that Kavanaugh had won his vote in favor of his confirmation.I plan to vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh. My full statement: pic.twitter.com/LDj4epYyhc  Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) September 28, 2018Corker s statement, as the Washington Post s Sean Sullivan noted, is a major positive indicator for Kavanaugh:Positive indicator for Kavanaugh: Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) just announced his support. He had seemed to be moving this way as the week unfolded. Now the focus is squarely on Murkowski/Collins/Flake. pic.twitter.com/J79T17OLLm  Sean Sullivan (@WaPoSean) September 28, 2018Corker s statement that he will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court means that, assuming Flake votes yes in Friday s Judiciary Committee vote, Kavanaugh only needs one more yes vote to reach the threshold for final confirmation on the floor of the U.S. Senate next week.Corker s confirmed yes means there are currently 48 Republicans who intend to vote yes on Kavanaugh. If he clears the committee vote on Friday, that means Flake is a yes in committee, so he will be a yes on the floorthus Kavanaugh has 49 yes votes at that point.Either Collins or Murkowskior a red state Democrat like Manchin or Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Jon Tester (D-MT), Doug Jones (D-AL), or Bill Nelson (D-FL)could end it by announcing their vote to support Kavanaugh, providing him with the requisite bare minimum 50 votes in favor of confirmation. If only 50 senators vote yes, Vice President Mike Pence will be on standby to break the tie and the nomination would succeed 51-50 in a very tight vote.For Democrats to stop Kavanaugh on the floor at this point, they would need to hold at least two of the three remaining outstanding GOP votesFlake, Collins, and Murkowskiback and prevent every Democrat from voting for confirmation. On the floor, if the nomination gets there, it would already need to win Flake s support in committee, so it is extraordinarily unlikely he would back it in committee and oppose it on the floor. Therefore, the Democrats could not afford for either Collins or Murkowski to support Kavanaugh.It s also very unlikely that Democrats would be able to hold their own conference unified against Kavanaugh, given the fact that signs are already clearly emerging that Manchin is likely to vote for Kavanaugh s confirmation as he faces a tough re-election battle back home in West Virginia:Interesting: A source close to Senator Manchin tells me now,  Short of claims that definitively prove Dr. Ford s allegations or a realization that Kavanaugh will gut the healthcare law, Manchin will side with the overwhelming number of people in WV who want Kavanaugh confirmed.   Elaina Plott (@elainaplott) September 28, 2018Manchin s spokesman Jonathan Kott, however, said the senator remains undecided:Manchin spokesman Jonathan Kott:  He is one-hundred percent undecided and remains so.   Elaina Plott (@elainaplott) September 28, 2018Even so, it has been expected all along that Manchin would vote to confirm Kavanaugh. In fact, his GOP opponent, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, predicted in an interview with Breitbart News that Manchin would vote to confirm him. On Thursday, a new poll emerged showing Morrisey and Manchin tied at 45 percent apiece.Meanwhile, Murkowski has not signaled which way she is leaning yet but has said she is still considering everything: I m going to go home, have dinner and have a chance to think about all that s gone on today,  Murkowski said, per @jeremyherb  It was long, it was detailed, it was very important to get it on the record   Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 28, 2018But another report suggests that Donnelly, Manchin, Murkowski, and Collins will vote as a bloc:Donnelly, Manchin, Murkowski and Collins are all expected to vote the same way, per senators and aides  Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 28, 2018That means that, assuming the news that Manchin intends to vote yes is correct, Kavanaugh has the votes necessary for confirmation at this time. In other words, according to at least one report, they all intend to vote for Kavanaughmeaning if these reports are true, he has the votes necessary for confirmation:Sounds like they re all voting yes https://t.co/YI9dtJsCF9  Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) September 28, 2018Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, has signaled the Senate is moving forward:.@senatemajldr McConnell, per @FoxReports:  The committee is going to vote in the morning and we re going to move forward.  He did not answer when asked if Republicans had the votes. (They don t currently, but a lot can happen before Saturday.)  Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) September 28, 2018McConnell also said he will  proudly  vote for Kavanaugh s confirmation in a post-hearing statement:McConnell s stmt post-hearing:  I Will Proudly Vote to Confirm Judge Kavanaugh  No evidence corroborates Dr. Ford s allegation. No evidence was presented today to back it up. And all existing evidence refutes it,  he says.  Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) September 28, 2018MCCONNELL: FULL SENATE TO VOTE ON KAVANAUGH IN COMING DAYS  Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) September 28, 2018McConnell s third-in-command, Sen. John Thune (R-SD), expects that the vote will pass the committee:Sen. Thune, Senate GOP number 3, tells me he d be  surprised  if the Judiciary Committee didn t move forward on a Kavanaugh vote tomorrow  Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) September 27, 2018Assuming the vote does pass the committee, the battle is only going to get more fierce as it heads to the full U.S. Senate and all senators debate the nomination on the floor over the weekend into next week.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/sen-bob-corker-to-vote-yes-on-kavanaugh-nothing-corroborates-the-allegation/","Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) announced Thursday evening that he would vote to confirm President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, pointing to the lack of corroboration of Dr. Christine Ford s allegation of sexual assault. I believe those who come forward with allegations of sexual assault deserve to be heard,  he wrote in a statement.  That is why I was one of the first members of the Senate to call on the judiciary committee to delay the original vote on the nomination so that both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh could provide additional information.  I know it took courage for Dr. Ford to appear before the committee today,  he continued.  I also very strongly believe that Judge Kavanaugh, like all Americans, deserves the presumption of innocence and that it was equally as important for him to have the opportunity to address the charges and defend himself. Corker explained his decision by stating that Ford had failed to provide sufficient evidence for her allegation and that Kavanaugh remains extremely well qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. While both individuals provided compelling testimony, nothing that has been presented corroborates the allegation. There is no question that Kavanaugh is qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, and in a different political environment, he would be confirmed overwhelmingly.  I believe Judge Kavanaugh has conducted himself as well as anyone could expect throughout this process and plan to vote to confirm him,  he added.I plan to vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh.

Other undecided Republicans include Sens. Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, and Lisa Murkowski. Meanwhile, some Democrats reportedly remain in play, with the likes of Sens. Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp, and Joe Manchin so far refraining from making a decision on the matter.Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.

Boxer said,  Let me say, I think it was exhausting for everybody, and especially for women who have had this experience and for women who have had relationships with very angry men. And I think I ve listened to your commentary, I think you re right, all of a sudden we see a man transformed from a choir boy who up until now has said after hours in front of the committee he lived this very perfect life, all of a sudden his anger is triggered and what we saw today is someone who you could now see attacking a woman. It is very frightening. She added,  I think your guest, who was so good, and said temperament is so important for who you put on the court. He not only showed the personality transformation. What do I think it will happen? We all know it is a few Republicans that hold this decision on their shoulders. I don t know anyone who didn t think that Dr. Ford was credible. And when she said I am 100% sure who this was, I believe her. It s up to them. Do they believe her? And the last point I ll make is if you are undecided, there is only one independent investigation, a FBI background check and frankly anyone who doesn t support that doesn t want to get to the truth and that includes Judge Kavanaugh.

Dianne Feinstein at Thursday s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing addressing sexual misconduct allegations against him.Feinstein s question session with Kavanaugh was contentious from the outset, with Kavanaugh repeatedly explaining that he was ready to defend himself against his accusers  allegations the day each were made. Things reached a boiling point, however, when Feinstein began talking about the lack of more involvement from FBI agents in the confirmation process. We hear from the witness, but the FBI isn t interviewing them and isn t giving us any facts. So all we have,  Feinstein began, when in a highly unusual move for a Senate hearing, an indignant Kavanaugh interrupted Feinstein. You re interviewing me. You re doing it senator. I m sorry to interrupt, but you re doing it. There s no conclusions reached,  Kavanaugh said.FBI nominee background investigations, like Judiciary Committee staff investigations, do not reach conclusions about guilt or innocence. They simply collect evidence for senators to use in making their decisions.When Feinstein s questioning turned to the heart of the matter, things were no less tense. What you re saying, if I understand it, is that the allegations by Dr. Ford, Miss Ramirez, and Miss Swetnick are wrong,  Feinstein said to Kavanaugh, who in his more than half-hour opening statement denied all allegations of sexual misconduct levied against him, including detailed denials of the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, the only accuser present at Thursday s hearing.Julie Swetnick, the third of Kavanaugh s accusers and client of  Resistance  lawyer Michael Avenatti, made the most aggregious allegations against him. Through Avenatti, she claimed Kavanaugh, three years her junior, was part of a gang of prep school boys who routinely drugged and then gang raped young girls in the Washington, DC, area for years in the 1980s. That is emphatically what I m saying. Emphatically,  Kavanaugh said in response to Feinstein.  The Swetnick thing is a joke, that is a farce!  Would you like to say more about it?  Feinstein asked.A sharp  No.  was Kavanaugh s only response.With some of her five minutes still remaining, Feinstein ended her questioning, passing the floor back to Arizona sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell. As in Thursday morning s testimony from Ford, Mitchell questioned Kavanaugh for each of the 11 Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

That is the human carnage Donald Trump promised in his inauguration address.  @NicolleDWallace discusses Kavanaugh s opening statement pic.twitter.com/HLiJOCmH4X  MSNBC (@MSNBC) September 27, 2018Asked by fellow MSNBC anchor Brian Williams for her thoughts on Kavanaugh s testimony, Wallace said:  I m thinking about Donald Trump s inauguration address and the line about human carnage. We ve seen a lot of it today. The stories from Professor Ford and her family, what they ve been through and the story about Judge Kavanaugh s daughters, talking about praying for Professor Ford and Ashley Kavanaugh s face while he was telling that story and Brett Kavanaugh crying every time he talked about his parents and his wife and his kids and all his friends, men and women. That s the human carnage  that Donald Trump promised in his inauguration address. The line was a misquote, both in content and in context, of Trump s inaugural speech. Rather than  promise  carnage in the future, Trump said that the  carnage  of crime, poverty, and drugs  stops right here and stops right now. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.Wallace continued:  A couple things I learned about how this speech came to be, Brett Kavanaugh ripped up a set of remarks that have been circulated for feedback and notes and approval yesterday. He wrote this himself. I heard from two sources close to Kavanaugh that this was not a performance that had anything to do with the Supreme Court. It s a performance that had to do with his life. And I say performance  because I knew Brett Kavanaugh for   I worked with him in the White House for years and I never saw that side of him. So it was authentic and real. It may not have helped him. The MSNBC anchor then said that Kavanaugh s passionate defense may have damaged the perception of his testimony:  It may have hurt him. It may have helped him. But it was raw emotion, and I ve never seen that side of him. It was a rebuke of this moment in politics, and I think the question now is, does that overlap with his legislative goals, which is to win enough votes on this Committee to have his nomination forwarded to the full Senate? And I have no idea.

I m going to talk about my high school record if you re going to sit here and mock me,  Kavanaugh said.Grassley interrupted the exchange.I think we were all very fair to Dr. Ford,  Grassley said.  Shouldn t we be just as fair to Judge Kavanaugh?

Donna Edwards (D-MD) said the judge was a  bully. Edwards said,  Like a lot of America, I was riveted by it. First, of course, by the very compelling and credible testimony of Dr. Ford. She came across as a real human being, just telling her story. And then of course listening to Judge Kavanaugh and it was surprising to me that he seemed like a bully, frankly, and it reminds me it took me back to my old days as a victim s advocate working with victims of domestic violence and sexual assault and seeing their perpetrators across the table or across the courtroom and that kind of confrontation and it really felt very much like that. And so I was struck. I was struck by the fact that he kept interrupting the Democratic senators. It was unbelievable, in fact. And he showed the most interruption I think to some of the women members of that Senate panel. And then, of course, he would not answer the question ever about submitting to or making a request to the White House for an FBI investigation. And I think that that was damning. I think that if he believes his truth, then he should want to submit that so that he could enter the court, if he s going to do that, without anything hanging over his term, and he is unwilling to do that, and that suggests to me that he doesn t want to find out the answers to that question, and he doesn t want the rest of us to find out either. She added,  He sort of modeled if you will, the man who nominated him, President Trump. He was very belligerent and angry, and clearly, there were emotional moments talking about his family. I imagine it would be difficult for your family to hear about this testimony and what I was shocked by is that at the end the fact that he actually did not watch Christine Ford s testimony. I think that that is very, very telling. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/27/heilemann-kavanaugh-is-making-trump-republican-base-happy/","Thursday on MSNBC s special coverage of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, network analyst John Heilemann said Donald Trump and the Republican base are pleased with Kavanaugh s performance, but not moderates.Heilemann said,  He could easily embrace two things if he were fully confident of his innocence. One of them would be to ask for an FBI investigation of every serious charge leveled against him, not just by Dr. Ford but for others. He could ask for his longtime friend Mark Judge to come forward and testify under oath and be cross-examined. He s not done either one of those things. Every time he s given an opportunity to do that, which would not just be a thing that would speak to his confidence, but it would also be a politically strong move, he demurs in one way or another and defers back to the Republican-controlled committee. He continued,  The reality of this day is we walked into the hearing with a couple of key this is a numbers game, right? Most of the Republicans are going to vote for him no matter what. Most of the Democrats, all Democrats are going to vote against him, no matter what. There are a handful of Republican senators, the notable ones obviously Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, but some others, probably up to maybe ten at the most, who are going to look at this hearing and make a decision about what they thought at the end of it. Given the strength of Dr. Ford s testimony and given the different Brett Kavanaugh that we saw in the second half of the hearing that we ve seen so far, it does not look to me like he designed his testimony and his demeanor to try to play to those people and their concerns. He may be making Donald Trump happy. He may be making the Republican base happy. What he is not doing is reassuring Senator Collins, reassuring Senator Murkowski, reassuring Jeff Flake and Bob Corker and some others who are the ones who hold the fate of this nomination in his hands. It looks much more to me like he has decided to defend his honor and try to portray himself as a martyr in some basic knowledge that he is probably now unlikely to get confirmed because the way this day has gone has made it very hard for those Republican senators in the middle to be for him.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/kavanaugh-i-fear-the-whole-country-will-reap-the-whirlwind-of-democrats-behavior/","Judge Brett Kavanaugh accused Democrats and the left at Thursday s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing of having created a dangerous precedent for the country in trying to defeat his nomination with last-minute, decades-old, uncorroborated sexual misconduct allegations. This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,  Kavanaugh said close to the beginning of his opening statement, where he gave a scathing assessment of how Democrats came to unveil the allegations against him. He quoted Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) saying those who support Kavanaugh are  complicit in evil  and former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz asserting that confirming Kavanaugh would endanger millions of lives.Kavanaugh told the committe:I understand the passions of the moment. But I would say to those senators, Your words have meaning.  Millions of Americans listened carefully to you. Given comments like those, is it any surprise that people have been willing to do anything, to make any physical threat against my family, to send any violent email to my wife? To make any kind of allegation against me and against my friends? To blow me up and take me down?Kavanaugh hinted that he believed the Democratic strategy to defeat his nomination will have lasting effects on the political system.  You sowed the wind. For decades to come, I fear the whole country will reap the whirlwind,  he said.He referenced the widely-criticized treatment Democratic senators subjected to Ronald Reagan s Supreme Court nominee Judge Robert Bork.  The behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment, but at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at borking,  he said, continuing:Those efforts didn t work. When I did at least okay enough at the hearings that it looked as though I might actually get confirmed, a new tactic was needed. Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready. This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee and by staff. It would be needed only if you couldn t take me out on the merits.Kavanaugh s opening statement set off a combative hearing, with Kavanaugh aggressively refuting both the allegations made against him with committee witness Christine Blasey Ford and those of other accusers not present.

In his prepared statement delivered before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kavanaugh cited calendars from 1981 and 1982 where he recorded his activities, including weightlifting sessions.Kavanaugh testified that his calendars supported his recollection of never attending a party with Blasey Ford:When I was in town, I spent much of my time working, working out, lifting weights, playing basketball, or hanging out and having some beers with friends, as we talked about life and football and school and girls.In the summer of 1981, I had worked construction. In the summer of 1982, my job was cutting lawns. I had my own business of sorts. You see some specifics about the lawn cutting listed on the August calendar page, when I had to time the last lawn cuttings of the summer of various lawns before football training camp. I played in a lot of summer league basketball games for the Georgetown Prep team at night at Blair High School in Silver Spring. Many nights I worked out with other guys at Tobin s house, he was the great quarterback on our football team, and his dad ran workouts, or lifted weights at Georgetown Prep in preparation for the football season.After deleting the tweet, Hohmann denied that he meant to insinuate Kavanagh s weightlifting gave him the strengthen to allegedly pin down his accuser.One of my earlier tweets was interpreted in a way that was not intended so I deleted it.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) charged in a fiery speech during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday that the sexual assault allegations, led by Sen.

Graham noted that 23 minutes after President Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he will oppose Kavanaugh s nomination  with everything I have  because the  stakes are simply too high. The South Carolina Senator knocked ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) for knowledge of the sexual allegation against Kavanaugh during his meeting with her and the fact that she had already recommended lawyer Debra Katz to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman that now accuses Kavanaugh of assaulting her. Graham blasted Feinstein, saying that she could have come to the Senate Republicans about this accusation well before the Senate Judiciary nomination hearings and, instead, contended that Feinstein wants to  destroy  Kavanaugh s nomination. If you wanted an FBI investigation, then you could have come to us, what you wanted to do was destroy this guy s life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020, you ve said that,  Graham went on.  Not me. Sen. Graham noted that he voted for both of Obama s Supreme Court nominees, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, and said that he would have never subjected them to these allegations as Feinstein did to Kavanaugh. Graham charged that this is the  most unethical sham  he has ever witnessed as a senator. I would never done to them, what you have done to this guy,  Sen. Graham said.  This is the most unethical sham since I ve been in politics, and if you really wanted to know the truth you sure as hell wouldn t have done the same thing you did to this guy.

Dr. Ford, in choosing attorneys, did anyone help you with the choice?  Rachel Mitchell, the Phoenix, Arizona, special victims division chief enlisted as outside counsel to take Ford s testimony, asked. Various people referred me to lawyers that they knew in the Washington, DC-area,  Ford responded.  I asked some family members and friends and they referred me to like divorce attorneys that might know somebody  I ended up interviewing several law firms from the DC-area. Unsatisfied with that answer, Mitchell pressed Ford to answer if anyone other than friends and family helped her choose a lawyer. Um, I think that the staff of Diane Feinstein s office suggested the possibility of some attorneys,  Ford replied, without saying what effect that advice may have had. Including the two that are sitting on either side of you?  Mitchell asked, to which Ford replied,  Not both of them, no. Mitchell asked for clarification of these indefinite answers in her next five minute questioning session.  Which of your two lawyers did Senator Feinstein s office recommend?  The Katz firm,  Ford responded, indicating her initial lead attorney, Democratic donor and activist Deborah Katz, was selected with assistance from the Judiciary Committee s ranking Democrat.Katz has been a fixture of left-wing advocacy for decades, being enlisted to defend both President Bill Clinton and Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) from their own sexual misconduct allegations.The origin of Ford s selection of her other present attorney, Michael Bromwich, the Justice Department Inspector General for the bulk of the Clinton administration, was not addressed.Earlier in the hearing, Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) asked Ford if there was a  political motivation  in her coming forward with an alleged attack from 36 years ago on the eve of Kavanaugh s potential elevation to the Supreme Court. No. I d like to reiterate that   again   I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other   what looked like equally-qualified candidates,  was Ford s response.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/christine-blasey-ford-i-thought-brett-kavanaugh-accidentally-kill-me/","California psychology Professor Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee Thursday that she believed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was going to  accidentally  kill her during an alleged incident of sexual assault.In her prepared statement before lawmakers, Ford said,  Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because he was so drunk and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes. I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming,  the professor continued. This was what terrified me the most and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me,  she added.Ford testified she did not reveal the alleged incident to her parents, citing concerns they would react angrily that she attended a house party where alcohol was present. Further, the professor, who did not file a police report following the alleged misconduct, contended she only first detailed the incident during a couples  therapy session in May 2012.Ford alleges that Kavanaugh, along with his friend Mike Judge, forced her into a room and groped her at a house party in Maryland around 1982, an accusation all named witnesses deny any knowledge of.With his wife, Ashley, by his side, Judge Kavanaugh denied the allegation in a sit-down interview with Fox News s Martha MacCallum on Monday and called for a  fair process  in which he could defend his integrity against the claims. I ve never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise,  President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee affirmed to MacCallum.  I am not questioning, and have not questioned, that perhaps Dr. Ford, at some point in her life, was sexually assaulted by someone, in some place. But what I know is I ve never sexually assaulted anyone.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/27/kavanaugh-this-whole-two-week-effort-has-been-a-calculated-and-orchestrated-political-hit/","During his opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh said,  This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit,  accused Democrats of turning advice and consent into search and destroy, and stated to them,  You sowed the wind for decades to come. I fear that the whole country will reap the whirlwind. Kavanaugh stated,  This confirmation process has become a national disgrace. The Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy. Since my nomination in July, there has been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything, to block my confirmation. After reading statements from Democrats about his nomination, Kavanaugh said,  I would say to those senators, your words have meaning. Millions of Americans listened carefully to you. Given comments like those, is it any surprise that people have been willing to do anything, to make any physical threat against my family, to send any violent email to my wife, to make any kind of allegation against me and against my friends, to blow me up and take me down? You sowed the wind for decades to come. I fear that the whole country will reap the whirlwind. Kavanaugh continued,  The behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment, but at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at Borking. Those efforts didn t work. When I did at least okay enough at the hearings that it looked like I might actually get confirmed, a new tactic was needed. Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready. This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee and by staff. It would be needed only if you couldn t take me out on the merits. When it was needed, this allegation was unleashed and publicly deployed, over Dr. Ford s wishes. And then, as no doubt was expected, if not planned, came a long series of false, last-minute smears designed to scare me and drive me out of the process before any hearing occurred. Crazy stuff, gangs, illegitimate children, fights on boats in Rhode Island, all nonsense, reported breathlessly and often uncritically by the media. He continued,  This has destroyed my family and my good name, a good name built up through decades of very hard work and public service at the highest levels of the American government. This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.

Kavanaugh ripped the Senate   and, by implication, Senate Democrats   for   false, last-minute smears designed to scare me and drive me out of the process before any hearing occurred. He read from a personal statement that he had appended to his prepared testimony, and written the day before.In a searing indictment of the politicians before him, he mentioned some of the comments made by Democrats   including members of the committee   such as the claim by Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) that supporting Kavanaugh meant being  complicit in evil.  Others, he noted, said that  people will die if I am confirmed. The campaign to stop his confirmation, he said, had  destroyed my good name and my family  through a  calculated and orchestrated political hit. Whatever the reason,   whether fueled by  pent-up anger  over the election, or for other motives   he decried the damage done to him, to the Supreme Court, and to the country. This is a circus. The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades,  he said.However, he vowed: Coordinated and well-funded effort to destroy my good name, and destroy my family, will not drive me out.  You may defeat me in the final vote, but you ll never get me to quit. Never. Kavanaugh also repeated his denials about any and all allegations of sexual assault. He seemed to choke up when mentioning his mother, a judge who inspired him to become a judge. And he teared up and paused when stating that his ten-year-old daughter had told him that they should pray for Dr. Ford.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

I do not remember, other than that I did not drive home,  Ford told the committee.How Ford got home after she claims to have fled the high school gathering, where, she alleges, a 17-year-old Brett Kavanaugh groped her before she managed to escape, remains an unexplained area of Ford s accusation. She claims to have walked out of the bathroom where she hid after escaping from Kavanaugh and friend Mark Judge s clutches, rushing out to the street upon hearing the pair go back downstairs to a living room from the bedroom where they assaulted her.Ford has never offered an explanation of how she, then 15 years old, and who, by her own reckoning, could not drive, made it miles back to her home.Mitchell began her line of questioning about her return home by trying to approximate the location of the party, which has also never been definitively established in Ford s allegations. Using a map, Mitchell showed that if the party were within one mile of the country club from which Ford claimed she came before the party, it would be between 6.2 and 8.2 miles from her home.Ford confirmed that this would have been the driving distance.  Would it be fair to say that somebody drove you somewhere, either to the party or home from the party,  Mitchell asked, and Ford responded that it was.Next, Mitchell inquired if anyone could corroborate this aspect of Ford s story by saying he/she was the driver.  Has anyone come forward to say to you, Hey, remember I was the one who drove you home?   Mitchell asked.Ford admitted no one had.

The letter included my name but also requested that it be kept confidential.But her written testimony sent to the Judiciary Committee for review ahead of time stated that she met with Eshoo a week earlier than when she told the committee:On July 9, 2018, I received a call from the office of Congresswoman Anna Eshoo after Mr. Kavanaugh had become the nominee.

Ford suggested that  health challenges  played a role, insinuating that the denial may have come exclusively from her lawyer, saying Keyser  texted me right after with an apology :Leland has significant health challenges and I m happy that she s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs. She let me know that she needed her lawyer to take care of this for her. She texted me right after with an apology and good wishes.I don t expect that PJ and Leland would remember this evening. It was a very unremarkable party. It was not one of there more notorious parties, because nothing remarkable happened to them that evening. They were downstairs.On Saturday evening, Keyser s attorney sent a letter to the committee stating his client has no recollection of being told about the alleged incident or attending a party with Kavanaugh present.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Howard Walsh wrote in a statement on behalf of Keyser:  Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.  Walsh s statement described his client and Ford as  lifelong friend[s]. The Senate Judiciary Committee earlier in the week told Keyser that Ford identified her as someone who attended the party, where the professor alleged she was groped and pinned down on a bed by Kavanaugh.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/ford-alleged-kavanaugh-assault-led-to-decision-to-install-two-front-doors/","Christine Blasey Ford said in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh alleged sexual assault at a social gathering in the 1980s led to the decision to install two front doors when remodeling her home in 2012. The reason this came up in counseling is because my husband and I had completed a very extensive, very long remodel of our home and I insisted on a second front door    an idea that he and others disagreed with and could not understand and in explaining why I wanted a second front door I began to describe the assault in detail,  Ford said.  I recall saying that the boy could someday be on the U.S. Supreme Court and spoke a bit about his background at an elitist all-boys school in Bethesda, Maryland. Ford implied at the hearing that she explained during a couple s therapy session in May of 2012 that she wanted the two doors because of the anxiety and panic she had experienced because of the alleged attack. My husband recalls that I named my attacker as Brett Kavanaugh,  Ford said.  After that May 2012 therapy session, I did my best to ignore the memories of the assault because recounting them caused me to relive the experience and cause panic and anxiety. The committee will hear from Kavanaugh after Ford s testimony concludes.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

In 2008 Blumenthal told a group of veterans that he served in Vietnam, but the New York Times reported that Blumenthal never did serve in Vietnam.Rather,  he obtained at least five military deferments from 1965 to 1970 and took repeated steps that enabled him to avoid going to war.

In your July 6 text to the Washington Post that you looked at earlier, you said that this happened in the mid-80s,  Mitchell said in the second of her five minute questioning sessions with Ford, yeilded from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-IA). In your letter to Sen. Feinstein, you said it occurred in the early 80s. In your polygraph statement you said it was high school summer in 80s  and you actually had written in  early  and then you cross that out,  Mitchell continued.  Later, in your interview with the Washington Post, you were more specific. You believed it occurred in the summer of 1982 and you said the end of your sophomore year.   How were you able to narrow down the time frame?  Mitchell posed. I can t give the exact date and I would like to be more helpful about the date,  Ford responded.Then, echoing repeated statements by the committee s Democrats about the absence of alleged accomplice Mark Judge, Ford added,  If I knew when Mark Judge worked at the Potomac Safeway, then I would be able to be more helpful in that way. So I m just using memories of when I got my driver s license. The exact time of the party where Ford claims Kavanaugh and Judge forced her into a room and Kavanaugh groped her and put a hand over her mouth has been one of the lacking details from Ford s account. She has never definitely named a month and year in which the attack allegedly took place, but the most recent accounts focus on the summer of 1982, when Ford was 15 and Kavanaugh 17.

Chuck Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, and Dick Durbin in refusing to even read her allegations in 1999, while pushing for believing the accuser of a Republican Supreme Court nominee in the present day. Back in 1999, Sen. Chuck Schumer, Sen. [Dianne] Feinstein, and Sen. [Dick] Durbin refused to read my investigation and record with the independent counselcompletely refusedeven [though] they were asked by the committee, and the committee said, This woman has credible evidence,   Broaddrick told Breitbart News.  I had all the what, who, when, wheres, and how of my rape by Bill Clinton. They refusedDurbin, Schumer, Feinsteinnot only didn t believe mine; they didn t give themselves a chance to believe it because they refused to read it. That s disgusting. Broaddrick came to Capitol Hill Thursday ahead of the day s Senate hearing regarding Dr. Christine Blasey Ford s allegations that Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school over 30 years ago.Broaddrick s message for senators getting ready to vote on Kavanaugh s nomination was,  They ve done already what they need to do. They know that these allegations are falling apart by the minute against a very good, honest man and they re trying to ruin this man all because of politics and I think that s wrong.   I didn t try to ruin Bill Clinton because of politics, I was just trying to validate a rape,  she added.Michelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News   follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/christine-blasey-ford-i-dont-know-who-paid-for-polygraph-not-yet/","Christine Blasey Ford, the California psychology professor who leveled allegations of teenage sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, said she does not know who paid for a polygraph examination regarding the incident while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.UPDATE   1:44 PM: Ford s counsel, Debra Katz, after a break in the hearing, says:  Let me put an end to this mystery  her lawyers have paid for her polygraph. As is routine. Blasey Ford told prosecutor Rachel Mitchell Thursday afternoon that she did  not yet  know who paid for the polygraph exam she underwent on August 7, one week after her allegations against Kavanaugh reached Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).Ford testified Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, leveling her accusations against President Donald Trump s Supreme Court Justice nominee. The Republican members all ceded their time for questions to Mitchell, a veteran sex crimes prosecutor.In this exchange, Mitchell asked whether Ford recalled who had paid for the polygraph exam:MITCHELL: Did you pay for the polygraph yourself?FORD: I don t think so.MITCHELL: Do you know who paid for the polygraph?FORD: Not yet, no.Mitchell also asked why Jerry Hanafin, the polygraph administrator, did not conduct the examination in his Virginia office, rather at a hotel next to BaltimoreWashington International Airport.  I had left my grandmother s funeral at that point at Fort Lincoln Cemetery that day and I was on a tight scheduled to get to make a plane to Manchester, New Hampshire,  Ford told Mitchell.  He was willing to come to me, which was appreciated. Mitchell followed up,  So you were administered a polygraph on the day that you attended your grand mother s funeral ?  Correct, or it might have been the next day,  Ford replied.In a hot mic moment, Ford then turned to one of her attorneys, Debra Katz, and said,  I don t remember the exact day. Asked if she had ever been advised on how to take a polygraph or offered any  tips  regarding an examination, Ford said she had not. She said that while she was  scared  to take the test, she believed it would accurately gauge whether her responses were truthful. I didn t expect it to be as long as it was going to be,  she added.  It was a little bit stressful.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/rachel-mitchell-demolishes-christine-blasey-fords-claim-she-fears-flying/","Investigative counsel Rachel Mitchell, cross-examining Christine Blasey Ford at the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, demolished her claim that she could not testify on Monday because she was afraid of flying.Ford and her attorneys refused a Monday hearing, arguing that she was afraid to fly. One of her friends even claimed that her fear of flying was a result of the alleged assault by Judge Brett Kavanaugh over 35 years ago.Watch the exchange: As Politico reported:The GOP has been told that Ford does not want to fly from her California home to Washington, according to the Republican senator, which means she may need to drive across the country. Ford has reportedly told friends she is uncomfortable in confined spaces, indicating a physical difficulty in making the trip by plane.Committee chair Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) then offered to travel to California to interview Ford, relieving her of the need to fly. She declined. There was talk of having Ford drive across the country to make the hearing.Yet under questioning by Mitchell, Ford admitted that she had, in fact, flown across the country to make the hearing. She had also flown to the east coast for a vacation with family in August. She also admitted flying frequently for her work and for her hobbies, including surfing vacations in Hawaii, Costa Rica, and French Polynesia. Ford, laughing nervously, said that it was easier to fly for vacations.Critics had speculated that the sole reason Democrats, and Ford, were refusing a Monday hearing   or even a compromise Wednesday hearing   was because a Thursday hearing would make it almost impossible for the Senate to hold a confirmation vote on Judge Kavanaugh before the Supreme Court begins its new session on October 1.Joel B.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/pollak-dianne-feinsteins-opening-statement-at-brett-kavanaugh-hearing-was-a-mockery-of-justice/","Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) delivered an opening statement Thursday to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Christine Blasey Ford s accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh that represented a complete inversion of the principles of justice upon which our republic is founded.Feinstein attempted to place Ford s allegations in the context of the broader  #metoo  movement, and lamented that accusers who came forward were, as she put it,  re-victimized. The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right of an accused  to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense. To demand that accusers provide evidence, and that they submit to cross-examination by the accused, is not  re-vicitmizing  them. It is fundamental to the basic principles of justice and the individual rights in our constitution. The alternative   a society where a mere accusation is enough to invoke punishment   would be horrific.Feinstein lamented what she called a  rush to judgment.  But she did not mean a rush to judge Brett Kavanaugh. On the contrary, she repeated accusations against Kavanaugh as if they had been proved, without using the word  alleged.  She also quoted accusations that had been made in the media against Kavanaugh by people who also refused to answer further questions, like Kavanaugh s college roommate (now a Silicon Valley CEO), James Roche.Feinstein then complained about  the unwillingness to take these kinds of allegations at face value    making it clear that she wants a rush to judgment   in favor of the accuser and against the accused.Breitbart News Senior Legal Editor Ken Klukowski notes:  Under the Constitution s Speech or Debate Clause, a Member of the House and Senate can never be sued or otherwise questioned about anything they say on the House or Senate floor or in a committee meeting. Feinstein could accuse Judge Kavanaugh of any crime, she can slander him or anyone else, she could even commit a felony by reading aloud from classified documents, and under this legislative immunity she could never be sued or charged with any of it. Still, it is shocking that someone who abuses the rights of the accused is the senior member of the minority party on the committee that evaluates judges and conducts oversight of the judicial system in general.Joel B.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/chuck-grassley-slams-dianne-feinstein-shameful-way-to-treat-dr-ford-amid-media-circus/","Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) slammed ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein s (D-CA)  shameful way  of pushing Christine Blasey Ford to testify amidst a  media circus. Grassley held a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday to discuss California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford s accusation that Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh allegedly attempted to sexually assault her when they were both in high school in the 1980s.Chairman Grassley said that he lamented how this hearing arose, given that Sen. Feinstein did not relay this information during the committee s confirmation process until the  eleventh hour. Grassley said that six separate Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) inquiries did not reveal anything to suggest that Kavanaugh engaged in any inappropriate sexual behavior. Nowhere in any of these six FBI reports, which committee investigators have reviewed on a bipartisan basis, was there ever a whiff of any issue  at all  related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior,  Grassley said.Sen. Grassley noted that Feinstein learned about these accusations two months ago, but waited until after the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation process finished to take action. Dr. Ford first raised her allegations in a secret letter to the Ranking Member nearly two months ago in July. The Ranking Member took no action,  Grassley explained.  The letter wasn t shared with me, our colleagues, or my staff. These allegations could ve been investigated in a way that maintained the confidentiality Dr. Ford requested. The Iowa senator then elaborated that Feinstein did not ask Kavanaugh about the accusations during her meeting with the nominee in August, during their four-day confirmation hearing in September, and not during a closed committee session on the last evening of the hearing, which, Grassley adds, Feinstein did not attend. Throughout this period, we did not know about the Ranking Member s secret evidence,  the Iowa Republican added.Chairman Grassley then charged that Feinstein referred these allegations to the FBI only  at the eleventh hour,  at which time the allegations were leaked to the press, all to Ford s dismay because she had insisted on confidentiality. This is a shameful way to treat Dr. Ford, who insisted on confidentiality, and Judge Kavanaugh, who has had to address these allegations in the midst of a media circus,  Grassley said.

Kavanaugh adamantly denies any of this ever happened.

Committee staff interviewed the man again the next day, on Sept. 25, according to the timeline.  He described his recollection of their interaction in some detail,  according to the committee.On Sept. 26, the committee received  a more in-depth written statement  from the man they had previously interviewed. Committee staff also spoke by phone  with another man who believes he, not Judge Kavanuagh, had the encounter with Dr. Ford in 1982 that is the basis of her allegation. He explained his recollection of the details of the encounter. Democrats called the release of this news  shameful and the height of irresponsibility. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

A Miami-Dade County court docket shows a petition for injunction against Swetnick was filed March 1, 2001, by her former boyfriend, Richard Vinneccy, who told POLITICO Wednesday the two had dated for four years before they broke up,  the report reads. Right after I broke up with her, she was threatening my family, threatening my wife and threatening to do harm to my baby at that time,  Vinneccy told Politico, adding,  I know a lot about her. She s not credible at all. Not at all. Avenatti, the attorney made famous by CNN for representing porn star Stormy Daniels, was caught off guard by the news of the restraining order filed against his client.After telling Politico he knew nothing about it, he added:  Complete nonsense. No truth to this at all. Her ex-boyfriend fraudulently used her resume to apply for and obtain jobs and was caught by her,  said Avenatti. Why are you all attacking a sexual assault victim? Would that be appropriate in a court of law?  he added.Politico also reports that Vinneccy is a  registered Democrat, according to Miami-Dade County voting records. On Wednesday, Avenatti released a sworn statement from Swetnick in which she accused Kavanaugh of participating in serial gang rapes. She claims that while she was a college-aged adult and Kavanaugh was as young as 15, he spiked drinks at ten house parties she attended as a means to incapacitate women and then gang rape them.Swetnick claimed she was gang raped and that Kavanugh was present at the time.Kavanaugh denies the allegation, and even the far-left New York Times has reported it could not find any evidence to corroborate her story. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Liberty University is only three hours from D.C., so we try to give our students a chance to get involved in national politics,  Falwell said.  If you want to be excused from classes tomorrow, go to Washington and counter what the Yale students are doing. Support Judge Kavanaugh, we ve got 300 spots for you.

I think the Republicans are going above and beyond giving the accuser the right to be heard, maybe more than they should, but I think they should be commended for hearing her out, for taking her seriously and delaying the process so she can be heard,  Falwell said.The university has not shied away from political activism as of late. Earlier in September, the university announced it would consider dropping Nike as a uniform supplier over the company s decision to use former NFL player and national anthem protester Colin Kaepernick as a spokesperson for the brand.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/cracks-and-contradictions-found-in-christine-blasey-ford-documents/","Attorneys for Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford released her polygraph report and a statement Wednesday, both of which appear to have further unraveled her allegations.To begin with, Ford s polygraph test is highly unusual. After writing out her own statement of her allegations in longhand, she was asked only two questions by the test administrator:  1) Is any part of your statement false? 2) Did you make up any part of your statement? Ford answered  no  to both questions and passed the test.Ford was not asked any specific questions about the specific allegation. There are also no test or baseline questions where the subject is intentionally asked to lie. This is raising all kinds of questions.Then there is Ford s written statement itself, which is riddled with cross-outs and corrections. We have no way of knowing if those corrections were made before or after the polygraph was taken.Most remarkable are the contradictions between Ford s statement written on August 7 for the polygraph, and the letter Ford sent to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) only a week earlier on July 30.On a matter as important as the number of people (witnesses) who were at the 1982 house party where the attempted assault allegedly took place, Ford told Feinstein that  me and 4 others  attended the gathering. That would be five people.One week later, though, Ford passed a polygraph, in which she wrote there were  4 boys and a couple of girls    or six people.Even if she includes herself as one of the  couple of girls,  the count is still off.What s more, in 2012, according to her own therapist s notes, Ford said there were four boys in the room during the alleged assault. Ford told the far-left Washington Post there were only two boys in the room (Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge) and that her therapist got it mixed up.What this means is that all of the written documentation contradicts the number of people in the room and the number of people at the party.Another contradiction comes from Ford s travel dates around the time of the polygraph and her reported fear of flying.One of the primary reasons everything has been delayed an extra week (a primary goal of Democrats) is to accommodate Ford s apparent fear of flying. Her attorney informed the Senate Judiciary Committee she could not appear earlier than this Thursday due to her fear of confined spaces.According to ABC News,  Ford s fear of flying is directly related to her allegation of assault, and that an airplane is the ultimate closed space where you cannot get away. But in her letter to Feinstein, Ford writes,  I am available to speak further should you wish to discuss. I am currently vacationing in the mid-Atlantic until August 7th and will be in California after August 10th. Confirming her whereabouts in the Mid-Atlantic is in her polygraph report, which was administered on August 7 in Maryland. But in her letter to Feinstein, Ford says she will be in California by the 10th.If you are in Maryland on the 7th of August and afraid to fly, the only way to be in California by the 10th of August would be to take a grueling 2,700-plus mile cross country trip that requires at least 42 hours on the road   not counting delays and the necessary stops for gas, food, and bathroom breaks.Finally, Ford is now refusing to release the aforementioned notes from her therapist. This comes after Ford chose to use the Washington Post to introduce those very same notes into the court of public opinion as evidence for her claim.Here is how she used those notes to back up her claim on September 16:Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband. The therapist s notes, portions of which were provided by Ford and reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention Kavanaugh s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students  from an elitist boys  school  who went on to become  highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.  The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy Ford says was an error on the therapist s part. Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.Ford did not mention Kavanaugh by name to her therapist, but she now wants to claim this session is proof she mentioned the incident prior to his Supreme Court nomination.Even more troubling is the fact she was willing to allow the anti-Trump Post to see her therapist s notes, but not the Senate Judicial Committee, and by extension, the American people.These latest contradictions and cracks in Ford s allegation, stretching back to when she was 15  and  Kavanaugh 17, comes on the heels of all four of her supposed witnesses basically siding with Kavanaugh.Ford named three males who were at this alleged house party and one other female.The three males (Kavanaugh, Judge, and PJ Smyth) have no memory of the alleged misconduct or even the house party.The female witness, Leland Ingham Keyser, who is a Democrat and a lifelong friend of Ford s, not only doesn t remember the house party in question, she says she has never met Kavanaugh.Every single witness named by Ford says they have no memory of any of this. The same is true of Kavanaugh s second accuser, Deborah Garcia, who told her admittedly flimsy story to the New Yorker, but has so far refused to go under oath. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Following the incident, Kadestsky becomes inspired to stand up for women s rights alongside other feminist activists.Amazon s acquiring of such a film comes at a tumultuous time for Amazon s film studios, which has seen big successes such as Manchester by the Sea and The Big Sick, but also major flops Life Itself, Wonder Wheel, and Gringo.The announcement also comes amid the ongoing controversy surrounding President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual misconduct at a college party among other uncorroborated allegations intended to torpedo his confirmation.The announcement also come nearly one year after former head of Amazon Studios Roy Price resigned from the streaming giant amid allegations that he sexual harassment an Amazon Studios top producer, Isa Hackett, a producer for the Amazon original series Man in the High Castle.
Last week Price was placed on indefinite leave of absence after Isa Hackett, a producer for the Amazon original series Man in the High Castle, accused him of sexually harassing her in a taxi.Kidman, who will produce the title alongside Lynda Obst and Per Saari, has never been known for having outspoken left-wing or feminist views. Following Trump s stunning election victory against Hillary Clinton in 2016, Kidman even urged the country to get behind the new president. [Trump is] now elected and we, as a country, need to support whoever is the president,  she said in an interview with BBC host Victoria Derbyshire before his inauguration.  That is what the country is based on. And however that happened, it happened, and let s go. Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/09/27/hate-machine-cnn-pushes-brett-kavanaugh-allegation-hours-accuser-recants/","CNN pushed a sexual misconduct allegation against Brett Kavanaugh Wednesday night, hours after the accuser had already recanted.On Wednesday, news broke about a Rhode Island man named Jeff Catalan who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of raping a  close associate  of his on a boat in 1985.Catalan made his accusation through the office of Rep. Sheldon Whitehouse (R-RI). According to transcripts of the phone call where Kavanaugh denied the allegation to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Catalan said his associate was  sexually assaulted by two heavily inebriated men she referred to at the time as Brett and Mark,  a reference to Kavanaugh and his high school friend Mark Judge.Wednesday afternoon, however, just before 5:00 p.m. Eastern, Catalan admitted he had made a mistake and recanted the allegation:Do everyone who is going crazy about what I had said I have recanted because I have made a mistake and apologize for such mistake  Jeffrey Catalan (@JeffreyCatala16) September 26, 2018Catalan is also a virulent anti-Trumper who has attacked Trump as a  parasite that occupies the White House. Nevertheless, at 7:33 p.m. Eastern, the far-left CNN not only used the already-recanted and totally false Rhode Island accusation for a breathless breaking news report against Kavanaugh, as you can see for yourself, but CNN did not even bother to report that the allegation had already been recanted.Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), a member of the Judiciary Committee, commented on it in a tweet Wednesday night. One of the unfortunate results of the media frenzy Senate Democrats have created by taking allegations straight to media instead of through the process,  he wrote,  [is that] major outlets are still reporting on this accusation even though the accuser has recanted :One of the unfortunate results of the media frenzy Senate Democrats have created by taking allegations straight to media instead of through the process   major outlets are still reporting on this accusation even though the accuser has recanted.  https://t.co/nLQnEsaVVZ  Senator Hatch Office (@senorrinhatch) September 27, 2018Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Kavanaugh says that is not an accurate characterization. He says Chris Dudley s (the terrible free throw shooter) statements in the article more accurate because he spent much more time with Dudley than the other people quoted in the article. Coons worried about the  credibility of the court  if Kavanaugh is confirmed.Kavanaugh asks Coons,  Do you know how long the last 10 days have been?  He says every day has been like a lifetime.5:31 PM: Hatch on Kavanaugh:  This man is not a monster.  Hatch says  this is worse than Robert Bork  and  this is worse than Clarence Thomas.

Jennifer Rubin (@JRubinBlogger) September 27, 20183:11 PM: Kavanaugh says he wrote his statement himself. He points out that all four people she named have denied. Kavanaugh quotes Leland Keyser s denial. He says he demanded a hearing the very next day to clear his name. He says in the 10 long days, his name and his family s name have been  totally and permanently destroyed.  He says when this allegation first arose,  I welcomed any type of investigation.  He says he knows that any kind of investigation  will clear me. Listen to the people I know. Listen to the people who ve known me my whole life  I m not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been assaulted by some person, in some place, at some time but I have never done this, to her or to anyone,  Brett Kavanaugh says.

You sowed the wind. For decades to come, I fear the whole country will reap the whirlwind.  I was not at the party described by Dr. Ford,  he says. Kavanaugh says the confirmation process has become a  national disgrace  and it has become a  search and destroy  mission instead of the Senate advising and consentingHe says Democrats could not take him out on the merits and then publicly deployed Ford s allegations against him against her wishes. He calls it a  calculated  and  orchestrated  political hit job. He talks about all of the  nonsense  that has destroyed his family and his name. He blasts the behavior of Democrats was embarrassing. Mentions that some said he was evil (reference to Booker s remarks).Brett Kavanaugh warns about  consequences  that will be felt for decades after the handling of the sexual assault accusation:  I am an optimistic guyBut today, I have to say that I fear for the future  https://t.co/9FalHY71EC pic.twitter.com/9oEfCYkEPJ  CBS News (@CBSNews) September 27, 2018 You may defeat me in the final vote but you ll never get me to quit,  he says.https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/1045394116207677443Kavanaugh says he has never sexually assaulted anyone and says one of his close friends is a woman who was sexually abused and consulted him when she was in her 30s. He says  due process is the foundation of American law  and it means  listening to both sides.  Not who I am and not who I was,  he says.  I am innocent of this charge.

He says he was 17 years of age during his junior and senior years at Georgetown Prep. He says his friends at Georgetown Prep partied with girls from other Catholic schools and not independent schools like Holton Arms. He says he did not travel in the same social circles as Ford though they may have crossed paths.He says Dr. Ford s allegations not only  uncorroborated  but  refuted  by people who she said were present at the party.Judge Brett Kavanaugh:  This whole two week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit.  https://t.co/005BvMqW3Y pic.twitter.com/RezyOPyHFL  Fox News (@FoxNews) September 27, 2018Kavanaugh points out he has submitted  detailed calendars  detailing his activities in the summer in question.Brett Kavanaugh:  Unfortunately, it took the committee ten days to get to this hearing.

He says  church  is not written on some Sundays because going to church is automatic like  brushing my teeth. still is. He says sometimes he had too many beershe like beer, he still likes beer. He says he never drank beer to the point of blacking out and never sexually assaulted anyone. He says if everyone who drinks beer or drank beer in high school is presumed guilty of sexual assault, then this will be an ugly society. He says he and his friends have cringed when they read their yearbooks and talked about it this week. He said the Georgetown Prep yearbooks were disasters to the point of absurdity. He says the students and the editors wanted to give off an  Animal House  vibe (or Caddyshack, Fast Time at Ridgemont High). He says the Renate Alumnus reference was clumsily made to show that she was one of them. Says Renate was and is a  great person. Now he says that he never had sexual intercourse during high school or many years after. He says he was  inwardly proud  of his virginity.#Kavanaugh: as to sex, i never had sexual intercourse or anything close to it during high school or for many years after thatin some crowds i was probably outwardly shy about my inexperience. at the same time i was inwardly proud of it.  Brooke Singman (@brookefoxnews) September 27, 2018Kavanaugh thanks the 65 women who signed a letter to support him for putting themselves on the line. He is also proud of female co-workers from the Bush administration who have vouched for him.3:10 PM: Kavanaugh getting sworn in.Of note: As Kavanaugh walked down the hallway to the hearing room he was straight-faced, almost frowning, which is the complete opposite of the smile he had on his face during every single meeting he had with Senators on the Hill.

Mitchell asks Ford why the people Ford says were at the party do not remember. She says it was not a  remarkable  party for PJ and Leland, who Ford says is dealing with health issues and texted her  sorry  after her lawyer took care of a statement for her. Mitchell asks whether anyone advised her to get a  forensic interview.  Ford says no.Grassley says three witnesses submitted by Ford have submitted statements denying Ford s allegations.2:01 PM: Harris says Ford is not on trial and praises her  courage.   I believe you,  Harris says.  And I believe many Americans across the country believe you.  She thanks Ford for being a  true patriot  and  bravely  coming forward and being a  profile in courage.  She says Ford has requested an FBI investigation and taken a polygraph test while Kavanaugh has not.1:55 PM: Sasse:WATCH: During a break in testimony, Republican Sen. Sasse, who defered his questions to a prosecutor in the hearing, walked up to Dr. Ford and shook her hand. pic.twitter.com/3StQt1Acst  MSNBC (@MSNBC) September 27, 20181:54 PM: Mitchell now asking Ford how she chose her lawyers. Ford says the staff of Feinstein s office could have suggested some attorneys that she could hire. She asks when Ford first requested an FBI investigation. She says when they first started talking about a hearing. Ford says she would be happy to cooperate with the FBI. Ford s lawyers say they are representing her pro bono and have no expectations of being paid. Ford says she has not been told of any questions in advance. Mitchell now asks about the person who connected her with Judge/Kavanaugh. Ford says it is the person Ed Whelan said looked liked Kavanaugh but she does not think it is appropriate to talk about him (assuming to protect his privacy). Ford says he was the member of the same country club and she knew his younger brother. Ford says she  went out with him  for a couple of months and there were other members at the country club who were common acquaintances. When Mitchell asks other social interactions with Kavanaugh, Ford says there were 4-5 parties that she attended that were also attended by Kavanaugh. Nothing inappropriate happened at those parties, she says.1:48 PM: Booker (D-NJ) now has his five minutes. She says Ford s life has been  upended  and commends her for sacrificing much to do her  civic duty.  Booker, who admitted to groping a classmate in high school, talks about a  dark culture  in American society where women are sexually assaulted. He says how the country deals with  survivors  is  unacceptable.  Booker praises Sen. Flake (R-AZ) for his Wed. floor speech. Booker wants to submit/introduce a letter from Mormon women supporting Ford.1:45 PM: After Hirono speaks about re-victimization, Ford s lawyers tell Mitchell that they have paid for the polygraph. Ford claims she has no political motive.  Mitchell asks if the cost of the polygraph will be passed on to her. Ford says she is aware of several  Go Fund Me  sites for her security detail but she does not know how to collect the money or distribute it. Mitchell now questioning Ford about her letter to Feinstein and asks whether someone speaking on her behalf spoke to anyone in Congress about her allegations re: the July 30th letter. She says she personally did not speak to anyone but is not sure if anyone else spoke about the letter to someone in Congress. Ford says she did not provide the letter to anyone else and does not know how the letter became public/was leaked. Mitchell asks if Ford reached out to the Post after the letter was leaked. Ford says she reached out to the Post (they were also continually reaching out to her) and she agreed to do a sit down after reporters were showing up at her home and workplace.1:30 PM: Graham:Sen.

Ford is asked whether anyone advised her on the choice of the person who conducted the polygraph test. Ford says she does not know who paid for the polygraph. She also says she took the polygraph test not at  Jerry s office but near BWI airport because she had to take a flight from BWI to Manchester, NH, even though she is so afraid to fly that she almost supposedly could not make the hearing. Ford says her primary memory of polygraph test was crying a lot.Christine Blasey Ford, in Senate testimony, says she doesn t know who paid for her polygraph test regarding sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh https://t.co/005BvMqW3Y pic.twitter.com/7aCI40i55v  Fox News (@FoxNews) September 27, 201812:31 PM: Blumenthal (D-CT) thanks Ford for  inspiring  and  enlightening  America.12:28 PM: Mitchell asks whether Ford spoke to any other person besides lawyers about the allegations during the period of time she was staying with her parents in Delaware (July 30 to August 7). Ford says she did not even speak to her parents about the allegations.12:25 PM: Mitchell asks whether Ford talked to any Republican about her allegations. She says she did not. Mitchell asks whether it was communicated to her whether Grassley s staff offered to fly out to California. Ford s lawyers immediately jump in and object to the simple question. But Feinstein insisted this is not a trial:We are here for one reason to determine whether Judge Kavanaugh should be elevated to one of the most powerful positions in our country. This is NOT a trial of Dr. Ford. It s a job interview for Judge Kavanaugh. Is he the best we can do?  Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) September 27, 2018Ford claims she was not clear what the offer was and would have happily hosted Grassley s staff.12:20 PM: After Ford describes her conversations with Rep. Eshoo (D-CA), Coons (D-DE) thanks Ford for testifying. The Palo Alto psychology professor  again insists she didn t know how to get information to Congressmen when there was a short list of candidates. Not a clue. Ford says she was able to pull herself together after the first few years of undergrad. She says she still experienced relationship challenges because of the incident. Ford says the impact is worse when someone is younger and has less coping skills. Ford says she was experiencing the  fight or flight  mode and  lucky events that occurred  that helped her get out of the event.12:14 PM: Mitchell wants to shift gears and discuss the last seven months. She asks if Ford spoke to any member of Congress before July about her allegations. Ford says,  no.  When asked why she contacted the Post on July 6, Ford says she was  panicking  and her beach friends who did not know anything about the process gave her advice to call newspapers or her congresswoman.12:12 PM: Grassley mentions that the committee s staff was willing to question Ford  anytime, anywhere.  Ford said being questioned in California was  unrealistic.  Did her lawyers not inform her of the accommodations Grassley and his staff were offering to make it as easy as possible for her?12:10 PM: Klobuchar asks Ford what she does not forget. She cites the living room, stairwell, bed to the right of the room, the laughter, the uproarious laughter, and the multiple attempts to escape.12:01 PM: Ford does not remember whether she showed a Post reporter her therapist s notes. Mitchell asks whether there are other things that have happened that have contributed to her anxiety and PTSD. Ford says  multifactorial  but her experience was  predictive  of symptoms. Ford also cites  biological predispositions  that she cannot rule out. When asked about possible environmental factors, Ford says  nothing that I can think of  and nothing  as striking as that event.  Mitchell asks Ford how she got to Washington. Ford responds:  In an airplane.  Ford says she was hoping they would come to her but realized it was  unrealistic  even though Grassley s staff offered to send staff to California. Ford says she worked up the  gumption  to fly to D.C. Ford says she flies once a year to visit her family to Delaware and flies frequently for work and hobbies. Ford says she has been to places like Hawaii and Costa Rica by airplane. Ford s team had insisted that she was too afraid to fly to have her testify before Thursday.11:53 AM: Whitehouse (D-RI) says a  sincere and thorough investigation  is critical and may be the  most basic thing we owe  the witness coming forward. Whitehouse says Ford has met all the standards of  preliminary credibility  with her opening statements.11:47 AM: Mitchell has a blow-ups of maps of the  beltway area.  Harris interrupts to say Democrats do not have the documents Mitchell is presenting. Ford says the house in question was somewhere between her parent s home and the country club. Ford says nobody has come forward to say that that person was the one who drove her home. Ford says she did not drive to or from that party because she didn t have her license yet. Ford says she is not sure whether the Washington Post reporter saw the therapy reportsshe doesn t remember whether she gave her the notes or whether she summarized the report. Her counsel, she says, saw the report. Mitchell now going over how many people were present at the party before her five minutes are up. Whitehouse now questioning.11: 42 AM: Fox News s Brit Hume: Very sympathetic witness,  says Brit Hume on Fox News s coverage.

He says Judge should be subpoenaed. Judge says a polished liar can create a seamless story as opposed to a sexual assault survivor who is traumatized. Durbin asks Ford to address reports of two men who say they might have assaulted Ford instead of Kavanaugh. Durbin asks how sure Ford is that Kavanaugh assaulted her. Ford says,  100%. 11:17 AM: Ford says she has spoken with Leland since the party. Mitchell asks Ford if she has told her everything she has remembered. Ford says she believes so. Mitchell asks whether music was at some point turned down, and Ford tell her she heard conversations downstairs as she was leaving the house.11:10 AM: Sen. Leahy (D-VT) says  bravery is contagious  and Ford s story is going to have a  lasting, positive impact.  Leahy blasts Kavanaugh allies for floating the kavanaugh look-alike theory. Ford says the look-alike was the person who introduced her to Messrs. Kavanaugh/Judge. Ford says she would not mistake Kavanaugh/Judge. Ford says  indelible in the hippocampus  is Kavanaugh s/Judge s laughter and their having fun at her expense. She says she was  underneath one of them  while the two of them laughed.Dr. Christine Blasey Ford remembers her strongest memory from the assault:  Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter. The uproarious laughter between the two  https://t.co/LCit5AErxU pic.twitter.com/SWrX5iLdsL  Variety (@Variety) September 27, 201811:08 AM: Mitchell asks Ford if she had anything to drink or was on any sort of medication before the gathering in question. Ford says she expected Mark Judge and Leland would be at the gathering. She dose not recall whether she expected Kavanaugh to be at the gathering. Mitchell asks what the atmosphere was like at the gathering before she walked up the stairs. She says Kavanaugh and Judge were  inebriated.  Ford says it was a  gathering  and  not really a party.  She said she assumed that it was going to lead to party later onshe calls it a  pre-gathering  and says it was not loud in the living room.11:04 AM: Ford cites  basic memory functions  when asked how she is sure that it was Kavanaugh that attacked her. She says this is  absolutely not  a case of mistaken identity. She talks about norepinephrine and epinephrine locking in memories. Ford also says Mark Judge was an employee at a Safeway when they crossed paths after alleged incident.Senator Feinstein: How are you so sure that it was [Kavanaugh]?Dr. Blasey Ford: The same way that I m sure that I m talking to you right now  just basic memory functions. https://t.co/hib1LKoWh8 pic.twitter.com/04ERUtZoud  CBS News (@CBSNews) September 27, 201811:02 AM: Ford talks about anxiety/PTSD after alleged sexual assault. She says she was  calculating  whether to come forward and did not want to be  annihilated  if Kavanaugh was going to get confirmed regardless. Ford talks about reporters posing as students and how she hosts Google interns at her home.10:59 AM: Grassley interrupts Mitchell because her initial five minutes are up. He now lets Feinstein question Ford. Awkward.10:54 AM: Mitchell says the first thing that struck her was that Ford was  terrified.  Ford says she misused the word  bystander  as an adjective when referring to  PJ Ford says he was  tall  and a  very nice person  who was  downstairs.  She d like to take that word out if possible.10:53 AM: Ford says she doesn t need a break right now since she has her coffee.10:51 AM: Ford says she is no one s  pawn  and is an  independent person.  She says she hopes to engage with each Committee member.10:50 AM: Fox News s Chris Wallace:Fox News  CHRIS WALLACE says in wake of Kavanaugh allegations  two of my daughters have told me stories that I have never heard before about things that happened in high school & hadn t told their parents I don t this we can disregard Ford and the seriousness of this.  pic.twitter.com/5lKaTDo9Cy  Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 27, 201810:47 AM:Holton-Arms alumnae are here in force today to support Dr. Christine Blasey Ford! #StandWithBlaseyFord #DontMess pic.twitter.com/225GnpppKH  Alexis Goldstein<U+0001F525> (@alexisgoldstein) September 27, 201810:46 AM:I just walked to @senatemajleader McConnell s office with @HouseDemWomen to demand that he delay this rushed confirmation hearing.

I denied the allegation immediately, unequivocally, and categorically. The next day, I told this Committee that I wanted to testify as soon as possible, under oath, to clear my name.Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired. There has been a frenzy to come up with something anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious that will block a vote on my nomination. These are last-minute smears, pure and simple. They debase our public discourse. And the consequences extend beyond any one nomination. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination if allowed to succeed will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country.As I told this Committee the last time I appeared before you, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. That is the kind of judge I am and will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. This effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. I am here this morning to answer these allegations and to tell the truth. And the truth is that I have never sexually assaulted anyone not in high school, not in college, not ever.Sexual assault is horrific. It is morally wrong. It is illegal. It is contrary to my religious faith. And it contradicts the core promise of this Nation that all people are created equal and entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Allegations of sexual assault must be taken seriously. Those who make allegations deserve to be heard. The subject of allegations also deserves to be heard. Due process is a foundation of the American rule of law.Dr. Ford s allegation dates back more than 36 years, to a party that she says occurred during our time in high school. I spent most of my time in high school focused on academics, sports, church, and service. But I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now. But that s not why we are here today. What I ve been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior. I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes.The allegation of misconduct is completely inconsistent with the rest of my life. The record of my life, from my days in grade school through the present day, shows that I have always promoted the equality and dignity of women.I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford. I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford. I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time. But I have never done that to her or to anyone. I am innocent of this charge.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/local/2018/09/27/pelosi-on-justice-kavanaugh-hearings-republicans-assaulting-ford-cowardly-using-hired-woman/","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Wednesday accused Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee of assaulting Christine Blasey Ford with their  cowardice,  which she said included having a  hired woman  ask Ford questions at Thursday s morning s hearing.Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Ford, the first person to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual assault, are set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday morning.Pelosi said Republicans are acting like the hearing is  not in the interest of the truth  and added that  in an act of cowardice,  the  Republican no offense, all-male committee has decided that they would have what they call what, a hired woman, is that what the expression they used? A hired woman to ask the questions. Pelosi later said that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s (R-KY)  term of art  was  female assistant,  which refers to Rachel Mitchell, the Arizona prosecutor Senate Republicans hired to ask some questions on Thursday morning.Pelosi also said that women who have come forward with allegations of sexual assault/misconduct against Kavanaugh have been  violated  many different times throughout the process.Pelosi said that the first violation is the  physical violation that happened  and the second  is the invasion of privacy and assault on the person who comes forward.  Dr. Blasey Ford has had two two assaults one personal and an assault on her family s privacy,  Pelosi said.  This has a chilling effect on people coming forward it took great courage for her to come forward. Pelosi then claimed that the  third assault is the assault by the cowardice of the Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee to act in the manner,  which she said  does not serve justice, does not serve seeking the truth, does not serve the integrity of the court, and does not serve the respect for women in this country.
 Three attacks,  she reiterated.Pelosi then briefly referred to Kavanaugh as  Justice Kavanaugh  before quickly correcting herself and calling on  Judge Kavanaugh  to  withdraw his name. She said she hoped that  Justice Kavanaugh judge, not to be iustice Judge Kavanauigh will withdraw his name. Pelosi added that  because unless he goes before the committee and tells the truth he not only jeopardizes his appointment to the Supreme Court, he jeopardizes by lying to Congress the position he holds now. Pelosi continued:  Do the right thing for our country and for the Republicans, quite frankly: End this thing.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/full-text-christine-blasey-fords-prepared-senate-testimony/","The following statement is Christine Blasey Ford s prepared written testimony, which the California psychology professor who brought forth an allegation of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, will deliver in a Thursday Senate Judiciary Committee hearing:Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, Members of the Committee. My name is Christine Blasey Ford. I am a Professor of Psychology at Palo Alto University and a Research Psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine.I was an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina and earned my degree in Experimental Psychology in 1988. I received a Master s degree in 1991 in Clinical Psychology from Pepperdine University. In 1996, I received a PhD in Educational Psychology from the University of Southern California. I earned a Master s degree in Epidemiology from the Stanford University School of Medicine in 2009.I have been married to Russell Ford since 2002 and we have two children.I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school. I have described the events publicly before. I summarized them in my letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, and again in my letter to Chairman Grassley. I understand and appreciate the importance of your hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact it has had on my life and on my family.I grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. I attended the Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland, from 1980 to 1984. Holton-Arms is an all-girls school that opened in 1901. During my time at the school, girls at Holton-Arms frequently met and became friendly with boys from all-boys schools in the area, including Landon School, Georgetown Prep, Gonzaga High School, country clubs, and other places where kids and their families socialized. This is how I met Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me.In my freshman and sophomore school years, when I was 14 and 15 years old, my group of friends intersected with Brett and his friends for a short period of time. I had been friendly with a classmate of Brett s for a short time during my freshman year, and it was through that connection that I attended a number of parties that Brett also attended. We did not know each other well, but I knew him and he knew me. In the summer of 1982, like most summers, I spent almost every day at the Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase, Maryland swimming and practicing diving.One evening that summer, after a day of swimming at the club, I attended a small gathering at a house in the Chevy Chase/Bethesda area. There were four boys I remember being there: Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, P.J. Smyth, and one other boy whose name I cannot recall. I remember my friend Leland Ingham attending. I do not remember all of the details of how that gathering came together, but like many that summer, it was almost surely a spur of the moment gathering. I truly wish I could provide detailed answers to all of the questions that have been and will be asked about how I got to the party, where it took place, and so forth. I don t have all the answers, and I don t remember as much as I would like to. But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult.When I got to the small gathering, people were drinking beer in a small living room on the first floor of the house. I drank one beer that evening. Brett and Mark were visibly drunk. Early in the evening, I went up a narrow set of stairs leading from the living room to a second floor to use the bathroom. When I got to the top of the stairs, I was pushed from behind into a bedroom. I couldn t see who pushed me. Brett and Mark came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them. There was music already playing in the bedroom. It was turned up louder by either Brett or Mark once we were in the room. I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on top of me. He began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me. I yelled, hoping someone downstairs might hear me, and tried to get away from him, but his weight was heavy. Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because he was so drunk, and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes. I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me. Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack. They both seemed to be having a good time. Mark was urging Brett on, although at times he told Brett to stop. A couple of times I made eye contact with Mark and thought he might try to help me, but he did not.During this assault, Mark came over and jumped on the bed twice while Brett was on top of me. The last time he did this, we toppled over and Brett was no longer on top of me. I was able to get up and run out of the room. Directly across from the bedroom was a small bathroom. I ran inside the bathroom and locked the door. I heard Brett and Mark leave the bedroom laughing and loudly walk down the narrow stairs, pin-balling off the walls on the way down. I waited and when I did not hear them come back up the stairs, I left the bathroom, ran down the stairs, through the living room, and left the house. I remember being on the street and feeling an enormous sense of relief that I had escaped from the house and that Brett and Mark were not coming after me.Brett s assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details. I did not want to tell my parents that I, at age 15, was in a house without any parents present, drinking beer with boys. I tried to convince myself that because Brett did not rape me, I should be able to move on and just pretend that it had never happened. Over the years, I told very few friends that I had this traumatic experience. I told my husband before we were married that I had experienced a sexual assault. I had never told the details to anyone until May 2012, during a couples counseling session. The reason this came up in counseling is that my husband and I had completed an extensive remodel of our home, and I insisted on a second front door, an idea that he and others disagreed with and could not understand. In explaining why I wanted to have a second front door, I described the assault in detail. I recall saying that the boy who assaulted me could someday be on the U.S. Supreme Court and spoke a bit about his background. My husband recalls that I named my attacker as Brett Kavanaugh.After that May 2012 therapy session, I did my best to suppress memories of the assault because recounting the details caused me to relive the experience, and caused panic attacks and anxiety. Occasionally I would discuss the assault in individual therapy, but talking about it caused me to relive the trauma, so I tried not to think about it or discuss it. But over the years, I went through periods where I thought about Brett s attack. I confided in some close friends that I had an experience with sexual assault. Occasionally I stated that my assailant was a prominent lawyer or judge but I did not use his name. I do not recall each person I spoke to about Brett s assault, and some friends have reminded me of these conversations since the publication of The Washington Post story on September 16, 2018. But until July 2018, I had never named Mr. Kavanaugh as my attacker outside of therapy.This all changed in early July 2018. I saw press reports stating that Brett Kavanaugh was on the  short list  of potential Supreme Court nominees. I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh s conduct so that those considering his potential nomination would know about the assault.
On July 6, 2018, I had a sense of urgency to relay the information to the Senate and the President as soon as possible before a nominee was selected. I called my congressional representative and let her receptionist know that someone on the President s shortlist had attacked me. I also sent a message to The Washington Post s confidential tip line. I did not use my name, but I provided the names of Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. I stated that Mr. Kavanaugh had assaulted me in the 1980s in Maryland. This was an extremely hard thing for me to do, but I felt I couldn t NOT do it. Over the next two days, I told a couple of close friends on the beach in California that Mr.Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted me. I was conflicted about whether to speak out.On July 9, 2018, I received a call from the office of Congresswoman Anna Eshoo after Mr. Kavanaugh had become the nominee. I met with her staff on July 11 and with her on July 13, describing the assault and discussing my fear about coming forward. Later, we discussed the possibility of sending a letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, who is one of my state s Senators, describing what occurred. My understanding is that Representative Eshoo s office delivered a copy of my letter to Senator Feinstein s office on July 30, 2018. The letter included my name, but requested that the letter be kept confidential.My hope was that providing the information confidentially would be sufficient to allow the Senate to consider Mr. Kavanaugh s serious misconduct without having to make myself, my family, or anyone s family vulnerable to the personal attacks and invasions of privacy we have faced since my name became public. In a letter on August 31, 2018, Senator Feinstein wrote that she would not share the letter without my consent. I greatly appreciated this commitment. All sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves whether their private experience is made public.As the hearing date got closer, I struggled with a terrible choice: Do I share the facts with the Senate and put myself and my family in the public spotlight? Or do I preserve our privacy and allow the Senate to make its decision on Mr. Kavanaugh s nomination without knowing the full truth about his past behavior?I agonized daily with this decision throughout August and early September 2018. The sense of duty that motivated me to reach out confidentially to The Washington Post, Representative Eshoo s office, and Senator Feinstein s office was always there, but my fears of the consequences of speaking out started to increase.During August 2018, the press reported that Mr. Kavanaugh s confirmation was virtually certain. His allies painted him as a champion of women s rights and empowerment. I believed that if I came forward, my voice would be drowned out by a chorus of powerful supporters. By the time of the confirmation hearings, I had resigned myself to remaining quiet and letting the Committee and the Senate make their decision without knowing what Mr. Kavanaugh had done to me.Once the press started reporting on the existence of the letter I had sent to Senator Feinstein, I faced mounting pressure. Reporters appeared at my home and at my job demanding information about this letter, including in the presence of my graduate students. They called my boss and co- workers and left me many messages, making it clear that my name would inevitably be released to the media. I decided to speak out publicly to a journalist who had responded to the tip I had sent to The Washington Post and who had gained my trust. It was important to me to describe the details of the assault in my own words.Since September 16, the date of The Washington Post story, I have experienced an outpouring of support from people in every state of this country. Thousands of people who have had their lives dramatically altered by sexual violence have reached out to share their own experiences with me and have thanked me for coming forward. We have received tremendous support from friends and our community.At the same time, my greatest fears have been realized   and the reality has been far worse than what I expected. My family and I have been the target of constant harassment and death threats. I have been called the most vile and hateful names imaginable. These messages, while far fewer than the expressions of support, have been terrifying to receive and have rocked me to my core. People have posted my personal information on the internet. This has resulted in additional emails, calls, and threats. My family and I were forced to move out of our home. Since September 16, my family and I have been living in various secure locales, with guards. This past Tuesday evening, my work email account was hacked and messages were sent out supposedly recanting my description of the sexual assault.Apart from the assault itself, these last couple of weeks have been the hardest of my life. I have had to relive my trauma in front of the entire world, and have seen my life picked apart by people on television, in the media, and in this body who have never met me or spoken with me. I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives. Those who say that do not know me. I am a fiercely independent person and I am no one s pawn. My motivation in coming forward was to provide the facts about how Mr. Kavanaugh s actions have damaged my life, so that you can take that into serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed. It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court. My responsibility is to tell the truth.I understand that the Majority has hired a professional prosecutor to ask me some questions, and I am committed to doing my very best to answer them. At the same time, because the Committee Members will be judging my credibility, I hope to be able to engage directly with each of you.
At this point, I will do my best to answer your questions.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/planned-parenthood-fundraises-off-kavanaugh-accuser-julie-swetnick/","Planned Parenthood sent out an email fundraiser letter to supporters Wednesday announcing that a third woman, Julie Swetnick, is accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Enough is enough: Kavanaugh must withdraw now,  writes Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in an email made available to Breitbart News.She continues:Moving forward with Kavanaugh s nomination at this point would be irresponsible and dangerous. It tells survivors of sexual assault that they don t matter. It tells the public that one man s promotion matters more than the safety of multiple women. And it sends a message that partisan politics trumps not only fairness, but basic human compassion.Speak out now: This nomination is a disgrace. Brett Kavanaugh must withdraw. [T]ogether, funneling our hurt and our anger into action, we ll stop this nomination from going any further,  Laguens adds.The fundraising letter comes with a  trigger warning  as well:  This message includes information about sexual assault. If you are finding it difficult to hear about sexual violence in the media and online, remember to take care of yourself. Questions, however, arose quickly about Swetnick s accusations after it was discovered that she would have been a college student during the period of time she claims Kavanaugh was  present  at gang rapes during high school parties.Breitbart News reported:On Wednesday morning, Michael Avenatti, the aspiring presidential candidate and lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, released a sworn affidavit from Swetnick in which she claimed to have met Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge in  approximately 1980-1981. She then went on to claim that in 1981-82, she  became aware of efforts  by Kavanaugh, Judge, and others to  spike  the punch  at house parties I attended  with the intent of incapacitating a girl who could then be gang raped. She said she witnessed Kavanaugh and Judge lining up outside a room waiting for their  turn.  She also said that in 1982, she was a victim of such gang rape, while drugged, with Kavanaugh and Judge  present. However, according to her resumé, Swetnick graduated from Gaithersburg High School in 1980 prior to attending the University of Maryland. Kavanaugh graduated from Georgetown Prep in 1983. These details indicate Swetnick would have known Kavanaugh while she was 17 or 18, and he was 15 or 16 years old and that she was attending high school parties while she was a college student.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/kavanaugh-twilight-zone-interview-transcript-unveiled/","The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday released a lightly redacted copy of the transcript of Monday s conference call between Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and committee staff.The call, conducted under threat of criminal penalty for lying, reveals an exasperated Kavanaugh countering accusation after accusation, likening his situation to an episode of The Twilight Zone.The transcript reveals previously unknown details and one heretofore unrevealed accusation involving Kavanaugh and a man, suggested to be Mark Judge, sexually assaulting a woman on a boat off the coast of Newport, Rhode Island, in 1985, only to be confronted the next morning by two men who then severely beat Kavanaugh and Judge.This new fifth accuser, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee staffer on the call, conveyed his allegations by telephone on Monday to Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). The staffer then read Whitehouse s office s report over the phone:Senator Whitehouse received a call this morning from a Rhode Island constituent, [REDACTED], who made allegations regarding U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. [REDACTED] reported that early on a Sunday morning in August of 1985, a close acquaintance of the constituent was sexually assaulted by two heavily inebriated men she referred to at the time as Brett and Mark.The event took place on a 36-foot maroon and white boat in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island, after the three had met at a local bar. According to [REDACTED], when he learned of the assault at approximately 5:00 a.m. that same morning, he and another individual went to the harbor, located the boat the victim had described and physically confronted the two men, leaving them with significant injuries.[REDACTED] recently realized that one of the men was Brett Kavanaugh when he saw Kavanaugh s high school yearbook photo on television over the weekend. He promptly reported the incident to our office on Monday morning, September 24, 2018.The newest accuser s name is left redacted in the transcript, but reporters quickly identified the Twitter account quoted in the same transcript as making repeated calls for the U.S. military to carry out a coup against President Donald Trump. The Twitter account belongs to a man named Jeffrey Catalan. As Fox News s Alex Pfeiffer pointed out, the same account also suggested Donald Trump killed someone in 1983:https://twitter.com/PfeifferDC/status/1045096733926203392As reporters began to swarm the Catalan account, it appeared to withdraw his claims of having beaten Kavanaugh up for raping someone, saying,  Do [sic] everyone who is going crazy about what I had said I have recanted because I have made a mistake and apologize for such mistake :Do everyone who is going crazy about what I had said I have recanted because I have made a mistake and apologize for such mistake  Jeffrey Catalan (@JeffreyCatala16) September 26, 2018On Monday, days before this apparent retraction, Kavanaugh categorically denied Catalan s accusation, saying,  I was not in Newport, haven t been on a boat in Newport. Not with Mark Judge on a boat, nor all those three things combined. This is just completely made up, or at least not me. I don t know what they re referring to. Also first unveiled in the transcript are new details of the fourth accusation, an anonymous letter alleging Kavanaugh  shoved  the writer s daughter s friend  up against the wall very aggressively and sexually  after leaving a bar together in 1998. The letter is revealed to have originated in Denver, Colorado. The unnamed daughter is supposedly from Boulder, Colorado. And Kavanaugh is said to have been  dating  the women he shoved. [W]e re dealing with an anonymous letter about an anonymous person and an anonymous friend. It s ridiculous. Total twilight zone. And no, I ve never done anything like that,  Kavanaugh responded.When a staffer asked Kavanaugh about dating the unnamed woman in the letter, Kavanaugh pointed out that the accusation provides nothing that could identify the woman in question in the following exchange:Staffer: While you were involved in the Starr investigation, do you recall ever dating a woman who would fairly fit the description in the letter provided to Senator [Cory] Gardner [(R-CO)]? The anonymous letter.Judge Kavanaugh: What s the description?Staffer: Just based on what I  Judge Kavanaugh: Describe her appearance.Staffer: No, it s   all we have is what I read.Judge Kavanaugh: Well, then I don t know what I m responding to then.In his most in-depth answers so far revealed about his second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, Kavanaugh again denied having exposed himself to her in a drunken dormitory common room party his freshman year of college. He acknowledges the two knew each other in college, describing their relationship as  friendly, but not friends.  Kavanaugh s confirmed the two had seen each since college, most recently at a mutual classmate s wedding, where, as Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer s New Yorker story noted, she did not mention the alleged incident and posed  smiling  in photographs with Kavanaugh. I m sure I saw her because it wasn t a huge wedding. And at any wedding, you would see the people that you went to school with. But I don t have a specific recollection,  Kavanaugh said.James Roche, Kavanaugh s freshman roommate   who told reporters that Kavanaugh was an excessive drinker and that he believed Ramirez, who was a close college friend, despite having no recollection of such an incident   also came up in the questioning. Kavanaugh claimed Roche, who then went by Jamie,  hated  their third roommate, Dave White:Jamie and Dave White hated each other. They got in fights, fist fights during the year. One time Dave White was away for the weekend. Jamie   when he came back, Jamie had moved all Dave White s furniture, everything, like into some other area of Lawrence Hall in a hallway.He continued:I was friends with Dave White more than Jamie. I tried to be civil. Jamie wasn t around a lot. I don t know, I think his parents lived nearby, and so he was elsewhere or with a girl, I don t know, a woman at Yale. [REDACTED] He didn t hang out with us very much, wasn t a great situation.The transcript also includes extensive questioning about Kavanaugh s high school yearbook that anti-trump activist and attorney Michael Avenatti has claimed contains secret codes about sexually assaulting girls. In one exchange, Kavanaugh explained that  devil s triangle  referred to a drinking game he d played in high school, not, as Avenatti claimed, a lewd sex act. Asked why he included the reference, Kavanaugh responded,  I don t know. We were 17. Kavanaugh s first use of the phrase  twilight zone,  which he also used in response to Avenatti s client Julie Swetnick s claims, occurs when discussing how  outraged  he is by the New Yorker/Deborah Ramirez story:The New York Times says as recently as last week, she  was calling around to other classmates saying she wasn t sure I had done this. And you know, I think   I think we re   this is an outrage for this kind of thin, uncorroborated, 35-year-old accusation to be leveled in this fashion at this time. I ve been in the public eye for 24 years, since I started with the independent counsel in the fall of 1994, very public at various points in my life. I ve been through six background checks. I worked in the White House at the highest levels, senior staff, traveling with the President all over the world, seeing the most highly sensitive secrets of our Nation for years. I went through a difficult confirmation process for the D.C. Circuit that was public with two separate confirmation hearings in 2004 and 2006.I ve been a judge for 12 years in a very public way. I ve been identified repeatedly as a potential Supreme Court nominee. Whether that was accurate or not, I ve been publicly identified. My decisions have been publicly discussed. I ve been very much a presence at the Yale College reunions. I ve been on multiple panels there. So I ve been active in the class. The class newsletter has talked about me. The people in my class have been at those reunions and those events.In all that time, not a word. And then 4 days, you know, when just right before a vote for the Supreme Court, after the nomination itself has been pending for months,  and I ve been through the hearings and 65 Senate meetings and all the written questions, and then   and then, after all these years, with all this time, and all these descriptions with no corroboration and with her best friend saying she never heard about it, you know, I m   I m really just, you know, stunned. And outraged.It s the twilight zone. I guess we re going to get to a few more of these twilight zone thingsKavanaugh will testify in an open hearing Thursday morning to answer allegations from his first accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.

After Gillibrand stated the FBI should do a complete background check on Kavanaugh in light of the accusations against him, anchor Chris Cuomo asked,  [A]re you open to changing your mind? Gillibrand answered,  Based on everything I have heard to date, no. And before these allegations came to light, I thought Judge Kavanaugh s record was disqualifying. His view on women s rights, the fact that he doesn t see women s reproductive freedom anywhere in the Constitution, the fact that he believes insurers have more free speech rights than you and I, if you have a preexisting condition, they should be able to charge you whatever they want, the fact that he believes my boss should decide whether I have access to contraception, all of those things, to me, are disqualifying. Because his views are so far outside the mainstream, so conservative, that I can t imagine him being a force for good on the court, and I can t imagine him actually having the kind of judicial character that is necessary to be a justice on the Supreme Court. Then you just add to that all these allegations. So, no, whatever he says tomorrow, it will not change my view. And I ve already read Dr. Blasey Ford s testimony and I believe her.

Cory Gardner (R-CO) an anonymous letter claiming her daughter told her Kavanaugh had shoved her friend against a wall while drinking in Washington, DC, in 1998.NBC News cites the letter and Judiciary Committee staff in reporting that the anonymous letter-writer claimed her daughter was out drinking with Kavanaugh and  several friends  20 years ago in Washington. After the group left the bar, the letter claims,  they were all shocked when Brett Kavanaugh shoved her friend up against the wall very aggressively and sexually. None of the alleged participants are named, but the letter claims,  There were at least four witnesses including my daughter. The unnamed victim is purported to be too traumatized, 20 years after having been pushed against a wall, to talk about the incident. It is unclear from NBC s report how the letter writer came to the conclusion the victim is traumatized.According to NBC News,  A Democratic source said the minority wasn t satisfied by the Republicans  questions about the incident during the call, calling them cursory, and believed it should be investigated more deeply. As with the other decades old allegations against Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee reportedly promptly denied the letter s claims, under threat of criminal penalty, in a call with committee staff.It is unclear if this latest accusation will feature in Thursday s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with the accuser who initially derailed Kavanaugh s confirmation schedule, California professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of having groped her at a high school party in the early 1980s.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/dershowitz-third-brett-kavanaugh-accuser-does-not-ring-true/","Harvard Law School emeritus professor and celebrated defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz told Breitbart News on Wednesday evening that the affidavit by Julie Swetnick, the third woman to accuse Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in high school,  does not ring true. Swetnick presented a sworn affidavit on Wednesday through her lawyer, Michael Avenatti   who is also representing porn star Stormy Daniels in her litigation against President Donald Trump, and is exploring a presidential run in 2020 himself. Any reasonably competent [defense] attorney could demolish her affidavit,  Dershowitz said, noting that Swetnick had not explained what she meant when she alleged that Kavanaugh was  present  at her gang rape.He also said that she had failed to explain why, if she had witnessed multiple gang rapes at parties among Kavanaugh s friends in Maryland, she had kept going back to the parties.The affidavit looked as if it had been prepared in haste, Dershowitz said, as Avenatti likely realized he needed to publish it before Thursday s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee if it were to have any impact on the confirmation process.(Kavanaugh is scheduled to testify, along with the first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, whose claims have not been corroborated by any of the eyewitnesses she named.)Swetnick had mentioned two eyewitnesses, Dershowitz noted, but had not named them.  Any lawyer should have been embarrassed to submit an affidavit like that. He criticized the Republican majority on the judiciary committee, however, for selecting Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell to lead questioning on Thursday. They should have named a defense attorney instead, he argued. What does a prosecutor know about cross-examintion? A prosecutor puts on a case. Joel B.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/mark-walters-guns/","As America watches the Democratic Party s machine attempt to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaugh s reputation, the tactics employed by the left are on full display.Those tactics have included withholding information from the Committee Chair and the American people, subverting the hearing process with frequent outbursts from themselves and outside protest groups, smearing the nominee with falsified quotes, and other disruptions of the committee hearing process. All of this is designed to defy the President whom American voters chose in 2016; a President many chose for the express purpose of keeping the Supreme Court from being infiltrated by the leftists we are now watching smear a good man and his family.So I ask you, what does this confirmation process have to do with guns and the future of our right to bear arms besides the obvious expected pro-gun votes from the nominee himself should he be confirmed? Ask yourself that question the next time you hear a Democrat politician or leftist gun-prohibitionist say that they do not want to destroy the Second Amendment nor do they want to take away our guns. To believe that, you would also have to believe the party of gun-control currently destroying the reputation of Judge Kavanaugh would not be willing use the same underhanded techniques against those of us in the gun-owning community.For example, we would have to assume they were not capable of making up phony names such as  assault rifles,  and lying about their use or of demonizing millions of law-abiding Americans by attacking the National Rifle Association as murderers. We would be have to be willing to accept that they would not possibly use false statistics and lump suicide numbers in with actual homicidesin an efforts to pump up crime statisticsor exaggerate the number of  mass shootings  in an attempt to ban our rights and the guns we choose for self-defense. We might even have to believe this group of Democrats would not dare tell us their goal is  gun safety  rather than gun control.But the problem is that Democrats and their leftist supporters are already calling our commonly owned firearms  assault rifles,  exaggerating the number of mass shootings, and pawning off their entire gun control agenda as a push for gun safety. Because of this, the confirmation process Kavanaugh has faced stands as stark reminder of what law-abiding gun owners can expect should the Democrats regain control of the House and Senate in November.Mark Walters is the host of Armed American Radio and a guest columnist for  Down Range with AWR Hawkins.

It s amazing to me that these type of things have come up way after the fact, way after the end of the committee hearings and everything else,  Hatch said in a statement.  It shows that there are people who would stop at nothing.  I don t think it s fair to Brett Kavanaugh, I don t think it s fair to our system, I don t think it s fair to the process,  Hatch said.  I don t think we should put up with it, to be honest. Christine Blasey Ford delivered a letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) in July claiming Kavanaugh groped her at a high school party, but Feinstein did not make the letter public until after the confirmation hearings.Feinstein also never brought the subject up when she met with Kavanaugh.Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick have also come forward, each with worsening accusations of Kavanaugh exposing himself and drugging women s drinks and participating in multiple  gang rapes,  respectively.The Senate Judiciary Committee, which has scheduled a vote on Kavanaugh for Friday, is set to hear from Ford at a hearing on Thursday.

You have three women here who are all making allegations, who are all asking that their stories be heard. And, you know, if you look at the case of Roy Moore, if you look at the case of one of your staffers, you seem to time and again side with the accused and not the accuser. Is that because of the many allegations that you ve had made against you over the years?Trump replied:Well, first of all, I wasn t happy with Roy Moore. Let s get that straight. But, Roy Moore was aRepublican candidate. And I would have rather had a Republican candidate win. I was very happy with Luther Strange. He was a terrific man from Alabama, but Luther Strange had a lot of things going against him. As far as women, whether it s a man or a woman, these areyou know, it can happen the other way. Allegations can go the other way alsoyou understand that. And, whether it was a man or a woman, 30 years ago, 36 years agoin fact, they don t even know how many years ago, because nobody knows what the time is. That s a long time, and I could pick, as an example, hopefully I won t have to do it as a replacement, because hopefully this is going to go very well on Thursday.

But I guess the question that Beth Wilkinson, Kavanaugh s attorney, is asking, why don t you and your client go to the police, presumably Montgomery County police or D.C. police?AVENATTI: Well, we are certainly considering that, Jake, as of this moment. But look, this is a distraction by counsel for Mr. Kavanaugh. Let me ask you this question. We ve offered to have my client take a polygraph examination. Why won t Brett Kavanaugh take a polygraph examination? Why won t Brett Kavanaugh allow his close friend, Mark Judge, who is very knowledgeable about what happened, very knowledgeable about these allegations. Why are they hiding Mark Judge from the American people and the Senate Judiciary Committee? Why won t they bring him in to testify truthfully? We want look, Jake, I want to be really clear about something. We want all of this aired and we want it aired publicly. And we want the American people to be able to decide who is lying and who is telling the truth. This should not be decided by a bunch of white privileged guys that are basically shaming sexual abuse victims.TAPPER: So you re willing your client would be willing to testify publicly about her charges before the Senate committee?AVENATTI: Yes, absolutely. But we believe first, the first step should be a full FBI investigation. Jake, let me ask you this question. Why is it that when the most heinous crimes appear or occur, I should say, on U.S. soil, whether it be 9/11 or Timothy McVeigh or the Unabomber, the FBI investigates in those instances. Why are the Senate Judiciary Committee and Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump afraid to afraid to have the FBI investigate these allegations?TAPPER: I m taking no position on it, but you haven t taken these allegations to local law enforcement, which seems like a reasonable thing to do, as far as I know. I m under the impression there is no statute of limitation for rape in Montgomery County, Maryland. So that is something you could do. You say you re considering it. I want to ask you about your client s sworn declaration. She details a horrific assault, saying, quote, in approximately 1982, I became the victim of one of these gang or train rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present. Now she didn t specifically say that Kavanaugh was one of the attackers. Is your client claiming that Kavanaugh raped her?AVENATTI: I m not going to have any further comment on that specific allegation. She s going to detail that for the FBI and hopefully for the Senate Judiciary Committee, ultimately, in a public hearing. But I m not going to provide any  TAPPER: That s a pretty big thing to hang out there. Are you saying Kavanaugh was present? That Kavanaugh was present in the room? He was in the line? He was in the party? I mean, just to say he was present is a really egregious lack of specificity when you re talking about charges this horrific. And I m not saying that I don t believe them. I m just saying, what exactly are you saying, or is she saying, that he did?AVENATTI: Jake, I disagree completely with what you just said. Let me be clear about something. This is not my declaration. These are statements by my client. These are her statements about what happened, and let s just eliminate that paragraph from the declaration, in its entirety, just for the sake of argument. Do you mean to tell me that the balance of the declaration still permits him to be sworn in as a sitting Supreme Court justice? No, it does not. The conduct that is littered throughout this declaration is outrageous. There are plenty of men and women in the United States that serve as attorneys and judges that don t have this kind of conduct in their background.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

I think she has known about this for a while, supposedly, and so has Mr. Avenatti. He waved this on some of your programs since last weekend and said he knew about it and he never went to the police. As an attorney, I know what my obligation is. It s to my client. And if I had represented her, it would have been my duty to go to the police immediately and report this. If this is true, it is a horrible thing. There s nothing that could have stopped Mr. Avenatti from going to the FBI or the police to start an investigation on his own. As far as I can tell from reading this, that wasn t done.TUR: All the women who have accused your client of misconduct have one similar thing in common. They all say he drank to excess. There are other folks out there from his high school years and from his college years who say the same thing, he drank to excess. Your client also admits he did at some times have a few too many beers. If that s the case and if there s a potential out there for him being black out drunk or very drunk, how is he confident of his memories?WILKINSON: First of all, almost every high school and college student could be accused of the same thing or have done, had drinks, had too many drinks. That s not the same as being black out drunk and not remembering this. He knows that he didn t know this woman. She s not saying it s once. She s saying it s over two years. This wasn t a one time thing. That s the same with the other two women. All the people who are supposedly there in those instances have said it didn t happen or they don t have any recollection. There s not one person who is saying they were there. In each of the incidents there s groups of people that were identified as present. That s not typical in these allegations. Normally it s one man and one woman and it s hard to determine. Here, especially in the most recent outrageous allegation, there s scores of people involved for years.TUR: Why is your client not demanding an FBI investigation to get to the bottom of this?WILKINSON: He didn t know about this until it came out today. Mr. Avenatti has had this information for weeks.TUR: Is he now demanding an FBI investigation?WILKINSON: He knows he didn t do it.TUR: Why doesn t he want an FBI investigation? If there s multiple people who can go on the record or go under oath or be interviewed by the FB, why would he not want the FBI to get involved?WILKINSON: Thankfully our system doesn t work the way you re suggesting.TUR: This is a job interview. It s two different things.WILKINSON: It s out here in the public opinion and what you re doing is a perfect example. You re claiming because he was drinking, he must have done it.TUR: I asked you about his memory. Don t put words in my mouth. I asked if he was confident of his memories. That s all I asked.WILKINSON: I heard your last session and you were saying there s so much detail. There s no detail in here. There s no place. There s one or two years generally. There s no other people. There s no dates. There s no times. There s no information. There are multiple people supposedly involved within several years, not just her. She saw other women being gang raped and it s never been reported. I don t know what the lawyer did and I feel sorry for her for getting dragged into this and any other woman getting dragged into it but that doesn t mean the accusations are true. This is a horrible commentary on our process this is what we re putting people through who wants to be in public service. It s important to treat everybody in the process with dignity and giving them the presumption of innocence whether you re inside a courtroom or outside.TUR: Let me read you something the president said about this this morning. You don t find people like this. He s outstanding. He s a gem and he s being treated unfairly by the Democrats who are playing a con game. They laugh at what they are getting away with.  Does your client believe it s a con game by the Democrats? That these women are part of a con by the Democrats and that the Democrats are laughing in a back room about what they are able to pull off?WILKINSON:  My client knows that he didn t do this. He s not speculating about all those things. What he knows is all of his friends and family all say this isn t like him. Nobody corroborates one of these allegations that they saw this happen or were in the room. Even the lady who knows Dr. Blasey and was friendly with her and was in the same party says she s never met Judge Kavanaugh. He s not speculating about the politics. What he s telling you is what he knows. He did not do this.TUR: Does your client believe any of the accusers against the president?WILKINSON: Does he what?TUR: Does he believe any of the women who came out and accused the president of sexual misconduct?WILKINSON: I don t know what that has to do with this. I ve never discussed that with him. We re talking about what s happening here. I came today to be on your program to tell you what he believes and what we know. That s it. I m not here to make political arguments and comment on what the president said or didn t say. The point is someone is making these outrageous allegations about him with no detail over multiple years with multiple people and he s telling you he did none of it. He doesn t know her. I ve had people call me and email me saying they know him. They ve never met her. They ve never seen her and never heard of any of these allegations. I ve got to believe if this was happening over two years someone else would have heard about it and reported it. Not the day before the hearing. He s had an entire hearing, a background investigation, none of these people, including Mr. Avenatti s client, came forward until the day before the hearing.TUR: Does he believe Dr. Ford is lying?WILKINSON: He doesn t believe anyone is lying or not lying. All he can say is what he knows. He did not do this. He s never engaged in that behavior. He was a normal kid. He played sports. He was a good student. He drank beers and sometimes he said things he regrets and cringes at, like all of us. But that is very different than saying did you engage in a sexual assault. Absolutely not. He did not do that.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/obama-era-campus-sexual-misconduct-rules-national-stage-kavanaugh/","The plight of Brett Kavanaugh  presumed guilty of sexual misconduct based solely on a woman s accusation and without due process  has been experienced by many young men on college campuses since the Obama administration utilized Title IX to enact its campus sexual assault policies. What has been happening to young men on college campuses is now playing out on the national stage with Judge Kavanaugh,  retired university administrator Patricia Daugherty told Breitbart News.  Incredible money and training  have gone into efforts to immediately side with the accuser, with little to no interest in due process for the accused. The fever pitch we see on the news has been nurtured in college. The Trump administration s anticipated new rules reversing the Obama-era policies are, in fact, causing a feminist meltdown.At The Mary Sue, Chelsea Steiner warned that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos  wants to protect everyone involved in sexual misconduct EXCEPT the victims.  The education secretary, who has endorsed a policy of using mediation to reach informal resolutions in cases of campus assault, wants to allow victims and their accused perpetrators to request any evidence they want from each other,  Steiner said, explaining her alarm.  In addition, victims and perpetrators would be able to cross-examine each other during the mediation. Daugherty, who currently is president of Eagle Forum of Georgia, said parents  concerns for their sons on college campuses are  completely rational in this climate.  We are doing a terrible disservice to young men and also to young women by encouraging such emotional, fear-based atmospheres,  she added.In September 2017, DeVos announced the Trump administration would be scrapping the Obama administration s policies regarding cases of sexual misconduct on college campuses. DeVos stressed in a new  interim Q & A  that all students must be protected from discrimination in school proceedings to investigate sexual assault allegations.In her announcement, DeVos cited cases of students, nearly all male, who were either expelled or punished in some other manner after being accused of actions which were never proven. Instead of working with schools,  DeVos said,  the prior administration weaponized the Office for Civil Rights. The Trump administration s proposed new rules were leaked to the New York Times at the end of August. While Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said the information leaked to the Times  is premature and speculative,  the newspaper reported the rules  narrow the definition of sexual harassment, holding schools accountable only for formal complaints filed through proper authorities and for conduct said to have occurred on their campuses. Many college and university officials have said they will ignore the new campus rules put forward by the Trump administration.Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro  now known for releasing a grand jury report alleging at least 1,000 children were sexually abused by Roman Catholic clergy in his state over 70 years  condemned the Trump administration s decision to scrap the Obama-era sexual misconduct policies.Shapiro said reversing the Obama administration s policies  threaten to make college campuses less safe, not more safe.  We made important strides over the last years of the Obama administration when it comes to Title IX issues,  Shapiro said, according to TribLive.  And the idea that Secretary Betsy DeVos would want to roll back those Title IX (civil rights) protections is something that does not sit well with me.  I have all the confidence in the world in our university leaders of Pennsylvania,  Shapiro added.  They ll fill the gap created by the Trump administration s wrong-headed policies. Joy Pullmann, executive editor at the Federalist, told Breitbart News the ideology behind the implementation of the Obama-era policies on campuses sparked the fire that has spread across the nation. It has always been true but is now becoming obvious to more Americans that what happens on campuses does not stay on campuses, or only affect the minority of Americans with college degrees,  she explained.  U.S. colleges and universities create the ideas, atmosphere, and policies that affect the nation, plus the nation s taxpayers underwrite the bulk of our elite s credentials through these institutions, and this is why everyone should care and raise his or her voice about what happens there.  Obama s Title IX rules that amped up campus kangaroo courts were quite clearly a test run of the kind of sexist mob attacks they want to bring to the entire culture,  Pullmann added.  The effects are to degrade society by degrading justice itself, by reducing it to identity politics rather than the truth of what happened. Daugherty said while she is encouraged by the Trump administration s plans to reverse the Obama Title IX policy, she anticipates a continued battle. That in itself won t change the emphasis on today s college campuses,  she warned.  Way too many faculty and administrators are devoted to far-left political ideologies, and they are teaching these ideologies to their students every day. Parents of sons may continue to have reason to be concerned that liberal university pushback against the Trump administration s new rules will still place young men, in particular, in danger of false accusations with minimal recourse. Parents need to teach their sons to treat everyone with respect and dignity, but their sons can t be naïve,  Daugherty said.  I don t want them to be suspicious of all women, of course, but they need to be aware of not getting into situations that might come back to haunt them. Writing at the Federalist, Melissa Danford, an army wife and mother of four boys, said what she is seeing now should stir parents of sons to rise up. I cannot accept a world in which my sons will be raised under the tyranny of a lawless, vindictive society that wants to subdue and oppress men in the name of equality for women,  she said.  The future isn t female; it belongs to both your daughters and my sons. Abandoning the basic standards of the rule of law will not empower women; it will enslave us all. Pullmann agreed it is  quite rational for mothers to wonder whether their sons will be discriminated against simply because of their sex.  Given that we have not only seen high-profile assault hoaxes  such as Columbia s mattress girl  and the UVA Rolling Stone hoax  but also a litany of lower-profile incidents on campuses throughout the country, some of which are being litigated in real courts due to the egregiously unjust outcomes,  she added.The Daily News s editorial board also said due process is exactly what is needed to put an end to the  kangaroo courts  that have erupted on college campuses:Today, the accused have no way to see the evidence against them, no way to appeal. Tomorrow, they are likely to be able to cross-examine accusers, and vice versa.The hands wringing that fair procedures will terrify young women out of reporting serious violations ought to be applauding efforts to make Title IX a credible tool to vindicate victims.Pullmann added traditional sexual morality actually protects both men and women from sexual misconduct allegations and misconduct towards each other. Both men and women should not have sex, or sexually charged interactions, with strangers while drunk,  she asserted.  Even without alcohol, sex without a marital commitment puts both the man and the woman in danger, not only of accusations but of being mistreated sexually by someone who doesn t love them enough to commit to them for life. Pullmann advised parents to explicitly teach their sons  not to trivialize sex, but to regard it, and therefore women, as precious.  Since neither our culture nor most educational institutions will do this   sometimes not even churches   parents must take the task upon themselves all the more if they want to protect both their sons and their daughters from the brutalities of our hookup culture,  she said.

Patty Murray (D-WA) said she was frightened by Republicans calling the allegations against Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh a smear campaign.When asked about attorney Michael Avenatti s client Julie Swetnick s new allegations, Murray said,  I just read it, and it is horrifying. It is important to note that it is an affidavit and she has signed it under perjury or law. So people don t do this randomly. It needs to be investigated, absolutely. But let me step back for a minute and are remind everybody that what we do as a Senate today and how we react to the allegations, and what message we send by how we deal with them is critically important. If the Senate were to swish this aside and dismiss Mrs. Ford and do what the president said, and start to call the allegations of she was drunk, we will send a message to young girls once again as we did in 1991 to be quiet, sit down and don t talk. And what is that message to young boys? Don t worry. You will get away with it. This is serious, and it needs to be taken absolutely with every, you know, things that we can do to make sure that the voices are brought forward and absolutely investigated. This is something that should not be rushed through. It is deeply disturbing me that these Republicans are doing because we can t send the message again. We just cannot. Addressing the Republicans calling all the allegations a smear, Murray said,  The message that this is a smear campaign frightens me as a woman that once again, we are saying to women out there, don t come forward, because you will be accused of smear campaigns., no one is going to believe you. Stop and do the investigations, and obviously, witnesses that can be called from both sides and so that we know that evidence and believe it or not, but have an investigation. To have it rushed through right now is such the wrong thing to do. She added,  I believe that there are responsible Republicans who are going to share the view that it is not just a Supreme Court nominee that is on trial right now. It is the United States Senate in the year of the #MeToo movement. We have the obligation to show this country we a take the allegations seriously, and investigate them absolutely, but that they will be listened to and heard. We are on trial here as well. I plead with the Senate Republicans to take to a breath. Having somebody on the court on October 1st is less important than getting this right. Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/questions-about-julie-swetnick-claims-she-was-in-college-when-brett-kavanaugh-was-in-high-school/","Questions arose Wednesday about claims by Julie Swetnick, the third  accuser  against Brett Kavanaugh, after it was revealed that she would have been in college during the time period she claims he was  present  at gang rapes at high school parties.On Wednesday morning, Michael Avenatti, the aspiring presidential candidate and lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, released a sworn affidavit from Swetnick in which she claimed to have met Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge in  approximately 1980-1981. She then went on to claim that in 1981-82, she  became aware of efforts  by Kavanaugh, Judge, and others to  spike  the punch  at house parties I attended  with the intent of incapacitating a girl who could then be gang raped. She said she witnessed Kavanaugh and Judge lining up outside a room waiting for their  turn.  She also said that in 1982, she was a victim of such gang rape, while drugged, with Kavanaugh and Judge  present. However, according to the New York Times,  Ms. Swetnick grew up in Montgomery County, Md., graduating from Gaithersburg High School in 1980 before attending college at the University of Maryland, according to a résumé for her posted online. Judge Kavanaugh graduated from Georgetown Prep in 1983. That means she would have met Kavanaugh while she was 17 or 18, and he was 15 or 16 years old. It also would mean that she was attending high school parties while in college.So to summarize claims:Swetnick graduated High School in 1980.
In 1982, as a college student, she was attending high-school parties where druggings & gang rapes occurred with regularity.
She went back to those parties 10 times.
She is just now reporting this, 37 years later.
Ok  Benny (@bennyjohnson) September 26, 2018One bit that investigators will focus on (if they ever agree to interview Swetnick) is why she was attending high school parties when she was already in college. https://t.co/keM0MZECIR pic.twitter.com/ZlCWsk7ZQi  Yashar Ali  (@yashar) September 26, 2018To review the Avenatti claim: a woman claims that when she was a college aged adult (graduated high school in 1980), she went to high school parties where high school girls were drugged and raped and she, as the adult present, did nothing but avoid the punch.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/michael-avenatti-stands-gang-rape-smear-kavanaugh/","Michael Avenatti is not backing down from his claim that he has a client who promised to release  detailed allegations  against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh about his participation in gang rapes while he was in high school. I made the determination she was 100 percent credible well before Sunday night,  Avenatti, who also represents porn star Stormy Daniels and was warned by a federal judge that Daniels  defamation suit would be thrown out due to his publicity stunts, told Politico Tuesday. We ve received over 3,000 inquiries in the last six months from people with all kinds of crazy stories and fabrications. I ve heard it all. I ve seen it all. Like we don t vet clients. Give me a break,  he added.Avenatti promised Monday that his client would publicly reveal the allegations against Kavanaugh within 48 hours, shortly before President Trump s Supreme Court nominee is set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he seemed to backtrack on his claim in a Tuesday morning tweet when he hinted that his client might not come forward. Let me be clear: We will disclose the client s name and accusations only when SHE is ready and we have adequate security measures in place. And not a moment before that,  Avenatti tweeted before he locked public access to his Twitter account.  It is her choice and hers alone as to when to surface bc it is her life. We expect it within the next 36 hrs. Avenatti, who has toyed with running for the presidency in 2020 as a Democrat, also asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to investigate quotes in Kavanaugh s high school yearbook to prove the Supreme Court nominee  gang-raped  women.On Sunday, Avenatti sent an email to Mike Davis, chief counsel for Nominations for the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, claiming he had evidence proving Kavanaugh and his high school classmate Mike Judge went to house parties where they  would participate in the targeting of women.  We are aware of significant evidence of multiple house parties in the Washington, D.C. area during the early 1980s during which Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, and others would participate in the targeting of women with alcohol/drugs in order to allow a train  of men to subsequently gang rape them,  Avenatti s email to Davis reads.The 2020 presidential hopeful also released information about a third woman accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, but as with Avenatti s other claims, he has produced no evidence as of Wednesday morning to back them up.Kavanaugh, in response to the allegations against him, publicly stated he was a virgin in high school and for many years after and is willing to say that under oath.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/live-updates-avenatti-circus-throws-brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-into-chaos/","The latest accusations against Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh   brought by Resistance TV lawyer Michael Avenatti, representing a D.C. resident named Julie Swetnick   have caused Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee to push even harder to derail Kavanaugh s confirmation.Follow updates from Breitbart News on the latest developments in the Kavanaugh confirmation battle. All times eastern.Livewire Highlights: Christine Blasey Ford releases polygraph report from her legal team. Details differ from other times she has recounted the story, and it is revealed that it was administered in Maryland   even though she recently delayed testifying before the Senate, citing difficulty with flying across the country from her home in California.
 Michael Avenatti has declined to make his client Julie Swetnick available for media contact. The NYTimes says it is thus unable to corrobate her story.
 Judge Kavanaugh has testified under oath to Senate investigators in response to Swetnick s allegations.
 GOP senators Cotton and Graham declare Swetnick s allegations  not credible,  echo Kavanaugh s  Twilight Zone  characterization.
 President Trump disses Avenatti on Twitter and apparently gets under his skin.
 Jeff Flake trashes Trump for being  uninformed and uncaring  in response to Kavanaugh s accusers   still says he has an open mind and will hear out both parties.
 Avenatti tells CNN s Tapper: He doesn t know if he first heard Swetnick s story before44  or after Ford came forward
 Trump lambastes Democrats in press conference for holding back allegations after confirmation hearings: They know it s a big, fat con job 
 NBC runs with  4th accuser  story an anonymous letter claiming someone s daughter saw Kavanaugh molest another woman in 1998
 Senate Judiciary Committee releases transcript of testimony from Kavanaugh on new(er) accusations took place day before Swetnick came forward11:47 PM   https://twitter.com/BazziNYU/status/104515786115066265611:44 PM   Beyond parody.

And you know, I think   I think we re   this is an outrage for this kind of thin, uncorroborated, 35-year-old accusation to be leveled in this fashion at this time. I ve been in the public eye for 24 years, since I started with the independent counsel in the fall of 1994, very public at various points in my life. I ve been through six background checks. I worked in the White House at the highest levels, senior staff, traveling with the President all over the world, seeing the most highly sensitive secrets of our Nation for years. I went through a difficult confirmation process for the D.C. Circuit that was public with two separate confirmation hearings in 2004 and 2006.I ve been a judge for 12 years in a very public way. I ve been identified repeatedly as a potential Supreme Court nominee. Whether that was accurate or not, I ve been publicly identified. My decisions have been publicly discussed. I ve been very much a presence at the Yale College reunions. I ve been on multiple panels there. So I ve been active in the class. The class newsletter has talked about me. The people in my class have been at those reunions and those events.In all that time, not a word. And then 4 days, you know, when just right before a vote for the Supreme Court, after the nomination itself has been pending for months,  and I ve been through the hearings and 65 Senate meetings and all the written questions, and then   and then, after all these years, with all this time, and all these descriptions with no corroboration and with her best friend saying she never heard about it, you know, I m   I m really just, you know, stunned.

I worked my ass off. And the second thing was basketball.

They refer to the other accusations as  consistent,  though Ramirez s claims were also denied by all of the eyewitnesses.It was not clear from the letter whether Democrats would still participate in Thursday s scheduled hearing, where Ford and Kavanaugh are expected to testify under oath, and the judge   who has served for twelve years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit   is expected to deny Ford s accusations and others that have emerged.On Wednesday, Swetnick s claims were presented by lawyer and presidential hopeful Michael Avenatti, who also represents porn star Stormy Daniels is a defamation suit against Trump that a federal judge seems poised to dismiss.The signatories to Wednesday s letter include Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who falsely claimed to have served in Vietnam, and by Sen.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/full-text-brett-kavanaughs-prepared-senate-testimony-i-am-innocent-of-this-charge/","The following statement is Brett Kavanaugh s prepared written testimony, which the Supreme Court nominee will deliver in a Thursday Senate Judiciary Committee hearing:Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the Committee:Eleven days ago, Dr. Ford publicly accused me of committing a serious wrong more than 36 years ago when we were both in high school. I denied the allegation immediately, unequivocally, and categorically. The next day, I told this Committee that I wanted to testify as soon as possible, under oath, to clear my name.Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired. There has been a frenzy to come up with something anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious that will block a vote on my nomination. These are last-minute smears, pure and simple. They debase our public discourse. And the consequences extend beyond any one nomination. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination if allowed to succeed will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country.As I told this Committee the last time I appeared before you, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. That is the kind of judge I am and will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. This effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. I am here this morning to answer these allegations and to tell the truth. And the truth is that I have never sexually assaulted anyone not in high school, not in college, not ever.Sexual assault is horrific. It is morally wrong. It is illegal. It is contrary to my religious faith. And it contradicts the core promise of this Nation that all people are created equal and entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Allegations of sexual assault must be taken seriously. Those who make allegations deserve to be heard. The subject of allegations also deserves to be heard. Due process is a foundation of the American rule of law.Dr. Ford s allegation dates back more than 36 years, to a party that she says occurred during our time in high school. I spent most of my time in high school focused on academics, sports, church, and service. But I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now. But that s not why we are here today. What I ve  been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior. I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes.The allegation of misconduct is completely inconsistent with the rest of my life. The record of my life, from my days in grade school through the present day, shows that I have always promoted the equality and dignity of women.I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford. I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford. I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time. But I have never done that to her or to anyone. I am innocent of this charge.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/26/avenatti-my-client-is-willing-to-testify-on-kavanaugh-gang-rape-allegations/","Wednesday on ABC s  The View,  attorney Michael Avenatti called in to discuss his client Julie Swetnick s allegations against Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Avenatti said,  Moments ago, we sent a sworn declaration under penalty of perjury signed by my client, Julie Swetnick, detailing her allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge and others relating to the early  80s and what she observed and witnessed, as well as what transpired to her during that time period. We have asked the committee, as we did days ago, to launch a formal FBI investigation. My client is ready to meet with FBI agents to disclose what she knows in detail. We have also offered that she ll take a polygraph exam if Brett Kavanaugh will take a polygraph exam. And let me also say that I m looking forward to anyone attempting to challenge the credibility of my client, because she is absolutely credible. She is a very brave woman, and in fact, she has also obtained multiple security clearances issued by the U.S. government over many, many years. He continued,  If you read further in the declaration, are far more specific relating to Brett Kavanaugh s conduct toward women in general, including the attempts to drug women by placing grain alcohol and/or drugs in the punch of many of these parties. Many of these women ended up gang raped, unfortunately. The details are specific. They are shocking. But above all else they are true. And my client stands behind them 100%, and she s looking forward to having an opportunity to meet with one or more FBI agents hopefully, and describe what happened, and she s also prepared to testify, if she s permitted to do so, to the U.S. Senate. But under no circumstances should Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court until these allegations and others are vetted and all of the facts and the truth are known. You know, Brett Kavanaugh went on Fox a couple days ago and he stated that he wanted an opportunity to be heard. Well, he s had an opportunity to be heard. He can certainly have an opportunity to be heard further by the FBI and others. I want my client to have an opportunity to be heard. I want Dr. Ford to have an opportunity to be heard. And I want the corroborating witnesses to have an opportunity to be heard. He added,  She is willing to testify. Again, she s willing to meet with the FBI forthwith immediately to describe what she witnessed. She s prepared to provide additional corroborating witnesses  names to the FBI associated with that investigation, and we re hopeful that the committee is going to respond immediately by calling for an FBI investigation so that all of these allegations can be properly vetted and the truth can be known.

Ted Cruz (R-TX), after permanently blacklisting Infowars host Alex Jones last month based on the same rules. Following the publishing of this article, Twitter admitted the tweets were  violating our rules against abusive behavior,  but the post featuring a video of Sen. Cruz being harassed remains on the site. Smash Racism DC,  an account which openly supports Antifa and the abolition of U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement, uploaded a video of left-wing activists harassing Cruz and his wife at a restaurant this week. Cruz has been friends with creep Kavanaugh for 20 years. Now Cruz is on judiciary committee hearing his testimony. Fascists not welcome!  the group captioned the video, receiving over 30,000 likes and 12,000 retweets.https://twitter.com/SmashRacismDC/status/1044408830564683776According to Twitter s rules, the social network prohibits  behavior that crosses the line into abuse, including behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another user s voice,  however the video remains, despite the fact that Infowars  Alex Jones was banned from Twitter this month for a similar video in which he filmed himself berating CNN reporter Oliver Darcy. Today, we permanently suspended @realalexjones and @infowars from Twitter and Periscope. We took this action based on new reports of Tweets and videos posted yesterday that violate our abusive behavior policy, in addition to the accounts  past violations,  declared Twitter this month.  As we continue to increase transparency around our rules and enforcement actions, we wanted to be open about this action given the broad interest in this case. Twitter currently has hundreds of Antifa and openly pro-Antifa accounts on the social network, even though the group has been registered as a domestic terrorist group in the United States.
Twitter also claimed last year that they would  take enforcement action against organizations that use/have historically used violence as a means to advance their cause,  but have refused to take action against pro-Antifa accounts.Following the publication of this article, Twitter did admit that the Antifa tweets were  violating our rules against abusive behavior,  however the tweet in this article remains on the site and no action appears to have been taken.The social network did not reply to a request for comment from Breitbart News.Update   Shortly after the publication of this of this article, Twitter indicated via email that the  Smash Racism DC  tweet is  violating our rules against abusive behavior,  but the tweet remains live on the platform.Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

They could have pushed this through two and a half weeks ago and you would not be talking about it right now, which is frankly what I would have preferred,  Trump admitted.He spoke to reporters after he arrived at the United Nations building in New York City on Wednesday morning.Trump noted that Senate Republicans were going out of their way to offer Kavanaugh s accuser Christine Ford a chance to testify. I think the Senate, the Republicans could not be nicer than the way they re handling this,  he said.Senate Republicans scheduled a confirmation vote on Friday, and have offered Ford and Kavanaugh a chance to testify to the committee on Thursday.Trump signaled his impatience with the process, although he provided some deference to Senate Republicans. I m OK with that,  he said.  I think I would have pushed it forward a lot faster. He called Kavanaugh  outstanding  and  an absolute gem  and again criticized Democrats for obstructing the proceedings with last-minute allegations. They laugh at what they re getting away with, it s a con game and that s what they play,  he said.

None of the statements show Ford made any mention of the incident for at least three decades. I was walking my dog and Christine was outside of her house,  Rebecca White, a neighbor of Ford s, wrote of the conversation they shared in 2017 regarding the alleged incident.  I stopped to speak with her, and she told me she had read a recent social media post I had written about my own experience with sexual assault.  She then told me that when she was a young teen, she had been sexually assaulted by an older teen,  she added.  I remember her saying that her assailant was now a federal judge. According to Adela Gildo-Mazzon s declaration, Ford is said to have detailed the alleged incident while sharing a meal together at a Mountain View, California restaurant in 2013. During our meal, Christine was visibly upset, so I asked her what was going on,  Gildo-Mazzon wrote.  Christine told me she had been having a hard day because she was thinking about an assault she experienced when she was much younger. She said she had been almost raped by someone who was now a federal judge. She told me she had been trapped in a room with two drunken guys, and that she had escaped, ran away and hid. Gildo-Mazzon, whose declaration states she has known Ford for over a decade, considers the professor a  good friend. In Ford s husband s declaration, Russell alleges he was first made aware of the alleged incident  around the time we got married  and learned of further details during a 2012 marital therapy session. I remember her saying that her attacker s name was Brett Kavanaugh, that he was a successful lawyer who had grown up in Christine s home town, and that he was well-known in the Washington D.C. community,  he wrote.While discussing the sexual assault case of Stanford University student Brock Turner, Keith Koegler wrote in his declaration that Ford  expressed anger at Mr. Turner s lenient sentence, stating that she was particularly bothered by it because she was assaulted in high school by a man who was now a federal judge in Washington, D.C.  Christine did not mention the assault to me again until June 29, 2018, two days after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his resignation from the Supreme Court of the United States,  Koegler noted.In an email exchange, Koegler claims Ford alleged the individual who had sexually assaulted her was the frontrunner to replace Kennedy. I remember you telling me about him, but I don t remember his name. Do you mind telling me so I can read about him?  Koegler asked Ford. Brett Kavanaugh,  she replied.In a Monday interview with Fox News host Martha MacCallum, Kavanaugh denied the decades-old allegations and asked for a  fair process where I can defend my integrity.  I ve never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise,  the nominee told the host.  I am not questioning, and have not questioned, that perhaps Dr. Ford, at some point in her life, was sexually assaulted by someone, in some place. But what I know is I ve never sexually assaulted anyone.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-sexual-assault-charge-does-not-kill-career-accelerates-it/","Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic Socialist and candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, said on Monday that being accused of sexual assault could benefit one s career, rather than end it. A sexual assault allegation does not kill a career but accelerates it,  Ocasio-Cortez said at Columbia University where she took part in a panel discussion and was asked to weigh in on the unsubstantiated accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. I hope that at some point, it keeps them up at night,  Ocasio-Cortez said.  I really do  it s beyond politics. The Columbia Spectator reported on the panel discussion, which was moved from the campus to a nearby church because of the university s prohibition of partisan events.Ocasio-Cortez argued at the event that the progressive base of the Democrat Party is growing and repeated her call for the elimination of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency tasked with protecting public safety in the interior of the United States, including protection from criminal illegal aliens. We need to not be afraid to take strong, moral stances,  said Ocasio-Cortez, who won New York s 14th Congressional District primary against veteran Democrat Joe Crowley.  We pinned our campaign on a moral argument  and then we won on that moral argument  It s not about testing and seeing what s viable, it s about making things viable. The Spectator reported:A student associated with the Roosevelt Institute asked Ocasio-Cortez about her thoughts on Barnard s investment in the Baupost Group, which holds some $911 million in Puerto Rican debt and has called for austerity measures in the area affected by Hurricane Maria.In response, Ocasio-Cortez advised students that the most effective way to enact change at institutions like Columbia or Barnard is to pressure the individuals who hold decision-making power.Ocasio-Cortez also emphasized the importance of engaging with minority groups that Democrats have neglected in the past, saying that if the party does not support marginalized communities, it cannot expect their vote. Unless we consciously communicate that we are changing course, with a renewed commitment to these communities, I don t think we can just expect them to turn out,  Ocasio-Cortez said.The event included voter registration.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

Her identity, however, was kept private until Tuesday night.In a statement announcing Mitchell as the previously unnamed prosecutor, Grassley wrote: As I have said, I m committed to providing a forum to both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh on Thursday that is safe, comfortable and dignified. The majority members have followed the bipartisan recommendation to hire as staff counsel for the committee an experienced career sex-crimes prosecutor to question the witnesses at Thursday s hearing. The goal is to de-politicize the process and get to the truth, instead of grandstanding and giving senators an opportunity to launch their presidential campaigns. I m very appreciative that Rachel Mitchell has stepped forward to serve in this important and serious role. Ms. Mitchell has been recognized in the legal community for her experience and objectivity.Some commentators on the political left immediately criticized the pick, trying to tie Mitchell, who is an unelected civil servant, to the controversially convicted   and now pardoned   Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.The Maricopa County Attorney s Office does not report to the Sheriff s Office. As in most counties nationwide, the Maricopa County Attorney is an independently elected official who runs his office independently, since 2010 Republican Bill Montgomery. Sheriff Arpaio at no time exercised authority over any aspect of the County Attorney s Office.The Washington Post s Never Trump blogger Jennifer Rubin, who is regularly identified as a  conservative  in media outlets despite distancing herself from the term, insulted Mitchell on Twitter shortly after the announcement, making this mistake:Only this crowd of clueless old white guys wold pick someone from Sheriff Joe s operation. I was saying no self-respecting lawyer would take the job of giving cover to GOP cowards. I was right.  Jennifer Rubin (@JRubinBlogger) September 26, 2018Former Hillary Clinton adviser Philippe Reines made the same error:11 Fraidy Cat Republican *men* need a ringer to do their dirty work: Rachel Mitchell, 26 years in Arizona s Maricopa County Attorney s Office, will interrogate Ford, ask Kavanaugh his favorite color.

Not only did Mitchell not work at the Sheriff s Office, she, as the Washington Post s Tuesday report notes was, according to her predecessor Cindi Nannetti,  one of the prosecutors tasked with finding out why hundreds of sex crimes were unresolved or not adequately investigated by the Maricopa County Sheriff s Office. Nannetti also told the Post that Mitchell was  one of the finest prosecutors in the country. Defense attorney Tracey Westerhausen, a self-identified Democrat who represented  more than 30  defendants Mitchell prosecuted, told the Post,  Part of the reason we re very good friends, she is a very nuanced and wise prosecutor. She doesn t pigeonhole defendants. In my experience, she is a very pointed questioner of adverse witnesses. But she is also very fair.

Pray for Brett Kavanaugh and his family!  Trump wrote on Twitter, denouncing Democrats for trying to destroy Kavanaugh.He again described Kavanaugh s accusers as part of a Democrat plot and a  con game  to destroy his nominee to the Supreme Court. The Democrats are playing a high level CON GAME in their vicious effort to destroy a fine person,  he wrote.  It is called the politics of destruction. Behind the scene the Dems are laughing. Since Christine Blasey Ford first accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, Trump has remained firmly behind his nominee and his family. His wife is devastated, his children are devastated. I don t mean, Oh gee, I am a little unhappy.  They are devastated,  he said earlier on Tuesday.  And it is because of these Democrats. Trump added that the allegations, which are more than 30 years old, were  totally unsubstantiated,  and he warned that it would be a bad precedent for the United States Senate to block Kavanaugh s confirmation. This is a high-quality person, and it would be a horrible insult to our country if this doesn t happen,  he said.  And it ll be a horrible, horrible thing for future political people. Trump has continued to highlight Kavanaugh s qualifications for the Supreme Court, touting his great legal mind and character. They know it s a con game. They know he s high quality,  he said about the Democrats.  And they wink at each other. They re winking. They know it s a con game. The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hear testimony from Ford about her allegations on Thursday   although it is unclear if she will testify.A Senate vote to confirm Kavanaugh is scheduled for Friday:The Democrats are playing a high level CON GAME in their vicious effort to destroy a fine person.

It s worth saying that most Democrats in Washington don t really hate Kavanaugh personally,  Carlson explained.  He s hardly an abrasive character, as you learned if you watched his interview with Martha [MacCallum] last night. There s nothing personal about any of this. Kavanaugh stands between the Democratic Party and the power it seeks. He is in the way. He must be crushed  in this case, along with his wife and his two little girls. Sorry, that s the cost of winning. No omelets without some broken eggs.  The problem is that outside party headquarters in D.C., people out there don t understand this,  he added.  When they hear a U.S. Senator call Brett Kavanaugh a sex criminal, they believe it. Why wouldn t they believe it? Because that s the only other thing that never changes, ever   human nature. There s a mob instinct in people   a gut-level desire to worship the powerful and hurt the undesirable. It s always there, in every population in every country from the beginning of time until now.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/25/report-kavanaugh-accuser-ramirez-refuses-to-cooperate-with-senate-committee/","Deborah Ramirez, the second women to level sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, is refusing to cooperate in any way with the Senate Judiciary Committee.The Washington Examiner reports that Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), a sitting member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told staffers Tuesday that Ramirez is refusing to cooperate in any way; she will not testify or even make a statement.Speaking of Ramirez s lawyer, Kennedy said,  Our counsel repeatedly tried to reach him. They finally did reach him, and he said, We are not issuing a statement . He said, If you want our statement, read the New Yorker.  According to others present when Kennedy made these remarks, he added that the  Read the New Yorker  comment was not a direct quote, just the way he interpreted it.Any testimony given to the Committee, including a statement, would be considered under oath, which carries with it the risk of perjury and imprisonment. So far, everyone appears to agree that Ramirez has not issued a statement, nor has her attorney.The only statement she has made is to the New Yorker, which does not carry any penalty for perjury.For his part, according to the far-left Washington Post, Kavanaugh did speak to the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and once again denied the Ramirez allegations. During this particular call, Kavanaugh is considered to be under oath and if he is lying would face disgrace, disbarment, and jail time.In a bombshell story co-authored by Ronan Farrow and published in the New Yorker Sunday, Ramirez alleged that during a drunken 1983 party in a Yale dorm room, when both she and the Supreme Court nominee were freshman, Kavanaugh aggressively flashed her.Ramirez s story quickly unraveled, though, and did so on the pages of the New Yorker.For starters, Farrow s in-depth reporting detailed Ramirez s memory problems. In part because she was so intoxicated on the night in question, for 35 years she could not remember who flashed her. It was only when Senate Democrats threatened to tell their version of the story and after she spent six days probing her memory with her attorney (a Democrat politician) that Ramirez agreed to name Kavanaugh.Memory issues are just the beginning of the problems with the Ramirez allegation. Every single person she named as a witness has either said the flashing incident never happened or they did not recall it happening.In other words, as is the case with Kavanaugh s first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, all the named witnesses either say this never happened or they cannot remember it happening.As of now, whether or not Ford will testify under oath is also up in the air. After a week of delays and accommodations, Ford agreed to testify this Thursday. Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA), however, said on Tuesday that  I have no way of knowing  if she will show up.Michael Avenatti, the attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels made famous by CNN, promised on Sunday that he had a third accuser who would come forward within 48 hours against Kavanaugh. On Tuesday, however, Avenatti not only appeared to walk back that promise, he also locked his Twitter account from public view. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

After days of negotiations, a hearing is set for Thursday to allow Ford to testify and Kavanaugh to respond to her allegations.In a speech on the Senate floor on Monday, McConnell said the vote would take place in the  near future  and condemned the Democrats  efforts to derail Kavanaugh s confirmation with a  smear campaign.  The Democrats have already made up their minds and chosen their tactics,  McConnell said.  Delay. Obstruct. Resist.  They re going to do whatever they could to stop this qualified, experienced and mainstream nominee,  McConnell said Democrats have signaled for months they d put on whatever performance the far-left special interest demanded and throw all the mud they could manufacture,  McConnell said.  But even by far-left standards, this shameful, shameful smear campaign has hit a new low. McConnell concluded:  I want to make it perfectly clear, Mr. President. Judge Kavanaugh will be voted on here on the Senate floor. Rasmussen Reports conducted the survey of 1,000 likely voters on September 23-24, 2018.

But neither the media nor the left seem at all interested in believing the women defending Brett Kavanaugh.I am not even talking about the legions and legions of female character witnesses from the Supreme Court nominee s professional and academic career  women who have known him for up to 35 years.No, the women I am talking about are the female witnesses named by Kavanaugh s accusers.Christine Blasey Ford has accused Kavanugh of attempting to assault her during a house party in 1983. She was 15 at the time, he was 17, and Ford claimed to have three witnesses.Now that the dreaded Patriarchy is finally coming down (whatever that means), let s ignore two of Ford s witnesses   PJ Smyth and Mark Judge (who have ZERO recollection of this house party) because  they are men, and therefore members of that dreaded patriarchy. ButWhat about Leland Ingham Keyser?What about her?Ms. Kesyer is not only a woman and a Democrat, she is a lifelong friend of Ford s, and this female, lifelong friend of Ford s not only cannot remember ever attending this house party, she also says she never met Kavanaugh, and does not know him.Hey, if we are supposed to believe all womenKavanaugh s second accuser is Deborah Ramirez, who claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken party in a Yale dorm in 1983. Ramirez says she was  foggy  drunk at the time and for 35 years could not remember who flashed her, but after talking to Senate Democrats and her Democrat lawyer for six days, she is now sure it was Kavanaugh.Two witnesses to the event named by Ramirez say it never happened. But they are both men, and therefore dreaded members of the patriarchy. ButWhat about Ramirez s best friend at Yale?What about her?She says of Ramirez,  This is a woman I was best friends with. We shared intimate details of our lives. And I was never told this story by her, or by anyone else. It never came up. I didn t see it; I never heard of it happening. And what about Louisa Garry who  Ramirez alleged [was] involved in the incident? Here is what she (and two additional men Ramirez claimed were involved) told the New Yorker:We were the people closest to Brett Kavanaugh during his first year at Yale. He was a roommate to some of us, and we spent a great deal of time with him, including in the dorm where this incident allegedly took place. Some of us were also friends with Debbie Ramirez during and after her time at Yale. We can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it and we did not. The behavior she describes would be completely out of character for Brett. In addition, some of us knew Debbie long after Yale, and she never described this incident until Brett s Supreme Court nomination was pending. Editors from the New Yorker contacted some of us because we are the people who would know the truth, and we told them that we never saw or heard about this.Garry added later,  I never saw or heard anything like this. But I cannot dispute Ramirez s allegations, as I was not present. What part of the  all  in  believe all women  am I missing? Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/25/senate-judiciary-vote-kavanaugh/","WASHINGTON, DC  The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a meeting on September 28, to vote on whether to recommend Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the full Senate for confirmation to the Supreme Court.The committee is currently scheduled to hear testimony under oath from Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, on Thursday. Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has hired a veteran prosecutor who specializes in sex crime cases to lead the questioning of both witnesses.While it appears certain that Kavanaugh will be there to testify, there are growing doubts  including from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who initiated the whole affair  as to whether Ford will show up at all. (Ford was invited to testify, but is not under subpoena, and therefore has no legal obligation to appear and be placed under oath.)The Judiciary Committee s rules require three days  advance notice of any business meeting, so Grassley has issued that notice today if a majority of the committee is prepared to vote after Thursday s hearing.Once the committee votes on the nomination, it goes to the majority leader  Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) who controls the Senate floor schedule for debates and votes. It is certain that McConnell will need to file a cloture motion to bring debate over President Trump s second Supreme Court pick to a close and proceed to a vote.McConnell has already told senators to expect to stay in Washington on Saturday and even Sunday to move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination.The Supreme Court begins its annual term next Monday, October 1, at 10:00 a.m.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

It would sure clear up all the questions, wouldn t it?  Murkowski reportedly told Raju.I just asked Sen.

Ford s legal and members of Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley staffer reached a tentative agreement Saturday for the professor to testify before lawmakers Thursday. However, a letter sent to the chairman by Ford s attorneys Monday complained of the panel s hiring of an  experienced sex crimes prosecutor  to partake in the testimony, suggests the professor may renege on the agreement.In new letter from Dr Ford s Attorney to the Judiciary Committee, they again object to having outside counsel ask the questions for republicans at Thursday s hearing, and ask for the name and resume of who that person will be.This does not appear to be a done deal. pic.twitter.com/MwggIeBGbs  Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) September 25, 2018 In our view, the hiring of an unnamed experienced sex crimes prosecutor  as Mr. Davis described in his email, is contrary to the Majority s repeated emphasis on the need for the Senate and this Committee s members to fulfill their constitutional obligations,  wrote lawyer Michael Bromwich.  It is also inconsistent with your stated wish to avoid a circus,  as well as Dr. Blasey Ford s repeated requests through counsel that senators conduct the questioning. This is not a criminal trial for which the involvement of an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would be appropriate. Another allegation Murkowski likely believes should be investigated regards the New Yorkers Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer report, in which a woman named Deborah Ramirez alleges that drunken Kavanaugh, while a freshman at Yale University,  exposed himself  to her during a party. Among the piece s key revelations, Farrow and Mayer were unable to  confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party. Despite saber-rattling from Democrats, chances of the FBI opening an investigation are slim.The Washington Post writes:The FBI conducts background checks for federal nominees but the agency does not make judgments on the credibility or significance of allegations, according to a Justice Department statement Monday. Instead, the department compiles information about the nominee s past and provides its findings to the agency that requested the background check. In this case, that would be the White House.There has been no suggestion that Kavanaugh may have committed a federal crime, so the FBI would not conduct a criminal investigation. But Senate Democrats are pushing for the FBI to reopen Kavanaugh s background investigation.Amid calls from Democrats to suspend the confirmation vote, Republican leadership is standing shoulder to shoulder with Kavanaugh. On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lambasted Democrats for launching a  smear campaign  against the Trump pick.  Senate Democrats and their allies are trying to destroy a man s personal and professional life on the basis of decades-old allegations that are unsubstantiated and uncorroborated,  he said.  That, Mr. President, is where we are. This is what the so-called resistance has become, a smear campaign, pure and simple, aided and abetted by members of the United States Senate. In a surprise sit-down interview with Fox News host Martha MacCallum yesterday, Kavanaugh once again denied the allegations and called for  fair process where I can defend my integrity.  I ve never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise,  Kavanaugh, flanked by his wife Ashley, told the Fox News host.  I am not questioning, and have not questioned, that perhaps Dr. Ford, at some point in her life, was sexually assaulted by someone, in some place. But what I know is I ve never sexually assaulted anyone.

He added,  Now, she ll have a chance to present her case on Thursday.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/25/thune-democrats-attempting-11th-hour-ambush-on-kavanaugh/","Tuesday on Fox News Channel s  America s Newsroom,  Sen. John Thune (R-SD) said Senate Democrats are attempting an  11th-hour ambush  on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Thune said,  This was an 11th-hour ambushed by the Democrats on the committee. Think about what he has been through. He started off answering over 30 hours of questions, in an open session from Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary committee. They had closed sessions where they asked him questions. They submitted 1300 questions for the record, more than all previous Supreme Court nominees combined. He answered those. He has answered six FBI background checks. This has been an incredibly open, transparent process. Republicans have been very fair to Democrats. Democrats, on the other hand, get a letter, a piece of information back in July, which they decide to hang onto and then unleash at the 11th hour to try and delay and derail this nomination. They have not been fair to this nominee at all. He continued,  It s been a circus from the get-go. From their standpoint, it s very clear they are doing everything they can to prevent him from going on the court. Notwithstanding that, Senator Grassley has conducted a very fair process. The Judiciary Committee is going to hear on Thursday for both of these individuals, and we will move forward from there. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

After 30 hours of sworn testimony where they failed to lay a glove on Brett Kavanaugh because he has academic credentials and impeccable integrity and character and qualifications beyond reproach. Many of them are raising money for their 2020 presidential elections instead of asking the judge about legal precedent because they already made up their minds that they are not going to support him.

Perdue said both Kavanaugh and his accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, should be heard and then the vote to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court should be held. I think Senator Grassley has done a fantastic job of making sure that this accuser, Dr. Ford, gets her moment. We should do that.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/25/donald-trump-democrats-playing-a-con-game-with-brett-kavanaugh-accusers/","President Donald Trump questioned the motives behind women accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault on Tuesday and stalling the Senate confirmation vote. Democrats are playing a con game   C-O-N,  Trump said in response to the controversy. He made his remarks after his speech at the United Nations General Assembly during a meeting with the new president of Colombia.The president immediately challenged the accusations from Deborah Ramirez, featured in an uncorroborated story in the New Yorker. Ramirez claimed that Kavanaugh exposed himself during a party when he was in college. Kavanaugh has adamantly denied the accusations.
 The second accuser has nothing,  Trump said, pointing out that she admitted that she was  drunk  at the time and had  time lapses  in her story. There were gaps, and she was totally inebriated and all messed up,  Trump said.  She doesn t know it was him but it might have been him. He said it would be a bad precedent for political nominees in the future if Kavanaugh s confirmation was ultimately blocked. This is a high-quality person, and it would be a horrible insult to our country if this doesn t happen,  Trump said.  And it ll be a horrible, horrible thing for future political people. The president angrily blamed Democrats for trying to ruin Kavanaugh and his family. His wife is devastated, his children are devastated. I don t mean, Oh gee, I am a little unhappy.  They are devastated,  Trump said.  And it is because of these Democrats.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/25/vulnerable-senate-democrats-remain-open-supporting-brett-kavanaugh/","Vulnerable Senate Democrats told reporters this week they continue to keep an open mind regarding their support for President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh.Several Senate Democrats up for re-election this year have remained open to supporting Judge Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court despite the sexual assault allegations brought against the president s nominee.Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) face three of the most competitive races this cycle and have continued to watch the accusations against Kavanaugh unfold before they give a decision regarding their support.Manchin told reporters on Monday,  I want everybody to be able to tell their side of the story if it s validated, and I want him to have a chance to clear his name.  I just want to hear all the facts, hear what everybody has to say,  Sen. Donnelly said. He contended that he is not facing pressure to vote to confirm the nominee, stating,  No. I ll just do what s right, no matter what. Heitkamp told reporters on Monday that the allegations need to be  looked into,  but he declined to elaborate. Rep. Kevin Cramer, Heitkamp s Republican challenger, leads the North Dakota Democrat by four points according to a poll released this month.Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), who faces an increasingly tight race against Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale, still has policy questions for Kavanaugh. Look, we re paying close attention to the allegations. I ve got other issues, too, that I want to talk to him if we can ever get an in-person [meeting] with him,  Tester said, citing privacy, abortion, and campaign finance.  We ve got a long list. And these allegations will also be a part of it. A survey last week found that Rosendale and Tester are in a virtual tie at 44 percent each.While Manchin, Heitkamp, and Donnelly face increasing pressure to back Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, they will likely not signal if they will support him until after he receives a 50-vote majority for Senate confirmation. The 50-vote majority largely rests upon Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Susan Collins  (R-ME) supporting Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, but they will wait on deciding until they hear California psychology Professor Christine Blasey Ford s testimony about the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh.If Collins and Murkowski back Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, Manchin, Heitkamp, and Donnelly will face continued pressure to vote to confirm him.In contrast to the three Senate Democrats, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) announced last week she will vote against Kavanaugh, saying the accusation against him was  troubling  but did not factor into her decision against the nominee.McCaskill is considered one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats. A September poll found that Missouri State Attorney General Josh Hawley is now tied with her for the Missouri Senate race.McCaskill said that Kavanaugh  has revealed his bias against limits on campaign donations which places him completely out of the mainstream of this nation.

I m not going to let false accusations drive out us out of this process,  he said.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/25/kavanaugh-accusers-legal-team-still-not-satisfied-with-hearing-setup/","Lawyers for Judge Brett Kavanaugh s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, sent another email to Senate Judiciary Committee staffers Monday night, indicating their displeasure with preparations for their client s Thursday testimony.Among the issues raised in the email by new addition to the Ford legal team Michael Bromwich (pictured) include the announcement of a female  experienced sex crimes prosecutor  as outside counsel. Ford s lawyers have been objecting to Republicans  ability to use anyone by the all-male roster of GOP senators on the Judiciary Committee since their opening salvos last week. In our view, the hiring of an unnamed experienced sex crimes prosecutor,  as [committee staffer Mike] Davis described in his email, is contrary to the Majority s repeated emphasis on the need for the Senate and this Committee s members to fulfill their constitutional obligations,  Bromwich writes.  This is not a criminal trial for which the involvement of an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would be appropriate. The email also includes a new set of demands including a meeting with the as-of-yet unnamed prosecutor Tuesday as well as an explanation of her role and her resume.  Mr. Davis still has not responded to a number of outstanding questions about the hearing, including an explanation of the role of the  experienced sex crimes prosecutor  in the Committee format,  Bromwich writes.  Please identify this person and ask your staff to send us her resume immediately. We respectfully request to meet with her tomorrow. Previous demands from Ford s legal team have included that Ford testify only after Kavanaugh has, denying him the ability to defend himself from her still-nebulous accusations.Given the repeated postponement on Ford s behalf of the hearing on Ford s allegation that a 17-year-old Kavanaugh groped her at a high school party 36 years ago, this latest salvo of objections had some commentators wondering if the hearing is again in jeopardy. As NBC News s Frank Thorp, who first reported the email in a tweet, expressed his doubts:In new letter from Dr Ford s Attorney to the Judiciary Committee, they again object to having outside counsel ask the questions for republicans at Thursday s hearing, and ask for the name and resume of who that person will be.This does not appear to be a done deal. pic.twitter.com/MwggIeBGbs  Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) September 25, 2018Whether these new objections prove fatal to Thursday s eagerly await hearing or not, it is scheduled for a smaller room in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, rather than the main Senate Judiciary Committee room on Ford s request, according to Fox News s Chad Pegram.  The witness list has also been published. It contains just two names: Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh.

Ramirez claimed she had  significant gaps in her memories  regarding the alleged encounter. Ramirez s college best friend also told the paper she  never heard of  the incident in question.Jimmy Kimmel cut to a clip of Judge Kavanaugh and his wife s Fox News interview on Monday, in which the Supreme Court nominee called allegations from Christine Blasey Ford false and explained that he was a virgin in high school and college.https://youtu.be/935PjmlOH5o?t=3m44s Thank you for admitting that,  Kimmel said in response to the Kavanaugh clip.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/kavanaugh-speaks-allegations-against-him/","WASHINGTON, DC   Judge Brett Kavanaugh spoke publicly on Monday for the first time since being accused of sexual misconduct, telling Fox News Channel s Martha McCallum that the accusations against him are categorically false, that he looks forward to clearing his name before the Senate, and that all he asks for is a fair process.Kavanaugh appeared with his wife Ashley on Fox News s The Story, answering questions from McCallum ahead of his Thursday testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. At issue are allegations from Christine Blasey Ford, who said Kavanaugh groped her at a party when he was 17 years old, and from Deborah Ramirez, who said he exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party when they were freshmen together at Yale.Both women s accounts are currently unraveling, with the five people Ford said were at the party in question all denying her account, and with more than a dozen people contacted regarding Ramirez s accusations likewise denying the second account. All I m asking for is fairness and that I be heard in this process,  Kavanaugh said early in the interview, a theme he would repeat several times to emphasize what he was looking for during this unexpected add-on part of his Senate confirmation process to the U.S. Supreme Court.Responding directly to the accusations against him, Kavanaugh was emphatic.  I ve never sexually assaulted anyone   not in high school, not ever,  he told McCallum.He noted that within 24 hours of being accused, 65 women who knew him as a student signed a letter affirming that he always conducted himself with grace and dignity and unfailingly acted as a gentleman around women.Nor did he think there was much opportunity to have interacted with Ford.  We did not travel in the same social circles,  the 53-year-old told McCallum. I was never at any such party,  Kavanaugh said of the event Ford described.  The other people who were alleged to be present say that they do not remember any such party. The judge also cited the fact that the other teenage young woman Ford named in her story, Leland Keyser, has publicly denied Ford s description of the party.  She doesn t know me and never remembers being at a party with me any time in her life,  he recounted from Keyser s response.Brett s wife Ashley was at his side during the interview and explained why she did not believe these allegations. He s decent. He s kind,  Ashley asserted.  He s good. I know his heart. Regarding the second accuser, Ramirez, Kavanaugh cut to the chase as to why many commentators think that Ramirez is crashing and burning only 24 hours after going public. The New York Times just reported that just last week, the person making the accusation was calling other classmates saying she was not sure that I had done this,  he explained. The Times chose not to run the story after they contacted more than a dozen people, none of whom could corroborate Ramirez s account that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a Yale party in which she admitted that she was severely drunk.The interview was uncomfortably candid when Kavanaugh explained that these playboy accusations did not fit the reality that, as a young man, he was something of a  nerd,  a top student focused on academics rather than a lady s man.  I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter,  he told McCallum. So you re saying, through all these years in question, you were a virgin?  McCallum asked, referencing the fact that it is uncomfortably unfortunate to have to discuss such intimate personal details in light of the accusations. That s correct,  the judge confirmed.They elevated the discussion by focusing on the path forward by talking about what the nominee was looking for going forward. I want a fair process where I can defend my integrity,  Kavanaugh asserted. I m not going to let false accusations drive me out of this process,  he responded when McCallum explored whether he was willing to withdraw from the process.  I have faith in God and faith in the fairness of the American people. America is about fairness, and hearing from both sides.  I was first interviewed last Monday, the day after the allegation appeared,  the judge explained,  under penalty of felony, and I denied this categorically and unequivocally, and I said twice during that   I want a hearing tomorrow.  I want to clear my name as quickly as possible,  he declared.He admitted that he has his flaws but insisted that he is innocent of these accusations. I think everyone is judged on their whole life. I m a good person,  Kavanaugh opined.  I ve led a good life. I ve tried to do a lot of good for a lot of people. I am not perfect. I know that. None of us is perfect. But I ve never done anything like this. Ashley addressed the human toll of this ordeal.  It s very difficult to have these conversations with your children,  she said.She told their two young daughters,  Just remember, you know your dad. Referencing the political reality of presidents who sometimes distance themselves from nominees who become problematic, McCallum asked Kavanaugh if President Donald Trump is going to stick with him. I know he s going to stand by me,  Kavanaugh responded, saying that the president had recently contacted him to assure him of his support.  He called me this afternoon. The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hear from Kavanaugh this Thursday.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/times-up-to-brett-kavanaugh-withdraw-your-nomination-now/","The Time s Up movement on Monday evening called on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination after two women accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault and misconduct in recent weeks. Judge Kavanaugh, do not delay the inevitable. Withdraw your nomination now,  Time s Up s statement read.Earlier in the day, the group sponsored the  Time s Up National Walkout and Moment of Solidarity  and Hollywood celebrities from shows like Shameless, Will & Grace, Busy Tonight, and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee reportedly stopped work to show solidarity with the  Me Too  movement and survivors of sexual assault. Given the multiple serious allegations against him, Kavanaugh can no longer credibly serve on the nation s highest court,  the statement read.  His confirmation would compromise the integrity of the court for generations to come. Do not delay the inevitable. The time has come for Judge Brett Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. Full statement below. pic.twitter.com/TAHn4f3Dx4  TIME S UP (@TIMESUPNOW) September 25, 2018 The Time s Up movement added that  there is simply no path forward: A man accused of multiple instances of sexual violence cannot have decision-making power over the lives of American women for decades to come. If elevated to the high court, the legitimacy of everything Judge Kavanaugh touches will be questioned. The statement also cited  profound culture shifts  that  are difficult to comprehend in history books, let alone as they happen.  The Supreme Court is 229 years old and women have had the right to vote in this country for less than a century. For far too long, the safety and dignity of women was secondary to the needs of powerful men. But that era is done,  Time s Up s statement continued.  The rules have changed. Thoughtful American citizens, regardless of political party, will not tolerate this man as an arbiter of justice on the nation s highest court.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/susan-collins-second-kavanaugh-accuser-should-speak-with-senate-investigators/","Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) said on Monday evening that Deborah Ramirez, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her while they were students at Yale, should speak to Senate Judiciary Committee investigators under oath. I believe that the committee investigators should reach out to Deborah Ramirez to question her under oath about what she is alleging happened,  Collins reportedly said, according to The Hill. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) reportedly said on Monday evening that Ramirez s  counsel has not been terribly cooperative other than to say to read the New Yorker.  Our majority staff has been in touch with Ms. Ramirez s counsel. We are told if we want to know the allegations, read the New Yorker. And that s all they re willing to say,  Kennedy reportedly added.When asked if Ramirez should appear at Thursday s scheduled hearing at which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh s first accuser, are scheduled to appear, Collins reportedly said,  No, because there hasn t even been an interview of her yet and I think that needs to take place first. Democrats are trying to convince Collins, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) to consider voting against Kavanaugh in light of the sexual misconducted/attempted sexual assault allegations.Collins said on Friday evening that she will  have to be able to look in the mirror  and say that she did what was the right thing when asked about Kavanaugh. In the end I have to be able to look in the mirror and say I did what I thought was right,  Collins reportedly said at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire.Earlier on Friday, Collins said she was  appalled  by President Donald Trump s tweet in which he said that  if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. Trump added:  I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn  date, time, and place!  I was appalled by the president s tweet. First of all, we know that allegations of sexual assault  I m not saying that s what happened in this case  but we know allegations of sexual assault are one of the most unreported crimes that exist,  Collins said.  So I thought that the president s tweet was completely inappropriate and wrong.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/report-trump-thinks-grassley-badly-handling-kavanaugh-accusers-demands/","President Donald Trump is none too pleased with how Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley (R-IA) is handling demands made by attorneys for Christine Balsey Ford, the California psychology professor who is scheduled to testify Thursday about her decades-old sexual misconduct allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a new report says.According to the Washington Post, President Trump believes Grassley has been  too accommodating  towards Ford, and he has grown tired of the professor s legal team  getting their way  when it comes to setting the terms of their client s testimony.As Breitbart News reported, the chairman late Saturday evening granted yet another extension to Ford s legal team to reply to a request that the accuser testify before lawmakers Wednesday. The following day, Ford s legal team convinced members of Grassley s staff to allow their client to appear before the panel on Thursday. The tentative agreement came after lawyers for Ford accused the Republicans of being  fundamentally inconsistent with the committee s promise of a fair, impartial investigation into her allegations.  Earlier this month, Ford publically detailed her allegation to the Washington Post, accusing Kavanaugh, then in high school, of forcing her into a room and groping her at a house party around 1982.The Post also reports that in the wake of allegations against Kavanaugh, President Trump believes,  Republicans are too easily manipulated by Democrats,  a view widely shared by his supporters, who see the likes of Sens. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) as bad faith actors attempting to derail the Supreme Court nominee s confirmation for purely political purposes. Further, a Republican with knowledge of the president s discussions on the matter says the White House  does not believe [Ford s] accusations are credible.  In private talks, Trump has targeted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Grassley for criticism, complaining that they have not been forceful enough in speeding up the process and have been too deferential to Ford s attorneys, according to two people familiar with Trump s concerns,  the Post reports.McConnell  vigorously defended Kavanaugh in a Senate floor speech Monday, accusing the Democrats of launching a  smear campaign  against the nominee, vowing the Trump will soon be confirmed to the Supreme Court. Senate Democrats and their allies are trying to destroy a man s personal and professional life on the basis of decades-old allegations that are unsubstantiated and uncorroborated,  McConnell said.  That, Mr. President, is where we are. This is what the so-called resistance has become, a smear campaign, pure and simple, aided and abetted by members of the United States Senate. One day after Ford tentatively agreed to testify, the New Yorkers Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer reported that while a college freshman at Yale University, an inebriated Kavanaugh  exposed himself  to fellow student Deborah Ramirez during a  drunken dormitory party.  Akin to Ford s allegation, Farrow and Mayer had no luck in corroborating Ramirez s claims.  The New Yorker has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party. The magazine contacted several dozen classmates of Ramirez and Kavanaugh regarding the incident. Many did not respond to interview requests; others declined to comment, or said they did not attend or remember the party,  the magazine s reporters wrote.Michael Avenatti, attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels and 2020 hopeful, claims to represent a third accuser who possesses  credible information  regarding Kavanaugh and has asked the committee to look into said evidence. In an email to Mike Davis, Chief Counsel for Nominations for the Senate Judiciary Committee, the  creepy porn lawyer  wrote:  We are aware of significant evidence of multiple house parties in the Washington, D.C. area during the early 1980s during which Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, and others would participate in the targeting of women with alcohol/drugs in order to allow a train  of men to subsequently gang rape them. Despite the allegations and violent threats against his family, Judge Kavanaugh s resolve appears stronger than ever.In a sit-down interview with Fox News host Martha MacCallum on Monday, Kavanaugh, with his wife Ashley by his side, vehemently denied the decades-old allegations and asked for a  fair process where I can defend my integrity.  I ve never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise,  he told MacCallum.  I am not questioning, and have not questioned, that perhaps Dr. Ford, at some point in her life, was sexually assaulted by someone, in some place. But what I know is I ve never sexually assaulted anyone.

Avenatti stated that Kavanaugh s claim isn t believable and isn t reconcilable with what Kavanaugh wrote in his yearbook and Kavanaugh s association with Mark Judge.Avenatti continued,  I mean, are we going to get into a definition of sexual intercourse? I mean, does that mean that he performed oral sex or had oral sex performed on him? Does that mean any host of any other sexual activities occurred?

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/09/24/pat-caddell-democrats-everybody-roadkill-beat-kavanaugh/","Pollster and political analyst Pat Caddell said Democrats view  everybody as roadkill  along a path to  block the nomination  of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. He offered his remarks on Monday s edition of SiriusXM s Breitbart News Daily with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow.Democrats will destroy lives and families in pursuit of a  political goal,  said Caddell. It is frightening how people s lives are damaged, I mean, are thrown away,  stated Caddell.  Everybody is roadkill when it comes to their desire to succeed in their goal, which is to beat Kavanaugh, whether it destroys him, his family, whatever   whether the charges are real or spurious.  [This will cause] people to not want to be in public life. Who wants this done to them? All in the name of a political goal. LISTEN:Caddell described Senate Republicans as acquiescing to partisan pressures from Democrats and Democrats  news media allies.Caddell said,  The Republicans in the Senate should have moved this a week ago. They should have told [Christine Blasey Ford] if she wanted to come and testify, that she would testify today or last Friday, and if not, they should have just moved ahead. They weren t going to get any points out of this, not with the media doing what it s doing, not with the Democrats doing what they re doing, which is anything to stop Kavanaugh, which has been their objective all along. Caddell added,  I think it s partly [because Republicans] have bent over so backwards that they have twisted into a pretzel, and to their detriment.  Republicans are the ones that can t play hardball. This should have been resolved last week. Caddell continued,  [Republicans] have done it all the way through. They ve allowed themselves to be Mau-maued, if you will, by people like Sen. Hirono.  The Democrats would never support [Brett Kavanaugh], no matter what. What do they think they re going to do here? Caddell noted an undermining of the idea of presumption of innocence:  This notion that you re guilty until proven innocent, or first the verdict then the trial is like Alice in Wonderland   Off with their heads!    is really disturbing.  It is out of control. Caddell went on:  I am appalled by this notion that everyone will be vulnerable all their lives to anyone who makes an accusation. Democrats had betrayed Christine Blasey Ford by leaking her identity, assessed Caddell. They don t even care about their person,  surmised Caddell.  If they did, they never would have thrown [Christine Blasey Ford] under the bus. She is roadkill to them as long as they can accomplish their purpose, which is to stop the nomination because they re right and everyone else is wrong. That s why I fault the Republicans. This has been a joke since the beginning, in terms of how it was handled. Democrats would oppose Kavanaugh if Jesus Christ declared Kavanaugh s innocence, quipped Caddell:  The Republicans have brought this on because they do not understand what they are dealing with. If the Lord Himself came down and announced that Kavanaugh was innocent, the Democrats would vote against him.

In the case of Christine Blasey Ford s accusation that a drunken 17-year-old Kavanaugh pulled her into a bedroom at a high school party with another teenager and groped her, however, the use of one has proved a major bone of contention.Ford s legal team, led by Democratic activist Deborah Katz and now joined by Bill Clinton era Justice Department Inspector General Michael Bromwich, has repeatedly demanded the Senate Judiciary Committee agree not to use a presumably female outside counsel in this hearing. Republican staffers on the committee have reportedly expressed concerns about the  optics  of the panel of 11 GOP senators, all men, conducting the questioning of a sexual assault accuser on their own.Evidently concerned with preserving those favorable optics, Ford s legal team, while urging continual delays and postponements for nearly a week, insisted on the Republican senators asking all questions of Ford on their own as a condition for Ford s testimony. Other demands included allowing Ford, the accuser, to testify after Kavanaugh, the accused  the exact opposite of centuries of Anglo-American legal tradition. Grassley s staff called that request  an affront to fundamental notions of due process  in their response Friday.As to Katz s demand to refrain from enlisting a female lawyer to question Ford, Grassley s staff also stood their ground, writing,  There is no rule of the Senate or the Committee that precludes staff attorneys from asking witnesses questions. We reserve the option to have female staff attorneys, who are sensitive to the particulars of Dr. Ford s allegations and are experienced investigators, question both witnesses. Ford s legal team has been informed of the decision to use an  experienced sex-crimes prosecutor  at Thursday s hearing, now scheduled for 10:00 a.m.

McConnell said,  Senate Democrats and their allies are trying to destroy a man s personal and professional life on the basis of decades-old allegations that are unsubstantiated and uncorroborated. That, Mr. President, is where we are. This is what the so-called resistance has become, a smear campaign, pure and simple, aided and abetted by members of the United States Senate. He concluded,  Judge Kavanaugh will be voted on here on the Senate floor.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/protester-resist-kavanaugh-or-youre-voting-for-subjugation-of-womens-bodies-exploitation-through-rape/","More than one hundred purported Yale Law students are on Capitol Hill Monday to protest President Donald Trump s Supreme Court Justice nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a Yale undergraduate and law school alumnus. Every senator that does not try to delay the confirmation hearing is an accomplice and is casting a vote of approval for the subjugation of women s bodies  our exploitation through rape,  warned one female protester while occupying Senator Ben Sasse s (R-NE) office. I know there are many women in this room, not just me, who have been drunk as teenagers and have been exploited and can t remember the details  because that s how life works,  she said, adding:If Ben Sasse, if he does not try to stop this [he] is an accomplice and for the rest of his career will be held accountable by people like me who have many years of voting ahead of us.Hundreds of activists are in the nation s Capitol this week to urge senators to vote  no  on Kavanaugh s confirmation in the wake of recent sexual misconduct allegations.Lining the halls of congressional office buildings, many protesters share personal stories of sexual assault unrelated to the accusations against Trump s nominee. As a woman at Yale Law School, I do not know a single woman who has not been a victim of sexual harassment,  another female protester explained.Watch:  I don t know a single woman who has not ever known what it is like to be fearful for her safety and health,  she continued.And I think its extremely important that we have this hearing and tell women, and people of color, and minorities, and marginalized groups that we care about them because when Anita Hill was coming forward, that is not what the Senate told us.What the Senate told women, what the Senate told people of color was, we don t care, and what s more important is the power and the privilege of a few extremely wealthy and powerful white men . The one hundred and fifty of us that came down and the many more that are sitting in at Yale Law School confirm that Yale Law School does not unequivocally support Brett Kavanaugh. Purported Yale Law students occupy Senator Ben Sasse s Washington office. (Matthew Perdie / Breitbart News)An anti-Kavanaugh protester s hat on Capitol Hill. (Matthew Perdie / Breitbart News)As of Monday afternoon, more than 750 women who graduated from Yale University have signed an open letter in support of Deborah Ramirez, the second woman who has made allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh. We are coming forward as women of Yale because we have a shared experience of the environment that shaped not only Judge Kavanaugh s life and career, but our own,  the open letter posted on Medium states.Breitbart News  Matthew Perdie contributed to this article.Amanda House is Breitbart News  Deputy Political Editor.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/ronan-farrow-new-yorker-debunks-ramirez-allegation-against-kavanaugh/","The New Yorker s Ronan Farrow and his co-author Jane Mayer are under fire for publishing a second allegation of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. When you look at how thin the story is, that criticism might be valid.But Farrow (pictured, top right) and Mayer (pictured, top left) deserve credit for writing the full story   a story that not only appears to debunk Deborah Ramirez s allegation but exposes how the institutional left is aggressively working behind the scenes to destroy Kavanaugh with spurious accusations.After 35 years of not being sure it was him, Ramirez now alleges that during a drunken dorm party during her and Kavanaugh s freshman year at Yale in 1983, he exposed himself to her in such an aggressive way she ended up accidentally touching his genitals.Obviously, this is a sensational allegation, and the timing is more than a little suspicious. The story appeared on Sunday night just as Christine Blasey Ford s allegations against Kavanaugh began to unravel.Just a few hours earlier, the last of Ford s three witnesses, including a lifelong friend, had not only said (under penalty of imprisonment) they do not recall any misconduct on Kavanaugh s part, they do not even recall attending the 1982 house party where the misconduct supposedly occurred.If anything, though, Ramirez s story is even less credible.Like Ford, neither of Ramirez s witnesses recall the party or the alleged incident, nor does her best friend. What s more, until Ramirez spent six days with her Democrat lawyer, she was unable to identify Kavanaugh as the man who exposed himself.Because of Ramirez s memory problems (she was also quite drunk at the alleged party) and her supposed witnesses stating none of this ever happened, some argue the New Yorker was irresponsible to publish. In fact, the New York Times found the story so lacking in credibility, the paper chose not to publish.But were it not for the New Yorker, we would not have learned how Democrats are willing to manipulate events behind the scenes in their ongoing effort to destroy Kavanaugh with unsubstantiated allegations from more than 30 years ago.The New Yorker informs us:In her initial conversations with The New Yorker, she was reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh s role in the alleged incident with certainty. After six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, Ramirez said that she felt confident enough of her recollections to say that she remembers Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away.In other words, a full 35 years after the incident occurred, Ramirez (who the New Yorker describes as an activist Democrat) could not put the finger on Kavanaugh as the alleged flasher.Moreover, we learn  Ramirez acknowledged that there are significant gaps in her memories of the evening  and that at the party she  became inebriated  and  was on the floor, foggy and slurring her words. Nevertheless, after all this time, over the past few days, she became sure it was Kavanaugh thanks to  carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney. Thanks to the New Yorker s in-depth reporting, however, we know exactly who the attorney is who helped Ramirez recall her memory    Stanley Garnett, a former Democratic district attorney  from Boulder, Colorado.And then there is the role Senate Democrats playedAppearing on Good Morning America Monday, Farrow disclosed that Senate Democrats instigated this by reaching out to Ramirez, who had no intention of reporting the incident because she was not sure it was Kavanaugh. One of the primary reasons she came forward, according to Farrow, is that she feared Democrats would tell the story for her. She felt it was important that she tell her story before others did without her consent because so many people on [Capitol] Hill were looking at this,  Farrow said.Farrow also admitted there are no eyewitnesses of this incident.In fact, as the New Yorker reports, the two people named by Ramirez as witnesses state the incident never happened:One of the male classmates who Ramirez said egged on Kavanaugh denied any memory of the party.  I don t think Brett would flash himself to Debbie, or anyone, for that matter,  he said. Asked why he thought Ramirez was making the allegation, he responded,  I have no idea.  The other male classmate who Ramirez said was involved in the incident commented,  I have zero recollection. Additionally, Ramirez s own best friend at the time says she knew nothing about this: This is a woman I was best friends with. We shared intimate details of our lives. And I was never told this story by her, or by anyone else. It never came up. I didn t see it; I never heard of it happening.  She said she hadn t spoken with Ramirez for about ten years, but that the two women had been close all through college, and Kavanaugh had remained part of what she called their  larger social circle.  In an initial conversation with The New Yorker, she suggested that Ramirez may have been politically motivated. Later, she said that she did not know if this was the case.Then there are the three classmates who also back Kavanaugh s claim:Dino Ewing, Louisa Garry, and Dan Murphy, disputed Ramirez s account of events:  We were the people closest to Brett Kavanaugh during his first year at Yale. He was a roommate to some of us, and we spent a great deal of time with him, including in the dorm where this incident allegedly took place. Some of us were also friends with Debbie Ramirez during and after her time at Yale. We can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it and we did not. The behavior she describes would be completely out of character for Brett. In addition, some of us knew Debbie long after Yale, and she never described this incident until Brett s Supreme Court nomination was pending. Editors from the New Yorker contacted some of us because we are the people who would know the truth, and we told them that we never saw or heard about this. The only person backing Ramirez is someone who refuses to be named and who allegedly heard about the flashing incident through a second-hand source:A classmate of Ramirez s, who declined to be identified because of the partisan battle over Kavanaugh s nomination, said that another student told him about the incident either on the night of the party or in the next day or two. The classmate said that he is  one-hundred-per-cent sure  that he was told at the time that Kavanaugh was the student who exposed himself to Ramirez.During her own appearance on CBS This Morning, Mayer stated that this person was not a witness, but someone who  heard it from someone who was there.  But we do not know who that someone is, and both the New Yorker and the New York Times aggressively tried to reach out to anyone who was part of this circle.Another former student remembered hearing about an incident regarding an exposed penis but did not remember either Kavanaugh or Ramirez being attached to it:Richard Oh, an emergency-room doctor in California, recalled overhearing, soon after the party, a female student tearfully recounting to another student an incident at a party involving a gag with a fake penis, followed by a male student exposing himself. Oh is not certain of the identity of the female student.But again, the only actual witnesses told the New Yorker it never happened, that Kavanaugh did no such thing, and that they witnessed no such thing.Kavanaugh himself unequivocally denies the incident and called it a  smear. For its part, on Monday morning, the left-wing New York Times corroborated the New Yorker s reporting about Ramirez s own witnesses contradicting her account, plus her troubling memory issues:The Times had interviewed several dozen people over the past week in an attempt to corroborate her story, and could find no one with firsthand knowledge. Ms. Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates asking if they recalled the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself.Bottom line: reporting from both the New Yorker and the New York Times not only back up Kavanaugh s claim he is innocent but every witness named by his accusers also back up Kavanaugh.Meanwhile, despite the facts, Democrats are still working behind the scenes to turn a fuzzy 35-year-old memory into one that perfectly fits their agenda to destroy this man.Had the New Yorker not published the complete story, we would not know any of this, and I cannot think of anything more newsworthy. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/brett-kavanaugh-defies-grotesque-character-assassination-from-the-left/","Supreme Court Nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh responded to the latest allegations of sexual misconduct on Monday by denouncing them as smears. These are smears, pure and simple. And they debase our public discourse,  he wrote in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  But they are also a threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination   if allowed to succeed   will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service. Kavanuagh s letter expressed frustration with his delayed confirmation vote despite repeating his willingness to testify about the accusations from Christine Ford and a second  uncorroborated  report in the New Yorker.He also remained defiant against the recent attacks against his character and his family. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process,  he wrote.  The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. The last-minute character assassination will not succeed. President Donald Trump stood by Kavanaugh on Monday, telling reporters in New York City that he backed his nominee to the Supreme Court  all the way.  In my opinion, it is totally political,  he said, calling the allegations  one of the single-most unfair, unjust things to happen to a candidate for anything. 2018-09-24 Kavanaugh Letter to Chairman Grassley

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/24/limbaugh-if-gop-does-not-get-kavanaugh-confirmed-kiss-the-midterms-goodbye/","Monday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh warned congressional Republicans against folding on the confirmation of Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh.According to Limbaugh, if Republicans do fail to confirm, they will compromise any chances they had at holding on to either chamber of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections.Partial transcript as follows (courtesy RushLimbaugh.com):So Chairman Grassley has a job to do here, because if he gives Democrats enough time, they ll produce a woman claiming to be Kavanaugh s secret Russian wife who Trump paid to urinate on that bed in Moscow. If Grassley waits long enough, the Democrats will come up with the woman claiming to be Kavanaugh s secret Russian wife.   he s a bigamist, too, don t you know   and Trump paid Kavanaugh s second wife to hire a bunch of prostitutes to urinate on the bed Obama slept in while in Moscow.If Grassley doesn t get a handle on this and just do   and I ll tell you something else, which everybody also knows. If the Republicans do not get this vote taken and have Kavanaugh confirmed, you can kiss the midterms goodbye. You can kiss goodbye holding the House and you can kiss goodbye holding the Senate. Because whatever the Democrats think of their base, the one thing I know that if you guys fold on this and cave and keep bending over backwards  You ve done that enough. You ve demonstrated that you don t hate women.You ve demonstrated that you re other open-minded. You ve demonstrated that you re gonna hear from her. You re never gonna hear from her! She s never gonna show up. She s not telling a story that can be verified, Senator Grassley. She s not gonna show up. If you guys don t conduct this vote in defiance of all this and if Avenatti gets one foot in the door to a Senate committee to start telling his story, then you can kind of kiss good-bye Republican chances in the midterms in November.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/flashback-chuck-schumer-pledged-oppose-kavanaugh-everything-i-have/","Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) promised he would launch an aggressive anti-Brett Kavanaugh campaign, saying he would oppose  Judge Kavanaugh s nomination with everything  he has, which he stated the same day in July that President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.On July 9, President Trump announced Judge Brett Kavanaugh as his nominee for the Supreme Court. The same day, Schumer announced that he planned to launch an aggressive campaign to oppose Kavanaugh s nomination. He would do it, he said,  with everything I have  because the  stakes are simply too high :I will oppose Judge Kavanaugh s nomination with everything I have, and I hope a bipartisan majority will do the same. The stakes are simply too high for anything less. Read my full statement on #WhatsAtStake: https://t.co/BYtcB3LWWB  #StopKavanaugh pic.twitter.com/5f2Bomxltb  Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) July 10, 2018 I m calling on Americans from all walks of life to make their voices heard from now until the end of this battle,  Schumer said.The New York Democrat continued:This nomination could alter the balance of the court in favor of powerful special interests and against working families for a generation and would take away labor, civil, and human rights from millions of Americans. We cannot let that happen. If we can successfully block this nomination, it could lead to a more independent, moderate selection that both parties could support [Emphasis added].Soon after Schumer s statements, reports emerged regarding Senate Democrats  tactics to delay and disrupt the Senate confirmation process. During the Senate Judiciary Committee s confirmation hearings, many leftist protesters shouted and disrupted the proceedings. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) admitted he and Senate Democrat leadership participated in conference calls to coordinate with leftist protesters to disrupt the hearings.Immediately after the hearings, Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) referred a letter to the FBI that led the Washington Post to reveal that Christine Blasey Ford, a California psychologist, accuses Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both in high school.Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) subsequently delayed the committee s confirmation vote to hold a hearing with Kavanaugh and Ford. Grassley scheduled the hearing for this Thursday.On Sunday, the New Yorker broke an accusation from Deborah Ramirez, a woman claiming that as a Yale University 18-year-old freshman, Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a drunken party. Ramirez reportedly spent six days discussing this with her lawyer before she was certain it was Kavanaugh.Sen. Feinstein then said that in light of the second accusation against Kavanaugh, the Thursday hearing should be canceled to investigate all of the claims against the Supreme Court nominee:Thursday s hearing should be canceled in light of a disturbing new allegation of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh. The FBI must investigate ALL allegations.  Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) September 24, 2018Ranking member Feinstein then wrote a letter to chairman Grassley demanding additional delays and investigations into the accusations:I am writing to request an immediate postponement of any further proceedings related to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. I also ask that the newest allegations of sexual misconduct be referred to the FBI for investigation and that you join our request for the White House to direct the FBI to investigate the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford as well as these new claims.Similarly to Feinstein, Schumer called for an independent background check to investigate the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh. Schumer asked rhetorically,  If President Trump and Senate Republicans are so certain the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh aren t true, then why are they blocking the FBI from reopening the background check and investigating a routine practice for judicial nominees? Schumer added,  What are they hiding?

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/every-witness-named-kavanaughs-accusers-sides-kavanaugh/","The two women making sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh claim to have witnesses, but so far, all of their witnesses back Kavanaugh s claim that nothing happened.It might be difficult to remember this as Democrats and the media throw around phrases like  second accuser  and  attempted sexual assault  and  exposing himself  against the Supreme Court nominee. But the facts are still the facts, and every single witness named so far by both accusers say they witnessed nothing of the sort.The first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, is accusing Kavanaugh of attempting to assault her at a house party in 1982 when she was 15 and he was 17. She named three people who were at the party: PJ Smyth, Mark Judge, and Leland Ingham Keyser.By submitting their respective statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee, all three witnesses did so under penalty of imprisonment, and all three have zero recollection of the house party in question.The one witness whom Ford said was in the room when the alleged misconduct took place (Mark Judge) denies it happened. Moreover, another witness, a lifelong friend of Ford s, not only cannot remember the house party, she says she has never met Kavanaugh.PJ Smyth:I understand that I have been identified by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as the person she remembers as  PJ  who supposedly was present at the party she described in her statements to the Washington Post. I am issuing this statement today to make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh. Personally speaking, I have known Brett Kavanaugh since high school and I know him to be a person of great integrity, a great friend, and I have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women.Mark Judge said,  I have no memory of the alleged incident. Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school but I do not recall the party described in Dr. Ford s letter. More to the point, I never saw Brett act in the manner Ford describes. Leland Ingham Keyser stated,  Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford. The above is an email that Keyser s attorney, Howard Walsh, sent to the Judiciary Committee.Furthermore, Keyser is the ex-wife of Democrat operative Bob Beckel and currently produces his podcast. According to public reports, she has only ever donated to Democrats. The far-left CNN reports that Keyser and Ford are  lifelong friends. For his own part, and under penalty of imprisonment, Kavanaugh not only denies any allegation that he acted improperly with Ford (or anyone), he denies being at this party   a party no one other than Ford remembers.A second accuser came forward Sunday night in a piece the New Yorker s Ronan Farrow co-authored. Deborah Ramirez alleges that an 18-year-old Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken 1983 dorm party at Yale.By any standard, this story is a mess, including Ramirez s own  recollection.  She admits she was drinking heavily at the party and that there are  significant gaps in her memory of the evening. When the New Yorker first contacted Ramirez, she said she could not say if it was Kavanaugh who exposed himself. But after  six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, Ramirez said that she felt confident enough of her recollections to say that she remembers Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party. The New Yorker added that it  has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party. In other words, like the Ford allegation, the New Yorker is not only unable to verify that Kavanaugh exposed himself, none of the witnesses can confirm Kavanaugh even attended the party.The only so-called corroboration comes from an anonymous source who claims to have heard the story second hand. He says,  Another student told him about the incident either on the night of the party or in the next day or two.  Another former classmate remembers hearing something about this but has no recollection of who was involved.But the witnesses Ramirez actually named say nothing happened:Witness 1:One of the male classmates who Ramirez said egged on Kavanaugh denied any memory of the party.  I don t think Brett would flash himself to Debbie, or anyone, for that matter,  he said. Asked why he thought Ramirez was making the allegation, he responded,  I have no idea. Witness 2: stated,  The other male classmate who Ramirez said was involved in the incident commented, I have zero recollection.  Classmates 3, 4, and 5:In a statement, two of those male classmates who Ramirez alleged were involved in the incident, the wife of a third male student she said was involved, and three other classmates, Dino Ewing, Louisa Garry, and Dan Murphy, disputed Ramirez s account of events:  We were the people closest to Brett Kavanaugh during his first year at Yale. He was a roommate to some of us, and we spent a great deal of time with him, including in the dorm where this incident allegedly took place. Some of us were also friends with Debbie Ramirez during and after her time at Yale. We can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it and we did not. The behavior she describes would be completely out of character for Brett. In addition, some of us knew Debbie long after Yale, and she never described this incident until Brett s Supreme Court nomination was pending. Editors from the New Yorker contacted some of us because we are the people who would know the truth, and we told them that we never saw or heard about this. Ramirez s best friend at Yale: This is a woman I was best friends with. We shared intimate details of our lives. And I was never told this story by her, or by anyone else. It never came up. I didn t see it; I never heard of it happening.  She said she hadn t spoken with Ramirez for about ten years, but that the two women had been close all through college, and Kavanaugh had remained part of what she called their  larger social circle. In a statement released Sunday, Kavanaugh called the Ramirez allegation a  smear, plain and simple,  and added (accurately),  People who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. Once you separate the media sensationalism and the political posturing from the actual facts, what we have here is a remarkable situation where every witness named by Kavanaugh s accusers  sides with Kavanaugh. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

I mean, the facts will be determined by an investigation and, Mike, I have absolutely no idea why the Republicans can t do exactly what you just said, pump the brakes, investigate this for a couple of more weeks and if they are correct and these women are lying then Judge Kavanaugh will be in great shape and if it s an FBI investigation these women will be going to jail, so the question is what are Republicans afraid of if the truth is on their side?  he asked.Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Mia Farrow (@MiaFarrow) September 23, 2018It s not apparent that Farrow s tweet was part of a longer thread but it did come hours before her son, Ronan Farrow, published a New Yorker article which included allegations of inappropriate drunken behavior by Judge Brett Kavanaugh by Deborah Ramirez. Ramirez told the paper she had  significant gaps in her memories  regarding the encounter in question. Ramirez, college best friend admits,  I never heard of it. The woman s allegations come weeks after Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of groping her at a party in the summer of 1982, when he was 17-years-old. Four people Ford said were present at the 1982 party have either said they have no knowledge of the alleged event or have denied her account.Clarence Thomas, who was nominated in July 1991 by President George H. W. Bush to replace the deceased Justice Thurgood Marshall, the Court s first black justice. Anita Hill had accused Thomas of sexual harassment while the pair worked for the federal government. Thomas  Senate confirmation hearing was an intense battle that saw several Democratic Senators attack Thomas, who famously described the process as a  circus,  a  national disgrace,  and  as a black American, it is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you.

I think it changes the whole story because it s another credible corroborated allegation of sexual misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh a long time ago, and senators are going to have to decide whether it matters to them,  Toobin said.  I think it does change things, but this is an election with 100 voters, and we will see if they are interested in these facts. He went on to say,  What s striking about the allegation, it is similar in atmospherics to the high school allegation: The excessive drinking and the coercive relationship with women. If you read Mark Judge, the alleged accomplice in the first assault, the world he describes at Georgetown Prep of really absurd amounts of drinking, weird hostility towards women. It s all of a piece. It is all consistent with one another. Are they all lies? Perhaps, but it certainly has a ring of truth to me.  The question is what are people going to do with this? The idea that it s all made up seems sort of preposterous at this point. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Judge Kavanaugh is an outstanding person, and I am with him all the way,  Trump told reporters after arriving at the United Nations Monday.Trump commented on the unsubstantiated allegations as Senate Republicans prepare to hear testimony from Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault more than 30 years ago. He s a fine man with an unblemished past. These are highly unsubstantiated statements from people represented by lawyers. You should look into the lawyers doing the representations,  Trump said.The president signaled frustration with the delay of the Senate vote and questioned accusations leveled against Kavanaugh. There s a chance that this could be one of the single-most unfair, unjust things to happen to a candidate for anything,  Trump said, dismissing  people coming out of the woodwork  with accusations against Kavanaugh after he was nominated to the Supreme Court. In my opinion, it is totally political,  he added.The president is spending most of the week in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the Senate Judiciary Committee s ranking Democrat, is demanding Sunday that Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) agree to another delay in the additional hearing on Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh set for Thursday.The hearing was finally set Saturday when Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford s legal team agreed tentatively to appear after continual delays and breakdowns in negotiation over requests such as wanting Kavanaugh to defend himself before the accuser testifies.Then, Sunday, Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer of the New Yorker broke a new accusation by Deborah Ramirez, a woman claiming an 18-year-old Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a drunken party as a Yale University freshman. Ramirez, according to Farrow and Mayer, took six days of discussion with her lawyer before she was sure it was Kavanaugh.Thursday s hearing should be canceled in light of a disturbing new allegation of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh. The FBI must investigate ALL allegations.  Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) September 24, 2018In response, Feinstein quickly penned a letter to Grassley with additional demands for delays and investigations. I am writing to request an immediate postponement of any further proceedings related to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh,  the letter reads.  I also ask that the newest allegations of sexual misconduct be referred to the FBI for investigation, and that you join our request for the White House to direct the FBI to investigate the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford as well as these new claims. Feinstein goes on to cite Farrow and Mayer s additional reporting about  jungle juice -fueled sexual assaults by other students at the 1980s Georgetown Prep and an ex-girlfriend of Mark Judge:Today, Deborah Ramirez came forward with serious allegations of sexual misconduct by Judge Kavanaugh. The New Yorker article recounting her experience states that there are witnesses who can corroborate her claims and who challenge Mr. Judge s account. An investigation needs to be conducted as part of Judge Kavanaugh s background investigation by career professionals at the FBI  not partisan staff of the Committee.Grassley has yet to issue a public response to Ramirez s claims or Feinstein s requests.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/23/ramirez-yale-classmates-deny-kavanaugh-allegations/","WASHINGTON, DC  The second woman accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of inappropriate drunken behavior, Deborah Ramirez, admits  significant gaps in her memories  regarding the college party in question. Critics note her allegations come after six days of consulting with a Democratic lawyer, other persons she claims were at the party deny her account, and even her college best friend admits,  I never heard of it. Despite focused efforts by Democratic political operatives and left-wing lawyer Debra Katz, the recent account of Christine Blasey Ford appears to be unraveling. Each of the four people she claimed to be present at a 1982 party where she claimed an intoxicated 17-year-old Kavanaugh groped her have either denied her account or said they have no knowledge of it.As that line of attack on President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee falters, another Democrat-supported accuser has suddenly emerged.While allegedly heavily drinking in 1983 at a party when she and Kavanaugh were freshmen at Yale, Ramirez told the New Yorker that she  became inebriated  and  was on the floor, foggy and slurring her words  during the event in question. Ramirez acknowledged that there are significant gaps in her memories of the evening,  the left-wing magazine explains.  Her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident.  However, after she had been coached for six days by a lawyer who is a former Democratic local elected official,  Ramirez said that she felt confident enough of her recollections to say that she remembers Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party. Individuals she said were present at the time deny her accusations today, the New Yorker acknowledges.  One of the male classmates who Ramirez said egged on Kavanaugh denied any memory of the party. I don t think Brett would flash himself to Debbie, or anyone, for that matter,  he said.  I have no recollection,  said a second person she claimed was an eye-witness.The New Yorker admits that it  has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party. Four Yale graduates who were friends with both Kavanaugh and Ramirez said  with confidence  if the episode had ever occurred, they  would have seen or heard about it and we did not.  They add that it  would be completely out of character for Brett,  and the first Ramirez said anything about it was when Kavanaugh was nominated for the Supreme Court. This is a woman I was best friends with. We shared intimate details of our lives,  added another woman, whose wedding both Ramirez and Kavanaugh attended.  And I was never told this story by her, or by anyone else. It never came up. I didn t see it; I never heard of it happening. Kavanaugh is also denying the allegation:This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen. The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple. I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name  and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building  against these last-minute allegations.The White House is standing by Kavanaugh. Officials note that Sen. Mazie Hirono s (D-HI) quote in the New Yorker story shows that Democratic senators are colluding with media outlets to create news stories against the judge instead of working with the Senate Judiciary Committee when they become aware of issues.Outside groups are likewise pushing back hard against this latest attack. Judicial Crisis Network Chief Counsel Carrie Severino said in a statement:Senate Republicans must not allow unsubstantiated and discredited allegations from over three decades ago to destroy the life and reputation of a good man. Countless people from every phase of Brett Kavanaugh s life have testified that he is a good man of the highest character and integrity. Chuck Schumer vowed to oppose Kavanaugh with everything he s got, and apparently that took the form of character assassination. This has all of the ingredients of a smear campaign on steroids. Senate Republicans should stand up to these unsubstantiated and discredited allegations and move forward with a vote to confirm Kavanaugh.Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) currently plans to hold a hearing on Kavanaugh s nomination on Thursday, September 27.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

The White House called it  the latest in a coordinated smear campaign by the Democrats designed to tear down a good man. Farrow and Mayer admit that Deborah Ramirez, the woman making the accusation, acknowledges being drunk at the party where she alleges the incident occurred, and that  her memories contained gaps.  They also note:  The New Yorker has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party. The magazine contacted several dozen classmates of Ramirez and Kavanaugh regarding the incident. Many did not respond to interview requests; others declined to comment, or said they did not attend or remember the party. One classmate of Ramirez, who declined to be named, said that he was told later about the party and that he remembered being told that Kavanaugh had behaved as described. Others had apparently also heard similar stories but not the names of those involved.However, a woman who described herself as Ramirez s best friend at the time told the New Yorker that she never heard about the story:  I was never told this story by her, or by anyone else. It never came up. I didn t see it; I never heard of it happening. Farrow and Mayer also explore other allegations about wild behavior involving  Kavanaugh and his social scene,  without connecting him to further allegations.They note that Kavanaugh had previously told the Senate Judiciary Committee, in response to a standard question from Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) that he had never committed any sexual misconduct as a  legal adult.  Kavanaugh would have been 18 at the time of the alleged incident.Read the full story here.Joel B.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/23/5-more-dirty-tricks-democrats-could-still-try-to-derail-brett-kavanaugh/","Democrats are determined to sink Judge Brett Kavanaugh s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court even if Christine Blasey Ford s original accusation unravels   as it is beginning to do, with all four named witnesses thus far contradicting her story.But the left is not above dirty tricks   such as failing to mention the accusation against Kavanaugh until after the confirmation hearings   and there are several more Democrats could pull that might have the potential to block Kavanaugh regardless.1. Create additional accusations. Even assuming that Dr. Ford s story is true, one of the problems that Democrats have faced is that Kavanaugh has shown no similar pattern of behavior. But if one or more new accusers emerged, that could create new suspicions that would at least delay his confirmation. The accusations would not need to be true; they would just need to cast the judge in a negative light. (Sunday night s  dildo  story, apparently in the works from the New Yorker, is a perfect example.)2. Instigate a local prosecution. If state or county prosectors were to announce that they were investigating Kavanaugh for attempted rape, which has no statue of limitations in Maryland, that could end his confirmation. If that sounds far-fetched, State Sen. Cheryl Kagan (D-Montgomery) has already tried it, urging Gov. Larry Hogan to order an investigation by state police. He refused, but prosectors in the office of the Montgomery County state s attorney   a Democrat   are noncommittal.3. Block the hearing. Ford s claims could look less credible by Thursday. Kavanaugh reportedly produced calendars from 1982 on Sunday showing he was out of town for much of the period in question. If so, Democrats might not want Ford to testify   but might want to delay a committee vote. They praised the protesters who interrupted Kavanaugh s confirmation hearing earlier this month; they could arrange massive protests during or before the hearing to disrupt it and delay the process.4. Organize a Bar protest. The left-leaning American Bar Association (ABA) gave Kavanaugh a unanimous  well-qualified  rating before his confirmation hearings. But Democrats could organize left-leaning lawyers to pressure the ABA to revise that conclusion, or to issue a statement of protest. Alternatively, they could organize a  lawyers  protest  of their own, stating that they will refuse to argue cases before the Supreme Court so long as Kavanaugh is seated without a full FBI investigation.5. Character assassination. If Ford s story falls apart, the campaign against Kavanaugh will go down as one of the worst smear campaigns in American history. But Democrats have time to make it even worse. They can ratchet up the pressure on the judge and his family to the point where he concludes it is simply not worth the effort. Already, the Washington Post is reporting that Kavanaugh refused to answer some personal questions in mock hearings   hinting, perhaps, at worse to come.Joel B.

Allegations against Brett Kavanaugh! Fallout from Hurricane Florence! Surely this would be a bad week for Trump. But at every turn, the establishment media fell on their faces trying to pin down Trump, telling bald-faced lies, fostering strange obsessions, and making gross analogies that exposed them as dishonest and ridiculous.The week started out with CNN host Anderson Cooper dedicating almost 10 minutes to  debunking  a tweet from Donald Trump Jr.Last weekend, Trump Jr. posted a story from Breitbart News about CNN s falling ratings (written by this reporter), along with a photo of Anderson Cooper standing in waist-deep water while his camera crew was on much higher ground.The photo was not from the recent Hurricane Florence, but was actually from Hurricane Ike in 2008.Though some Twitter users falsely claimed otherwise, Trump Jr. never once claimed the photo was from Florence.On Monday night, Cooper dedicated a long-winded segment to  debunking  Trump Jr. s tweet, and later followed up by tweeting,  what are the chances DonaldJTrumpJr apologizes for lying about me? Im not holding my breath. what are the chances @DonaldJTrumpJr apologizes for lying about me? Im not holding my breath. Check out the video below rebutting his false claim. https://t.co/r8fRX7VM3e  Anderson Cooper (@andersoncooper) September 18, 2018During his monologue, Cooper said: Now, over the weekend, however, the son of the president, Donny Jr., tweeted out this picture of me in waist high water, my camera crew, a few feet away, on higher ground, in only a little bit of water. Donny Jr. was claiming it showed me in Florence faking the depths of flood waters in order to somehow harm his father. And I quote from his tweet stop lying to try to make @realDonaldTrump look bad.  This is a total lie Trump Jr. never said that the photo was from Florence.Trump Jr. responded on Twitter, accusing CNN of  Crying & Lying. CNN doing what they do best. Crying & Lying.@AC360 says I said it was a pic from FlorenceIsaid no such thing. evidence  CNN provided doesn t even reference Florence. You guys can t even fact check a meme. The illusion created by the pic is illustrative of the bs you sell! https://t.co/wnRSns1Thf  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 18, 2018 Not surprised AC360 lied about me on CNN last night. Par for the course. I never said the pic of him was from Florence. When I tweeted out the picture of AC360 it was with a link to an article about CNN s dwindling ratings. Nothing to do with Florence,  Trump Jr. added.Not surprised @AC360 lied about me on @CNN last night. Par for the course.

Nothing to do with Florence. https://t.co/fflwOa10GK  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 18, 2018The establishment media also embarrassed themselves with their focus on porn star Stormy Daniels  upcoming bookfocusing on strange, personal details about President Trump s penis that Daniels claims to have seen when the two had an alleged sexual encounter in 2006.CNN host Jake Tapper dedicated a segment on his show to Daniels book, during which the appearance of President Trump s penis is discussed. Lots of books claim to be tell-alls, but they don t follow through. Stormy Daniels  new book about her life is not that book. Wow. She tells all,  Tapper said to introduce the segment.During the piece, CNN correspondent Sara Sidner recalls how Daniels describes Trump s penis. When Daniels came out of the bathroom, she claims Trump was lying on the bed in his underwear. They had sex. She then describes his genitalia in great detail. His penis is distinctive in a certain way,  she writes. Proof, her attorney Michael Avenatti says, she is tired of being called a liar by Trump s people. Late night hosts also went into full obsession mode over Trump s genitals, with Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, and Seth Meyers all dedicating bits to Trump s penis.Finally, in reporting on the controversy surrounding allegations made against Brett Kavanaugh, many in the media catapulted themselves into full dishonesty mode.CNN s Jim Acosta played a blatantly misleading video clip of a speech Brett Kavanaugh gave in 2015.Jim Acosta on the 2015 Kavanaugh clip (which CNN edits so it begins after the reference to his three male friends):  There are portions of his childhood he d rather not come to light.  Note how even Susan Hennessy thinks he s reaching. pic.twitter.com/swDqI2YcHh  Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 18, 2018Meanwhile, CNN s Chris Cillizza lied in a tweet, falsely accusing Trump of  telling the FBI to ignore an allegation of sexual assault. No big deal: Just the president telling the FBI to ignore an allegation of sexual assault https://t.co/lvO8w9ccOm  Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) September 18, 2018As Breitbart News  John Nolte wrote:To begin with, in his statement, all the president did was reiterate what the FBI has already said. On two occasions, through the Department of Justice, and independent of Trump, the FBI accurately pointed out that their agency does not investigate local sexual misconduct allegations, especially ones that happened 36 years ago when both parties were still teenagers in high school.The worst part of Cillizza s lie, though, is that if you look at Trump s precise words, he actually said he would support the FBI had they decided to get involved   which is the exact opposite of  telling the FBI to ignore  the matter. I don t think the FBI really should be involved because they don t want to be involved,  Trump said, adding,  if they wanted to be I would certainly do that, but as you know they say this is not really their thing. Finally, a number of Republican women bucked the narrative and defended Brett Kavanaugh to CNN reporter Randi Kaye during a segment that aired on Anderson Cooper 360 Thursday. Because one woman made an allegationsorry, I don t buy it,  one woman told CNN s Kaye. Kaye asked the group of women,  Why would she come forward if this wasn t true? Because it has basically destroyed her family. She s had to move. She s gone undercover. She s gotten death threats. So if she s lying, why come forward?  She s also destroying his life, his wife s life, his children s lives. His career. I mean, why didn t she come out sooner if she s telling the truth?  a woman named Irina Villarino responded.MSNBC s Chris Hayes closed off the week by sending an unhinged tweet comparing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court to rape on Friday. So even though Dr Ford is saying please stop, slow down, I m not comfortable with the way this is going, the GOP is gonna plow through, ignore her telling them to stop and just take what they think is rightfully theirs?  Hayes tweeted.So even though Dr Ford is saying please stop, slow down, I m not comfortable with the way this is going, the GOP is gonna plow through, ignore her telling them to stop and just take what they think is rightfully theirs?

That s really all they care about here. It is not about get the truth and it is not showing respect for this witness.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/23/megyn-kelly-blasts-dianne-feinstein-you-did-nothing-about-ford-allegation-for-weeks/","NBC s Megyn Kelly took to Twitter on Sunday morning to blast Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) for calling Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who is accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in high school, a  survivor of attempted rape. Feinstein tweeted Saturday that Republicans had been  bullying  Ford in an effort to confirm Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court   echoing fellow Democrats, who also used the word  bullying.  She referred to Ford as a  survivor of attempted rape    even though Kavanaugh has denied her accusation, and every witness Ford has mentioned has contradicted her account.It s clear that Republicans have learned nothing over the last 27 years. Bullying a survivor of attempted rape in order to confirm a nominee particularly at a time when she s receiving death threats is an extreme abuse of power. https://t.co/XoAcqEQF1a  Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) September 21, 2018Feinstein also linked to a statement in which she blasted Republicans for their insistence (at the time) on holding a hearing with Ford on Monday as scheduled:  I m shocked and appalled by the Republicans  refusal to wait 24 hours for a hearing. In response, Kelly tweeted that Feinstein had no way to know if Ford was a survivor of attempted rape. She added that Feinstein was implicated by her own reasoning, since she sat on Ford s claims for nine weeks without bringing them forward:A lot of nerve here from the woman who did nothing about this allegation for weeks   and by the way, you don t know if she is a survivor of an attempted rape. She may well be, but how about WE HEAR THE EVIDENCE FIRST and engage in at least a semblance of fairness? https://t.co/iobd0UWT8h  Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) September 23, 2018Kelly claimed in her recent book that former Fox News chief Roger Ailes had sexually harassed her and other women, and famously confronted Donald Trump at the first Republican presidential debate in 2015 over his alleged treatment of women.Joel B.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/23/democrats-claim-republicans-are-bullying-christine-blasey-ford/","Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee and beyond accused Republicans this weekend of  bullying  Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of groping her in high school over 35 years ago.Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said last Thursday that Republicans were  bullying  Ford by saying that they would hold a vote on Kavanaugh if she did not accept an invitation to testify Monday. Republicans have since relented, and extendeded their deadline for Ford to accept their invitation several times until apparently acquiescing in her demand to testify on Thursday.Nevertheless, Democrats continued to complain Republicans were  bullying  Ford by asking her to tell her story under oath.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, tweeted on Friday that Republicans were  bullying  a  survivor of attempted rape :It s clear that Republicans have learned nothing over the last 27 years. Bullying a survivor of attempted rape in order to confirm a nominee particularly at a time when she s receiving death threats is an extreme abuse of power. https://t.co/XoAcqEQF1a  Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) September 21, 2018Fellow committee member Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) agreed Saturday:Courageously, Dr. Ford will tell her story in the face of an impossible choice & vile bullying by Republican leadership. I will support her steadfast bravery against the arbitrary, unfair, irrational constraints set by Chairman Grassley.  Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) September 22, 2018Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) repeated the  bullying  claim on Sunday, comparing it to the alleged  mistreatment  of Anita Hill in the Clarence Thomas hearings in 1991:Witnessing the bullying of Dr. Ford reminds me so much of the mistreatment Anita Hill endured after bravely coming forward to share her story.I came into the US Senate because I didn t want to see another woman or any survivor treated that way again. https://t.co/BR0WIqCQJ1  Senator Patty Murray (@PattyMurray) September 23, 2018And Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) accused Republicans of  bullying  Ford by insisting on a  sham  hearing with  no witnesses    though all of the potential witnesses have denied Ford s account:If Dr. Ford has the courage to come before the committee, the committee should have the decency to hold a REAL hearing, with relevant witnesses, and to treat her with dignity and respect. NO BULLYING and no sham hearing!  Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) September 23, 2018And Ford s attorney, Debra Katz, has also accused Republicans of using deadlines  to bully  her client gratuitously.Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) had finally had enough on Sunday:Chairman Grassley has spent 7 days working to accommodate Dr Ford so the Senate could hear her testimony.He s offered open/closed hearings, sending staff to her, and has delayed the entire committee agenda for her countless times.Calling this  bullying  is simply outrageous  Senator Hatch Office (@senorrinhatch) September 23, 2018The Judiciary committee s Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI), who said last week men should  shut up  about the issue, told CNN s Jake Tapper on State of the Union Sunday morning that Kavanaugh is not entitled to the presumption of innocence, and that Democrats may continue to investigate the accusation against him even if is confirmed to the Supreme Court by the Senate.Joel B.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/23/hirono-refuses-to-say-kavanaugh-has-presumption-of-innocence-women-need-to-be-believed/","Sunday on CNN s  State of the Union,  Senate Judiciary Committee member Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) refused to say Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh is presumed innocent regarding the allegation by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.Partial transcript as follows:TAPPER: The  Wall Street Journal  editorial board wrote a piece about the presumption of guilt, they say. They quoted you directly to argue that a core tenet of American law is not being applied to Kavanaugh. They write, quote,  The Democratic standard for sexual assault allegations is, they should be accepted as true merely for having been made. The accuser is assumed to be telling the truth because the accuser is a woman. The burden is on Mr. Kavanaugh to prove his innocence. This turns American justice and due process upside down. What s your response?HIRONO: If  The Wall Street Journal  really cares about due process, I would say that they should care that there is no independent investigation of these allegations. I think that this kind of attitude is what makes it really difficult for victims and survivors of these kinds of traumatic events to even come forward. You know, we don t seem to have come very far from the Anita Hill days. But, as I said, for  The Wall Street Journal  to come out and talk to us about, talk to me about due process, or all the women out there that I m hearing about who never came forward, it is really important, not only for these survivors to be heard, but if their stories are credible, as Dr. Ford s story is, they need to be believed.TAPPER: So, four people said to be at the party Ford described have denied knowledge of the incident, Brett Kavanaugh, obviously, Mark Judge, who she says was in the room, P.J. Smith, and even Ford s longtime friend Leland Keyser. So there hasn t been a law enforcement investigation, but there are these statements from the four people she remembers being there who don t remember the incident or don t even remember being at the party in question, according to her friend Leland Keyser, who says she believes herHIRONO: Yes.TAPPER:  but doesn t have any memory of it.HIRONO: Yes.TAPPER: Doesn t Kavanaugh have the same presumption of innocence as anyone else in America?HIRONO: I put his denial in the context of everything that I know about him in terms of how he approaches his cases. As I said, his credibility is already very questionable in my mind and in the minds of a lot of my fellow Judiciary Committee members, the Democrats. So he comes, and   when I say that he s very outcome-driven, he has an ideological agenda, is very outcome-driven. And I can sit here and talk to you about some of the cases that exemplifies his, in my view, inability to be fair in the cases that come before him. This is a person that is going to be sitting on our Supreme Court, making decisions that will impact women s reproductive choice. He has a   he very much is against women s reproductive choice.TAPPER: Mm-hmm.HIRONO: And I can tell you two very important cases in which he applied the same standard, but came to totally different results to make it much harder for women to get this kind of coverage. So there s   there are so many indications of his own lack of credibility. And I put that in a context.TAPPER: It sounds to me like you re saying, because you don t trust him on policy and because you don t believe him when he says, for instance, that he does not have an opinion on Roe v. Wade, you don t believe him about this allegation about what happened at this party in 1982? Is that fair?HIRONO: Well, without   this is why it is so important that there be at least an investigation, so that there s some effort at collaboration. And we think that there was a lot of drinking going on. As far as the friend, his friend Mark Judge, not even testifying, that is astounding to me. He was right there in that room. He refuses to testify.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Trey Gowdy (R-SC) said he was  really disappointed  with senators who have already decided whether or not to believe either Dr. Christine Blasey Ford or Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Gowdy said,  My bias is toward sex assault victims. I spent 20 years believing them sometimes when nobody else did. I am used to the beyond a reasonable doubt. That is an incredibly high burden, but it ought to be if you re going to take away someone s freedom. It also ought to be a high burden when you are going to impact someone s reputation. And make no mistake both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh will live with consequences of this for the remainder of their lives. But- but as it relates to Judge Kavanaugh when you have been accused of something that is a crime it s an incredibly serious crime. It is a crime that goes to the heart of your character. He added,  I think American people expect there to be a high evidentiary burden, and I m really disappointed when I hear senators say they either believe or don t believe witnesses that they have never interviewed or heard from. How can you do that John? How can you make a credibility assessment if you ve never bothered to interview either of the two principals. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

At the same time, I think the accused deserves to be heard. I think that s going to happen, which is great. The Senate has a huge responsibility here. They have to make sure it s fair.

Haley was responding to a question about President Donald Trump s tweet.I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/local/2018/09/23/dana-rohrabacher-backs-brett-kavanaugh-left-pounces/","Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) backed Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh last weekend   and the left is outraged.Rohrabacher was secretly recorded   against California law, which requires two-party consent for taped conversations   as he spoke to supporters last Saturday, before the Washington Post published Christine Blasey Ford s name and the details of her accusation last Sunday, which claims that Kavanaugh groped her at a party in high school more than 35 years ago.The tape was leaked to the liberal website Talking Points Memo, which summarized Rohrabacher s comments (at 9:54). The context was a discussion about how the government could use surveillance and  hate speech  rules to restrict freedom.: George Orwell, he was so incredibly insightful and could see what s going to happen. But that s the challenge you re going to have. At least I didn t have to worry about that   This guy who s going to be our Supreme Court justice   and he better be our Supreme Court judge   he s a perfect candidate, and what do they say? Well, in high school you did this.  High school? Give me a break. Rohrabacher is in the middle of a tough re-election race in California s 48th congressional district. A recent New York Times / Sienna College poll found that he was tied, 45%-45%, with Democrat challenger Harley Rouda.Talking Points Memo apparently tried to make the most out of the recording, publishing it after Dr. Ford s story had emerged. Several local news outlets picked up the story. However, the effect may have been the opposite of the one intended, as Ford s story has since been contradicted by every single potential witness she has named, including one of her own friends. A poll last week indicated that only 25 percent of American women believed that Dr. Ford s story about Kavanaugh is credible.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

According to the news outlet, Walsh confirmed that his client and Ford are  lifelong friend[s]. Earlier this week, a staffer for the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter the Keyser, notifying her that she was identified as an attendee of the house party where the alleged incident occurred.   I understand that you have been identified as an individual who was in attendance at a party that occurred circa 1982 described in a recent Washington Post article,  Lauren Mehler, Senior Counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee for Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) wrote.  Pursuant to our Committee s investigative practices, we would like to have a confidential phone call with you regarding the allegations made in the article about Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Responding to Walsh s statement, an attorney for Ford told NBC News that it s  not surprising  Keyser does not remember the incident because it was not discussed between the two.  It s also unremarkable that Ms. Keyser does not remember attending a specific gathering 30 years ago at which nothing of consequence happened to her,  Ford s attorney added.Dr Ford s attorney to @NBCNews:  It s not surprising that Ms Keyser has no recollection of the evening as they did not discuss it.

Smyth issued a statement of his own:I understand that I have been identified by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as the person she remembers as PJ  who supposedly was present at the party she described in her statements to the Washington Post. I am issuing this statement today to make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh.Smyth continued,  Personally speaking, I have known Brett Kavanaugh since high school and I know him to be a person of great integrity, a great friend, and I have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women. To safeguard my own privacy and anonymity, I respectfully request that the Committee accept this statement in response to any inquiry the Committee may have. Separately, Judge told the Weekly Standard that the allegation against Kavanaugh was  absolutely nuts. On Monday, Kavanaugh also denied the claim, releasing the following statement:  This is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes to her or to anyone.

Dianne Feinstein s (D-CA) staff were also a part of Saturday s negotiations. Negotiations could still falter over those details, which include who will question the woman, Christine Blasey Ford.

Dr. Ford accepts the committee s request to provide her firsthand knowledge of Brett Kavanaugh s sexual misconduct next week,  the letter read.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/22/gary-bauer-kavanaugh-confirmation-process-political-waterboarding-redux-of-clarence-thomas-hi-tech-lynching/","Gary Bauer, conservative activist and former president of the Family Research Council (FRC), said on Friday that the politicization of the Supreme Court nominee confirmation process has been going on for decades but is reaching new levels today as the United States Senate considers Brett Kavanaugh for a seat on the high court. This is a travesty,  Bauer said at the 2018 Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C.   I cannot imagine what it has felt like for Judge Kavanaugh to be in that hearing room.  It s almost like political waterboarding   that s what our political process has become,  Bauer said.Bauer, who has been in Washington for more than three decades and has witnessed the confirmation process for judges in four Republican administrations, provided a history lesson, beginning with President Ronald Reagan s nomination of Robert Bork, who was voted down because he was an atheist by a Senate that is tasked with preserving and protecting Americans  religious liberty.President George H.W. Bush nominated David Souter, who turned out not to be a conservative, but then Bush redeemed himself, Bauer said, when he nominated Clarence Thomas, in 1991, to replace Thurgood Marshall.Clarence Thomas s confirmation, like Kavanaugh s, was thrown into chaos when, near the end of the process Anita Hill,   a woman who had worked with Thomas at the United States Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)   accused him of sexual harassment in a report leaked to the media.Thomas categorically denied he had ever spoken inappropriately to Hill or shared pornographic materials with her as she claimed.Bauer said he and other Thomas supporters formed the Citizens Committee to Confirm Clarence Thomas to fight against the Democrats and pro-abortion activists who opposed him, just like Kavanaugh s opposition.But, Bauer said, rather than the loud and rude protesters at Kavanaugh s recent hearing, supporters showed up to cheer Thomas on as he faced the Senate Democrats  scathing interrogation. For Clarence Thomas   with that being the last thing he saw   walked into the hearing room, sat down at that chair and confronted those senators,  Bauer said. Imagine this young man that had grown up in poverty, raised by a single mother, had overcome all kinds of problems to get to the level where he was,  Bauer said of Thomas.  But he had made one mistake in his life. He was a black American willing to defend conservative principles. And that is why they needed to stop him. Bauer read from Thomas s now iconic testimony, which came as something new to many of the young people at the summit. This is not an opportunity to talk about difficult problems privately or in a closed environment,  Thomas said.  This is a circus.  It s a national disgrace,  Thomas said.  And from my standpoint as a black American, it is a high tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas.  And it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order this is what will happen to you,  Thomas said.  You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the U.S. Senate rather than hung from a tree.  That s what we re going through now,  Bauer said.  A circus.  When the history books that matter are written, it will show that because of Clarence Thomas  fifth vote, time and time again, that this country is a better place than it would have been otherwise,  Bauer said.Fast forward to today and Christine Blasey Ford s 11th-hour claim that Kavanaugh groped her at a party 35 years ago when the two were in high school.But even if the similarities between the nominations of Thomas and Kavanaugh are striking, the outcome his opponents seek is more than destroying a man s reputation and ambitions.That s clear from what unfolded at Kavanaugh s hearings, Bauer said, including the behavior of Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He cited Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) and their pandering to today s radical left in the Democratic Party. [Booker] knows the current grassroots of the progressive Democrat movement in this country is demanding that people like Senator Booker break all the rules to resist the duly elected president and vice president of the United States and to overturn the election results where 63 million Americans voted for [President Donald Trump],  Bauer said.Bauer also chided Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the ranking member on the committee, who has had Ford s letter since July and did not bring up its existence at Kavanaugh s hearings or in her private meeting with him. She sat on that letter hoping, I suspect, that these other tactics they were using would be able to stop judge Kavanaugh,  Bauer said.  And when it failed, then all of a sudden the letter becomes public and we are in the middle of this circus. Bauer said there is no proof yet that what Ford alleges is true, but there is something we can prove, and that s Kavanaugh s character,  which he said is clear not only in his professional record but from the dozens and dozens of people who have spoken out on his behalf.Moreover, at the end of the day, Bauer said he believes another stellar conservative will be seated on the high court. And my friends in a few weeks, when Judge Kavanaugh is sworn in as the next Supreme Court justice, we will not just be celebrating that day, we will be celebrating for the next 30 years,  Bauer said.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

A grand jury has reportedly been impaneled in that case.Bromwich and his business partner Melissa Schwartz confirmed reports he had agreed to help Christine Blasey Ford on Twitter:I m honored to be joining Debra Katz and Lisa Banks in representing Dr. Ford https://t.co/WdhWj0qmSw  Michael R. Bromwich (@mrbromwich) September 22, 2018Ford accuses Kavanaugh of having drunkenly groped her at a high school party when he was 17.Like Katz, a Democratic donor and left-wing activist, Bromwich has a long history of involvement in cases closely tied to the political ambitions of the Democratic Party. During the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s, he served as an Office of Independent Counsel prosecutor. He helped secure convictions of Reagan administration National Security Council staffer Lt. Col. Oliver North. Those convictions were all later reversed on appeal.In 2010, following the Deepwater Horizon disaster, President Barack Obama picked Bromwich to oversee efforts to overhaul offshore drilling regulations. His recommendations quickly came under fire from the energy industry for  stifling  production.In 2012, as the Fast and Furious scandal broke, Bromwich served as counsel to Jason Weinstein, a DOJ official he had originally hired in the 1990s who resigned from the department after Inspector General Michael Horowitz s report savaged him over his oversight of the ATF s  Fast and Furious  gun-walking operation.Bromwich will join Ford s team shortly after Katz sent the Senate Judiciary Committee a letter in which she claims her client  agrees  to testify. The text of that letter, however, quickly makes clear Katz has come to no agreement, having agreed neither to any of the dates offered by the committee or to any of the terms that were made clear in a letter addressed to Ford s legal team on Friday.As with all previous public communications on the matter, Katz demands further delays, which, at this point, stand the very real possibility of rendering Kavanaugh s confirmation before the start of the Supreme Court s October term impossible.

The letter requests a time on Saturday afternoon to continue negotiations.Ford s lawyers wrote:Dr. Ford accepts the Committee s request to provide her first-hand knowledge of Brett Kavanaugh s sexual misconduct next week. Although many aspects of the proposal you provided via email, on September 21, 2018, at 2:33 pm, are fundamentally inconsistent with the Committee s promise of a fair, impartial investigation into her allegations, and we are disappointed with the leaks and the bullying that have tainted the process, we are hopeful that we can reach agreement on details. Can we set up a time for later this afternoon to continue our negotiations?Sincerely,Debra S. KatzLisa BanksSenate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley has repeatedly given Ford and her attorneys offers for allowing Dr. Ford to testify about her accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh from nearly three decades ago. Grassley has given Ford s lawyer several extensions on deadlines to come to terms that Ford can agree to. Five times now we hv granted extension for Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w her desire stated one wk ago that she wants to tell senate her story Dr Ford if u changed ur mind say so so we can move on I want to hear ur testimony,  Grassley tweeted late Friday night.  Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a man of integrity with impeccable credentials and a proven judicial philosophy,  Vice President Mike Pence told hundreds at the Values Voter Summit Saturday. He called the way Democrats  conduct through the confirmation,  a disgrace, and a disservice to the Senate and the American people.  He expressed confidence that Senate Republicans would  manage this confirmation properly with the utmost respect for all concerned.  He then said he was sure that  Judge Brett Kavanaugh will soon be Justice Brett Kavanaugh and take his seat on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/22/only-25-percent-of-women-think-kavanaugh-accusations-are-credible/","A new poll from The Huffington Post indicates that only a quarter of women believe that the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh are credible.25 percent of women responding say that the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh are credible, while 35 percent say that they haven t heard enough to decide and 18 percent aren t sure, according to a new poll from HuffPost/YouGov.For men, there are less who are undecided: 28 percent say that they find the allegations credible, but 34 percent who say they are not credible. 29 percent of men haven t heard enough and 10 percent aren t sure.The poll was taken between September 17  18 and samples 1000 adults in the U.S.In a Washington Post article published Sunday, Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when he was 17 years old and  stumbling drunk  in high school in 1982.According to the Posts report, he allegedly  groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. Kavanaugh has defended himself from the accusation, saying,  I have never done anything like what the accuser describes to her or to anyone.  Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday,  he stated.Mark Judge, a classmate of Kavanaugh s who was named by Ford, said that the allegations were  absolutely nuts. Many Republicans are standing with Kavanaugh. During the Value Voters Summit Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said,  You ve watched the fight. You ve watched the tactics. But here s what I want to tell you: in the very near future, Judge Kavanaugh will be on the United States Supreme Court.  So my friends, keep the faith. Don t be rattled by all of this. We re going to plow right through it and do our jobs,  McConnell added.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/09/22/hillary-clinton-stephen-colbert-fbi-must-investigate-brett-kavanaugh/","Hillary Clinton told Stephen Colbert Friday that the FBI needs to investigate the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.The two-time presidential loser appeared on the anti-Trump late-night show to publicize the paperback version of her book What Happened. Inevitably, the conversation turned to the 36-year-old allegations against the supreme court nominee.As of now, things are at a standstill. Kavanaugh s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, has missed numerous deadlines to agree to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, even as Republicans bend over backward to accommodate her demands   some of which are being criticized as unreasonable. For example, Ford does not want Kavanaugh to have the chance to rebut her testimony, she does not want to be questioned by lawyers, and she refuses to fly in from California.Many see these as delaying tactics, as an attempt by Ford and her left-wing handlers to stretch out the process until after the election, which could kill Kavanaugh s confirmation if Democrats take over the Senate.Another delaying tactic has been this call for an FBI investigation. Although the FBI does not investigate local crimes, Ford, Democrats, and now Hillary Clinton continue to push for the FBI to get involved in an alleged incident that happened in 1982 when Kavanaugh was still a minor   17-years-old.What s more, Ford says she cannot remember where or when it happened.For his part, Kavanaugh unambiguously denies the allegation and two witnesses back him up. What s more, unlike his accuser, Kavanaugh appears eager to testify to his innocence in public and under the penalty of perjury.On Friday, Hillary not only called for the FBI to get involved, she also accused Republicans, who are now in a second week of delay, of rushing things.Republicans are  trying to rush this through to the detriment of the American public who deserves to have answers to whatever charges might be presented,  she said. So I m hoping that at some point there will be an agreement to have an investigation,  she added.  It would be very easy for the FBI to go back and finish the background investigation, to investigate these charges. The FBI has already completed six background checks on Kavanaugh. And, you know, maybe find out there s nothing to them, maybe find out there s something to them, but at least have that investigation completed. And I think that s what is a fair request, for due process to be asked for. Colbert also brought up Merrick Garland, who was President Obama s Supreme Court nominee after the 2016 death of Antonin Scalia. Do you think the nomination process in general is irreparably damaged following the Republicans not allowing Merrick Garland to be heard?  Colbert asked. Well, it s one of the reasons I think a lot of Americans are just fed up with the political process,  Clinton answered, adding,  Because in a democracy, you have to have at least enough trust to be able to work with each other and try to solve difficult problems. Referring directly to Garland, she said,  When the Republicans refused to give a distinguished judge, appointed by President Obama, even the courtesy of meetings let alone a hearing, that sent such a terrible message. What Clinton left out, though, is that Republicans refused to consider Garland because this Supreme Court opening occurred in the heat of the 2016 presidential election.The precedent for not going through a Supreme Court confirmation process during a presidential election year is nothing new. In fact, Barack Obama s own vice president backed this precedent in 1992.There was no Supreme Court vacancy in 1992. When he made those remarks (linked above), Biden was getting ahead of that possibility. But had there been a vacancy in 1992, and had the vacancy been held until after the election, it would have been Hillary Clinton s husband, President Bill Clinton, who benefited from the precedent.Lost on no one, though, except the sycophantic Colbert, is the irony of having Hillary Clinton (of all people) seriously discuss the issue of sexual misconduct. For decades Hillary has been seen as her husband s chief enabler, a man credibly accused of rape, who settled a sexual harassment suit as president, who engaged in a sleazy Oval Office sexual affair with a young subordinateThe left, including feminists, and the establishment media, never wanted the FBI to investigate any of this. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

The 53-year-old Californian now claims that in 1982, an inebriated Kavanaugh forced her into a room and groped her during a house party. Ford has stated she never mentioned the alleged incident to anyone until 2012, when she revealed it during a marriage counseling session with her husband.As Breitbart News reported, the Senate Judiciary chairman turned down Ford s request that only senators, not attorneys, be allowed to ask questions. Further, Grassley rejected her proposal that she testify after Kavanaugh, a position lawyers consider advantageous because it gives them a chance to rebut accusations. Some of your other demands, however, are unreasonable and we are unable to accommodate them. You demanded that Judge Kavanaugh be the first person to testify,  Grassley wrote in a statement.  Accommodating this demand would be an affront to fundamental notions of due process. Grassley said he would schedule a hearing for Wednesday, rather than Thursday, as Ford prefers.The Iowa lawmaker also rebuffed other Ford requests, including calling additional witnesses. Ford wants an appearance by Mark Judge, a Kavanaugh friend whom Ford asserts was at the high school party and in the bedroom where Kavanaugh s assault occurred. Ford eventually escaped.Grassley consented to other Ford demands, including that she be provided security and that Kavanaugh not be in the hearing room when she testifies.Kavanaugh s ascension to the Supreme Court seemed a sure bet until Ford emerged last weekend and provided details of the alleged assault. Kavanaugh, a District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals judge, has repeatedly denied the accusation.While rallying in support of Republican Missouri Senate candidate Josh Hawley, President Donald Trump assured supporters that Kavanaugh s confirmation is  going to happen,  while reminding them of the importance of sticking by the Supreme Court nominee. I said, We have to fight for him, not worry about the other side,   President Trump said of Kavanaugh.During his remarks before the Values Voter Summit in Washington, DC, on Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell drew a standing ovation when he assured a gathering of evangelical activists that the conservative Kavanaugh would soon be a justice.  We re going to plow right through and do our jobs,  he said.Kavanaugh had seemed to gain momentum among Republican senators this week, with growing numbers saying it was approaching time to vote and those who had voiced concern about Ford s charges stopping short of expressing opposition to Kavanaugh. But with the slender 51-49 GOP majority and the unpredictability of how Ford and Kavanaugh would come across to millions of American voters should she agree to testify, his approval remains in question.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/sen-cory-booker-admitted-to-groping-female-friend-at-15/","A Star-Ledger columnist has revisited a piece written by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, in which he admitted to  groping  a female friend at age 15.On Thursday, Paul Mulshine asked,  Guess who wrote the following :New Year s Eve 1984 I will never forget. I was 15. As the ball dropped, I leaned over to hug a friend and she met me instead with an overwhelming kiss. As we fumbled upon the bed, I remember debating my next move  as if it were a chess game. With the  Top Gun  slogan ringing in my head, I slowly reached for her breast. After having my hand pushed away once, I reached my  mark. Our groping ended soon and while no  relationship  ensued, a friendship did. You see, the next week in school she told me that she was drunk that night and didn t really know what she was doing.Mulshine had cited a portion of a piece written in 1992 by  as he calls him   our junior U.S. Senator, Cory Spartacus  Booker,  when the senator was a student at Stanford University.The column, titled  So Much for Stealing Second,  was apparently written by Booker to highlight his conversion from a 15-year-old who was  trotting around the bases and stealing second  to a  sensitive man  who came to understand women as victims of men s sexual  power plays. In his piece, Booker proudly boasted that his transformation was so stark, one college friend even referred to him as a  man-hater. In a second column, cited by Fox News, in which Booker referred to  date rape,  he admitted,  With this issue as with so many others, a dash of sincere introspection has revealed to me a dangerous gap   a gap between my beliefs and my actions. Booker s writings have drawn criticism, as they have circulated once again, since he is considered to be a potential 2020 presidential contender. But that column puts the senator in an awkward position regarding the allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by psychologist Christine Blasey Ford,  Mulshine pointed out as well.Now-Sen. Booker has called for a delay in the vote to confirm Kavanaugh, in light of Ford s accusation of sexual misconduct against the nominee  which Kavanaugh denies  over 35 years ago. It takes enormous courage to come forward publicly as Ms. Ford has,  Booker said.  The Senate owes it to her and every survivor of sexual trauma to listen to her story and gather all of the facts before moving forward with this nomination. The New Jersey Democrat also said Ford s accusations against Kavanaugh are  serious, credible, and deeply troubling,  and called for an FBI investigation into the allegations. But based on that Stanford Daily column, Booker should be giving Kavanaugh the benefit of the doubt as well,  Mulshine asserted.  The point of it was that the future senator had a wake-up call  and decided I will never be the same.  Leading Anti-Kavanaugh Senator Admitted Teen Groping https://t.co/zUqD3lNNTP  DRUDGE REPORT (@DRUDGE_REPORT) September 20, 2018Fox News reported that Booker s office denied he is guilty of any hypocrisy, and painted the senator as a victim of a  right-wing attack.  This disingenuous right-wing attack, which has circulated online and in partisan outlets for the past five years, rings hollow to anyone who reads the entirety of Senator Booker s Stanford Daily column,  Booker s spokesperson said in a statement. The column is in fact a direct criticism of a culture that encourages young men to take advantage of women  written at a time when so candidly discussing these issues was rare  and speaks to the impact Senator Booker s experience working to help rape and sexual assault survivors as a college peer counselor had on him,  the spokesperson added.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/trump-get-out-and-vote-in-the-midterms-because-youre-voting-for-me-in-2018/","President Trump delivered a rousing appeal to his supporters to get-out-the-vote for Republican candidates at a rally in Springfield, Missouri on Friday night in support of Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, the GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate seat on the ballot this November.The president also strongly supported Judge Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee to serve on the Supreme Court. We have to fight for him, not worry about the other side,  the president said he told a Republican senator in Washington of Kavanaugh.He also aggressively attacked the platform of the Democrat party. The new platform of the Democrat party is radical socialism and open borders. A vote for any Democrat this November is a vote for massive regulation, massive taxes, and massive crime,  Trump told the large and enthusiastic crowd. The Democrat party is held hostage by angry mobs, Deep State  radicals and their establishment cronies,  the president continued. We re going to be fighting [in 2018] to keep what we have,  he added. You can t be complacent  he told the crowd about the 2018 midterm elections. Get out in 2018, because you re voting for me in 2018,  the president said.The current Real Clear Politics Average of Polls shows Hawley and incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) are statistically tied in a state the president won by 19 percent in 2016.With 46 days until the election, absentee ballot voting (both by mail and in-person) begins in Missouri just four days from Friday, and the stakes in the race could not be higher. Republicans hold a slender 51 to 49 majority in the Senate, and, though the electoral map does not favor Democrats this cycle, they could regain a majority in the upper chamber of Congress with a net pick-up of two seats.Missouri is one of many states where incumbent Democrat senators must hold on in order for the party to accomplish that two-seat net gain. Some optimistic Democrats are eyeing Arizona and Tennessee, which the Cook Political Report currently rate as  toss-ups,  as potential Democrat Senate seat flips.The enthused and energetic crowd cheered throughout the entire rendition of Lee Greenwood s  God Bless the USA  as Trump entered the hall.As President Trump stepped to the podium, the crowd broke into chants of  USA! USA! USA! Trump immediately blasted McCaskill and praised Hawley, her Republican opponent. McCaskill voted for the liberal Obama judges who want to destroy your 2nd amendment. They want to destroy your health care, they want to destroy your wealth. They all as a group, they want to raise the hell out of your taxes,  he added. She reveals her true colors when she pretended to tour the state in an RV when she was actually flying around the state in her luxurious private airplane,  Trump said of McCaskill. McCaskill doesn t represent the people of Missouri, she represents the radical Democrats in Washington, D.C. who are trying to take over.  Claire McCaskill voted no on tax cuts. And that s tax cuts for the middle class families,  the president pointed out.Trump continued to run down a long list of bad votes by McCaskill. McCaskill voted no on Kate s Law. How do you vote no on Kate s Law? You know why?  Because Schumer and Pelosi told her,  the president said. And she voted no on enhanced vetting for refugees. She wants to let everybody pour into our country. She wants to give them free health care  McCaskill voted no on our new Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsich. How good is he?  the president asked rhetorically. We need Josh.  We have to fight for him,  Trump said of Hawley. Please welcome a special man, a special talent  the next United State Senator from Missouri, Josh Hawley,  the president said as he introduced Hawley. How about the leadership of President Donald J. Trump?  Hawley asked, as the crowd responded with loud cheers. We had to turn away about 20,000 people who couldn t get into the stadium,  Hawley told the audience.Other press reports indicated the line to get into the 11,000 capacity stadium extended for as long as two miles. Have you noticed something about our president? When he makes a promise he keeps it. When he makes a commitment he delivers. He s delivering big for the state of Missouri and the United States of America,  Hawley said.The GOP candidate for Senate then turned his attention to the current confirmation battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The president said he s going to put pro-Constitution judges on the bench and he has. Judges who love the Constitution. Judges who love our country. Judges like Brett Kavanaugh,  Hawley said. There s somebody in the state of Missouri who hasn t heard what you ve been telling her. There s somebody who hasn t been willing to work with the president. That somebody is Claire McCaskill,  he added. She said she s going to vote no on Judge Kavanaugh,  Hawley said. I m not sure who she s with, but she s not with the state of Missouri.  This November in this state, let s make history again, let s make America great again,  he concluded, turning the podium back to the president. Josh is a star. He s one hundred percent pro 2nd amendment. We need Josh in the Senate to fight for Missouri,  the president said of Hawley. We ll never ever get a vote from Claire McCaskill,  Mr. Trump said, pointing to her promised no vote on Kavanaugh as the most recent example.The president ended the hour and fifteen minutes rally with another push to get out the Republican vote. For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who will never apologize for America, but only will stand up for America,  Trump said, adding:We are standing up for your values we standing up for Missouri, and we are standing up for our national anthem.To continue this momentum, to protect your family your jobs and country . . .You need to get out and vote Republican, and vote for Josh Hawley.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/kavanaugh-accusers-lawyers-refuse-to-meet-grassleys-final-deadline/","UPDATE: Approximately 90 minutes after the expiration of the 10:00 p.m. deadline, Chairman Grassley took to Twitter, where he made clear that, despite his repeated extensions, he is offering yet another extension to Christine Blasey Ford s legal team, presumably until Saturday, for her to decide whether to testify, in line with attorney Deborah Katz s demands:Five times now we hv granted extension for Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w her desire stated one wk ago that she wants to tell senate her story  Dr Ford if u changed ur mind say so so we can move on I want to hear ur testimony. Come to us or we to u  ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) September 22, 2018Judge Kavanaugh I just granted another extension to Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w the statement she made last week to testify to the senate  She shld decide so we can move on  I want to hear her.  I hope u understand.  It s not my normal approach to b indecisive  ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) September 22, 2018With all the extensions we give Dr Ford to decide if she still wants to testify to the Senate I feel like I m playing 2nd trombone in the judiciary orchestra and Schumer is the conductor  ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) September 22, 2018Lawyers for Judge Brett Kavanaugh s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, refused Friday to reply in time to meet Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley s (R-IA) final deadline to agree to have their client testify.Ford s lead attorney, Democratic donor Deborah Katz, sent Judiciary Committee staff an email shortly after 9:00 p.m. refusing to give an answer. Your cavalier treatment of a sexual assault survivor who has been doing her best to cooperate with the committee is completely inappropriate,  Katz wrote as she demanded an additional day s delay in giving an answer.The new demand comes after almost a full business week since first being offered the opportunity to testify in any one of a number of ways, including in open committee and behind closed doors, as to her allegation that Kavanaugh and another teenager attacked and groped her at a high school party more than 35 years ago.Earlier Friday evening, Grassley had set a 10:00 p.m. deadline, after which he would schedule a committee vote on Kavanaugh s Supreme Court confirmation. That 10:00 p.m. Eastern deadline was imposed after Grassley s relenting from a 10:00 a.m. deadline to let the Judiciary Committee know if Ford would be testifying under oath on Monday. A new date of Wednesday was offered, with an initial deadline to accept of 5:00 p.m., but after rejecting a series of Ford s lawyers controversial demands, a final extension of five hours was offered.Among these demands were a Thursday or later hearing date and a prohibition on the Senate Judiciary Committee enlisting female outside lawyers to assist them in taking Ford s testimony. Most controversially, Ford s legal team demanded that Ford, the accuser, testify after the accused, Kavanaugh. In their final offer letter, Republican Judiciary Committee staff called this demand in a particular  an affront to fundamental notions of due process. If Grassley and his fellow Republicans on the Judiciary Committee stick to their announced plan, the committee will convene for a vote Monday. If, as expected, the Republican majority votes to approve Kavanaugh s confirmation, it will pass to the full Senate, where a vote for cloture, setting up a final full-Senate vote, can be taken Wednesday morning. That final vote could then be taken Thursday, allowing Kavanaugh to take a seat on the Supreme Court in time of the start of the Court s October term.In her Friday night email, Katz insists that  the 10 p.m deadline is arbitrary. Its sole purpose is to bully Dr. Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-altering implications for her and her family. Timing in the case, however, has serious implications for Kavanaugh s confirmation. Without a hearing Monday, or at the very latest Wednesday, as Grassley had offered, confirming Kavanaugh before the start of the Supreme Court s new term becomes virtually impossible.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) said Friday evening during a highly-anticipated debate against his Democrat Senate opponent Rep. Beto O Rourke (D-TX) in Dallas, TX, that the progressive congressman   akin to Hillary Clinton   supports the appointment of Supreme Court Justices that would  effectively write the Second Amendment out of the Constitution. (Watch: 16:07  18:07)A partial transcript is as follows: DEBATE MODERATOR: And we re moving on here, the next question [is] for Senator Cruz. Details are still being worked out, but Dr. Chrstine Blasley Ford may testify about her allegations of attempted sexual assault against Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Is there anything you could hear from here that would make you change your vote.SEN. TED CRUZ: Well, absolutely. Listen, I very much hope Dr. Ford comes next week and testifies before the Judiciary Committee. I publically called for her to be given an opportunity to testify and I urged my colleagues. The allegations she s raised are serious and they deserve to be treated with respect. I hope that she comes. As a full opportunity to tell her story in a way that is respectful, but I also think Judge Kavanaugh deserves a full opportunity to defend himself and to let the American people listen and come to an assessment of what happened. We don t know right now. We need to give them a full hearing. I will say more broadly than this, this issue, whether it is Judge Kavanaugh, whether it is Neil Gorsuch, whether it is other Supreme Court nominees, reflects one of the many massive divides on policy, substance, and record between me and Congressman O Rourke. Congressman O Rourke doesn t want Judge Kavanaugh confirmed. He said that before these allegations, he said that after these allegations. He didn t want Neil Gorsuch confirmed.Congressman O Rourke agrees with Hillary Clinton. He wants liberal judiciary activists on the court, who will impose their particular policy. I have devoted virtually my entire life to defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights. I think one of the major issues the American people had before us in 2016 was what vision of the court you want?  I believe Texans want Constitutions on the Supreme Court, who will defend the First Amendment, who will defend free speech, who will defend religious liberty. religious liberty, one of the fundamental liberties, has been under assault. Who will defend the Second Amendment, and I would note that the Justices Congressman O Rourke would insist upon, like Hillary Clinton, are Justices that would undermine and effectively write the Second Amendment out of the Constitution. Those are radical views and they re not views consistent with the overwhelming majority of Texans.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/grassley-sends-final-deadline-for-kavanaugh-accusers-lawyers-10-p-m-friday/","Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) set what he says is the final deadline Friday for Judge Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford s lawyers to agree to have her testify at a hearing next week.If Ford s attorneys do not reach an agreement to one of the several options they have been offered for their client to tell her side of the story, Grassley will schedule a committee vote on Kavanaugh for Monday. Despite the fact that the July 30th letter remains hidden, my committee has been investigating the allegations and has heard from multiple witnesses since Sunday,  Grassley said in a statement to reporters after Ford s attorneys, led by Democratic activist Deborah Katz, failed to respond first to a 10:00 a.m. deadline to agree to testify Monday and then a concession offer of 5:00 p.m. to testify Wednesday.The statement continues:Ms. Katz has discussed Dr. Ford s allegations in numerous media interviews and said on TV Monday morning that Dr. Ford wants to share her account with the Senate Judiciary Committee. It s Friday night and nothing s been agreed to despite our extensive efforts to make testimony possible. I m extending the deadline for response yet again to 10 o clock this evening. I m providing a notice of a vote to occur Monday in the event that Dr. Ford s attorneys don t respond or Dr. Ford decides not to testify. In the event that we can come to a reasonable resolution as I ve been seeking all week, then I will postpone the committee vote to accommodate her testimony. We cannot continue to delay.Grassley s move represents the firmest language yet that Senate Republicans have reached the end of their patience since Ford s allegation that Kavanaugh had groped her at a high school party more than 35 years ago threw the confirmation process into disarray last weekend. Grassley set a full public hearing under oath, only for Ford s lawyers to repeatedly not agree to have their client testify.In the intervening time, those lawyers have reportedly issued a fluid set of demands including excluding outside counsel from asking any questions at the hearing, having Ford not be required to appear in the same room as Kavanaugh, testifying in the opposite order of an actual trial with the accuser having the last word and the accused, Kavanaugh, having no opportunity to reply, and finally, Friday, claiming a further delay was needed because Ford was unwilling to board a plane for fear of confined spaces.The Judiciary Committee also released the text of the previous offer, originally made with 5 p.m. deadline, that was put to Ford s lawyers after they failed to meet the 10 a.m. deadline for the Monday hearing.  The Chairman has offered the ability for Dr. Ford to testify in an open session, a closed session, a public staff interview, and a private staff interview,  the offer letter explains.  The Chairman is even willing to fly female staff investigators to meet Dr. Ford and you in California, or anywhere else, to obtain Dr. Ford s testimony. The letter goes on to refuse some of Ford s lawyers  most controversial demands:Some of your other demands, however, are unreasonable and we are unable to accommodate them. You demanded that Judge Kavanaugh be the first person to testify. Accommodating this demand would be an affront to fundamental notions of due process.You also demanded that only senators be permitted to ask questions of the witnesses. We are also unable to accommodate this demand. There is no rule of the Senate or the Committee that precludes staff attorneys from asking witnesses questions. We reserve the option to have female staff attorneys, who are sensitive to the particulars of Dr. Ford s allegations and are experienced investigators, question both witnesses.You demanded that the Committee issue subpoenas for the testimony of Mark Judge and other unidentified witnesses. The Committee is unable to accommodate this demand. The Committee does not take subpoena requests from witnesses as a condition of their testimony.You demanded that the Committee call additional witnesses that Dr. Ford requests. We are unable to accommodate this demand. The Committee does not take witness requests from other witnesses.The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, led by Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who withheld a letter detailing Ford s account of her alleged sexual assault for more than six weeks, meanwhile issued a response admonishing Republicans for their handling of the situation.  [W]e are disheartened to see many of our colleagues in the majority have already made up their minds and begun to dismiss and diminish Dr. Ford s experience,  the Democrats letter reads.  Up to this point, the Committee majority s treatment of Dr. Ford has unquestionably been worse than the disgraceful treatment that Anita Hill received 27 years ago. We are better than this.

Dean Heller (D-NV), Trump said Democrats are trying to  besmirch  Kavanaugh and said  they have to get on with it.  I don t think you can delay it any longer. They ve delayed it a week already,  Trump said.  They have to get on with it. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates. All times eastern. 8:53 PM: Trump ends rally with standard closing remarks. Did not go on and on about Messrs. Rosenstein and Kavanaugh and mostly pumped up his  movement  that shocked the world in 2016.8:46 PM: Trump says  now you have a president who will never apologize for America, but will only stand up for America.  He blasts politicians who have apologized for America for decades.8:40 PM: Trump boasts about  eradicating  that  crummy Iran Deal.  He says Iran just wants to survive and no longer looking at the Mediterranean.8:38 PM: Trump says he didn t deserve to put in a situation where he had to deal with China (blame the Bush administration for that) on trade and North Korea.8:35 PM: Trump also says he is fixing  one-side  trade deals that took away America s  wealth  and  dignity.  He vows to crack down on  unfair trade practices  of China, which took out $500 billion from the U.S. last year. He says America has rebuilt China.8:33 PM: Trump says Democrats  cheated  African-Americans for hundreds of years and now the unemployment rates/poverty rates for African-Americans are at historic lows.8:31 PM: Trump touts his administration s record re: lifting people off of food stamps and adding manufacturing jobs.8:23 PM: Trump says he could build the wall in a year if he could get funding for it. Why didn t he fight for that and infrastructure out of the gate to give Republicans incentive to get their cherished tax cuts once those things got done first? Big mistake!8:19 PM: Trump: Democrats not just  extreme  but  crazy.  He says Democrats want to abolish ICE and let  violent  and  sadistic  gangs like MS-13  run wild.  He says Democrats support  open borders  and  sanctuary cities     cities of crime    while Republicans believe  our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans and not criminal aliens. 8:17 PM: Trump says Democrats want to give free health care to  illegal immigrants    all paid for by taxpayers. He says Republicans want to give health care to needy Americans and not to illegal aliens. He says he will always protect pre-existing conditions when it comes to health care.8:16 PM: Trump says Medicare is at stake in this election because Democrats want to  raid Medicare  for their socialism to make America  another Venezuela.   That will not happen to us,  Trump says.8:11 PM: Trump says Democrats will try to do anything to  undermine  the greatest election in history.8:09 PM:  It s fragile,  Trump says of the GOP majority.  You can t be complacent.  He says if Dems take back Congress, there will be endless fights because they will want to take away everything.  You re voting for me in 2018,  Trump says. He says voting for Democrats is a vote for massive regulations, taxes, and crime. He says they are held together by deep-state radicals, establishment cronies, and groups like Antifa. He says once Antifa s masks come off, you have people who look like they live in their parents  basement. He says they are so lucky that we are peaceful.8:08 PM: Trump says a vote for McCaskill is a vote for Schumer, Pelosi and the new, legendary de facto leader of the Dem. Party   Maxine Waters. He says the new platform for Democrats is  radical socialism and open borders. 8:02 PM: Trump blasts McCaskill for claiming to have traveled around Missouri in an RV when she was flying by private jet. He says McCaskill represents the  radical left.  He says if Democrats take back control of Congress,  that wealth is going to disappear very quickly. Evaporate very quickly.  He blasts McCaskill for voting against the tax cut and Obamacare repeal.  We need some more Republicans,  Trump says. He says McCaskill voted no on Kate s Law. Trump:  How do you vote no on Kate s Law?  He says she also voted no on  enhanced vetting  for refugees.  She wants to let everybody pour into our country,  Trump says, adding McCaskill wants to give them free health care and education. Trump says Democrats fight  so hard  not to take care of veterans/military.8:01 PM: Trump says:  Look at what s going on  in the FBI and the Department of Justice. Trump says there is a  lingering stench  though and he is going to get rid of it.8:00 PM: Trump says Kavanaugh is out of  central casting  and was  born  to be a Supreme Court justice. He rips McCaskill for not voting for Kavanaugh and says McCaskill is part of the  swamp. 7:58 PM: Hawley blasts McCaskill for saying a border wall is an  embarrassment  and says McCaskill is not with the people of Missouri.7:55 PM: Trump welcomes Hawley, and Hawley says they had to turn away 20,000 people because the stadium was already at capacity. Hawley says Trump kept his promise to put  pro-Constitution judges on the bench  and mentions Kavanaugh.7:50 PM: Trump says Missouri was never too close to call in 2016 but states like Texas, Utah, and Georgia that were were called for him  like two seconds  after the polls were closed. Trump blames the  fake polls  that he calls  suppression polls.  He says the  haters  in the media will endorse him because without  us they have nobody watching television reading their phony papers. 7:48 PM: Trump says Hawley is  a star  and said the venue broke every record re: crowd size for Trump s rally. Trump says the  fake news  will never report it.7:47 PM: Trump asks the crowd if they love the military, law enforcement, and ICE. He says  we need tough people to protect  because ICE is  dealing with tough people.  He is says America is  winning again  and being  respected again  because  we are finally putting America first. 7:45 PM:  I love you people,  Trump says. He says he is  thrilled  to be back in the heartland. He talks about the country s historic economy.  The stock market hit an all-time high again,  Trump says, adding that to him, the stock market equals jobs. He says we re bringing back our factories and reopening minds.  We re restoring our industrial might like nobody can believe,  Trump says.  After years of rebuilding other nationsgetting a little tired of thatwe are rebuilding our nation with American grit, steel, and pride. 7:42 PM: Trump takes the stage in Missouri.7:00 PM:Today s joint rally with President Trump and AG Josh Hawley began with a prayer, the Pledge of Allegiance and the National Anthem. pic.twitter.com/lG2l8NJW9O  Brett Stover (@brettastover) September 21, 2018 Sen.

Bush and the late John McCain s 2008 fail presidential campaign Steve Schmidt said in the midterm elections, Republican lawmakers were in a  lose-lose  situation concerning President Donald Trump s nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.Schmidt said  They re in a lose-lose situation now. You would see a demoralized base. It would be a major defeat for the president. He will be seen to have backed down. The base will be angry. It will be enraged at Republican Senators who they think will have betrayed the president. But also if they force it through and Kavanaugh is confirmed, it will intensify passions on the Democratic side. It will drive women turnout in this election in 2018, and I think that whatever the size of the blue tsunami that s coming and I think there is one coming I think it s going to grow. I think it could be the difference, for example, between Beto O Rourke narrowly being defeated by Ted Cruz and Beto O Rourke narrowly winning that race. He added,  But there will be a profound political implication no matter what. This is a terrible circumstance. Let me just say that I think that it s going to be impossible to find out what happened in that room between teenagers 36 years ago, but it s not impossible to find out in the moment if someone s lying about memories of where they were and when it happened and specifically if there is any knowledge by Judge Kavanaugh about the Ed Whelan conspiracy theory where a middle school teacher was smeared and publicly identified as the person who possibly did that. If that was a coordinated strategy and I m not suggesting for a second that Brett Kavanaugh had any knowledge about it I say this as someone who ran two of these, the nominees don t have much say in the political strategy around them but if he knew, then I think that disqualifies him, and it has to go down. At the end of the day, this is Collins and Murkowski who are the two senators that are going to determine whether he sits on the court or whether he doesn t. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Sharpton said,  To come with the weight of the presidency, where he is clearly castigating this Dr. Ford, again shows why, as you ve been discussing on the Rosenstein issue, why people feel he is not fit to be president. When asked about the Kavanaugh nomination, Sharpton said,  I think that it is now really in jeopardy because I think that given where we are in the in terms of these accusations and the behavior that has circled these accusations, the one or two Republicans, moderate Republicans that were undecided, I think are going to have a lot of pressure now to tilt toward non-confirmation. And they can do it without convicting Kavanaugh of what s been accused, but by just saying there s too many questions. I think that the president might have tilted it in a way that he really will regret. I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/09/21/alan-dershowitz-absurd-and-outrageous-to-make-kavanaugh-testify-before-ford/","Harvard Law School Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz described demands for Judge Brett Kavanaugh to testify before Christine Ford as  absurd,   outrageous,  and  inconceivable.  He offered his remarks in a Friday interview on SiriusXM s Breitbart News Daily with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow.Ford, a California professor, accused Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh of a  rape attempt  when both were high schoolers in the 1980s.Dershowitz said,  It s obvious what should happen. [Christine Ford] should testify first, make the accusation, lay it out, and then [Brett Kavanaugh] should be asked to respond. LISTEN:Dershowitz added,  Civil liberties have to be complied with, and the ACLU, we don t hear from them. When the accuser s lawyer says that the accused has to go first, that s such a fundamental denial of due process, the way they used to do it in the Star Chamber, you call somebody in, have him deny everything, and then you bring in the accuser afterward. That s just not the way the Anglo-American system of justice has ever worked. Dershwoitz continued,  It would be outrageous to have him testify first and her testify only in response, and I want to hear from the American Civil Liberties Union on that issue. For years and years they ve talked about due process of law and due process can t apply only to Democrats and not to Republicans. Dershowitz explained the centrality of an accused s right to respond to his or her accuser. What s not reasonable, at all, and what really destroyed the credibility of some of the other reasonable claims, is this demand that he go first,  said Dershowitz.  It s just impossible to imagine a legal system that is anything consistent with the rule of law which puts the accused on the stand first before the accuser takes the stand. It s just inconceivable that that should happen. Dershowitz criticized assumptive descriptions of Ford as a  victim  and  survivor,  as well as descriptions of Kavanaugh as a  perpetrator.  What you have is media on the left calling her a victim and calling her a survivor, we don t know if that s true,  noted Dershowitz.  It may very well be true, and calling him a perpetrator, and we don t know whether that s true. The presumption of innocence has to still apply.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/21/women-defend-brett-kavanaugh-to-cnn-shes-also-destroying-his-life/","CNN interviewed a group of Republican women who vociferously defended Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh during Thursday s broadcast of  Anderson Cooper 360  Thursday night. Show of hands. How many of you believe Judge Kavanaugh when he says this didn t happen?  CNN reporter Randi Kaye asked a group of women.All of the women answered that they believed him. Because one woman made an allegationsorry, I don t buy it,  a woman named Lourdes Castillo de la Pena said in part. In the grand scheme of things, my goodness, there was no intercourse. There was maybe a touch. Can wereally? 36 years later? She s still stuck on that? Had it happened,  Irina Villarino said. I mean, we re talking about a 15-year-old girl, which I respect. You know, I m a woman. I respect. And we re talking about a 17-year-old boy, in high school, with testosterone running high. Tell me what boy hasn t done this in high school. Please, I would like to know,  Gina Sosa said. Why would she come forward if this wasn t true? Because it has basically destroyed her family. She s had to move. She s gone undercover. She s gotten death threats. So if she s lying, why come forward?  CNN s Kaye asked. She s also destroying his life, his wife s life, his children s lives. His career. I mean, why didn t she come out sooner if she s telling the truth?  Villarino answered. Why didn t she come out when he was going into the Bush White House? Why didn t she come outhe s been a federal judge for over a decade,  Angie Vazquez wondered.Kaye compared the allegations against Kavanaugh to allegations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas. This is not the same. This is a high school kid. I mean, it s not Anita Hill s story,  Lourdes Castillo de la Pena said. As women, though, do you have some sympathy for her for what she s going through?  CNN s Kaye also asked. No, I have no sympathy. And perhaps maybe at that moment she liked him, and maybe he didn t pay attention to her afterward, and he went out with another girl, and she got bitter or whatever the situation is. They re kids.  Castillo de la Pena answered. If it is true, would it be okay with you if he became a justice on the Supreme Court?  Kaye finally asked.

Susan Collins (R-ME) said she was  appalled,  by President Donald Trumps tweet about Judge Brett Kavanaugh s accuser Christine Blasey Ford.Collins said,  I was appalled by the president s tweet. First of all, we know that allegations of sexual assault  I m not saying that s what happened in this case  but we know allegations of sexual assault are one of the most unreported crimes that exist. So I thought that the president s tweet was completely inappropriate and wrong. I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn  date, time, and place!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2018Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

I want to make something clear   very, very clear. For me, this is not political.  My being here has nothing to do with politics,  Fitzgerald said as she stood on stage with the other Kavanaugh-supporting women at Washington, DC s, JW Marriott hotel.  I m here because I felt it important to share my perspective on Brett s character and to talk about a man that I have known for over 35 years. Like the other speakers, Fitzgerald was offering her experience with Kavanaugh in light of California professor Christine Blasey Ford s allegation that more 35 years ago, a teenage Kavanaugh assaulted and groped her at a high school party. The allegation, withheld during Kavanaugh s extensive confirmation hearings, has thrown his confirmation process into turmoil and jeopardized his ability to take a seat on the Supreme Court before the October 1 start of the Court s new term. The allegation against Brett is inconsistent with everything that I have known about him as a person,  Fitzgerald said.  In both public and private, Brett treated me and everyone I know with respect. He has always been kind and good-natured. He has always been caring and concerned with the well-being of others. Fitzgerald recounted how Kavanaugh had written her a note offering support when her friend was in a coma after a car wreck.  That was very typical of Brett, openly and unabashedly delivering care and compassion,  she said.  To my recollection, he was the only friend, male or female, who wrote a note to me after that terrible time. Fitzgerald also recalled Kavanaugh as gracious guest at her parents  vacation home when they were growing up.  It was a full house, but Brett was always welcome. He was polite and considerate to my siblings and to the parents,  she told the audience. Brett was the kind of you wanted to take home to meet your parents. Brett was then, and still is, a stand up guy,  Fitzgerald concluded, yielding the podium to the next of the six women who spoke to offer her story of knowing Judge Kavanaugh.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/feminists-kavanaugh-ford-dont-need-prove-beyond-reasonable-doubt/","Assorted heads of feminist organizations described Christine Blasey Ford as a  survivor  of sexual assault   accepting Ford s allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh prima facie   during a Thursday conference hosted by the Feminist Majority Foundation in Washington, DC.The word  survivor  was used 32 times by the conference s featured speakers, according to C-SPAN s automated transcription of the event.  Trauma  was said 23 times.Roger Canaff, a former assistant district attorney in New York City, said a  reasonable doubt standard  is not needed to block the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court:We re not dealing with a reasonable doubt standard, either. That s really important. We don t need to demonstrate this beyond a reasonable doubt. Judge Kavanaugh is not on trial. This is about whether or not he should have the privilege of serving in the highest court in the United States.Canaff also said Americans must  start by believing  all women who make allegations of sexual assault against men:Another thing that we believe in violence against women is to, what we call,  start by believing : SBB. That doesn t mean that we continue to believe despite any fact that might emerge.  When we begin by believing survivors, then we allow them to open up their minds. We allow their anxiety to go down, their self-esteem to go up. More facts come forward, we actually reduce bias, and we re able to get to the truth a lot faster.Indira Henard, executive director of the DC Rape Crisis Center, said Americans must  believe  Ford s accusations against Kavanaugh:It is not our job to dissect Dr. Ford s story or any survivor s story of sexual violence. It is our job to believe them. It is our job to support them. It is our job to hold those responsible accountable. The burden of proof should not be on survivors of sexual violence. Dr. Ford should not be on trial. What we are seeing in the treatment of Dr. Ford is a travesty.Henard warned against senators  perpetrating another level of violence  against Ford in the event of Ford s testimony before a Senate committee:If [Christine Blasey Ford] shows up on Monday  [senators] are going to be perpetrating another level of violence because it s not going to be a trauma-informed process.We have to be very careful that our institutions are not reperpetrating violence which will be retraumatizing for survivors of sexual violence. Dr. Ford is not just standing as one; she is standing for ten thousand. What is happening to her is also happening to other survivors of sexual violence.Lisalyn Jacobs, an attorney, described Ford s claims as  serious and credible charges of sexual violence.  She added that  time has vindicated [Anita Hill].  She continued:[Ford] is not on trial. Justice demands that we respect that Dr. Ford is a survivor of trauma and that the Senate Judiciary Committee hear from experts on the lasting impact of trauma on survivors. Justice demands that the hearing process be paused while the FBI reopens its investigation.Kiersten Stewart, a director at Futures Without Violence, called on America s men to  believe women :To the men controlling this process: This is your test, as well. Do you respect women, or don t you? If you do, as you say, then you need to show it with your actions, now, when it matters.To the men out there: Now is your moment to take a stand. You know sexual violence is wrong. Most of you would never do it and hate is as much as we do. Speak out. Believe women. Use your power. Use your voice. Speak up for a fair process.Toni Van Pelt, president of National Organization for Women (NOW), noted the race and sex of Republican senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee:Only Chuck Grassley and Orrin Hatch still remain on the Senate Judiciary Committee that unfairly interrogated Anita Hill with malice and spitefulness. Today, all 11 white men on the Republican side of the dais seem intent on creating their own Anita Hill with Dr. Ford their new target.NOW calls on the Judiciary Committee to delay these hearings and to open them to witnesses who may wish to confirm Dr. Ford s account.  Dr. Ford made a brave decision to come forward. Clearly, she is not lying,  added Pelt in reference to Ford.Some women attending the events held signs with the following messages:  #CancelKavanaugh,   I stand with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford,  and  #IBelieveChristine.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/christine-blasey-ford-wants-thursday-hearing-to-stop-brett-kavanaugh-from-joining-supreme-court-oct-1/","Christine Blasey Ford, the California psychology professor who has emerged to accuse Judge Brett Kavanaugh of groping her in high school over 35 years ago, wants to move Monday s scheduled hearing to Thursday instead, among other demands.There is only one possible reason that Dr. Ford and her attorneys could want a Thursday hearing   not Wednesday, as the GOP has now counter-offered, or Monday as originally scheduled: a Thursday hearing could preclude Kavanaugh from joining the Court for its new session on Oct. 1. (Dr. Ford has until Friday to respond to the counter-offer.)Here is why. The earliest that the Senate Judiciary Committee could vote for Judge Kavanaugh s nomination to be considered by the full Senate would be Wednesday afternoon, if the hearing takes place. That would likely mean the earliest that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) could introduce a motion to confirm Kavanaugh would be Thursday morning. The Senate would then have 24 hours before a cloture motion Friday morning. Then there would be 30 hours of debate, meaning that the earliest that the Senate could vote to confirm Kavanaugh would be Saturday afternoon or evening   September 29.But if the hearing were Thursday, the earliest the full Senate could vote would be Sunday evening, Sep. 30, with just hours to spare.That would create the very risk that a vote might not be held before Oct. 1, if procedural roadblocks arose (and they would). And some wavering Republicans might be uncomfortable voting to confirm a Supreme Court justice in the dead of night.The only possible reason for Dr. Ford to demand a Thursday hearing (as opposed to Wednesday/Tuesday or the scheduled Monday) is to prevent the Senate from voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh before month s end, leaving him off the bench when the Supreme Court s next session starts.  Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) September 21, 2018Theoretically, Kavanaugh could join the Court after Oct. 1. But once the Court began its fall session, the Democrats could argue that there is no rush to confirm him, that there should be more investigations, and that the president should let voters decide in November. That would turn the midterm elections into a referendum on the Court, and potentially create a huge political opportunity for Democrats   and a problem for McConnell and the GOP, who promised a confirmation on time. Republican moderates could start to waver, effectively defeating the nomination   and infuriating the conservative base.That is why Thursday is so important to Democrats. It also looks less suspicious than demanding a hearing on Friday, or demanding Republicans postpone the process for weeks or more.There is little doubt Ford is coordinating with Democrats. On Thursday, Republicans released the audio of a conference call held by the liberal American Constitutional Society in July with Democratic strategist Ricki Seidman, who is now one of Ford s advisers. In it, she laid out a strategy to defeat the nomination (3:19 to 3:33):  I do think that over the coming days and weeks there will be a strategy that will emerge, and I think it s possible that that strategy might ultimately defeat the nominee. Ford s accusations   which were known to ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)   have become the  strategy that will emerge,  and demanding a Thursday hearing   not Wednesday, or Monday   is the way to bring it to fruition.Joel B.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/21/kavanaugh-friend-heartbroken-over-way-his-precious-family-has-been-treated/","Laura Cox Kaplan joined more than 75 other women Friday at the #IStandWithBrett press conference and expressed her outrage over how close friend Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his family have been treated after Christine Blasey Ford s allegation. The nomination process should be one that weeds out those who are not qualified or suited to serve,  Kaplan, who like Kavanaugh served in the George W. Bush administration, said from the podium at Washington, DC s JW Marriott hotel.  Sadly, this process isn t. It seems anyone can lodge an allegation, without corroboration or evidence, and dismantle a person s career, and their life, and the lives of their family members. This is wrong.  My husband Joel and I have been friends with Brett and Ashley Kavanaugh from the early days of the George W. Bush administration and well before the four of us were married,  Kaplan explained.  For more than 15 years, we ve shared life s victories and its heartaches, its highs and lows.  There are no two people who are more humble, more honorable, more generous, or more gracious and, in Brett s case, more qualified, to serve this country in the role for which he has been nominated,  Kaplan said, recounting stories of shared children s birthday parties and holidays between their two families.Kaplan focused on the pressures put on Kavanaugh s family who, after intense left-wing media scrutiny, have received threats since Ford s accusation about a high school party in the early 1980s when Kavanaugh was 17 emerged after the close of regular confirmation hearings. She told the audience:While Brett is the person who s been nominated, his family is going through this process too. My friend Ashley, and her precious girls, Margaret and Liza, who I love. I am heartbroken over the way that this precious family has been treated. What saddens me the most is that I know this person, Brett Kavanaugh, to be a person of the highest moral character and integrity   someone who is humble, who puts others before himself, and someone who is beyond well-qualified for the position of the U.S. Supreme Court.The #IStandWithBrett conference was put on to bring together more than 75 women who have known Brett Kavanaugh for years or decades and stand by him. Some of the women have known Kavanaugh since the high school days where he is alleged, without corroborating evidence, to have drunkenly groped Ford at a small party. Kaplan was one of six who spoke. It would have been a lot easier not to come here today. This is not particularly fun,  Kaplan said.  But it wouldn t have been right. And it wouldn t have been what Brett would have done.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/brett-kavanaugh-accusers-attorney-cancels-fundraiser-democrat-senator/","A fundraiser for Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) slated for October at the office of Katz, Marshall & Banks, LLP   the firm where Debra Katz, attorney for Brett Kavanaugh s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, is a partner   was canceled once news of the partisan event surfaced.Katz and attorney Lisa Banks were listed as headliners for the  cocktails and conversation  event to raise money for Baldwin s 2018 re-election bid, according to an invitation obtained by CNN.Invitees were asked to pay $1,000 to attend the October 1 event at the Washington, DC, law firm, CNN reported:After CNN contacted the Baldwin campaign and the attorneys, Katz called CNN to say that the event was being canceled. The invite was sent Thursday morning, but a campaign spokesman called it an  old invite  scheduled before Ford s accusation became public. The short answer is this: We did a fundraiser for Sen. Baldwin six years ago when we ran for the Senate, we supported her then,  Katz told CNN.  We are not going to be doing a fundraiser now. We re going to be focused on the issues involving the Kavanaugh confirmation process. In the eleventh hour of Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation process to be seated on the United States Supreme Court   days after long hearings and days before a scheduled Senate Judiciary Committee vote   Ford accused the federal judge of groping her at a party while the two were in high school.Since making the allegation, Republicans in charge of the committee have scrambled to offer Ford the opportunity to testify on Monday and gave her several options for an interview venue with the committee or committee staff in D.C. or even in her home state of California.Initially, Katz said Ford would not testify until after the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) had completed a probe into her claim   even after the agency said it would not conduct an investigation.Now Katz has said her client would be willing to come before the committee but not on Monday.Republicans still hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed before the high court begins its next session on October 1.A Baldwin campaign spokesman confirmed the event was canceled, according to CNN. The event was scheduled before Dr. Ford made the allegations,  the spokesman said.  Dr. Ford s lawyers are no longer involved in the event. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/21/former-colleague-recounts-brett-kavanaugh-caring-for-her-on-9-11-was-a-gift/","Sara Fagen, a friend and former colleague of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, recounted Friday how the future Judge offered her moral support moments following the terror attacks of September 11, 2001.Speaking before the  #IStandWithBrett  press conference in Washington, DC, Fagen, a George W. Bush White House political director, said of Kavanaugh,  Our friendship was forged on 9/11, the fateful day when many of my colleagues and I hastily left the White House after being told by a Secret Service agent to run as fast as we could. Within seconds, I was in a sea of strangers walking up 17th Street   scared and alone   with nothing in my pocket. Fagen continued,  I looked up, and there was Brett Kavanaugh. My colleague took care of me that day. He made sure I was safe, had food and money, and also made sure I got home safely that evening. The days after 9/11 in the White House were long and stressful, but Brett took the time to follow up with me and ensure I was doing okay. For me, running into Brett Kavanaugh that day was a gift. The conference, attended by around 75 women, took place as the Supreme Court nominee faces a 36-year-old sexual misconduct allegation leveled by California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford. The accuser alleges Kavanaugh and a friend shoved her into a room and groped her during a Maryland house party in 1982 or thereabout.Mike Judge, who the professor alleges was in the room with her and Kavanaugh told the Weekly Standard that the claim was  absolutely nuts. In a statement Monday, Kavanaugh denied the claim, describing the decades-old allegation as  completely false.  I have never done anything like what the accuser describes to her or to anyone,  the judge wrote.  Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday.  Speaking with reporters earlier in the week, President Donald Trump defended his Supreme Court pick, describing Kavanaugh as an  outstanding man,  and encouraged Ford to meet with the Senate Judiciary Committee. Look, if she shows up and makes a credible showing, that will be very interesting and we ll have to make a decision,  President Trump said.  But I can only say this: he s such an outstanding man   very hard for me to imagine that anything happened.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/timeline-democrats-changing-demands-for-christine-blasey-fords-testimony/","The timeline of events following Christine Blasey Ford s decision to go public with her allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh can be characterized as a series of solicitous accommodations on the part of the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chairman, followed by shifting demands and stonewalling from Democrats and Ford s lawyers.The letters, statements, and public comments from Senate Republicans and the White House make clear their eagerness for Ford to come forward and be heard before the Senate Judiciary Committee, either in private or in public. At first, Democrats demanded that the accuser be heard. But once Republicans agreed, the goalposts moved, and moved, and moved   always in the direction of delaying the confirmation vote.The following is a timeline of events.(Editor s Note: scroll down for the latest updates.)Summer 2018: Christine Blasey Ford, a professor of clinical psychology at Palo Alto University, contacted the Washington Post s tip line after learning that Judge Brett Kavanaugh was on President Trump s shortlist to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Washington Post reported.The Post also reported that around that same time, Ford contacted Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-CA), her representative in Congress.Monday, July 9, 2018: Trump officially nominated Kavanaugh to serve as retiring Justice Kennedy s replacement on the Supreme Court.Late July 2018: According to the Washington Post, in late July, Ford sent a letter through Rep. Eschoo s office to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the letter, Ford requested anonymity and alleged that Judge Brett Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her at a party 35 years ago when they were both teenagers and he was  stumbling drunk  at the time.Sen. Feinstein did nothing with Ford s letter. She did not alert the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), as is customary. She did not alert the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), so that they could include it in their background investigation of the nominee. She did not even alert her fellow Democrats on the Committee. She would later claim that her lack of action was due to her desire to honor Ford s request for confidentiality.Early August 2018: Ford hired Debra Katz, a lawyer with a long history in Democratic politics who specializes in sexual harassment cases. On Katz s advice, Ford took a polygraph test. The results were later provided to the Washington Post, which reported that the test  concluded that Ford was being truthful when she said a statement summarizing her allegations was accurate. Late August 2018: According to the Washington Post, in Late August,  Ford had decided not to come forward, calculating that doing so would upend her life and probably would not affect Kavanaugh s confirmation. Why suffer through the annihilation if it s not going to matter?  she said. Tuesday-Friday, September 4-7, 2018: The Senate Judiciary Committee held confirmation hearings with Kavanaugh from September 4 through 6. On Friday, September 7, they heard expert testimony from Kavanaugh s supporters and detractors. This would have been the appropriate venue for Ford to present her accusations. However, if she desired to remain anonymous, Sen. Feinstein could have raised the allegations directly with Kavanaugh during any of the hearings on Tuesday through Thursday. Instead, the hearings concluded without any mention of Ford s allegations.Wednesday, September 12, 2018: Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee  first learned about [Ford s] letter s contents at a meeting called at the last minute on Wednesday night,  according to the Washington Post. The New York Times reported:  Several Democrats advised [Feinstein] to take [the letter s] claims to the F.B.I., and others pressed for it to become public. The story of Ford s letter then leaked to the Intercept, which reported that  Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have privately requested to view a Brett Kavanaugh-related document in possession of the panel s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, but the senior California senator has so far refused, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. Thursday, September 13, 2018: Feinstein finally issued a statement confirming the existence of the letter but declining to offer any details. I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,  Feinstein wrote.  That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities. NEW: Sen. Feinstein:  I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court  and  referred the matter to federal investigative authorities.  pic.twitter.com/ORpIeiNhpI  NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) September 13, 2018The New York Times reported,  The F.B.I. said in a statement on Thursday that it had received Ms. Feinstein s referral and included it in Judge Kavanaugh s background file. A bureau official also said that no criminal investigation had been opened related to the matter. The updated copy of Kavanaugh s file with the letter was then sent by the White House to Senate Judiciary Chairman Grassley, as is customary. In addition to criminal investigations, the F.B.I. conducts background checks on all major government appointees, including Supreme Court nominees,  the Times noted.The media soon worked itself into a frenzy to discover the name of the accuser and the exact nature of her accusation, which the New York Times said involved  possible sexual misconduct. Ford began to worry that her identity would become public after a Buzzfeed reporter turned up at her home and workplace and another reporter contacted her colleagues.In response to news of the mysterious letter, White House spokesperson Kerri Kupec issued the following statement:  Throughout his confirmation process, Judge Kavanaugh has had 65 meetings with senators including with Senator Feinstein sat through over 30 hours of testimony, addressed over 2,000 questions in a public setting and additional questions in a confidential.  Not until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new information  about him,  the official added.Friday, September 14, 2018: Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer of The New Yorker got their hands on the contents of the letter and reported the most accurate description to date of the alleged incident.Sunday, September 16, 2018: Ford went on the record with the Washington Post revealing her name and conveying the entire incident in her own words. She told the Post,  Now I feel like my civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation. Ford s lawyer Debra Katz told the Post:  Victims must have the right to decide whether to come forward, especially in a political environment that is as ruthless as this one. She will now face vicious attacks by those who support this nominee. Ford s account to the Post also made clear that she was uncertain about key details, such as the exact date of the event, location, and how she got to the party and got home from it. She also revealed that she told no one about the incident until 2012, when she and her husband were in couples therapy. That year, Kavanaugh s name was included in a short list of potential Supreme Court nominees for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.The notes Ford s therapist s wrote, which the Post acquired in part, contained glaring discrepancies about the incident. The therapist wrote that four boys were involved in the alleged assault, but Ford claimed that only two were: Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge. The therapist s notes also do not contain Kavanaugh s name. Ford blamed the discrepancies on the therapist s transcription.The editorial board of Sen. Feinstein s hometown newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, denounced her handling of Ford s allegations, calling it  unfair all around. It was unfair to Kavanaugh, unfair to his accuser and unfair to Feinstein s colleagues   Democrats and Republicans alike   on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Monday, September 17, 2018: President Trump said he was open to having the Senate Judiciary Committee delay the confirmation vote to consider Ford s allegation. I want the American people to be happy because they re getting somebody that is great. I want him to go in at the absolute highest level. And I think to do that you have to go through this. If it takes a little delay, it ll take a little delay,  Trump said.Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley issued the following statement:Anyone who comes forward as Dr. Ford has deserves to be heard, so I will continue working on a way to hear her out in an appropriate, precedented and respectful manner.The standard procedure for updates to any nominee s background investigation file is to conduct separate follow-up calls with relevant parties. In this case, that would entail phone calls with at least Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. Consistent with that practice, I asked Senator Feinstein s office yesterday to join me in scheduling these follow-ups. Thus far, they have refused. But as a necessary step in evaluating these claims, I ll continue working to set them up.Unfortunately, committee Republicans have only known this person s identity from news reports for less than 24 hours and known about her allegations for less than a week. Senator Feinstein, on the other hand, has had this information for many weeks and deprived her colleagues of the information necessary to do our jobs. The Minority withheld even the anonymous allegations for six weeks, only to later decide that they were serious enough to investigate on the eve of the committee vote, after the vetting process had been completed.It s deeply disturbing that the existence of these allegations were leaked in a way that seemed to preclude Dr. Ford s confidentiality.Over my nearly four decades in the Senate I have worked diligently to protect whistleblowers and get to the bottom of any issue. Dr. Ford s attorney could have approached my office, while keeping her client confidential and anonymous, so that these allegations could be thoroughly investigated. Nevertheless, we are working diligently to get to the bottom of these claims.Other Republican senators   including crucial GOP swing votes   agreed with the need to hear from Ford.Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) said,  Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said:  If they push forward without any attempt with hearing what she s had to say, I m not comfortable voting yes. We need to hear from her. And I don t think I m alone in this. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) said,  I think [delaying the vote] might be something they might have to consider, at least having that discussion. This is not something that came up during the hearings. And if there is real substance to this, it demands a response. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a member of the Judiciary Committee, said,  If Ms. Ford wishes to provide information to the committee, I would gladly listen to what she has to say and compare that against all other information we have received about Judge Kavanaugh. Now that there was general agreement that Ford s testimony should be heard, the Democrats deftly moved the goalposts with a new demand that would delay the confirmation even more. They insisted that the FBI must conduct an investigation into Ford s allegations, despite the fact that the FBI had already fulfilled its obligation in this matter by including Ford s letter in Kavanaugh s background file and forwarding it to the White House.Nevertheless, Sen. Feinstein tweeted,  There s a lot of information we don t know and the FBI should have the time it needs to review this new material. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) agreed, tweeting,  [Senate Republicans] cannot impartially investigate these disturbing allegations. That must be done by the FBI, and the vote must be postponed until it is complete. Senate Republicans ran a transparently partisan confirmation process and then immediately insinuated Prof Ford is being untruthful. They cannot impartially investigate these disturbing allegations. That must be done by the FBI, and the vote must be postponed until it is complete.  Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) September 17, 2018Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats then sent a letter to Sen. Grassley demanding the vote on Kavanaugh be delayed for an FBI investigation.Their letter stated:  As you are aware, Dr. Ford s serious allegations were submitted to the FBI for investigation last week. Now that her story is public, it is even more important that we give the Bureau the time it needs to follow up. All Senators, regardless of party, should insist the FBI perform its due diligence and fully investigate the allegations as part of its review of Judge Kavanaugh s background. Staff-level examination of these allegations should not go forward until the FBI s career professionals with the requisite investigative expertise have completed their review. Once the FBI has completed its independent work, we hope that we can work together in a bipartisan manner to decide on next steps. The Department of Justice shot down this talking point in a statement issued Monday night, declaring that the FBI can not and will not be investigating Ford s allegation because it  does not involve any potential federal crime  and is therefore beyond the FBI s jurisdiction.The statement explained that the FBI s role in conducting a background investigation into a nominee is  to determine whether the nominee could pose a risk to the national security of the United States  and then to provide that information  for the use of the decision makers.  The DOJ said,  it s not the job of the FBI to judge the significance or the credibility of an accusation. That afternoon, Sen. Grassley issued a statement that the Judiciary Committee was attempting to reach Ford, who was not responding to their inquiries, but would cancel the confirmation vote scheduled for Thursday, September 20, and instead hold a public hearing on Ford s claim on Monday, September 25. As I said earlier, anyone who comes forward as Dr. Ford has done deserves to be heard. My staff has reached out to Dr. Ford to hear her account, and they held a follow-up call with Judge Kavanaugh this afternoon.  Unfortunately, committee Democrats have refused to join us in this effort. However, to provide ample transparency, we will hold a public hearing Monday to give these recent allegations a full airing,  Grassley said.Tuesday, September 18, 2018: Ignoring the Department of Justice s prior statements on the matter, Senate Democrats sent a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray and White House Counsel Don McGahn demanding the FBI investigate Kavanaugh.They wrote:  The need for the FBI to perform its due diligence has become even more important in light of Chairman Grassley s announcement that he plans to move forward with a hearing on this matter next Monday. The Committee should have the completed report before any hearing occurs and we ask that you take immediate steps to make sure that we have the FBI s report before we proceed. Please notify us as soon as possible whether this can be completed in time. Wednesday, September 19, 2018: Sen. Grassley responded to the Judiciary Committee Democrats  letter with a letter of his own detailing why their demand for an FBI investigation was totally unnecessary now that Ford s allegation has been made public. Such a demand, Grassley explained, was akin to demanding that the FBI do the Senate s job. It is now the duty of the Senate Judiciary Committee to call witnesses, gather evidence, and conduct the investigation going forward, not the FBI.Grassley s letter stated (emphasis in the original):Your letter requests that I demand that the FBI conduct an additional investigation into this matter. This request demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the FBI background investigation process. Before nominating an individual to a judicial or executive office, the White House directs the FBI to conduct a background investigation. The FBI compiles information about a prospective nominee and sends it to the White House. The White House then provides FBI background investigation files to the Senate as a courtesy to help us determine whether to confirm a nominee. But the FBI does not make a credibility assessment of any information it receives with respect to a nominee. Nor is it tasked with investigating those matters that this Committee deems important. The Constitution assigns the Senate, and only the Senate, with the task of advising the President on his nominees and consenting if the circumstances merit. We have no power to commandeer an executive branch agency into conducting our due diligence. The job of assessing and investigating a nominee s qualifications in order to decide whether to consent to the nomination is ours, and ours alone.Second, your request ignores the fact that Dr. Ford has already made her allegations public. The purpose of the background investigation process is to compile information in a confidential manner. Confidentiality permits people to speak freely and candidly about the character and qualifications of the nominee. The White House requires the Senate to keep background investigation files private so that people can speak anonymously to investigators if they so desire. Because Dr. Ford s allegations are in the public arena, there is no longer a need for a confidential FBI investigation.In this same letter, Sen. Grassley also fact-checked the Democrats  claim that their request for an FBI investigation into Ford s allegation is no different than the way the FBI investigated Anita Hill s allegation against Clarence Thomas in 1991. He wrote (emphasis in the original):In 1991, the FBI s additional investigation into Professor Anita Hill s allegations occurred when the allegations were still non-public. When the Senate received Professor Hill s non-public allegations of sexual harassment, then-Chairman Biden expeditiously notified the White House. (That decision sits in sharp contrast to Senator Feinstein s decision to sit on Dr. Ford s allegations for more than six weeks.) The White House directed the FBI to conduct a handful of interviews regarding Professor Hill s allegations. The FBI completed the interviews within a few days. The White House turned the interview reports over to the Senate as a courtesy. The contents of one of those reports was leaked to the public soon after. The hearing was subsequently reopened five days after the allegations were made public.We are in the same position the Committee was in after Professor Hill s allegations were leaked. After that leak, we did not ask the FBI to conduct an investigation. Instead, we reopened the hearing and assessed the testimony that was given on our own. As in 1991, it is now up to the Senate to gather and assess the relevant evidence.On Wednesday, Sen. Grassley also sent a letter to Sen. Feinstein request she provide him and the rest of the Republicans on the Committee a copy of the letter submitted to her by Ford.Grassley wrote,  My staff has made repeated requests for this document   which has become a significant piece of evidence in Judge Kavanaugh s confirmation process   but your staff has so far refused to provide a copy of the letter. You are able to share this unredacted copy with all the members of your caucus and their staff, as well as anyone else you choose. The only version we have of this letter is a redacted version contained in the supplemental FBI background investigation file that only senators and a handful of very select staff are authorized to read. Grassley then called out Feinstein s politicization of this process and total disregard for the wellbeing of the accuser, the accused, and her colleagues who want to get at the truth. He wrote (emphasis in the original):Sexual assault allegations deserve serious attention, and those who make such allegations must be heard. They should not be deployed strategically for political gain. You received this letter approximately seven weeks ago. But the contents of the letter were leaked only last week when it appeared the Senate was about to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. There were numerous opportunities to raise the serious allegations made in the letter during the course of this nomination process. They could have been raised in your closed-door meeting with Judge Kavanaugh on August 20. Sixty-four other senators also met with Judge Kavanaugh prior to his confirmation hearing. These senators could have asked Judge Kavanaugh about these allegations if you had shared the letter.Your staff could have raised these allegations during routine background investigation phone calls in late-August. Questions about these allegations could have been asked of Judge Kavanaugh during his more than 32 hours of testimony before the Committee over the course of three days. You could have asked him about these allegations during the closed session of his confirmation hearing, where sensitive material can be discussed. But you did not attend the closed session. Finally, these allegations could have been addressed in one of the nearly 1,300 written questions issued to him after the hearing more written questions to any Supreme Court nominee than all prior Supreme Court nominees combined.You have said that you didn t raise Dr. Ford s allegations previously because you wanted to protect Dr. Ford s anonymity. But these allegations could have been raised to me, or to Judge Kavanaugh, while protecting Dr. Ford s anonymity. Indeed, the only version of her letter that I have is the redacted version from the FBI, which protected Dr. Ford s anonymity. Had Dr. Ford not made her allegations public via the Washington Post over the weekend, I still would not know her identity. The fact is that these allegations could have been raised both within the last seven weeks and in a way that protected Dr. Ford s anonymity. Instead, you chose to sit on the allegations until a politically opportune moment. I cannot overstate how disappointed I am in this decision. It has caused me to have to reopen the hearings for the fifth day of testimony, when we easily could have and should have raised these issues before or during the first four days of the hearing.Grassley also made clear that the committee would go out of its way to accommodate Ford so that she could provide her testimony in whatever manner was most comfortable for her   even going so far as to send his staff to California to get Ford s testimony at her home so that she wouldn t have to travel to D.C.  He wrote:Dr. Ford has asked for the opportunity to be heard in a hearing, and I believe she should have that opportunity. I recognize that testifying publicly about sexual assault allegations may be difficult for Dr. Ford, so I have offered her the opportunity to testify in any of four possible venues: (1) a public hearing; (2) a private hearing; (3) a public staff interview; or (4) a private staff interview. I am even willing to have my staff travel to Dr. Ford in California or anywhere else to obtain her testimony.Later that day, Ford s lawyer, Debra Katz, sent a letter to Sen. Grassley. Echoing the Senate Democrats  talking points, Katz demanded an FBI investigation on behalf of her client before she would provide any testimony. Katz also objected to any attempt to make her client  testify at the same table as Judge Kavanaugh  or endure an  interrogation  from senators who don t believe her.Katz s letter stated:As you know, earlier this summer, Dr. Ford sought to tell her story, in confidence, so that lawmakers would have a fuller understanding of Brett Kavanaugh s character and history. Only after the details of her experience were leaked did Dr. Ford make the reluctant decision to come forward publicly.In the 36 hours since her name became public, Dr. Ford has received a stunning amount of support from her community and from fellow citizens across our country. At the same time, however, her worst fears have materialized. She has been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats. As a result of these kind of threats, her family was forced to relocate out of their home. Her email has been hacked, and she has been impersonated online.While Dr. Ford s life was being turned upside down, you and your staff scheduled a public hearing for her to testify at the same table as Judge Kavanaugh in front of two dozen U.S. Senators on national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident. The hearing was scheduled for six short days from today and would include interrogation by Senators who appear to have made up their minds that she is  mistaken  and  mixed up.  While no sexual assault survivor should be subjected to such an ordeal, Dr. Ford wants to cooperate with the Committee and with law enforcement officials.As the Judiciary Committee has recognized and done before, an FBI investigation of the incident should be the first step in addressing her allegations. A full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions.Sen. Grassley responded in a letter to Ford s attorney, in which he solicitously offered her client the option of a private or public hearing and respectfully explained   yet again   why an FBI investigation was wholly unnecessary at this point now that the Senate was conducting its own investigation:As you know, I have reopened the hearing on Judge Kavanaugh s nomination in light of Dr. Ford s allegations. That hearing will begin again on Monday, September 24, at 10:00 a.m. I have invited Dr. Ford to testify regarding her allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. And in recognition of how difficult it can be to discuss allegations of this kind in public, I have also offered her the choice of testifying in either a public or closed session of the hearing. In response to my invitation, however, you wrote yesterday that  an FBI investigation of the incident should be the first step in addressing her allegations. I certainly understand and respect Dr. Ford s desire for an investigation of her allegations. That is precisely what the Senate is doing. That is why our investigators have asked to speak with your client. That is why I have invited Dr. Ford to tell her story to the Senate and, if she so chooses, to the American people. It is not the FBI s role to investigate a matter such as this. Before nominating an individual to a judicial or executive office, the White House directs the FBI to conduct a background investigation. The FBI compiles information about a prospective nominee and sends it to the White House. The White House then provides FBI background investigation files to the Senate as a courtesy to help us determine whether to confirm a nominee. The FBI does not make a credibility assessment of any information it receives with respect to a nominee. Nor is it tasked with investigating a matter simply because the Committee deems it important. The Constitution assigns the Senate, and only the Senate, with the task of advising the President on his nominee and consenting to the nomination if the circumstances merit. We have no power to commandeer an Executive Branch agency into conducting our due diligence. The job of assessing and investigating a nominee s qualifications in order to decide whether to consent to the nomination is ours, and ours alone.I have reopened the hearing because I believe that anyone who comes forward with allegations of sexual assault has a right to be heard, and because it is the Committee s responsibility to fully evaluate the fitness of a nominee to the Supreme Court. I therefore want to give Dr. Ford an opportunity to tell her story to the Senate and, if she chooses, to the American people. I also want to give Judge Kavanaugh an opportunity to respond to the allegations. By hearing out both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, the Committee will endeavor to discover the truth of the matter, and will be better able to make an informed judgment about Judge Kavanaugh s nomination.Sen. Grassley then provided Katz with a deadline for confirming that her client would testify:You have stated repeatedly that Dr. Ford wants to tell her story. I sincerely hope that Dr. Ford will accept my invitation to do so, either privately or publicly, on Monday. In the meantime, my staff would still welcome the opportunity to speak with Dr. Ford at a time and place convenient to her. And I remind you that, consistent with Committee rules, Dr. Ford s prepared testimony and biography are due to the Committee by 10:00 a.m. on Friday, September 21, if she intends to testify on Monday.A report by Fox News confirmed Grassley s assertions that the FBI has no jurisdiction to investigate Ford s allegations because they do not involve a federal crime. An FBI source told the network,  This is a political issue, not a law enforcement one. Another source told Fox News,  It s totally inappropriate for someone to demand we use law enforcement resources to investigate a 35-year-old allegation when she won t go under oath and can t remember key details including when or where it happened.  In an FBI background investigation, the bureau is only responsible for finding information and passing it along, which they have done in the Kavanaugh case, a source said. The source said the FBI would not investigate  the information found,  Fox News reported.However, late Wednesday evening, another of Ford s lawyers, Lisa Banks, issued a new statement that shifted her client s demands again   now demanding a hearing for  multiple witnesses.  [Ford] continues to believe that a full non-partisan investigation of this matter is needed and she is willing to cooperate with the Committee,  Banks  statement read.  However, the Committee s stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation; there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding.The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth. JUST IN: Lawyer for Christine Blasey Ford issues new statement:  The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth.  https://t.co/LvTe3kGtgN pic.twitter.com/bocCe54CvH  ABC News (@ABC) September 19, 2018Banks was perhaps alluding to the two other individuals named by Ford as being at the party 35 years ago when the alleged incident occurred. The two men, Mark Judge and Patrick J. Smyth, both issued statements denying any knowledge of the incident and declining any invitation to speak further on the matter.Mark Judge stated that he had  no recollection of any of the events described  by Ford and that he  never saw Brett act that way. In a letter to Sens. Grassley and Feinstein, Smyth wrote,  I am issuing this statement today to make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh.  To safeguard my own privacy and anonymity, I respectfully request that the Committee accept this statement in response to any inquiry the Committee may have,  he added.Thursday, September 20, 2018: On Thursday morning, the Senate Judiciary Committee s official Twitter account tweeted out confirmation that they had contacted and obtained statements  under penalty of felony  from Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, Patrick J. Smyth, and another person who was allegedly at the party where the incident occurred.In other words, the Committee was, in fact, reaching out to multiple witnesses   including Cristina King Miranda, a classmate of Ford s who deleted her Facebook post claiming knowledge of the incident and later admitted,  That it happened or not, I have no idea. I can t say that it did or didn t. Within hours of learning Dr. Ford s identity from press reports on Sunday Chairman Grassley took swift action making contact w the alleged witnesses. Dems haven t joined background investigation of Dr. Ford s allegations. It s our constitutional duty to do investigations.

Her attorneys say there needs to be an investigation, which is exactly what the committee has been doing all week. And we would love to hear from Dr. Ford. Democratic staff is invited to participate fully every step of the way.  Senate Judiciary (@senjudiciary) September 20, 2018Later Thursday Afternoon: One of Ford s lawyers sent an email to Senate Judiciary Committee members stating that Ford  would be prepared to testify next week  if the committee offers her  terms that are fair and which ensure her safety,  the New York Times reports.However, the email stated that it is  not possible  for Ford to attend the committee s scheduled hearing on Monday  and the Committee s insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event. The email also emphasized Ford s  strong preference  that  a full investigation  happen before her testimony.Late Thursday afternoon, Ford s attorney Katz had a 30-minute conference call with Republican and Democrat members of the Judiciary Committee to negotiate the  terms  Ford required in exchange for her testimony.According to reports from the Washington Post, Fox News, and others, Katz had at least five key requests for her client:First, no lawyers are allowed to question Ford, only members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Post reports that Katz is concerned that  the potential of an outside counsel coming in to question Ford  would  would be too much like a trial. Second, Kavanaugh cannot be in the hearing room when Ford gives her testimony.Third, Kavanaugh must give his testimony first, without the benefit of hearing the testimony of his accuser.Fourth, Ford wants the Senate Judiciary Committee to subpoena Mark Judge to testify.Finally, Katz suggested that Thursday, rather than Monday,  would be a good hearing date. This last request has great political significance because pushing the hearing to Thursday would mean Kavanaugh could not be confirmed in time to join the Supreme Court for its new session on October 1, as Republicans and the White House hope. (Breitbart s Joel Pollak explains why here.)Fox News reports that it  would be highly unusual for a witness before a Senate committee to dictate who receives a subpoena as a precondition to testifying.  However, CNN reporter Manu Raju tweeted that these demands were  mostly asks and appear to be negotiable. Before his rally in Las Vegas, NV, on Thursday evening, President Trump told Fox News s Sean Hannity that he doesn t think the hearings should be delayed any further if Ford refuses to appear on Monday. I don t think you can delay it any longer. They ve delayed it a week already,  Trump said.  They have to get on with it. Friday, September 21, 2018: The Senate Judiciary Committee has yet to respond to Ford s lawyer s demands.CNN reports that the Republican possible counter-offer to Ford includes a Wednesday hearing; Ford will testify first, followed by Kavanaugh; and questions will be asked by an independent counsel.BREAKING ON CNN: the LIKELY  key word, likely  GOP counteroffer to Prof. Ford is as follows 1) hearing Wednesday, 2) Ford testifies first, #Kavanaugh second, 3) Independent counsel asks questions. via @DanaBashCNN @Phil_Mattingly  Catherine Valentine (@CNNValentine) September 21, 2018Update: NBC News also reports on the GOP s counter-offer to Ford, including the new detail that only two witnesses will be called and the Committee will  pick a lawyer for question  Ford.JUST IN: Judiciary Cmte.

The source also said the Committee agreed to Ford s request to have only one camera at the hearing and for Kavanaugh not to be in the same room with her.Republican Committee members discussed this on a Friday morning conference call, according to Politico,  [a]nd barring new revelations, the party plans to vote on Kavanaugh s nomination in Judiciary Committee shortly after hearing [Ford s] testimony next week. A senior Democratic Senate aide told Politico that the GOP s offer of a Wednesday hearing date is one of several  nonstarters with Democrats and Ford s camp  because they  had made clear that [Ford] could not be in the capital to testify before Thursday. The Democratic aide accused the GOP of  making this disingenuous counter-offer knowing she won t be here.  Ford does not want to fly from her California home to Washington,  a Republican senator told Politico, and therefore  she may need to drive across the country to make the hearing. Ford has reportedly told friends she is uncomfortable in confined spaces, indicating a physical difficulty in making the trip by plane. Update: The 5:00 p.m. deadline for Ford and her lawyers to respond to the GOP s counter-offer has now expire. No word yet on whether they have accepted.Update: The Washington Post reports that the deadline has now been extended to 10:00 p.m.NEWS, w/@seungminkim: The deadline for Christine Blasey Ford s lawyers to respond to the Senate GOP offer for a Wednesday Judiciary Cmte hearing has been extended until 10 pm tonight, two people familiar with the situation tell us.

Grassley issued a statement Friday evening extending the deadline to 10 p.m. for Ford s lawyers to respond the Committee s offer and making it clear that if they do not respond, the Committee will proceed with a vote on Monday.Grassley s statement reads:Despite the fact that the July 30th letter remains hidden, my committee has been investigating the allegations and has heard from multiple witnesses since Sunday. Ms. Katz has discussed Dr. Ford s allegations in numerous media interviews and said on TV Monday morning that Dr. Ford wants to share her account with the Senate Judiciary Committee. It s Friday night and nothing s been agreed to despite our extensive efforts to make testimony possible. I m extending the deadline for response yet again to 10 o clock this evening. I m providing a notice of a vote to occur Monday in the event that Dr. Ford s attorneys don t respond or Dr. Ford decides not to testify. In the event that we can come to a reasonable resolution as I ve been seeking all week, then I will postpone the committee vote to accommodate her testimony. We cannot continue to delay.The Senate Judiciary Committee also posted the full proposal sent to Ford s lawyers explaining the Committee s response to her various demands.The proposal reads: Rebecca Mansour is a senior editor-at-large for Breitbart News and the host of Breitbart News Tonight on SiriusXM s Patriot channel 125, weeknights from 9pm to midnight Eastern (6pm to 9pm Pacific).

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/mitch-mcconnell-predicts-kavanaugh-supreme-court/","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) predicted during the Values Voters Summit on Friday that  Judge Kavanaugh will be on the Supreme Court. Sen. McConnell predicted that the Senate will soon confirm President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee on Friday despite the accusations laid against Kavanaugh. Christine Blasey Ford, a California psychology professor, has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both in high school in the 1980s.Ford alleges that in 1982, 17-year-old Kavanaugh and a friend pulled Ford into a room during a high school party in suburban Maryland, forced her onto a bed, and groped her over her clothing before she was able to escape.McConnell continues to back Kavanaugh, saying that  President Trump has nominated a stunningly successful individual. Sen. McConnell charged that Senate Republicans must  wait out the obstruction  from Senate Democrats and that Kavanaugh will soon join President Trump s other nominee, Neil Gorsuch, on the Supreme Court.The Kentucky Republican said,  You ve watched the fight. You ve watched the tactics. But here s what I want to tell you: in the very near future, Judge Kavanaugh will be on the United States Supreme Court,  to which the crowd erupted in thunderous applause. So my friends, keep the faith. Don t be rattled by all of this. We re going to plow right through it and do our jobs,  McConnell added. Even more nominees will be confirmed. They will be pro-family,  said McConnell.
McConnell also said that the record numbers of judicial confirmations are the  single most consequential things  the Senate does for the future of the country.President Trump backed the Supreme Court nominee in a series of tweets on Friday, saying,  Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a fine man, with an impeccable reputation, who is under assault by radical left-wing politicians who don t want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay. Facts don t matter. I go through this with them every single day in D.C. Trump also called for Ford to provide details of Kavanaugh s alleged assault against her. I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents,  Trump added.  I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/donald-trump-challenges-brett-kavanaugh-accuser-to-provide-detailed-evidence/","President Donald Trump called out the woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault on Friday to provide details of the alleged attack. I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents,  Trump said.  I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place! The president has so far resisted attacking the accuser Christine Ford, signaling instead his willingness to hear her claims against Kavanaugh before he is confirmed for the Supreme Court. Ford has said she did not report the details of the alleged incident to anyone after she claims it occurred over 30 years ago when they were both in high school.Trump ridiculed the left for demanding an FBI investigation of the alleged incident before confirming Kavanaugh. The radical left lawyers want the FBI to get involved NOW,  he wrote.  Why didn t someone call the FBI 36 years ago? Trump also expressed his frustration with the Democrats and leftists in Washington, DC, after they successfully delayed the vote to confirm his nominee by a week. Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a fine man, with an impeccable reputation, who is under assault by radical left-wing politicians who don t want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay,  he wrote.  Facts don t matter. I go through this with them every single day in D.C. Trump criticized Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Senate Democrats for delaying the release of the accuser s letter until the hearings were over. Senator Feinstein and the Democrats held the letter for months, only to release it with a bang after the hearings were OVER  done very purposefully to Obstruct & Resist & Delay,  he wrote.  Let her testify, or not, and TAKE THE VOTE!

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/21/maddow-kavanaugh-could-be-arrested-as-a-sitting-supreme-court-justice/","Thursday on her MSNBC show, Rachel Maddow discussed Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh s sexual assault accusation, and if confirmed, she said the judge could be arrested as a sitting Supreme Court justice because  there is no statute of limitations for a felony like this  where the alleged misconduct allegedly took place over 30 years ago. There is no statute of limitations for a felony like this in Maryland,  Maddow explained.  Local authorities in Montgomery County, Maryland now say that while this allegation does pertain to their jurisdiction, the reason they have not yet opened a criminal investigation of this matter is because they have not received a criminal complaint from the alleged victim in this case. I don t know if it will always be this way. She added,  [Dr. Christine Blasey Ford] could, at any point, make that criminal complaint to the police in Maryland, who would not be bound by some expiration of the statute of limitations here. Such a complaint count start a criminal investigation conceivably of a sitting Supreme Court justice for felony attempted rape. If law enforcement found that allegation to be substantiated and they found sufficient evidence to bring charges, there is no rule against indicting a Supreme Court justice. There is not even a Justice Department policy against indicting a Supreme Court justice the way there is for, say, a president of the United States. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

We ve got her back. Her story is our story. She is one of us,  said neighbor Kristen Podulka.At the same time, an airplane   reportedly hired by a different group of activists from back east   was flying above Palo Alto towing the message,  Thank you Christine, we have your back.  She s getting death threats. The trolls of the world are not afraid to have their voice spoken,  said Poduika.  So we are trying to drown them out with our voice of love and encouragement and support. Palo Alto Mayor Liz Kniss encouraged Dr. Ford to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, though Dr. Ford s lawyer is insisting on a number of conditions before she does so, including that she be allowed to testify after Kavanaugh.In Washington, DC, activists gathered in the Hart Senate Office Building to protest against Kavanaugh. Wearing buttons that read,  I believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford,  they cheered Democrat Sens. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).Joel B.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/blue-state-blues-brett-kavanaugh-circus-is-a-preview-of-democrats-return-to-power/","If you like what you ve seen Democrats do in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, you re going to love what they do if they win the 2018 midterm elections.They began by trying to prevent the hearings from taking place at all, interrupting repeatedly and demanding votes on frivolous points of order.Then they praised the left-wing radical  protesters  who disrupted proceedings.Then they broke the rules and released confidential information.Now, they want Kavanaugh to face a Kafkaesque show trial.The Democrats are doing their worst because a Supreme Court seat is at stake, and their base will accept nothing less. Yet they will do the same next year, if voters give them a chance to govern again.They intend on turning the House   or the Senate   into a Star Chamber that could make the McCarthy hearings look like a model of procedural fairness.They are not interested in oversight, any more than they want to hear from Christine Blasey Ford. They want to turn oversight into  overthrow. McClatchy briefly sketched Democrats  plans Thursday:Democrats want to examine President Donald Trump s tax returns. There s talk of launching an independent commission into his administration s handling of the hurricane that wracked Puerto Rico. Progressive activists are ready to start impeachment proceedings.Get ready. If Democrats take control of a chamber in the November election, expect a flood of hearings, investigations, probes and special commissions starting in January.Last month, a spreadsheet emerged that listed 100 investigations that Republicans believe Democrats will launch the moment Nancy Pelosi seizes the speaker s gavel. Many of them are redundant, or ridiculous, aimed only at embarrassing the president and preventing Congress from achieving anything more on his watch.For example, Democrats want to probe the payment to porn star Stormy Daniels   a matter already in the ambitious grasp of the U.S. Attorney of the Southern District of New York.The ultimate goal is Trump s impeachment, removal of office   and, perhaps, worse. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD), the second-ranking Democrat behind Pelosi, has declared Trump guilty of  treason,  for which one punishment is death.Pelosi has tried to downplay the impeachment issue, without success, because the so-called  Resistance  demands nothing less and because Tom Steyer, the party s top donor in the last midterm election, is spending over $100 million promoting the cause.But even if Democrats do not succeed in ousting Trump   thanks, in theory, to Republican opposition in the Senate   they will destroy our democratic institutions in the process.In the Kavanaugh controversy, Democrats are backing a demand by Dr. Ford s attorney that the judge be required to speak first   before he has heard the accusations against him. It is a complete inversion of civil rights, one familiar to totalitarian dictatorships, and a preview of how Democrats will conduct  oversight. Democrats have also demanded the FBI investigate Kavanaugh, for a seventh time. They have learned nothing from 2016 and are eager to use   or abuse   the powers of law enforcement for political gain. And Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) helpfully offered this advice to American men:  Just shut up. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who is chiefly to blame for the way Democrats have handled the Kavanaugh accusation, was elected in 1992, after female voters marched to the polls to express their outrage at the way Anita Hill was questioned about her accusations against Clarence Thomas. She has predicted 2018 will be another  year of the woman,  and is determined to make it so.But there are also millions of American men   and women   who are outraged by what is happening to Kavanaugh. It is up to them to stop this liberal totalitarianism from taking over our country.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/09/20/politico-editor-in-chief-god-is-laughing-at-brett-kavanaugh/","Politico Editor-in-Chief John Harris penned an op-ed on Monday suggesting that  God is laughing at Brett Kavanaugh,  noting the supposed irony that Kavanaugh once investigated Bill Clinton s infidelity only to have the Senate Judiciary Committee and the media now investigate a sexual misconduct allegation brought against the Supreme Court nominee.Harris wrote his op-ed one day after the Washington Post revealed that California psychology professor, Christine Blasey Ford, is the woman that now accuses Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both in high school in the 1980s.Ford alleges that back in 1982, a 17-year-old Kavanaugh and a friend of his pulled Ford into a room during a high school party in suburban Maryland, forced her onto a bed, and groped her over her clothing before she was able to escape.The Politico chief noted the irony in this accusation considering that Kavanaugh spent his early 30s investigating Bill Clinton s  most intimate moral failings,  or his affair with then-21-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. And now the Senate Judiciary Committee and the media are investigating Kavanaugh s alleged groping of a woman when he was in high school. God, it s sometimes said, has an awesome sense of humor,  Harris remarked.The Politico head continued:So here was Kavanaugh who spent his early 30s as a Ken Starr warrior pursuing Bill Clinton for the political and legal implications of his most intimate moral failings now in his early 50s facing a political crisis over disturbingly vivid, passionately contested, decades-old allegations about Kavanaugh s own possible moral failings.Few prosecutors, it seems likely, would ever open an assault case 36 years later on the basis of Christine Blasey Ford s account of being pinned down on a bed by a drunken Kavanaugh, then 17, and being aggressively groped until a friend of his physically jumped in.Harris contends that few people would investigate a 36-year-old sexual assault accusation; however, few people would have also investigated a  middle-aged man s lies about adultery if that person had not been President Bill Clinton.  The Politico chief neglects to mention that President Clinton was impeached for lying under oath before a grand jury and for obstruction of justice, not for sexual impropriety.The comparison between Kavanaugh and Clinton also fails to note that President Clinton did, in fact, have an affair with Lewinsky during his presidency, while Kavanaugh has continued to vehemently deny the accusations brought against him.Now on Thursday, Ford has said that she is willing to testify before the committee next week, but not on Monday,  so long as her safety is assured and hearing is fair. NEW: Lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford have told Senate Judiciary Committee staff she is  prepared to testify  next week   but not Monday   so long as her safety is assured and hearing is fair.  My latest.  https://t.co/WiA3kXb2d8  Sheryl Gay Stolberg (@SherylNYT) September 20, 2018Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) gave Ford and her lawyers until Friday morning to say if she plans to testify either in private or public.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) suggested that, if Ford does not testify, the committee should move forward with Kavanaugh s nomination, and key moderate senators are beginning to say the same.President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he would like to hear from Kavanaugh s accuser despite her reluctance to testify. The president also said that the last-minute accusation revealed by Democrats was  very unfair  to Kavanaugh and his family. I can only say this: He is such an outstanding man. Very hard for me to imagine that anything happened,  Trump added.Harris concludes in his editorial,  With a vote on his career-long dream of serving on the high court scheduled for three days from now, Kavanaugh can be forgiven if he is not in an ironic frame of mind.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/20/trump-dems-trying-to-besmirch-kavanaugh-have-to-get-on-with-it/","President Donald Trump on Thursday evening said Democrats are trying to  besmirch  Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and need to  get on with it  without any more Senate Judiciary Committee delays. I don t think you can delay it any longer. They ve delayed it a week already,  Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity before a Las Vegas, Nevada, rally.  They have to get on with it. Before the rally, Trump told Hannity that he thinks  it s a sad situation  and said that Kavanaugh is an  outstanding person.  Trump, referring to Christine Blasey Ford, the Northern California psychology professor who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, asked,  Why didn t somebody call the FBI 36 years ago?  To take a man like this and besmirch,  Trump said, adding that he has been  accommodating.   Now, with that being said, let her have her say and let s see how it all works out. Later at the rally for Sen. Dean Heller (D-NV), Trump said,  One of the reasons I was elected was because you believed I was going to pick great Supreme Court Justices.  Brett Kavanaugh and I m not saying anything about anybody else but I want to tell you that Brett Kavanaugh is one of the finest human beings you will have the privilege of knowing or meeting. A great intellect. A great gentleman. An impeccable reputation. Went to Yale. Top student. Went to Yale Law School. Top student,  Trump said at the rally.  So we ll let it play out, and I think everything s going to be just fine. This is a high-quality person. On Thursday afternoon, Ford s lawyers told Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) that though Ford will not testify on Monday, Ford  wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety.  A hearing on Monday is not possible and the Committee s insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event,  Ford s lawyers wrote Grassley, who had given Ford s team a Friday morning (10 a.m. ET) deadline to make their decision about testifying.  Dr. Ford has asked me to let you know that she appreciates the various options you have suggested. Her strong preference continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony. Kavanaugh also wrote Grassley and said he  will be there  on Monday and looks  forward to the opportunity to testify before the Committee.  I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name,  Kavanaugh wrote.  Since the moment I first heard this allegation, I have categorically and unequivocally denied it. I remain committed to defending my integrity. On Thursday evening, Ford s lawyers reportedly indicated that Ford could be willing to testify on Thursday of next week so long as certain conditions are met. Ford s lawyers reportedly are opposed to Senators using outside lawyers to question Ford. They also want Kavanaugh to testify first and to not be in the same room at the same time as Ford.Earlier in the week, Lisa Banks, one of Ford s lawyers, told CNN s Anderson Cooper that her client was  not prepared  to testify on Monday and indicated that Ford did not want to do so before a full FBI investigation into her allegations. Banks also claimed that the Judiciary Committee s  stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation  and added that  there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding.

I believe her and I think she s very courageous for coming this far,  Seidman told the news outlet.Prior to her post as senior principal at TSD Communications, Seidman was then-Senator Joe Biden s communications director in 2008 and later advised the White House on the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor in 2009. The longtime Democrat operative was also the deputy communications director during the Clinton years.One Republican official told Politico that Seidman s involvement  feels more like a Democratic super PAC than a legal effort to get at the truth. An email obtained by the New York Times reveals Ford has declined to testify on Monday and is instead proposing to appear before lawmakers on an unspecified day next week if given  terms that are fair and which ensure her safety.  Appearing before the committee  is not possible and the Committee s insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event,  the email written by Ford s lawyer reads.In an interview with the Washington Post released over the weekend, Ford came forward with her allegations against Kavanaugh, in which she claimed the future judge pinned her down on a bed and proceeded to grope her during a Maryland house party in the 1980s. Ford reportedly does not recall who organized the gathering or its exact time and date.Mike Judge, who Ford claims jumped atop her and Kavanaugh sending the pair tumbling to the ground, told the Weekly Standard that the accusation is  absolutely nuts. Last Monday, Kavanaugh denied the allegation, issuing the following statement:  This is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday.  Conversing with reporters this week, President Donald Trump defended Kavanugh, describing him as an  outstanding man,  and encouraged Ford to appear before lawmakers next week. Look, if she shows up and makes a credible showing, that will be very interesting and we ll have to make a decision,  the president said.  But I can only say this: he s such an outstanding man   very hard for me to imagine that anything happened.  I really want to see her,  he added.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said Republicans were not giving  basic courtesies  to Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.Gillibrand said.  I believe Dr. Blasey Ford because she is telling the truth and you know it by her story, by the fact she told her therapist from five years ago. It was documented at the time. We have the therapist s notes. She told her husband. This is a trauma she has been dealing with her whole life. She doesn t want to be in a bedroom that doesn t have two doors. People knew that about her a long time ago. They told a friend a year ago before Kavanaugh was ever named. These are the hallmarks of truth. These are the hallmarks of someone who has to be believed. She continued,  She fears if this person is confirmed he will do terrible things for American women. She is concerned he doesn t have the character, the integrity, the honesty to be a Supreme Court justice. I believe her because she s telling the truth. She s asking the FBI to investigate her claims. She s asking for that kind of review, that investigative work, that oversight and accountability, because she s telling the truth. Someone who is lying does not ask the FBI to investigate their claim. Who is not asking the FBI to investigate these claims? The White House. Judge Kavanaugh has not asked the FBI to investigate these claims. Is that the reaction of an innocent person? It is not. We have to get to the bottom of these claims before we put someone on the Supreme Court for life. I m very concerned that they are unwilling to get to the bottom of this, don t want the facts. Even the Anita Hill hearing had an investigation, an FBI investigation, of her allegation in advance of the hearing. She had 22 witnesses, some of them corroborating witnesses. Those things are not being afforded Dr. Blasey Ford. They are the basics. This is not something that s debatable or negotiable, or we only do it sometime. A background check is required for all judicial nominees, especially the Supreme Court, but they can t complete that background check if they don t investigate these claims. Right now we have an incomplete background investigation by the FBI. She added,  She is not asking for extraordinary measures. She is asking for basic fairness. This is about basic fairness. I do hope the American people, I do hope every woman in America is paying very close attention to what is happening in this body, in the U.S. Senate, today. This is not 1991 and how dare them not even afford the basic courtesies that were afforded them. They are not giving her an option. The option is show up Monday or don t show up at all. I consider that to be bullying. I consider that to be disregarding. I consider that to be something set up for failure. They would like a he said/she said scenario. Because you know what happens in those scenarios? The men are typically believed. You see those issues through your own lens. Why not have the witnesses? What are they afraid of? Why not have the therapist come in, her husband come in, her friend come in? Why not have Mark Judge testify under oath to the FBI and in front of the committee. What are they afraid of? What is this White House afraid of? What is this president afraid of? What is the U.S. Senate afraid of?  What are the Republican members of the judiciary afraid of? Those are the questions we need to ask today. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Another message states  Hi, Ashley,  you should tell her husband to  put a bullet in his  skull.  My condolences to you for being married to a rapist. Although you probably deserve it,  another email read.On Wednesday, Mrs. Kavanaugh is said to have received a note with the following subject line:  F*** YOU AND YOUR RAPIST HUSBAND. The U.S. Marshals Service has yet to issue a statement regarding the matter.According to the Journal,  One person close to the confirmation process said that while Mrs. Kavanaugh is upset by the attacks on her husband, she doesn t want him to withdraw. Judge Kavanaugh himself hasn t considered withdrawing. Mrs. Kavanaugh, who serves as Town Manager of Maryland s Chevy Chase, met the future Supreme Court nominee while working in the George W. Bush White House.In addition to Mrs. Kavanaugh, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) has received multiple threats in a bid to intimidate her into voting against the Trump Supreme Court pick. My office has received some pretty ugly voice mail threats, terrible things said to my staff, so this has been a very ugly process and I think that s very unfortunate,  Collins told radio station WVOM on Wednesday. Last week, Collins s chief of staff, Steve Abbot, told a Maine television station,  We ve had some very abusive callers  regarding Kavanaugh s nomination.  We ve had some very vulgar calls and sort of harassing the staff. Christine Blasey Ford, the California psychology professor accusing Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a house party around 1982, has also been the subject of threats, according to her lawyer Debra Katz.  As you are aware, she has been receiving death threats, which have been reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and she and her family have been forced out of their home, Katz wrote in an email sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.In a separate email, Ford s second lawyer, Lisa Banks, claimed to lawmakers that the professor has faced  vicious harassment  after coming forward with her story.  As a result of these kind of threats, her family was forced to relocate out of their home. Her email has been hacked, and she has been impersonated online,  the attorney wrote. According to the New York Times, Ford will meet with the FBI in San Francisco Friday to discuss the threats.In a letter sent to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on Thursday, Kavanaugh confirmed he will appear before the committee on Monday to address the decades-old accusation.  Thank you for the invitation to appear before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on Monday, September 24. I will be there. I look forward to the opportunity to testify before the Committee,  wrote the Supreme Court nominee.Conversely, Ford has declined to testify on Monday and has proposed to appear before the committee on an unspecified day next week if offered  terms that are fair and which ensure her safety.  According to Ford s attorney, meeting with lawmakers  is not possible and the Committee s insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/20/kavanaugh-on-monday-hearing-i-will-be-there/","Judge Brett Kavanaugh sent Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) a letter Thursday emphatically stating his willingness to address his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford s, claims as soon as possible after she refused to appear at Monday s scheduled hearing on the matter. Thank you for the invitation to appear before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on Monday, September 24. I will be there. I look forward to the opportunity to testify before the Committee,  the Supreme Court nominee wrote. (Emphasis added.)The letter comes hours after Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of drunkenly groping, restraining, and attempting to undress her at a high school party more than 35 years ago, communicated through her lawyers that she was not willing to appear at the open hearing under oath Monday.Ford s lawyers made clear she was  willing to testify  but that it was  not possible  for her to do so Monday. Grassley previously offered the opportunity for Ford to address the committee behind closed doors at a bi-partisan conference and other Republican committee members reiterated Wednesday that Ford is still welcome to testify privately.By contrast, Kavanaugh expressed eagerness to defend himself further after having already done so to Judiciary Committee staff behind closed doors and stated he was willing to conduct the additional hearing as early as this past Tuesday.  I also appreciate the time that Committee staff took to interview me on Monday, September 17. During that interview, I twice requested a Committee hearing for the following day, Tuesday, September 18,  Kavanaugh goes on.  I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name. Kavanaugh closes the letter with another denial of Ford s claims.  Since the moment I first heard this allegation, I have categorically and unequivocally denied it. I remain committed to defending my integrity,  his letter reads.The Monday hearing already represents a delay to Kavanaugh s confirmation process. He had been scheduled to come up for a committee vote this Thursday, the last hurdle before a final full-Senate debate and vote, when Ford s allegations surfaced over the weekend. During his four days of public hearings, no mention was made of the alleged incident despite ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) having been in possession of a letter from Ford detailing her account for weeks.Democrats, including Feinstein, are now claiming the Monday hearing is too soon and that the FBI needs to investigate the allegation first:This is exactly right. The FBI should investigate Dr. Ford s allegations, not partisan staff. Senators need to be working with the same set of facts. https://t.co/Vv4TDqMA7I  Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) September 20, 2018Other Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have called the Monday hearing a  rush :Republican opposition to re-opening the FBI background investigation doesn t make sense. Members of the U.S. Senate should exercise due diligence, not rush toward a vote for a lifetime appointment. The people we represent didn t send us here to shirk our duty.  Kamala Harris (@SenKamalaHarris) September 19, 2018Sen. Patrick Leahy, a senior Democrat on the judiciary committee, says Republicans should not rush Christine Blasey Ford to testify:  If they have nothing to hide, why the hurry?  pic.twitter.com/0afCwzv7VG  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 20, 2018The Justice Department has repeatedly explained that, as the allegations contain no possible federal crime and the FBI s nominee background investigations do not include the Bureau weighing in on the credibility of claims of this kind, the FBI is not involved in the dispute.

If you haven t, have no fear, #VoterEmpowermentDay is almost here! #TakeItBackLearn more: https://t.co/VVZcmp1MqZ  Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) September 20, 2018The super PAC affiliate of the taxpayer-funded abortion chain hopes to enable the Democrats to regain control of the House for a  pro-reproductive health majority. Fortune reports:In 15 of the races, the incumbent is a Republican; in nine, the races are open. But the organization will be giving particular attention to six races: California s 25th and 48th districts, Illinois  6th district, Minnesota s 2nd and 3rd districts, and New York s 19th district.According to the report, these six races are considered  toss-ups. Planned Parenthood will be running digital ads, participate in door-to-door canvassing, and distribute mailers emphasizing their continued fight for abortion rights and support for Obamacare. The Trump-Pence administration is responsible for an unprecedented assault on Planned Parenthood patients and our communities, aided by politicians at state and federal levels who have supported dangerous policies meant to strip us of our rights and our ability to access health care,  Deirdre Schifeling, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, said in March.  In response, we ve marched, we ve mobilized, we ve organized, and together we ve built a historic resistance. Now, our electoral program is going to channel that energy and the activism into electoral victories across the country in 2018. Earlier in September, Planned Parenthood announced a $20 million midterm election ground campaign  reportedly the largest ever organized by the group. This is all fuel to an already raging fire,  Schifeling said, warning that the  days are numbered  for any politician who opposes women s right to abortion.Announcements about Planned Parenthood s investment in the campaigns of pro-abortion candidates have been coordinated with the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the sexual misconduct allegations made against him by Christine Blasey Ford.Whether it was abusing his power over a young woman 30 years ago, or abusing his power over women s lives as a judge, Brett Kavanaugh should not be considered for a seat on the Supreme Court.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/20/pence-accuser-should-be-heard-but-democrats-unfair-to-kavanaugh-and-his-family/","Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday that he and President Donald Trump want to hear from Christine Blasey Ford   the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attacking her in high school   but that the  process  the Democrats have used to put last-minute doubt into the confirmation process has been unfair to Kavanaugh and his family. Let me just say to begin with that I had the opportunity to meet Judge Kavanaugh before the president made a decision, and to review his record,  Pence told Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council on his Washington Watch radio program. Pence went on to say:Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a man of integrity, deeply committed to his family, with a lifetime of service to this country in a variety of roles. On the District of Columbia Court of Appeals more than 300 opinions that reflect a strong and principled judicial philosophy that again interprets statutes as written, will interpret the Constitution as written, will not legislate from the bench, and we believe that he will make an outstanding justice to the Supreme Court of the United States.That being said, as President Trump has said over the last several days, with the allegations that have emerged, it s important that we give it time, that we hear from both sides, and we have every confidence that Senator Grassley and the Republicans in the Senate will handle these allegations properly. I know Senator Grassley has laid forward a range of options from an open session hearing to a closed session to private staff interviews, and they ve already   the staff and the judiciary committee has already begun following up on leads   following Dr. Ford s allegations. And that s all very important.And again   we re confident the Senate will handle it, but that being said, what Senator Diane Feinstein has done here   what Democrats in the Senate have done here   is very unfair to Judge Brett Kavanaugh and it is a great disservice to the process. The fact that Senator Feinstein apparently had this letter more than six weeks ago, never raised the issue in her interview with Judge Brett Kavanaugh, never brought the issue to the attention of other members of the judiciary committee, it s a great disservice to the process, and to the American people, and, of course, to Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his family.Pence also said the Democratic senators on the Judiciary committee also harmed the confirmation process by how they handled questioning Kavanaugh at the hearings. And frankly, it follows on conduct by many Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee who I think virtually embarrassed themselves during the public hearings that were on display just a few short days ago,  Pence said.  So, that being said, I would just say the president and I believe that Judge Brett Kavanaugh will make an outstanding addition to the Supreme Court of the United States.  We re very confident that the Senate will handle this all in a proper and appropriate way,  Pence said.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/20/kavanaugh-accuser-refuses-to-appear-monday-prepared-to-testify/","Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, will not appear at the Monday hearing Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) set to address her claims, her attorneys wrote Thursday.The New York Times published portions of an email from Ford s lawyers to Judiciary Committee staff claiming it  is not possible  for her to appear Monday and that the  Committee s insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event.  Ford  would be prepared to testify next week,  but only on  terms that are fair and which ensure her safety. The Monday hearing was set to discuss, under oath, Ford s accusation that more than 35 years ago, a 17-year-old Kavanaugh had pulled her into a room at a high school party with another teenager and groped her. The email made clear she would not appear at the Monday hearing at which Kavanaugh has already agreed to testify.Grassley had set a Friday morning deadline for Ford to let the Judiciary Committee know if she would appear. He has also stated that the hearing may be cancelled if Ford refuses to testify.Grassley, who first suggested Ford and Kavanaugh address the accusation in a bipartisan conference call, then offered a full, open-door hearing under oath and set a date for Monday. Other Republican senators, like Susan Collins (R-ME), also made clear that Ford would have an option to testify in private with or without Kavanaugh s presence if she so preferred:I hope that Dr. Ford will reconsider and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. It is my understanding that the Committee has offered to hold either a public or a private session, whichever would make her more comfortable.  Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) September 19, 2018Ford s camp and the Democrats opposed to Kavanaugh s confirmation quickly balked, demanding an  FBI investigation  despite the Department of Justice s repeated assertion that the accusation, as it involves no potential federal crime, is not under the Bureau s general investigative jurisdiction and that their role in background investigations for nominees does not include credibility determinations. The FBI make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation. The purpose of a background investigation is to determine whether the nominee could pose a risk to the national security of the United States,  a Justice Department spokesman said in a statement. It is important to remember that an FBI background investigation is entirely different from an FBI criminal investigation,  a former federal prosecutor further explained to Breitbart News Thursday.  The letter referred by Feinstein has already been added to Kavanaugh s file, so the normal background element is complete.  What Ford is now asking for with a full investigation would be a criminal investigation,  the prosecutor went on.  The FBI does not do that when there is no federal crime being alleged. Ford s lawyers  email appears to drop this demand for an FBI investigation after Ford s lead attorney, Democratic donor Debroah Katz, claimed Tuesday that her client would not testify without such an investigation. The letter states a  strong preference  for  a full investigation  but reportedly does not mention the FBI.The New York Times s report notes no specific reasons for further delay, but notes that Katz hopes to set up a call Thursday evening to  discuss the conditions  for her client s testimony. The scheduling of the Monday hearing was already a delay on Kavanaugh s confirmation process, which included four days of public hearings at which Ford s allegations were never mentioned and was set for a committee vote Thursday. A letter detailing Ford s claims was in Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein s (D-CA) possession during the entirety of Kavanaugh s original hearing and for several weeks before.The email also makes notes of  death threats  and Ford an her family being  forced out of their home,  and implied her  safety  was one of the conditions for her appearing in on Capitol Hill.

Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said Republicans in the Senate were handling Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct,  worse than  Republicans  handling of Anita Hill s accusations during the confirmation hearing for Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991.Boxer said,  We are facing another moment in our history that we faced with Anita Hill. Anita Hill got no justice and we got a justice who is still sitting on that bench with a cloud over his head and he votes against women s rights time after time. I would just answer your question this way, regardless of what happens, what we see is that the Republicans in the United States Senate have learned nothing in 27 years. She continued,  If you look at the membership on that committee, four out of ten members on the Democratic side are women. Zero, zero out of 11 are women.  There are no women on their side. Hatch and Grassley, there for Anita Hill, who called for an FBI investigation, and rightly so in those years, are walking away from their own precedents on the committee. This is a loser for the Republicans. I hope Michael agrees with me on this. They have absolutely no credibility.

To hear these three friends of mine, as well as others who have contacted my office with their stories, brings tears to my eyes. It just goes to show how pervasive this is and how we have not created an environment where women like Dr. Ford can come forward and be supported in a respectful way. That s not what is happening.

The way I portrayed it and describe it, you have the entire force of the presidency and all of the supporters of Judge Kavanaugh in the Senate, a raid on one side and on this other side you have Dr. Ford who doesn t even have the benefit of an FBI investigation as we all have called for. She added,  How unfair is that? That s why I m grateful that the leaders of her school are coming forward. They organized a letter drive to stand with Dr. Ford and they are going to have a few words to say in a couple of minutes, but this is not fair. I m counting on the members of the press to point out that this is a fast track. They are totally intent on getting Judge Kavanaugh on to the Supreme Court come hell or high water.

Chuck Grassley s (R-IA) offer for Ford to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying that Kavanaugh should have the opportunity to defend himself from concrete accusations that have been made under oath.Dershowitz said,  I believe she has to show up on Monday. If she doesn t show up on Monday she has violated his core right to confront his accuser. If he shows up, what s he going to respond to? News reports? She has to go under oath. Dershowitz noted an accused s right to challenge his or her accuser within America s justice system and broader Western legal history. She has to testify,  Dershowitz said.  Nobody should be referring to her as a victim or him as a perpetrator until we hear from both of them under oath [and] subject to cross examination. There is nothing more essential to American justice than the opportunity to cross examine your accuser, to confront your accuser. It s in the Constitution. Essentially, it goes back to Magna Carta. Dershowitz went on,  The idea that we re calling somebody a perpetrator and somebody else a victim based solely on he-said-she-said is just wrong, and it s un-American. She should testify. They should also call in [Mark] Judge and any other witnesses who were at the party, who claim they weren t at the party. Sure, let them broaden it beyond the two of them.  Neither men nor women were born with a gene to lie or tell the truth. Women lie. Men lie. Women forget. Men forget. These are very emotional issues. Dershowitz described the  Me Too  campaign as framing men accused of sexual improprieties and/or crimes as guilty until proven innocent. That s what s happened today with the Me Too movement,  remarked Dershowitz.  In fact, in many respects, men are denied even the opportunity to prove their innocence. In colleges and universities today, it s enough for a preponderance of the evidence   that means 51 percent   that means 49 out of every 100 people accused on a college campus and convicted may well be innocent.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/09/20/huffpost-bombshell-reveals-kavanaughs-female-clerks-advised-look-outgoing/","An anonymous woman told HuffPost she was  warned  to look  outgoing  if she wanted a job clerking for Brett Kavanaugh.Kavanaugh is the Supreme Court nominee whose confirmation has been temporarily stalled due to a 36-year-old sexual misconduct accusation leveled at the last possible moment. Kavanaugh says the alleged incident (when he was 17) did not occur. Two witnesses back him up.To bring Kavanaugh down, the media are currently throwing whatever it can against the wall in the hopes of peeling off enough moderate Republican senators to kill his confirmation chances.And for that reason, a wildly misleading HuffPost headline reads,  Brett Kavanaugh Liked Female Clerks Who Looked A Certain Way,  Yale Student Was Told. But if you actually read the story, that is not even close to the truth.Naturally, the truth is buried under a dozen or so paragraphs of innuendo.The story s opening makes it sound as though Kavanaugh is grooming female law clerks for something untoward:A few years ago, as she was prepping to interview for a judicial clerkship, a student at Yale Law School received a troubling combination of warning and advice from her professors about one federal judge in particular: Brett Kavanaugh, she was told, liked his female clerks to have a  certain look. HuffPost then links the Kavanaugh dress code  warning  to former appeals court judge Alex Kozinski, who retired last year under a cloud of harassment allegations:  [She was warned] about two judges in particular: First, Alex Kozinski, then a judge on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, was known to sexually harass his clerks, he told her. (Kozinski retired in December amid accusations of harassment.) At first, HuffPost tells us this anonymous woman did not know what that  certain look  was, stating only  It was very clear to me that he was talking about physical appearance, because it was phrased as a warning <U+2015> and because it came after the warning about Judge Kozinski. But a full fifteen paragraphs into the piece, we discover that she was, in fact, told what a  certain look  meant.It meant Outgoing. Yes, you read that correctly; people are telling budding law clerks that Brett Kavanaugh wants female law clerks to look  outgoing,  which the dictionary defines as  friendly and socially confident; extroverted. Merriam-Webster uses  outgoing  this way in a sentence:  His outgoing personality made him popular at school. In other words, you should dress for success, with confidence, sharp, ready to conquer the world, to succeed  and not like a granola with a chip on your shoulder.Moreover, the person giving this  outgoing  advice is  a woman. Her name is Amy Chau, and she is a Yale Law School professor. The other person offering the advice is Chau s husband, Jed Rubenfeld, also a Yale professor.Without explanation, HuffPost describes Chau as  controversial. Somehow, though, the HuffPost story gets worse.A full 16 paragraphs in, we learn this advice might have been meant especially for this anonymous woman. The woman said she was not sure if Chua was giving this advice to others,  HuffPost is forced to admit. A friend suggested that the student needed the advice because she was awkward,  according to a transcript of a Gchat conversation that the Yale student had at the time and that was viewed by HuffPost. And so, if you read between the lines, it sounds as though this anonymous law student dressed like a slob, and a couple of concerned professors, hoping to advance her career, brought this to her attention in the most diplomatic way possible.For her part, Chau supports Kavanaugh s nomination and says she has placed ten clerks with him over the years, eight of them women, one of them her own daughter. As I wrote in the Wall Street Journal, he has also been an exceptional mentor to his female clerks,  Chau told HuffPost.  Among my proudest moments as a parent was the day I learned our daughter would join those ranks. A full 22 paragraphs into the piece, HuffPost finally informs readers,  Giving law students advice on what to wear to an interview isn t terribly odd. Of course, this is followed by a  but.  but the particular warning about Kavanaugh is unusual. A columnist told HuffPost the advice is  sexist. Except it is not Kavanaugh offering the advice; it is a professional woman motivated to help other women.Oh, and despite her misgivings about appearing  outgoing,  despite her  mixed feelings  about Kavanaugh, this anonymous woman still interviewed with him.Obviously, she did not get the job.Just one week ago, according to the media, Kavanaugh was a teenage  rapist.  Now the media are reduced to publishing misleading headlines, followed by a pile of dishonest paragraphs that are only there to bury the inconvenient truth of Kavanaugh s stellar record when it comes to advancing the careers of  outgoing  women. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/20/boo-hoo-hoo-democrat-eric-swalwell-mocks-threats-against-sen-collins-staff/","Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) mocked Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) late Wednesday night about threats she and her staff received over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. Boo hoo hoo. You re a senator who police will protect. A sexual assault victim can t sleep in her home tonight because of threats,  Swalwell tweeted, referring to reports Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford has received death threats.  She s on her own while you and your @SenateGOP colleagues try to rush through a hearing. In his now-deleted tweet, Swalwell   who is considering a presidential run in 2020   responded to a Hill article detailing the threatening voicemails and phone calls Collins  office received: My office has received some pretty ugly voicemails, threats, terrible things said to my staff,  Collins said in an interview with WVOM on Wednesday. We ve had some very abusive callers.  We ve had some very vulgar calls and sort of harassing the staff,  Steve Abbot, Collins s chief of staff, told a Maine TV station at the time. Have you seen the emails  where he talked about Roe v. Wade not being settled law. He [bleeped] lied to you. How [bleeped] naive do you have to be?  the caller in the voicemail said.Just last week, in a widely reported story, on top of other threats and acts of intimidation, Collins  office received a rape threat: The [left s] frustration has boiled over at points,  the Times understates.  Annie Clark, a spokeswoman for Ms. Collins, provided The New York Times with copies of a letter and multiple voice mail messages addressed to the senator using vulgar language and outright threats. One example of a threat is a  caller [who] told a 25-year-old female staff member at one of Ms. Collins s Maine offices that he hoped she would be raped and impregnated. Both Thursday s Hill report and last week s report in the far-left New York Times document threats only coming from those opposed to Kavanaugh s nomination.Under pressure, Swalwell later tweeted out an apology.  Sexual assault victims deserve respect. And senators shouldn t be threatened by the public,  he said.  I said something stupid and minimized ugly behavior. That tweet is deleted and I m sorry for that. This minimizing of threats against Republicans comes less than two weeks after a Republican congressional candidate   running for Swalwell s seat   was attacked with a knife by man making  disparaging  and  profanity-laced  remarks about President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. During that same week, a shooting threat was made against Trump supporters gathering Washington, DC.Breitbart News has documented over 560 separate acts of violence, vandalism, intimidation, and harassment committed by leftists against Republicans.Nevertheless, elected Democrats like Swalwell and his allies in the establishment media continue to both ignore and stoke this ongoing epidemic of political violence. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Handler took to her Twitter account to insist that the nation does not need another  sexual predator  on the court and that Republicans  have no regard  for women. One known sexual predator on the Supreme Court isn t enough for Republicans,  Handler tweeted on Thursday.  They want two. The president bragging about sexual assault isn t an issue for them either. They have no regard for women. No regard for their daughters or wives. One known sexual predator on the Supreme Court isn t enough for Republicans. They want two. The president bragging about sexual assault isn t an issue for them either. They have no regard for women. No regard for their daughters or wives.  Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) September 20, 2018Handler s attack on Kavanaugh, Thomas, and President Trump is of a piece with the left s campaign to smear Clarence Thomas all over again. For instance, on Tuesday, ABC News  chief political analyst Matthew Dowd also labeled Thomas a  sexual Predator,  despite the fact that the Justice was found not guilty of the sexual harassment charges he faced during his own confirmation hearings in 1991.Indeed, the FBI took three days to investigate the allegations of sexual harassment submitted by Anita Hill and at the conclusion of that investigative review, the agency said that Hill s charges were unfounded.But Hill s accusations were heard during the actual confirmation hearings, not afterward. Today, Democrats want Christine Blasey Ford s allegations heard despite that the actual confirmation hearings are long over and despite that these sudden accusations of sexual assault were not made public for 35 years.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.

Christine Blasey Ford didn t ask for any of this shit,  Bee proclaimed.  She did America a favor by coming forward with extremely relevant background information about an important job applicant. Comedienne Sarah Silverman also chimed in to attack Kavanaugh. Silverman targeted the SCOTUS nominee on her Hulu show, I Love You, America. Indeed, Silverman imagined that Ford is  brave  for coming forward with her hazy memories about a 35-year-old alleged assault. I think she s doing something really brave,  Silverman exclaimed.  And now in this time when we should be thoroughly vetting Kavanaugh, we are vetting her. Someone who is exposing her personal life at the expense of her entire life. And she s OK with it because that s the code she lives by. Of course, Kavanaugh has received a lot of vetting already. Not only has he undergone six deep dive FBI background checks, but he has also already been unanimously confirmed to the second highest court in the land.As to the accuser, despite all the lauding of Ford and the pleas for the Senate to allow her to  tell her story,  the accuser has thus far refused to do just that and has turned down repeated offers to appear before the U.S. Senate to tell her tale and answer questions about her supposed encounter with a teenaged Brett Kavanaugh.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) during Thursday s  Morning Joe   on MSNBC weighed in on Brett Kavanaugh s potential confirmation to the Supreme Court amid sexual misconduct allegations from over 30 years ago by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, saying the GOP is signaling that they are  OK  with  putting someone who committed attempted rape on the Supreme Court of the United States. MSNBC s Willie Geist asked,  [D]o you believe that Dr. Ford should testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday as she s been invited? 
 I hope that she does, because I m afraid that what the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee really want is they want her to go away,  Schiff replied.  They don t want the country to hear from her, and they certainly don t want the country to hear from her live and on television. She s absolutely right: the FBI should do a thorough vetting of these allegations. The Senate shouldn t simply rely on hearing two conflicting accounts and decide, Well, we re OK with not knowing. We re OK with the fact we might be putting someone who committed attempted rape on the Supreme Court of the United States.  He continued,  They should get to the bottom of this. And it wouldn t take that long to do. This is the same crowd that waited a year to fill the last vacancy during the Obama administration on the Supreme Court, so why this rush?

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/09/20/cnns-jim-acosta-uses-misleading-video-to-claim-kavanaugh-is-hiding-something/","CNN s Jim Acosta took a 2015 Brett Kavanaugh joke out of context to claim Kavanaugh is hiding something from his high school days.Far-left MSNBC has also aired the  deceptively edited  video and used it in this way, as has the far-left Politico. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) tweeted the video out and asked,  Is this really what American wants in its next Supreme Court Justice? As far as CNN is concerned, there are actually two falsehoods in the segment embedded below. The first is the CNN chyron that claims the GOP is  pushing  Kavanaugh s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.This is simply not true. Through her attorney, Ford had said she wanted to tell her story and the GOP is simply asking her to do so under oath. If she chooses not to, which now appears to be the case, she chooses not to.What s more, the GOP is obviously trying to accommodate her, and has even offered to hold the hearing in a private session. The truth is that Ford has now aligned herself with Democrats in calling for a FBI investigation into her allegations, even after the FBI said local crimes are not in its jurisdiction. Many see this as a stalling tactic as Democrats hope to run out the clock until the midterms.Acosta is even more dishonest than the chyron.Acosta airs video of Kavanaugh giving a speech in 2015 where he jokes about  What happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep.  think After the clip, Acosta gravely informs CNN viewers that this video  is not a conclusive piece of video that says that he did anything, but it does speak to  this notion that perhaps there are portions of his childhood that he would rather not come to light. Jim Acosta on the 2015 Kavanaugh clip (which CNN edits so it begins after the reference to his three male friends):  There are portions of his childhood he d rather not come to light.  Note how even Susan Hennessy thinks he s reaching. pic.twitter.com/swDqI2YcHh  Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 18, 2018In other words, here s a smoking gun proving Kavanaugh is covering up things he did during his high school days.But here is what Acosta and the far-left CNN do not want you to know   that Kavanaugh was specifically referring to three of his former classmates, with whom he has remained friends. It was a laugh line (referring to the famous Las Vegas slogan) and was not in any way a  moral code. Moreover, the friends he names are not involved in Ford s allegations. Here is the FULL context of Kavanaugh s remarks to the Columbus School of Law:By coincidence, three classmates of mine at Georgetown Prep were graduates of this law school in 1990, and are really, really good friends of mine   [names his friends], and they were good friends of mine then and are still good friends of mine as recently as this weekend when we were all on email together. But fortunately we had a good saying that we ve held firm to this day as the Dean was reminding me before the talk, which is, What happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep.  That s been a good thing for all of us, I think.In the past, Acosta has been caught being wildly dishonest in his attacks on Trump. Acosta regularly lies in matters both small and large. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

She supported that statement by citing an email sent by Kavanaugh in March 2002 to formerAssociate White House Counsel Helgard C. Walker. In the email, Kavanaugh wrote,  And I have heard very few people say that limits on contributions to candidates are unconstitutional although I for one tend to think those limits have some constitutional problems.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/19/ann-coulter-haven-monahan-to-testify-at-kavanaugh-hearings/","If this is what the left pulls against a sweet nerd like Brett Kavanaugh, I can t wait for the hearings to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg!Observers of the passing scene were not surprised that the same lunatics screaming that Kavanaugh is going to impose  The Handmaid s Tale  on America also announced that he had committed attempted rape and murder in high school.His accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, remembered this in a therapy session 30-plus years after the alleged incident   coincidentally, at the exact moment Kavanaugh was all over the news as Mitt Romney s likely Supreme Court nominee.She doesn t remember the time or place of the assault, told no one for 30 years and has no evidence or corroboration. Maybe the party was at Haven Monahan s house. (He was the instigator of the fraternity gang rape reported in Rolling Stone, which never happened and   luckily for Monahan!   who doesn t exist. Otherwise, he was in BIG trouble.)But the psychology professor at Palo Alto University   who recently signed a letter denouncing President Trump s border policies (thank you, Attorney General Sessions!)   says a teenaged Kavanaugh threw her on a bed at a party and began groping her, trying to take off her clothes.Here s the kicker:  I thought he might inadvertently kill me. We went pretty quickly from drunken teenaged groping to manslaughter.This is always my favorite part of any feminist claim: The leap from  he used a bad word  to  HE ADMITTED COMMITTING SEXUAL ASSAULT!  (That s what the media lyingly said about Trump s remarks on the  Access Hollywood  tape, as detailed in Chapter Two of my new book, Resistance Is Futile!: How the Trump-Hating Left Lost Its Collective Mind.)Kavanaugh emphatically denies that anything of the sort ever occurred at any party, but feminists are already off on, Maybe he s one of these sick people who rapes corpses!It s also great how the media act as if attempted rape was perfectly acceptable in America, until we were educated by the #MeToo movement. No, the breakthrough of the #MeToo movement was that it was finally acceptable to call out liberal sexual predators.Until recently, it was OK to rape and even murder girls   but only if your name was  Clinton,   Kennedy  or  Weinstein,  et al. Then Hillary lost, and Teddy was dead, so there was no point in ferociously protecting the Democrats  rapists any longer.Thus, for example, The New York Times defended Blasey Ford s failure to tell anyone about the alleged groping/manslaughter for 30 years, claiming things were different in the 1980s.  More likely,  the editorial explained,  a girl in the early 1980s would have blamed herself than report it. As proof, the Times linked to a Washington Post article citing the Times  own treatment of a Kennedy victim. After Patricia Bowman accused William Kennedy Smith of rape, the Times  reported on her speeding tickets, partying in adulthood and even dredged up an unnamed woman who claimed Bowman showed a little wild streak  in high school. So the Times  defense of the decades-old, therapy-induced recovered memory by Kavanaugh s accuser is, Look at the way we abused a Kennedy accuser! We were horrible to her! OK, New York Times, you win.Most hilarious is the media s insistence that Kavanaugh s accuser is putting herself at enormous risk by coming forward.Oh, cut the crap, media. In terms of press coverage, no one alive would prefer to be Kavanaugh than his accuser. Everywhere you look, someone is praising the  survivor  for her stunning, unprecedented courage as she viciously tries to derail Kavanaugh s nomination.True, accuse a Clinton, a Kennedy or a Weinstein (et al), and you ll be treated like dirt. You ll get the Patricia Bowman treatment. Paula Jones was smeared and laughed at for three years, until Stuart Taylor s 15,000-word article defending her in the American Lawyer. (That took courage.)But accuse the elitist white male Duke lacrosse team, Haven Monahan or a Republican nominee to the Supreme Court, and you can upgrade to a much better university and spend the rest of your life being showered with awards, fellowships, honorary degrees, media appearances and so on. Look up  Anita Hill. And, boy, was Hill right about Clarence Thomas! (Honorary white male.) He got confirmed, and now he issues conservative rulings. We warned you.Following days of the entire media demanding that the victim (by which they mean the accuser) be allowed to tell her story, it turns out she d really rather not. Blasey Ford spent an eternity deciding whether to accept the Senate s invitation to testify, finally announcing on Tuesday night that she would appear only after a thorough and complete FBI investigation.Tell me what an  investigation  of this matter involves. Do agents go door to door in Montgomery County, Maryland asking everyone who went to high school in the early 1980s if they remember going to some kind of party?Second: IT S NEVER THE VICTIM WHO NEEDS AN INVESTIGATION! She knows what her story is. It s the accused who wants an investigation to know exactly what he s accused of.Blasey Ford already knows what she thinks happened. I ve been waiting my whole life to unburden myself about that night in 1981, 1982 or 1983 in a dark bedroom. Well, I m not sure if it was a bedroom, but it definitely had a door. And a ceiling and a floor-ish kind of thing. And walls   I know I was surrounded by walls. I remember thinking,  OH MY GOSH, I M IN A CLOSED SPACE!  On one hand, walls keep me warm, but that s also why I ve never enjoyed sex.The only reason for the professor to insist upon an  investigation  is to delay having to give her story under oath until she knows what can be proved   and what can be disproved.Of course, the main purpose of an  investigation  is to give the media time to browbeat Republicans into withdrawing Kavanaugh s name and doing the honorable thing by nominating someone more suitable.

Susan Collins (R-ME) publicly asked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford Wednesday afternoon to  reconsider  testifying before the Senate with her story of an alleged high school sexual assault from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. I hope that Dr. Ford will reconsider and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday,  Collins wrote on her Twitter account.  It is my understanding that the Committee has offered to hold either a public or a private session, whichever would make her more comfortable. I hope that Dr. Ford will reconsider and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. It is my understanding that the Committee has offered to hold either a public or a private session, whichever would make her more comfortable.  Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) September 19, 2018Ford s attorney Debra Katz said Tuesday night that her client will not testify before the Judiciary Committee until the FBI completes an investigation into her allegation that Kavanaugh pinned her down on a bed during a drunken party when the now-judge was 17 years old. However, the Bureau has said on multiple occasions to multiple news outlets that it has no jurisdiction and no plans to investigate Ford s charge.Breitbart News  senior legal editor Ken Klukowski reports that the FBI cannot take any action on Ford s claims unless President Trump expressly orders them to do so: It is important to remember that an FBI background investigation is entirely different from an FBI criminal investigation,  a former federal prosecutor told Breitbart News.  The letter referred by Feinstein has already been added to Kavanaugh s file, so the normal background element is complete.  What Ford is now asking for with a full investigation would be a criminal investigation,  the prosecutor continued.  The FBI does not do that when there is no federal crime being alleged. Another source explains that the purpose of an FBI background investigation is to allow people to provide information in a strictly confidential manner, including secret accusations. Because Ford is making her accusations publicly, there is no role whatsoever for the FBI to play in collecting anonymous or confidential information.The only way the FBI would get involved is if President Trump took the extraordinary action of ordering the FBI to do so. But that creates a no-win situation because then the president s opponents who are currently attacking Kavanaugh could accuse the White House of political interference with a law enforcement investigation, directing an agency to act outside its jurisdiction. Some could even call a presidential order for the FBI to investigate a state-law matter to be an abuse of power.In spite of these facts, Democratic pundits and lawmakers continue to demand an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh s high school conduct.Collins, long known for being a more liberal Republican, has faced pressure from far-left activists to vote against Kavanaugh s confirmation to the Supreme Court. However, this latest statement echoes calls from Never-Trump senators Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Bob Corker (R-TN) urging Ford to take advantage of the opportunities to testify provided by committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA). I now implore Dr. Ford to accept the invitation for Monday, in a public or private setting,  Flake tweeted Wednesday.  The committee should hear her voice. When Dr. Ford came forward, I said that her voice should be heard and asked the Judiciary Committee to delay its vote on Judge Kavanaugh. It did so. I now implore Dr. Ford to accept the invitation for Monday, in a public or private setting. The committee should hear her voice.  Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) September 19, 2018Corker went farther, framing the delayed Monday hearing as a final deadline.  If we don t hear from both sides on Monday, let s vote,  he wrote.After learning of the allegation, Chairman @ChuckGrassley took immediate action to ensure both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh have the opportunity to be heard, in public or private. Republicans extended a hand in good faith. If we don t hear from both sides on Monday, let s vote.  Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) September 19, 2018

We re delaying the vote strictly to get all the facts out on the table. What would be the purpose of the hearing if Dr. Ford doesn t want to respond? In the letter to Ford s lawyers, Grassley rebuked the call for an FBI investigation into her allegation against Kavanaugh, stating that the FBI has already conducted a background check into any executive or judicial nominee. Instead, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman contended that only the Senate could determine the worthiness of a Supreme Court nominee.Grassley explained:The Constitution assigns the Senate, and only the Senate, with the task of advising the President on his nominee and consenting to the nomination if the circumstances merit. We have no power to commandeer an Executive Branch agency into conducting our due diligenence. The job of assessing and investigating a nominee s qualifications in order to decide whether to consent to the nomination is ours, and ours alone.Sen. Grassley also said that  anyone who comes forward with allegations of sexual assault has a right to be heard,  and he wants to give Ford an opportunity to tell her story to the Senate and  if she chooses, to the American people.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said it was  shameful  Republicans were trying to  bully  Brett Kavanaugh s accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford into testifying in a  he said-she said  hearing instead of allowing an investigation which could include more witnesses.Gillibrand said,  What the Republicans are doing is outrageous. They are creating a false choice. They are trying to bully her into testifying Monday, before a full FBI check is completed. First nomination for the Supreme Court and any judicial nomination there is always an FBI investigation. They do it as part of the background check. This allegation is new so they need a thorough, nonpartisan review of the facts so there can be a proper hearing. Unfortunately, they are trying to set up a he said/she said scenario, and bullying her into testifying Monday or not being heard at all. She continued,  We are asking for a basic review of the facts. If you are listening to Anita Hill herself, she said that you need to push the pause button to do this nonpartisan investigation before the senators have the information that they need to ask appropriate questions. Make no mistake about this, this is a false choice and they are trying to bully her into testifying against her versus Kavanaugh as opposed to calling all of the witnesses who have important understanding and knowledge of the events. Even to have Mark Judge, who was in the room, to not be forced to be investigated by the FBI to answer questions under oath and testify under oath is a dereliction of their duty. She added,  I have heard my Republican colleagues say that we have to vote now. That is outrageous, and we intend to be here through all of October, and we have time to do this thoughtfully, and to do it precisely and to be fair to this witness, and what they are doing today is nothing short than shameful.

The video ad was produced by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. and released Wednesday, according to Hollywood Reporter. Who becomes the next Supreme Court Justice is the decision of a lifetime   your lifetime,  the Grammy-winner Legend says in the ad.  Brett Kavanaugh s troubling views on the issues that matter most and his rushed confirmation process make him unfit for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.

These allegations underscore the costs of the Senate Judiciary Committee s failure to thoroughly and impartially vet Kavanaugh s entire record and background,  the NAACP exclaimed in a press release.  Kavanaugh s confirmation vote should be postponed until these allegations can be thoroughly investigated. His record on civil rights alone is enough to demand that, if Kavanaugh s nomination is ever brought to a vote, Senators must vote no. Despite the claim that the judge has not been properly vetted, Brett Kavanaugh has undergone six FBI vetting procedures and was confirmed unanimously to the second highest court in the land once already.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/19/christine-blasey-ford-might-refuse-brett-kavanaugh-testimony-without-fbi-investigation/","WASHINGTON, DC  Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford and her attorney, Debra Katz, demand that the FBI investigate before Ford will speak to senators, which the FBI will not do because it has no jurisdiction, setting the stage for Ford to back out. Republicans are becoming skeptical, with one commenting,  It is almost as if the accuser does not want to state her accusations under oath. Republicans treated the allegations against President Trump s Supreme Court nominee seriously, suspending their planned Senate Judiciary Committee vote on his nomination to investigate the matter fully, including setting a time on Monday for both the judge and the woman who accused him of misconduct in 1982  when he was a teenager  to provide sworn testimony to senators.Ford s attorney Katz suggested that senators had planned to put Kavanaugh and Ford side-by-side at the same table to testify and rejected that idea as traumatizing to Ford, forcing her to relive the alleged incident. Contrary to suggestions by Dr. Ford s attorneys, the committee had no plans to place Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh on a panel together, and never indicated plans to do so,  the Senate Judiciary Committee responded in a statement.  Grassley s staff offered Dr. Ford multiple dates as well as a choice of providing information in a public or private setting. Now Katz says that Ford has a new condition before testifying: The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) must investigate this matter first; then Ford would testify afterward.That is a non-starter, the FBI responded. It is a federal law enforcement agency and, therefore, has jurisdiction to investigate only federal crimes. The conduct Ford describes  personal sexual misconduct, whether groping or the more serious crime of attempted rape  are crimes under state law, not federal law, and, thus, are properly referred to county prosecutors and local police departments, not to the FBI. It is important to remember that an FBI background investigation is entirely different from an FBI criminal investigation,  a former federal prosecutor told Breitbart News.  The letter referred by Feinstein has already been added to Kavanaugh s file, so the normal background element is complete.  What Ford is now asking for with a full investigation would be a criminal investigation,  the prosecutor continued.  The FBI does not do that when there is no federal crime being alleged. Another source explains that the purpose of an FBI background investigation is to allow people to provide information in a strictly confidential manner, including secret accusations.

But that creates a no-win situation because then the president s opponents who are currently attacking Kavanaugh could accuse the White House of political interference with a law enforcement investigation, directing an agency to act outside its jurisdiction. Some could even call a presidential order for the FBI to investigate a state-law matter to be an abuse of power.Several federal agencies are  buzz words  in American society, whose very name carries a  Jack Bauer  connotation of serious federal action. Those agencies include the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the U.S. Secret Service, and the FBI.Saying the FBI is investigating a matter lends immediate gravitas to the situation and, with it, adds political weight to the accusation. Some people are beginning to wonder if Katz or Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) wants the political headline of saying the FBI is investigating Kavanaugh, fully aware that there is nothing for the FBI to investigate within its law enforcement mission.It would also be very difficult to investigate this allegation in any event, as U.S. attorney Joe diGenova said on Fox News on Tuesday, as Ford is now saying she cannot be sure when the event happened, where it happened, or who else was present. The only other individual she named as being present  journalist Mark Judge  has publicly stated he never saw such a thing, emphatically denying the allegation. Republicans are bending over backwards to defer to the politically powerful #MeToo movement,  Fox News s Britt Hume  one of the most seasoned political veterans in journalism  said on-air Tuesday night.But despite Republicans doing so, some observers believe Ford and Katz are now moving the goalposts in a direction that would delay Kavanaugh s joining the Supreme Court while rejecting the opportunity offered by senators to provide testimony that could get to the bottom of the situation.Senate Republicans are beginning to ask new questions regarding the allegations now that their repeated attempts to get Ford to give sworn testimony are being rejected unless the FBI first takes actions that are outside the agency s lawful mandate. I ve said from the beginning that these are very serious allegations, and she deserves to be heard,  said Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), a moderate Republican who is a crucial swing vote for Kavanaugh s confirmation.  I really hope she doesn t pass up that opportunity :Sen.

On two occasions, through the Department of Justice, and independent of Trump, the FBI accurately pointed out that their agency does not investigate local sexual misconduct allegations, especially ones that happened 36 years ago when both parties were still teenagers in high school.The worst part of Cillizza s lie, though, is that if you look at Trump s precise words, he actually said he would support the FBI had they decided to get involved   which is the exact opposite of  telling the FBI to ignore  the matter. I don t think the FBI really should be involved because they don t want to be involved,  Trump said, adding,  if they wanted to be I would certainly do that, but as you know they say this is not really their thing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=456&v=CYqtaFaTZhQCillizza is deliberately lying; deliberately deceiving the public with fake news.Kavanaugh s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford,says she cannot remember where or when the alleged misconduct took place. What s more, she named two other people who were supposedly at this house party, and both of them (Mark Judge and Patrick Smyth   who believes he is the second person) have released statements saying it never happened.As of now, Ford is refusing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath in either a private or public session. Ford is now demanding a full FBI investigation first.Ford had said she wanted to tell her story, but she is now aligning herself with Democrats who appear to be using the demand for an FBI investigation that is not going to happen as a means to stall the vote on Kavanaugh s nomination until after the midterms. If Democrats take back the Senate next year, they will kill Kavanaugh s nomination and anyone else Trump were to nominate in his place.You can read the details of Cillizza s previous lies here and here. Cillizza also published a gif that put President Trump in crosshairs.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/18/third-person-that-kavanaugh-accuser-claims-was-at-party-denies-incident/","A third high school student Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford claimed attended a party more than 35 years ago where the future Judge Kavanaugh attacked her denied any memory of the alleged incident in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, CNN reported Tuesday.CNN obtained a letter from Patrick J. Smyth, a Georgetown Prep alum who graduated in Kavanaugh s class, to Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). The letter was penned after Ford apparently identified Smyth as  PJ   another teenager who was one of around five people at a drunken gathering in a Montgomery County, Maryland, home in or around 1982. I understand that I have been identified by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as the person she remembers as PJ  who supposedly was present at the party she described in her statements to the Washington Post,  the letter, penned by Smyth s attorney, Eric Bruce, reads.  I am issuing this statement today to make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh. Smyth remains Kavanaugh s friend and had already written to the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of his nomination to the Supreme Court, calling him  singularly qualified to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court  in a letter co-authored by Georgetown Prep classmates of Kavanaugh. Personally speaking, I have known Brett Kavanaugh since high school and I know him to be a person of great integrity, a great friend, and I have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women,  Smyth s new letter continues. To safeguard my own privacy and anonymity, I respectfully request that the Committee accept this statement in response to any inquiry the Committee may have,  the letter explains, although, with the letter s leaking to CNN, that anonymity is apparently at an end.The denial is the third of the among five people Ford has claimed were present when Kavanaugh and classmate Mark Judge, both allegedly drunk, forced her into a room where Kavanaugh forced himself on top of Ford and groped her until she managed to escape without incident. Kavanaugh and Judge have both categorically denied any recollection of the incident or the high school party itself.The exact number of attendees  like the date, location, and circumstances of the supposed party  has never been definitively fixed in any of Ford s accounts. Some accounts include the attendance of a still not publicly identified female.Ford, by her own account, told no one of the incident for three decades, revealing it only at a marriage counseling session in 2012. In July, she sent Feinstein a letter realleging the attack, but the ranking Democrat made no mention of it throughout Kavanaugh s confirmation hearings, going public only after news reports of the letter began to emerge over the weekend.Republicans set a Monday date for a hearing under oath on the matter, which Kavanaugh has agreed to attend. Ford, despite her attorney, Debra Katz s, repeated assertions she is willing to testify, has not yet accepted her invitation to do so. After reports of her failure to accept the invitation emerged Tuesday, Katz returned to the airwaves to claim Ford will not appear until the FBI investigates her claims.The FBI has repeatedly denied it is conducting an investigation, noting there is no potential federal crime contained in Ford s allegations. A Monday Department of Justice statement made clear this is not a type of investigation the FBI performs as part of its background investigations.  The FBI does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation. The purpose of a background investigation is to determine whether the nominee could pose a risk to the national security of the United States,  the statement explained. On the night of September 12, the FBI received a letter dated from July 2018 alleging that the nominee engaged in an incident of misconduct in the 1980s,  the statement continues.  Consistent with the memorandum of understanding, the FBI forwarded this letter to the White House Counsel s Office. The allegation does not involve any potential federal crime. The FBI s role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers. While Chairman Grassley has made clear Monday s hearing may be cancelled if Ford refuses to testify, Democrats echoed Katz s demands for the FBI to get involved. One member of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Mazie Hirono, did so while further instructing  the men in this country  to  just shut up and step up.

Because they only want a he said/she said scenario. In fact, they should be allowing the FBI to do a complete background check now that they have this allegation, which has not been done, which is the normal course for any Supreme Court nominee. She later said of Kavanaugh,  I don t think he s qualified because of his record on women s issues, specifically. He doesn t believe that women should have the ability to make decisions about their reproductive freedom. He believes that your boss should decide whether or not you have access to birth control. And if he has this history, then he is unfit for the court, and he doesn t have the character or integrity. Gillibrand concluded by stating of Ford,  I believe her. Her story is credible. If you listen to everything about it, the fact that she told her therapist about it five years ago, a friend most recently, she told a reporter before Kavanaugh was even named to be a nominee. This is a woman who has endured trauma, and   as experts have said, this is what trauma looks like. These   it gets relived much later in time.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/18/kavanaugh-accusers-lawyer-defended-clinton-franken/","Debra Katz, the attorney hired by Christine Blasey Ford to represent her and her claim that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh attacked her at a high school party three decades ago, is a longtime Democratic activist and donor. Katz has, in the past, defended men accused of sexual assault by multiple women, including former President Bill Clinton and disgraced former U.S. Senator Al Franken (D-MN).And she is a part of the  resist  movement, the anti-President Donald Trump crowd. In an October 2017 interview posted on the National Women Law Center s website, Katz was asked about sexual misconduct cases. Today, in your practice, have you noticed an increase in these kinds of cases or complaints? Why do you think that is?  Emily Martin, vice president for Education and Workplace Justice, asked Katz in 2017. Unfortunately, these kinds of cases do not go away. In times of economic uncertainty when people feel vulnerable on many levels, it is easy for them to blame other outside  groups, including women, African-Americans, and national origin minorities, for their lost opportunities,  Katz said.  Part of President Trump s appeal is apparently that he reinforces those fears and resentments.   We are seeing a large uptick in sexual, racial, and religious harassment cases since the election,  Katz said.  Unfortunately, President Trump s misogynistic, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim conduct and comments have radically lowered the bar and have normalized abusive and assaultive conduct in the workplace. However, when asked about men who have been accused of sexual assault by numerous women   Clinton who was impeached and Franken who resigned   Katz has defended them.In Clinton s case, Katz took his word over that of Paula Jones, who claimed that the president exposed himself and pressured her to commit a sexual act, according to a report in Townhall:Katz dismissed Jones  assertions on March 30th, 1998 on CNN s  Talkback Live  saying that,  Paula Jones  suit is very, very, very weak. She s alleged one incident that took place in a hotel room that, by her own testimony, lasted 10 to 12 minutes. She suffered no repercussions in the workplace. Likewise, Katz again said on CBS  Evening News on April 2nd, 1998 that Jones  allegation could not hold up in court because,  Clearly a one-time incident that took place in 10 to 12 minutes, she was not forced to have sex, she left on her own volition, the courts increasingly are finding that that is not enough to create a sexually hostile work environment claim. In 1998, Katz told the media that,  If a woman came to me with a similar fact pattern, that is someone in the company above her propositioned her but only once and she suffered no tangible job detriment. I would probably tell her that I m sorry, it s unfair, but you don t have a case.  Katz said that courts have generally held that a one-time proposition does not constitute harassment. If it s one time, it has to be severe, almost a sexual assault, not just a touching of somebody s breast or buttocks or even forceful kissing. Katz also defended Franken when several women accused him of sexual misconduct. Context is relevant,  Katz said of the scandal.  He did not do this as a member of the U.S. Senate. He did this in his capacity of someone who was still functioning as an entertainer. Katz has also been a longtime financial supporter of Democrats, according to Open Secrets. She donated more than $8,000 to both former President Barack Obama s presidential campaigns.At an event to raise money for Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign in 2015, Katz is credited with raising $29,000.She also has ties to George Soros, according to the Washington Times, through her involvement with the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), an organization that has been directly funded by Soros s Open Society Foundation.POGO co-signed a letter to Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) with a variety of leftist groups demanding Kavanaugh records, according to FrontPageMag.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

During the confirmation hearings, Harris continued to try to grab the spotlight with her antics, which the Los Angeles Times even conceded  failed miserably. Harris, who often sounds like a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, was also condemned when she shared an edited video clip of Kavanaugh during the confirmation hearings to make it seem like Kavanaugh told Senators that he viewed contraceptives as  abortion-inducing drugs.

One of Ford s lawyers, Lisa Banks, told CNN s Anderson Cooper on Tuesday evening that her client is  not prepared  to testify on Monday before an FBI investigation and  can t focus  on the hearings after receiving  harassment  and  death threats. Democrats and their media allies immediately hammered Republicans this week for not having a female Senator on the Judiciary Committee, and, according to a Tuesday evening Politico report, Republicans are considering using an  independent outside lawyer  to question Ford  to head off the potentially bad optics of older white men questioning a woman about alleged sexual assault. HuffPo also reported on Tuesday that  three Democratic sources familiar with the committee s planning  said Republican Senators are also considering having top female staffers question Ford, who has not confirmed as of Tuesday evening whether she will even attend Monday s hearing. We ve discussed various options, including hiring outside lawyers and supplementing that with senators asking questions,  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Judiciary Committee, told the outlet.  So, any senator who wants to ask questions remains free to do so. But I don t want want to get in front of the chairman. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the Judiciary Committee s ranking member, accused Republicans of trying to  rush  the nomination and called for more witnesses to be called on Monday even as she waffled on whether  everything is truthful  about Ford s accusations. Chairman Grassley today said there would be only two witnesses invited to testify at the Kavanaugh hearing next week on sexual assault allegations. Compare that to the 22 witnesses at the 1991 Anita Hill hearing and it s impossible to take this process seriously,  she said in a Tuesday statement.  What about other witnesses like Kavanaugh s friend Mark Judge? What about individuals who were previously told about this incident? What about experts who can speak to the effects of this kind of trauma on a victim? This is another attempt by Republicans to rush this nomination and not fully vet Judge Kavanaugh. Political operatives from both parties told the Washington Post that female voters could turn out for Democrats like they did in 1992 after the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings  if Republicans mishandle the investigation of Ford s allegations.

Asking her to come forward in four or five days and sit before the Judiciary Committee on national tv is not a fair process,  Banks continued.  Any talk of a hearing on Monday is premature because she just came forward with these allegations 48 hours ago. When Cooper pressed Banks on multiple occasions about whether Ford would appear on Monday if the FBI concluded an investigation by then, Banks claimed that  no legitimate investigation is going to happen between now and Monday  and  nothing of substance and nothing legitimate can happen by Monday.  Banks also deflected after Cooper asked whether Democrats are just trying to stall and obstruct.Banks, repeating that Ford was  deflecting death threats and harassment,  said  rushing forward into a hearing when she is under this much pressure  is not the right thing to do. There is no reason we should have a public hearing on Monday given what has occurred and when it has occurred,  Banks continued.  This is being rushed through. And it s too important to be rushed through. This is not a game. This is a serious situation.

Deutsch said,  The trend that you re talking about to me is going to dominate everything. The entire #MeToo movement started post the election with Donald Trump. He continued,  I think they had buyers remorse. I think some women said kinda well  on the  Access Hollywood  tape.

Six years ago, she didn t sit in a therapy session and make something up and have the doctors take notes in the thinking that Brett Kavanaugh would be a Supreme Court nominee. Everything in your gut tells you this woman has no incentive to make it up, where Judge Kavanaugh would have every incentive to deny it. Having said that the people who are on the line will not be Professor Ford and it will not be Judge Kavanaugh, it will be the Republican men. Those Republican men going after this woman in any way, shape or form, is going to be a suicide mission. No matter how they dance it because every woman sitting across America who has ever in any way been victimized is going to look at that and rise up. I think that wave is going to turn into a tsunami.

Frankly, I think they are lousy on policy and in many ways lousy politicians, but they are very good on obstruction, and it is a shame because this is a great gentleman. But Trump appeared willing to go through a process to hear out the accuser s allegations against Kavanaugh. There shouldn t even be a doubt,  he said but cautioned that he did not want the process to  play into the hands  of Democrats  attempted obstruction.Earlier Tuesday, Trump pointed out the FBI said they would not investigate the allegation.

Just stay alert because a lot of things can change between now and next Monday. He added,  This has changed things dramatically. The center of gravity has changed, and to mix metaphors here, his nomination is hanging by a rope, and that rope can start to fray very, very quickly because you have to know that somewhere in the balance of the White House, someone is saying, you know what?

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Democrats on the Judiciary Committee called on the FBI to investigate high school-era allegations against Kavanaugh. In view of the enormity and seriousness of these allegations, a staff-only phone call behind closed doors is unacceptable and Democratic staff will not participate,  Feinstein said in a statement on Monday.She added that the FBI  has the resources and know-how to conduct an objective, independent evaluation of these sensitive allegations with appropriately trained investigators. Senate Minority Leader Schumer (D-NY) is also calling for an FBI investigation.On Tuesday, Feinstein again called on the FBI to investigate the allegation of a local crime 36 years ago when Kavanaugh was 17 and still in high school:Republicans have learned nothing from Anita Hill. President Bush asked the FBI to do its job and investigate Hill s allegations, which it did.  Now, under the Trump administration, Republicans want to do even less by blocking any investigation into Dr. Blasey Ford s allegations.  Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) September 18, 2018The DOJ, however, told a reporter for the far-left Politico,  The allegation does not involve any potential federal crime. Furthermore, the Associated Press reports that in a statement, the DOJ said late Monday that  it s not the job of the FBI to judge the significance or the credibility of an accusation. Nevertheless, Democrats continue to call for the FBI to investigate in the hopes it will put an indefinite hold on the vote for Kavanaugh s nomination, which has already been postponed.The Senate Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote on Kavanaugh this Thursday. That has now been pushed to next week at the soonest so the committee can reconvene on Monday when both Kavanaugh and his accuser are expected to testify in public and under oath.Kavanaugh has unequivocally denied the charge that as a 17-year-old high school student he drunkenly tackled and groped 15-year-old Christine Blasey Ford.Kavanaugh said he never attended the party in question and has a witness to back up his claim.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Before Ford s allegations, the actress had tweeted out multiple stories criticizing Kavanaugh s nomination and other left-wing causes including NFL star Colin Kaepernick s recent Nike campaign.I was class of 79 & signed this letter. https://t.co/5ssttu9uzT  Julia Louis-Dreyfus (@OfficialJLD) September 17, 2018The letter comes after psychology professor Dr. Christine Blasey Ford told The Washington Post in an interview on Sunday that Judge Kavanaugh had forced her onto a bed during a party in the 1980 s, before  [groping] her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the allegation, saying he had no idea who was making the claims until Ford revealed her identity. He and his accuser are set to testify in front of a Senate committee on Monday.
 I am willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the Committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity,  Kavanaugh said in a statement this week.Last year, Louis-Dreyfus announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer, using the opportunity to push a policy of universal healthcare. The good news is that I have the most glorious group of supportive and caring family and friends, and fantastic insurance through my union,  she wrote at the time.

Carlson said once it becomes impossible for Republicans to get a justice on the high court, there will be less incentive for Republican voters to vote Republican. The larger lesson of this moment and actually the past two years is that the left will not abide losing power, even temporarily,  Carlson said.  For liberals, political power is personal power, and without it, they are exposed and terrified. Some become vicious. If you have lost friends, since Trump got elected or have been yelled at over dinner or on an airplane, you know exactly what we are talking about. Liberals believe they were meant to run this country, our government and our culture. They have no intention of sharing control with you. If they are not in charge, they will burn it down, which is what they are doing now.  The question is   the political question is will the Republican Party let them do this? If Republicans allow Kavanaugh s nomination to be derailed over an unprovable allegation he can t rebut, it s over. They will never put a justice on the Supreme Court again. It will be too easy to stop them. A single charge from 35 years ago will be enough. That s the precedent they would set.  And let us pause parenthetically and say, we may learn more in the coming weeks, who knows and the calculation may change. But as of today, there is no way to prove either way what happened 35 years ago in Bethesda, Maryland. It s an unsolvable mystery, again unless something else comes up. So to derail the nomination on the basis of it, would be a brand-new thing. Republican voters put up with a lot already including a party leadership that does not share their values, or even like them very much and doesn t hide it well. They vote Republican anyway in part because they would like to see judges who care about the Constitution sitting on the Supreme Court. Once that s gone, what s the point of voting Republican?

There s every reason to believe a woman who has come forward at great personal risk, facing the anguish and terror, as she put it, of a nightmare of vicious and hostile scrutiny, and there are a lot of reasons to disbelieve Judge Kavanaugh after his evasive and seemingly misleading responses to our questions at the Judiciary Committee hearing just a week or so ago.

Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were teenagers, was  to be believed. Boxer said,  This is eerily, eerily like what happened to Anita Hill. Even you have Chuck Grassley who was on the committee really being terrible to Anita Hill, and Orrin Hatch and others. And they re still there. The difference is Dianne Feinstein is the ranking member. Kamala Harris is on the committee. Mazie Hirono is on the committee, Amy Klobuchar. There is a big difference because we now have a more representative Senate. She added,  This woman is to be believed. She added,  You can believe Dr. Ford. This was attempted rape.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is exploiting a sexual misconduct allegation leveled against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to seek campaign contributions.In a fundraising email sent Monday, Warren called on recipients to make financial contributions to her Senate campaign, while showering praise on California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, who broke her silence in an interview with the Washington Post Sunday about 36-year-old misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh.  Christine Blasey Ford has done a brave thing in coming forward. She deserves to be heard and treated with respect. Now it s the Senate s job to make sure that happens,  the email reads.Ford alleges an inebriated Kavanaugh groped her during a Maryland house party in the 1980s. According to Ford, Mike Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh, pounced on the two, sending them both tumbling, prompting her to flee the room.Kavanaugh denied the allegation Monday, issuing the following statement:  This is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday.  Speaking before reporters Monday, President Donald Trump expressed confidence in the Senate Judiciary Committee s ability to vote Kavanaugh through and praised the nominee as  one of the finest people that I ve ever known.  He s an outstanding intellect, an outstanding judge, respected by everybody. Never had even a little blemish on his record,  President Trump said of the judge.  If it takes a little delay, it ll take a little delay. It shouldn t, certainly, be very much.  It will, I m sure, work out very well,  the president added.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and other Democrats had handled the matter inappropriately.President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh in July, and the Senate Judiciary Committee held more than 30 hours of hearings to vet the nominee, including two days questioning of him and hearing from several panels speaking for and against him. Now an accusation of 36-year-old misconduct dating back to high school has been brought forward at the last minute in an irregular manner,  McConnell said.Feinstein is now said to have had a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, now a 51-year-old professor, for weeks and did not bring it up during Kavanaugh s hearing or in her meeting with the nominee.In the letter, Ford accuses Kavanaugh of attacking her at a swim party when they were in high school. Now at the eleventh hour with committee votes on schedule after Democrats have spent weeks and weeks searching for any possible reason that this nomination should be delayed, now, now they choose to introduce this allegation,  McConnell said.Kavanaugh has categorically denied the accusation and said he does not know Ford, who at first was represented in a Washington Post article as an  anonymous  accuser but has since revealed her identity.

The accusation, known to Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) for more than six weeks but kept private until after the end of the scheduled hearings on Kavanaugh s nomination, has thrown an already chaotic confirmation process even further afield of the norm.Earlier Monday, sources close to the confirmation process were confident Thursday s scheduled final committee vote would still take place. But that vote is now unlikely to take place until at least next Tuesday.The reports emerged shortly after Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) told reporters she would need to see both Ford and Kavanaugh tesitfy under oath on the matter before she cast her vote.The news of a Monday hearing took even staffers close to Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley s (R-IA) office by surprise. Even after talk of a hearing flowed, Kavanaugh, who categorically denies Ford s accusation, had indicted he was willing to testify under oath as soon as Tuesday this week.Grassley himself confirmed the reports in a statement shortly therefore, setting 10:00 a.m. as the hearing start and indicating the hearing was decided on after Senate Democrats refused to participate in a Monday evening conference call with Kavanaugh on the matter.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman @ChuckGrassley today announced that the Committee will hold a public hearing with Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. pic.twitter.com/523miClAVL  Senate Judiciary (@senjudiciary) September 17, 2018

The Democrat-connected accuser specifically stated that there was no nudity involved in the alleged incident and that both parties were fully clothed.According to the claims made by accuser Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh  groped her over her clothes.  So, unlike Carrey s drawing, there was no nudity in her accusations.Meanwhile, Judge Kavanaugh fully denies all of the allegations being thrown at him, saying that the claims are  completely false.  I have never done anything like what the accuser describes to her or to anyone,  Kavanaugh added.  Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. Inconsistencies have also appeared in Ford s accusations. For instance, she cannot recall exactly when this alleged  groping  occurred but thinks it was sometime in 1982. She is also not sure exactly where it happened. Further, Ford has revised just who was in the room when she claims the incident took place.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/17/senate-republicans-stick-with-thursday-kavanaugh-committee-vote/","The Senate Judiciary Committee will proceed to a planned vote on Supreme Court Nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh Thursday, sources tell Breitbart News Monday.Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) is, according to these sources, refusing to yield to pressure over allegations of a high school attack revealed by Democrats over the weekend. Since July, Ranking Member Diane Feinstein (D-CA) had possession of a letter from California professor Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, claiming that Kavanaugh and another teenager had forced her into a room at a 1982 party where Kavanaugh forced himself on her before she escaped.Feinstein declined to introduce the letter at any point before or during the four-day public hearings on Kavanaugh s nomination, but went public after media reports of the letter began to surface.The Republican leadership came under intense pressure not only from Senate Democrats, but from moderate Republicans like Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who indicated they would not vote for Kavanaugh without hearing Ford s accusations out. Democrats like Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) explicitly took this as support for his call to delay the vote.Two sources close to the confirmation process, however, told Breitbart News that Republicans will not yield to that pressure. One claimed the Thursday vote would occur  no matter what.  The other confirmed that Chairman Grassley remains  completely committed  to the originally scheduled Thursday vote.Both sources also indicated Judge Kavanaugh will speak on a conference call with the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday night, where he will directly address Ford s accusations. He has already twice categorically denied he attacked Ford and reports indicate he told Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) Monday that he was not at the party in question.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) also addressed the matter on the Senate floor Monday afternoon. I am glad that Chairman Grassley is following standard practice and regular order. As he s stated, he plans to pursue this matter by the book, with bipartisan interviews of both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford,  he said, criticizing Grassley s Democratic counterpart, Sen. Feinstein, over her handling of the matter:Neither she nor any of her Democratic colleagues chose to raise this allegation during the committee staff s bipartisan background calls with the nominee. They did not raise it, even with the name redacted, in the 65 meetings Judge Kavanaugh held with Senators before his confirmation hearings, including his private meeting with the Ranking Member. They did not raise it, even with the name redacted, in four days of exhaustive public hearings while Judge Kavanaugh testified under oath   even though they chose to raise myriad other matters at the hearing, including through sometimes bizarre innuendo.They did not raise it in the closed session, the proper forum where such an allegation could been addressed with discretion and sensitivity. They did not raise it in the thousand-plus follow-up questions that Senators sent to Judge Kavanaugh in writing. But now  at the 11th hour, with committee votes on the schedule, after Democrats have spent weeks and weeks searching for any possible reason that the nomination should be delayed.Minority Leader Schumer spoke shortly thereafter, reiterating his call for a delay on Thursday s vote and an open hearing before the Judiciary Committee.  When someone  believes she was terribly aggrieved   and I believe her    when the credibility of a Supreme Court Justice is on the line, we re gonna just brush it under the rug?  he asked, adding,  I want to applaud my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have called for hearings. I believe, one way or another, six have said this should be delayed. I hope they ll be strong. I hope they tell Leader McConnell he s doing the wrong thing. While some Senate Republicans, like Flake, Graham, and Bob Corker (R-TN) have said Ford must have an opportunity to be heard, and key moderate vote Sen. Susan Collins said Monday she wants both Ford and Kavanaugh to testify under oath, none have explicitly ruled out a Thursday vote.Asked about the situation Monday, President Donald Trump stuck by his pick, calling the idea of him withdrawing  ridiculous.

When asked about the allegations having taken place over 30 years ago, she continued,  That does make it very difficult, and that s why it s important that there be a very thorough interview and that we see both individuals respond to the allegations. There are an awful lot of questions, inconsistencies, gaps and that s why, to be fair to both, we need to know what happened. It s my understanding that the staff is doing interviews or has proposed to do interviews and that would be the prelude to some sort of hearing. She continued,  I don t know enough about Dr. Ford and her allegations to give kind of judgment. That s why having the opportunity to observe her being questioned, read a transcript or and a deposition and make that kind of assessment is so important.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/17/senate-judiciary-committee-suspicious-timing-of-feinstein-attack-on-kavanaugh/","Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans are questioning why Dianne Feinstein waited two months to act on Christine Blasey Ford s allegations of Judge Brett Kavanaugh groping her in 1982 when Kavanaugh was a high-school teenager.It would be more politically impactful to confront him on national television during his confirmation hearings   unless she thought the accusations would not survive serious scrutiny.Feinstein is a smart, tough, experienced senator, but she did not take the shot. Why?Serious accusations should not be ignored, as the White House has said. Everyone should agree that every human being deserves to be heard respectfully when they say that something bad has happened to them, and people who have honestly suffered must be comforted and cared for. However, the sad reality is that sometimes the accusations are not true, and false accusations can destroy a good person s reputation and career.Imagine this scenario: It is Wednesday, September 5, the second day of the nationally televised Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. Every news organization in the country is tuned in as senators begin grilling President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee with questions, which he must answer under oath, on camera.Chairman Chuck Grassley goes first. Second is Feinstein as the ranking member of the minority. No one has changed the channel yet; it is still the opening part of the hearing. Judge, I have a letter in my hand from a woman accusing you of sexual misconduct,  Feinstein could have begun.  And I am going to take all 30 minutes of my time with you today asking you about this on national television. I remind you that you are under oath. Many of her colleagues would doubtless have asked some follow-up questions during their turns during the next 12 hours. His answers would have led to more questions, and the Senate Democrats with prosecutorial backgrounds, like Pat Leahy (D-VT), Richard Blumenthal (R-CT), and Kamala Harris (D-CA) could have gone into full attack mode.Whatever they forgot to ask during the first day of questions would have been asked during the second day.Kavanaugh would have been under oath. Every word he said would subject him to prosecution for perjury if he lied. It could have been a catastrophe for him   if Feinstein believed the allegations were true.Democrats would have been protected by legislative immunity. Under the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution, because this took place in a committee hearing, Feinstein   as well as the less temperate members of her caucus (e.g.,  Spartacus  or Harris)   could have said anything they wanted. They could have declared that he was guilty of committing a felony. They would be immune from lawsuits for defamation, including future subpoenas or depositions.Feinstein s ambush would have been breaking news. It would have been explosive. It would have captivated the nation. In fact, it would have made history.So Republicans are asking, why did Feinstein not do it?She did not need time to vet the story. This was not an accuser who saw the hearings in September and decided at the last minute to call the Senate. Instead, Feinstein learned all this in July. She has all the time in the world to vet the story, investigate the accuser, corroborate the charges, and to decide the best angle of attack.Instead, Feinstein waited until after the hearings   after the cameras were gone, and Kavanaugh was no longer under oath. She waited until the White House and Senate Republicans would have time to craft responses as a team to give coordinated responses.If she had thought these allegations amounted to a smoking gun, senior Repubicans are thinking there was no reason in the world not to seize control of the hearings while the national cameras were rolling and possibly destroy the nomination. It s disturbing that these uncorroborated allegations from more than 35 years ago, during high school, would surface on the eve of a committee vote after Democrats sat on them since July,  said Taylor Foy for the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA).  If Ranking Member Feinstein and other Committee Democrats took this claim seriously, they should have brought it to the full Committee s attention much earlier. The committee s spokesman continued:Instead, they said nothing during two joint phone calls with the nominee in August, four days of lengthy public hearings, a closed session for all committee members with the nominee where sensitive topics can be discussed and in more than 1,300 written questions. I agree with the concerns expressed in the Judiciary Committee s statement about the substance and process regarding the allegations in this latest claim against Judge Kavanaugh,  said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). He added that he wanted to see the committee vote on the nomination on Thursday in any event, and so anything further the committee might require  should be done immediately so the process can continue as scheduled. Consider next how Feinstein acted after she first heard of the accusations, according to the story that has been told publicly.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) gave a closed-door briefing to senators regarding their comprehensive investigation into Kavanaugh. Feinstein reportedly blew it off; she did not even attend, according to sources who spoke with Breitbart News.Feinstein s office has not responded to our requests for comment at the time the story was filed.Feinstein did not tell her colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee about the accusations. She could have set up a coordinated campaign with them. The word on Capitol Hill is that Democratic senators are not happy that she did not share her information with them.She did not raise it in private meetings. She did not raise it in a private session, where senators could have asked questions with no cameras to provide a more candid exchange. She also did not raise it in the questionnaire they sent Kavanaugh after the hearing, to which he provided over 100 pages in answers and 17,000 pages in attachments.They could have brought her in as a witness on Friday, September 7, to tell her account to the nation. But even if she was not willing to go before national television cameras, Feinstein could have made her case during all the other days of the televised hearings.One inside expert who spoke with Breitbart News said the only plausible explanation was that Feinstein did not think Ford s accusation would hold up under scrutiny. Otherwise, why not raise what would have been a smoking gun if it were true? Judge Kavanaugh is admired in his church, in his community, and in his profession,  said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network (JCN).  Throughout his distinguished career in public service, he has undergone half a dozen FBI background checks, and never a whisper of misconduct. Until the eve of his confirmation.  Sixty-five women who were his contemporaries during high school have all come out saying that Brett Kavanaugh was and is a man of character and integrity,  she continued.  Countless women who have known Brett Kavanaugh personally and professionally spanning three decades have all testified to his respect for women, his character, and his integrity.  Furthermore, Senator Feinstein apparently did not believe the allegations were serious, credible, or relevant enough to share with the FBI or any other member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, even in the confidential background portion of the committee process,  Severino added.  It doesn t add up. But what does add up is that Democrats are doubling down on a strategy of character assassination, seeking to destroy the life of a distinguished public servant for the sake of appeasing their base.

You know what, a rush to judgment, trying to rush this through on Thursday is an insult to the women of America and an insult to the majesty of the Supreme Court of the United States.

Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Donald Trump, was spotted at the White House on Monday.Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, speaking to the Washington Post about her account of the event she says happened when they were both in high school. I thought he might inadvertently kill me,  said Ford in the interview.  He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing. Kavanaugh repeated that the allegation was  completely false.  I have never done anything like what the accuser describes to her or to anyone,  he said.  Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. The White House said Monday that they were willing to listen to Ford s allegations after she identified herself over the weekend. This woman should not be ignored and should not be insulted; she should be heard,  Kellyanne Conway, White House counselor to the president, said in an interview with Fox News.

She also characterized having Ford and Kavanaugh to testify as  reasonable  and said that Ford  will be heard. Conway said,  Well, this woman should not be insulted and she should not be ignored. I think the Senate is headed to a reasonable approach, in that, it seems to me, in speaking to a few senators, including Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), that, allowing this woman to be heard in sworn testimony, allowing Judge Kavanaugh to be heard in sworn testimony about these specific allegations would be added to the very considerable mountain of evidence and considerations that folks will have when they weigh whether or not to vote for Judge Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court. So, let me make very clear, I ve spoken with the president. I ve spoken with Senator Graham and others, this woman will be heard. Conway added that the accusations must  be weighed against what we already know, which is that Judge Kavanaugh is a man of character and integrity, who has been through six FBI vettings, which I can tell you firsthand are significant and thorough. He also has been lauded by women from every different aspect of his life.

The policy to prosecute all illegal border crossers, enacted by the Trump administration, including illegal alien adults who cross the border with children, results in border-crossing parents having their children taken into federal custody. This is a loophole known as the Flores Settlement Agreement.Detaining child border crossers was a policy during the Obama administration when Breitbart Texas exclusively reported on the conditions in which unaccompanied minors were being packed into crowded cells and holding facilities. As Breitbart News reported, the federal government has separated adult border crossers from the children they have brought with them into the U.S. as far back as 2001, court records reveal.The ACLU letter, signed by Blasey, demanded the Trump administration stop the border enforcement policy, claiming the enforcement measure was an  intentional infliction of pain on children,  calling it  inhumane. Read the full letter here:____ ____As Breitbart News exclusively reported, Mark Judge, the man named by Blasey Ford as having allegedly watched as Kavanaugh allegedly sexually assaulted the woman in high school, has strongly denied the allegations. The allegation was first published by the Washington Post. Now that the anonymous person has been identified and has spoken to the press, I repeat my earlier statement that I have no recollection of any of the events described in today s Post article or attributed to her letter,  Judge told Breitbart News in a statement.Likewise, Kavanaugh denied the accusations made against him, saying in a statement,  I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation.

The accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, came forward on Sunday to the Washington Post, describing an event that she said happened at a party when Kavanaugh was 17 years old.Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the committee s ranking Democrat, had known of the accusation since July. In a statement, Feinstein said Sunday that  from the outset  she had believed the accusations were  extremely serious.  Yet she did not bring them up in his confirmation hearing earlier this month.Fellow Democrat Mazie Hirono (D-HI) did, however, ask Kavanaugh on Sep. 5 about whether he had ever faced allegations of sexual misconduct as  a legal adult,  noting that she asks that of every judicial nominee. He said he never had:Sen. Hirono: Since you became a legal adult, have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual requests for sexual favors, or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature?Judge Kavanaugh: No.Sen. Hirono: Have you ever faced discipline or entered into a settlement related to this kind of conduct?Judge Kavanaugh: No.Kavanaugh went on to say,  No woman should be subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace,  as Hirono questioned him about allegations against former Judge Alex Kozinski, the Ninth Circuit judge for whom he once clerked.Kavanaugh added that he had  no reason not to believe  the women who had come forward to accuse Kozinski of inappropriate behavior. He also agreed  completely  with Hirono that  women who are the victims of sexual harassment  needed better support.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

It s not about only his beliefs, it s about the fact that he s been an operative, a political operative. And so you look at that on a number of issues. For example, I brought up dog whistling. And you know dog whistling is a term for basically people who are speaking in code to touch certain people who recognize the language as being representative of how they think. She continued,  For example, he used the term in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that he wrote   now this is a lawyer who is a judge who talks about how he uses his words very carefully  twice in a published opinion he used the word racial spoil system. One of the witnesses during the hearing was the Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus Cedric Richmond. I asked him when he was a witness, what does that term mean?  And he said that s a dog whistle. That speaks to people who believe because this was the question I asked Kavanaugh when he was before us. That speaks to the belief that somebody is taking something from them that nobody else should have. So that s the term that has been used when people talk about affirmative action or when people talk about how we have looked at the disadvantage and the historical disadvantage the government has created for minorities and particularly black people. and he uses the word racial spoils systems. She added,  He used the word abortion on demand. There are specific cases that  one in particular, the Garza case, where there was a young woman, immigrant woman, 17 years old who went through every step that the law required her to go through to obtain an abortion. And yet he called it abortion on demand because those who would deprive women of their ability to make decisions about their own body are trying to suggest it s just like tv on demand. You just click a button and you get it, which is mislead, and it is wrong. So those are the concerns I have. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

So when we get back to Washington this week we ll take a look at it but it really raises a question in my mind about, if this was material to the confirmation process, why on Earth, over the past four to six weeks, hasn t it been discussed among the committee members?DICKERSON: That s right and we should make it quite clear this is something he s denied categorically. This is something that allegedly happened much more than 30 years ago. But now that it is in the mix, is your is your feeling that this is a ploy of some kind or that this is while it is so long ago sufficient sufficiently important to look at look seriously and put into your calculation and others as they make their vote.TILLIS: Well I ve I ve spent most of my time focused on Hurricane Florence, but the questions that we will ask and seek answers to next week are,  why sit on it for weeks?  We understand that the person who wrote the letter is not willing to come forward. So we have a confidential witness not willing to sit down at least in a closed setting that s problematic to me. And as you said Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegations and I put some weight on that.DICKERSON: Very quickly Senator you think he ll be confirmed by the Senate?TILLIS: Oh I do-DICKERSON: -Alright-TILLIS: -I think that we ll move forward to report about the committee and confirm him before October.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

John Kennedy (R-LA) said Democrats had turned the Supreme Court confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump s nominee Brett Kavanaugh into an  intergalactic freak show. Kennedy said,  I m fairly confident that our Founding Fathers did not intend the process to work this way. So far it s pretty much been an intergalactic freak show. Senator Grassley, our chairman, did the best he could at the hearing. Senators kept interrupting him. They ignored the rules. We had over 240 protesters who stood up screaming. The only thing missing I think was the genitalia-shaped headgear. He continued,  There were wild accusations about Kavanaugh that he s evil and hates women, he hates children, he hates little warm puppies. And now we have this recent allegation by Senator Feinstein. Here s what we know. She s produced a letter, it s a secret letter, and we are not entitled to see it or know who wrote it. It supposedly was put together with the help of Stanford law school. He added,  They ve had this stuff for three months. If they were serious about it, they should ve told us about it.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/15/leahy-kavanaughs-candor-and-character-in-question-views-on-constitution-downright-extreme/","During Friday s Democratic Weekly Address, Senate Judiciary Committee member Pat Leahy (D-VT) stated Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh s  candor  and therefore his character  is seriously in question. And his constitutional views are downright extreme. Transcript as Follows: The American people just witnessed an unprecedented week of Supreme Court hearings for President Trump s nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Now I have been in the Senate for 44 years, that s a time that includes 19 nominations to the Supreme Court   more than any other sitting Senator. And I do not use the word unprecedented lightly. Unfortunately, it was unprecedented for all the wrong reasons.This was the least transparent confirmation process I ve ever seen. Senate Republicans blocked the American people from seeing more than 93 percent, that s 93 percent, of Judge Kavanaugh s record during his five controversial years in the Bush White House. Of the small fraction we ve seen, Republicans, without justification, have kept us from sharing nearly 190,000 pages with the American people. And then on top of that, President Trump asserted executive privilege to hide an additional 102,000 pages from the Senate and the American people  that is unprecedented. And the White House hasn t even released a privilege log so we don t even know what they re withholding. Reasonable Americans watching this should wonder: What are they hiding?Judge Kavanaugh s conception of the Constitution itself is deeply troubling; his lack of candor during the hearing only exacerbated my concerns. The documents that Senate Republicans have been withholding from the American people could help cast significant light on what we already know about Judge Kavanaugh s troubling legal views. As a judge, for example, he has argued that all regulations on guns are effectively unconstitutional, unless they were in effect when the Constitution was drafted. Of course at that time, that was an age of muskets, not military-style assault weapons favored by mass shooters today. And as a White House staffer, Judge Kavanaugh coached controversial conservative nominees, coached them to provide vague, meaningless assurances to the Senate regarding Roe v. Wade. Well, last week, he followed his own blueprint; he dodged questions about whether the Constitution protects a woman s right to reproductive care. The same week that a federal court was hearing oral arguments in a case that would erode vital health care protections, Judge Kavanaugh dodged a question on whether he would promise to uphold pre-existing condition protections as constitutional by saying he couldn t give assurances on a specific hypothetical. And, you know, of unique interest to a President who is increasingly fixated on his own legal jeopardy and problems, Judge Kavanaugh has taken the unorthodox position that Presidents should not be burdened with either criminal or civil investigations while in office. Perhaps knowing that President Trump would be watching last week, Judge Kavanaugh artfully avoided providing any real answers than would walk back his unbridled views on executive immunity and power.I have never been more concerned about a Supreme Court nominee s basic willingness and unwillingness to be truthful under oath. Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly testified that during his time in the Bush White House, he never had reason to believe he was benefiting from information that had been stolen from Democrats. But he repeatedly received information clearly marked highly confidential  and even one e-mail with the subject: spying , this from a Republican aide behind one of the biggest thefts in Senate history. A scandal in which Republican aides on the Senate Judiciary Committee stole 4,670 files from six Democratic senators, including myself. Documents show that his testimony was almost certainly false.Now Judge Kavanaugh also testified that he was never personally involved in the highly controversial nomination of Judge William Pryor, who called Roe v. Wade a constitutional abomination.  Well, the documents show that too was false. And Judge Kavanaugh testified that he had heard nothing at all  related to the NSA s warrantless wiretapping program of Americans until the press exposed it, and he said he never worked on policies related to detainees. Again, documents strongly suggest that this testimony was clearly misleading. You know, candor speaks to a person s character. And nothing is more important than character than when that individual seeks to shape Americans  lives for a generation or more with the mere stroke of a pen.With so much at stake, Americans are right to be deeply concerned about this nomination. The confirmation process has been woefully inadequate. Republicans have abandoned basic standards of transparency well-established by our committee. They treated last week s hearings more like a coronation than a constitutionally-mandated vetting. Judge Kavanaugh s candor  and therefore his character  is seriously in question. And his constitutional views are downright extreme.Like we did last week, Senate Democrats will continue to make our voices heard during this confirmation. And we count on Americans to do the same. We need to speak up, before it is too late, to defend the integrity of our nation s highest court. Only nominees of unquestioned character and forthright candor should sit on the Supreme Court, and Judge Kavanaugh threw both into question during last week s hearing.We must protect women s constitutional rights, vulnerable individuals with pre-existing conditions, protect the rule of law from a president who acts like he s above it, and the hard-fought rights of millions of hard-working Americans. With so much on the line, remaining on the sidelines is simply not an option. Democracy, especially in moments like these, is not a spectator sport. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/14/ronan-farrow-reports-kavanaugh-accuser-refuses-to-come-forward-no-witnesses/","On the eve of a vote on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh as a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, Sen. Dianne Feinstein has produced a letter from an unnamed woman who accuses him of sexual misconduct when she and Kavanaugh were in high school.Ronan Farrow   a journalist who has gained notoriety for his investigative reporting on sexual predators, including disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and CBS executive Leslie Moonves   worked with another writer at the New Yorker to report on the last-ditch effort by Democrats to derail Kavanaugh s confirmation.Unlike Farrow s earlier reports on Weinstein and Moonves  in which victims are named and interviews included in the piece, the Kavanaugh accuser is different   and less credible   for several reasons.First, the woman is refusing to provide her name or to be interviewed   even anonymously.Second, she did not tell anyone at the time of the alleged encounter with Kavanaugh, while Kavanaugh was with a friend during their interaction and said he doesn t recall the story she tells.The New Yorker reported:The woman, who has asked not to be identified, first approached Democratic lawmakers in July, shortly after Trump nominated Kavanaugh. The allegation dates back to the early nineteen-eighties, when Kavanaugh was a high-school student at Georgetown Preparatory School, in Bethesda, Maryland, and the woman attended a nearby high school. In the letter, the woman alleged that, during an encounter at a party, Kavanaugh held her down, and that he attempted to force himself on her. She claimed in the letter that Kavanaugh and a classmate of his, both of whom had been drinking, turned up music that was playing in the room to conceal the sound of her protests, and that Kavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand. She was able to free herself. Although the alleged incident took place decades ago and the three individuals involved were minors, the woman said that the memory had been a source of ongoing distress for her, and that she had sought psychological treatment as a result.Kavanaugh has issued a statement, which the New Yorker included in its story. I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,  Kavanaugh said in the statement.  I did not do this back in high school or at any time. The New Yorker included the facts about how the woman approached her congresswoman, Anna Eschoo (D-CA), which reveals the woman now lives in the Golden State.The letter was also sent to Feinstein, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who questioned Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing but did not refer to the woman or the letter.The New Yorker reported that the woman had decided to not advance her allegations, but:After the interactions with Eshoo s and Feinstein s offices, the woman decided not to speak about the matter publicly. She had repeatedly reported the allegation to members of Congress and, watching Kavanaugh move toward what looked like an increasingly assured confirmation, she decided to end her effort to come forward, a source close to the woman said.The New Yorker article describes the tense reaction to how Feinstein handled the revealing of the letter among fellow Democrats. Feinstein s decision to handle the matter in her own office, without notifying other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, stirred concern among her Democratic colleagues,  the article stated.  For several days, Feinstein declined requests from other Democrats on the Judiciary Committee to share the woman s letter and other relevant communications. Eventually, Feinstein briefed other Democrats on the committee, but no staff was present at the briefing, according to the New Yorker. Feinstein made a public announcement on Thursday. I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,  Feinstein said.  That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the agency that received the letter, issued a generic statement:  Upon receipt of the information on the night of September 12, we included it as part of Judge Kavanaugh s background file, as per the standard process.

This is nothing more than a last-minute attempt at character assassination, and there should no delay in confirming Judge Kavanaugh. The allegation brought against Kavanaugh relates to his time as a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda, Maryland, in the 1980s. Kavanaugh allegedly held a woman down and tried to force himself on her during a party before she got away, according to the New Yorker.The New Yorker then described the accusation, writing:In the letter, the woman alleged that, during an encounter at a party, Kavanaugh held her down, and that he attempted to force himself on her. She claimed in the letter that Kavanaugh and a classmate of his, both of whom had been drinking, turned up music that was playing in the room to conceal the sound of her protests, and that Kavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand. She was able to free herself. Although the alleged incident took place decades ago and the three individuals involved were minors, the woman said that the memory had been a source of ongoing distress for her, and that she had sought psychological treatment as a result.The White House blasted that accusation in a statement on Thursday, charging that this is a last-minute attempt to attack Kavanaugh after the Supreme Court nomination hearings. Not until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new information  about him,  White House spokesman Kerri Kupec said.One source told Fox News that Feinstein received the letter in July; however, she waited until Thursday to release it.Despite the accusation that arose due to Sen. Feinstein s referral, Senate Judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said he does not plan to delay Kavanaugh s committee confirmation vote on September 20 and that they plan to confirm October 1.Taylor Foy, Grassley s communications director, said in a statement on Friday,  Sen. Grassley is aware of Senator Feinstein s referral. At this time, he has not seen the letter in question, and is respecting the request for confidentiality. There s no plan to change the committee s consideration of Judge Kavanaugh s nomination.

Dianne Feinstein s (D-CA) last-second attempt to smear Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.After countless hours of hearings, a number of in-depth background checks, thousands of questions asked and answered, and numerous one-on-one meetings with senators of both parties, at the very last second Feinstein dramatically released a letter (she has reportedly had in her possession for months) to the FBI. I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,  she said in a statement.  That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities. According to the far-left Washington Post, however, the FBI is not interested and will not be investigating the matter. The Post, however, was happy to add this:  The information came in a letter that describes an alleged episode of sexual misconduct involving the 53-year-old Kavanaugh when he was in high school, according to a person familiar with the matter. The  matter,  according to the Guardian, involves an alleged event that happened when Kavanaugh was still in high school. He stands accused of some mischief involving he and a friend locking a female student in a room. She found a way out. If this happened, Kavanaugh, who is now 53, was 17 years old at the time.Nevertheless, left-wing outlets like NBC News ran with headlines that read,  Sexual allegation against Kavanaugh referred to FBI by top Democrat. And in that particular story, we have a prime example of what NBC News called  journalism. Two sources told NBC News the allegation was sexual in nature, but both said the letter writer was not specific in describing Kavanaugh s alleged behavior. One source told NBC News the conduct described could allege sexual assault, but said it could also be a lesser allegation   and added the individual making the allegation would have to be more specific with law enforcement officials for any investigation to be able to move forward. [emphasis added]To the surprise of no one, the far-left ThinkProgress covered this in the exact same hysterical way NBC News did.The ThinkProgress headline and sub headline reads:  Brett Kavanaugh has a mysterious #MeToo problem     And federal investigative authorities  are involved. Here is how the ThinkProgress story opens:Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh may have committed a very serious crime   possibly even a sex crime. Or maybe he didn t. [emphasis added]You can go ahead and laugh at ThinkProgress over the  Or maybe he didn t,  but they are just aping the  professional journalists  over at NBC News. One way the far-left outlet did take the mud-slinging further, however, was by illustrating their piece with a photo of Kavanaugh standing over a young girl with his hands on her shoulders. They were shamed into changing the picture after publication.According to the Intercept, the woman who is the subject of Feinstein s secret letter  is now being represented by Debra Katz, a whistleblower attorney who works with #MeToo survivors. Joseph Abboud, an attorney at Katz s firm, said that the firm was declining to comment. Oh, and the far-left New York Times was no better:Two officials familiar with the matter say the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between Judge Kavanaugh and a woman when they were both in high school. They spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.How lucky are Democrats that they can use the establishment media to spread unfounded smears on their behalf?Feinstein releases a vague statement about a vague incident she refers   strictly for dramatic purposes   to the FBI. Then the Democrat leakers run to their confederates in the elite media to whisper about  sexual misconduct  and  MeToo,  and the smear machines that are NBC News and the New York Times give the Democrats exactly what they want.Meanwhile, a decent man is tarred for life.And over what? Even if it is true   if Kavanaugh, nearly 40 years ago, committed the worst sin of his life, this is still the biggest nothingburger ever.But that is not the point.The goal was manipulating a willing media into publishing  sexual misconduct  headlines, which of course they did.Democrats sure got it good.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

A letter containing information regarding the alleged incident was initially received by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), whose office forwarded the document to Feinstein  this summer.  Fox News reports Feinstein was sent the letter in July   prior to the hearings  September 4 start date. Feinstein only revealed the letter s existence during a meeting with fellow Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats Wednesday evening.The Times reveals  several  Democrats have since urged Feinstein to relay the allegations to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Washington Post reports the bureau is not considering investigating the matter at this time.  According to a person familiar with the matter, the FBI does not now plan to launch a criminal investigation of the matter, which would normally be handled by local authorities, if it was within the statute of limitations,  the Post says.As Feinstein faces pressure to make the allegations public, various individuals familiar with the letter have told outlets differing accounts of the possible incident. Different sources provided different accounts of the contents of the letter, and some of the sources said they themselves had heard different versions, but the one consistent theme was that it describes an incident involving Kavanaugh and a woman while they were in high school.  Kept hidden, the letter is beginning to take on a life of its own,  writes The Intercept s Ryan Grim.The unidentified woman has retained Debra Katz, a prominent civil rights lawyer who represents various #MeToo victims.Sen.

Grassley is aware of Senator Feinstein s referral,  Taylor Foy, the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman s communications director, said in a statement.  At this time, he has not seen the letter in question, and is respecting the request for confidentiality. There s no plan to change the committee s consideration of Judge Kavanaugh s nomination. Republicans aim to have Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court by October 1.In response to the letter, White House spokesperson Kerri Kupec issued the following statement:  Throughout his confirmation process, Judge Kavanaugh has had 65 meetings with senators including with Senator Feinstein sat through over 30 hours of testimony, addressed over 2,000 questions in a public setting and additional questions in a confidential.  Not until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new information  about him,  the official added.

For @TeenVogue I spoke with @_Jordynkiera and other young people who have had abortions, and wrote about how they re letting the world know THEY are the experts of their own stories via programs from @AdvocatesTweets @AbortionFunds #AbortionOnMyTerms https://t.co/XH3H8UGXKU  Elly Belle <U+0001F52E> (@literElly) September 12, 2018In a feature story about the new program, Teen Vogue focuses on the case of Jordyn Close, a young black woman and  abortion storyteller from Ohio  who is  especially passionate about dispelling the myth that finding out you re pregnant and proceeding to get an abortion must be a harrowing or debilitating experience. Teen Vogue continues:For Jordyn, who went in and out, made casual conversation with her doctors while they performed the procedure, and then treated herself to Raising Cane s for chicken before returning home to once again watch TV and relax, it was a mostly normal day. Although Jordyn recognizes that the way her abortion story panned out is not always the norm, the ease she experienced is what she ultimately wants every person to have the opportunity to have. I just want there to be accessibility and intersectional accessibility,  Close said, adding:If we re talking about access, that means something completely different to me, or another black woman. If there are more clinics, that s great, but how are people paying? How are people getting to those? How are people taking care of their kids if they already have kids waiting at home? There s just so many other aspects that people don t think about.The new abortion story-telling program hopes to  reframe the narrative around abortion by giving platform to some of the most vulnerable abortion storytellers   particularly people of color, LGBTQ people, and people with varying abilities and citizenship statuses,  states Teen Vogue. The goal of the program, according to the NNAF, is to show that young people who have had abortions are the experts on reproductive rights as well as the experts of their own experiences, and must be trusted with making decisions without anyone else s permission,  the article says.In another  story,  Jessy, 22  president of the Planned Parenthood Generation Action chapter at the University of California, Riverside  told Teen Vogue she was  shocked  to discover she was pregnant. I just didn t know what to do for myself even though I knew what I would always tell others,  she said.  Knowing that what was inside me kept growing as time progressed really did take an emotional toll on me, my grades, my social life it wasn t until after I got my abortion that I got some sort of relief. Jessy said young people need an abortion clinic on or near college campuses that offer drugs that induce abortion, so that students won t have to travel far from school to obtain abortions.We Testify says its mission is to  build the power and leadership of abortion storytellers, particularly those of color, those from rural and conservative communities, those who are queer identified, those with varying abilities and citizenship statuses, and those who needed support when navigating barriers while accessing abortion care. Teen Vogue notes the program is launched as the abortion industry views federal protection to legal abortion in danger due to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Deb Hauser, president of Advocates for Youth another sponsor of the youth abortion storytelling program  said getting young people to speak out about the need for more abortion services is key.We re calling our Senators to demand they #StopKavanaugh and protect abortion access, LGBTQ rights, immigrant rights  and workers. Join us by calling your Senators: 202-849-7460! pic.twitter.com/xsmWAZ9gqg  Advocates For Youth (@AdvocatesTweets) September 4, 2018 With this Administration s unrelenting assault on everything we value, we need youth activists more than ever,  Hauser said in a press statement announcing the new program. Young people are leading the way on every fight worth having,  she also told Teen Vogue.  Whether they are marching for gun control, police reform, immigrants  rights, LGBTQ health and rights, racial justice or reproductive justice, young people are mobilizing for a more just and equitable world. Our job is to provide them with the tools and support they need to make their vision a reality. We re so excited to announce the launch of Youth Testify, a partnership between Advocates for Youth and @AbortionFunds .  Youth leaders who have experienced abortion are sharing their stories and working in their communities to ensure access.  https://t.co/VmbtbNVjlB  Advocates For Youth (@AdvocatesTweets) September 12, 2018NNAF also launched the George Tiller Memorial Abortion Fund  named for the murdered abortionist  and created the Tiller Fund Report, which promotes the idea that no one should have to pay for their own abortion. The results of this research suggest a need for repeal of discriminatory abortion policies and for abortion to be fully covered by all health insurance, both public and private,  NNAF states. Restrictions like parental consent laws make abortion care even harder for young people to obtain than for adults seeking the same or similar procedures,  adds Teen Vogue.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/13/resistance-hero-ruth-bader-ginsburg-slams-highly-partisan-kavanaugh-hearings/","Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made her disapproval known regarding the  highly partisan show  that took place during confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh.Speaking at the George Washington University Law School, Justice Ginsburg told students that  the way it was, was right. The way it is, is wrong.  She called the  atmosphere  of her 96-3 voted confirmation  truly bipartisan.  The vote on my confirmation was 96-3, even though I had spent about 10 years of my life litigating cases under the auspices of the ACLU,  she explained.  No senator asked me any questions   not about that. Ginsburg offered another example, in memory of the late Justice Anton Scalia:  Think of Justice Scalia, who s certainly a known character in, what was it? 1986,  she said, continuing:The vote was unanimous, every Democrat and every Republican voted for him. That s the way it should be, instead of what it s become, which is a highly partisan show. The Republicans move in lockstep, and so do the Democrats. I wish I could wave a magic wand and have it go back to the way it was.Despite the contentious nature of Kavanaugh s confirmation hearings   complete with allegations of perjury   he is expected to gain more than the 50 votes needed for confirmation.Ginsburg will be portrayed by actress Felicity Jones in a new biopic that will premier on Christmas Day, 2018.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/13/white-house-questions-last-minute-democrat-attempt-to-smear-brett-kavanaugh/","The White House responded Thursday to an attempt by Senate Democrats to smear Judge Brett Kavanaugh with unfounded allegations. Senator Schumer promised to oppose Judge Kavanaugh s nomination with everything I have,  and it appears he is delivering with this 11th-hour attempt to delay his confirmation,  White House spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement to reporters.Sen. Dianne Feinstein issued a statement that she sent a letter from a person involved with Kavanaugh to the FBI, suggesting that she was concerned about the contents.The New York Times reports that officials  familiar with the matter  suggested that the letter had to do with  possible sexual misconduct  with Kavanaugh and a women when they were both in high school. Kavanaugh went to Georgetown Preparatory high school, which is an all-boys school.The White House reminded critics the FBI had vetted Kavanaugh throughout his 25-year career, he had sat through 65 meetings with senators, 30 hours of testimony, and addressed over 2,000 questions, throwing into  question the timing of the new information. Not until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new information  about him,  Kupec said.The New York Times reports that Feinstein received the letter earlier in the summer, but only shared the contents of it with Democrats on the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/13/elizabeth-warren-confirming-kavanaugh-means-return-back-alley-abortions/","Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) told her 4.5 million followers on Twitter that if the U.S. Senate confirms Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice, women will be forced to get  back-alley abortions.  We cannot go back to the time of back-alley abortions,  Warren said in a tweet on Wednesday.  But that could happen if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court and helps overturn Roe v. Wade. We must #StopKavanaugh  the lives and futures of countless American women are at stake :We cannot go back to the time of back-alley abortions. But that could happen if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court and helps overturn Roe v. Wade. We must #StopKavanaugh  the lives and futures of countless American women are at stake. https://t.co/ScOgbd3diB  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 12, 2018The Washington Times reported: President [Donald] Trump s nominee for the high court told lawmakers during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Roe v. Wade set an  important precedent  in 1973 before being  reaffirmed many times,  but the Massachusetts lawmaker isn t letting up on her  #StopKavanaugh  activism.Mr. Kavanaugh told lawmakers last week that 1992 s Parenthood v. Casey further cemented the precedent set by Roe v. Wade. It was reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992 when the court specifically considered whether to reaffirm it or whether to overturn it,  Kavanaugh told lawmakers during his recent confirmation hearings.  That makes Casey precedent on precedent. Democrats have made the overturning of Roe v. Wade the centerpiece of their opposition to Kavanaugh, citing the threat to women s  constitutional  right to abortion.In fact, if the high court were to reconsider Roe v. Wade and a majority of jurors decided to overturn the law, it would not outlaw the procedure, but return jurisdiction to the states. States would then control abortion laws.Republican leadership has said they have the 51 votes needed to confirm the judge. The Senate vote on Kavanaugh is expected to take place on September 20.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/13/poll-kevin-cramer-up-four-points-north-dakota-senate-race/","Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) leads Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) by four points, according to a poll released Wednesday.Congressman Kevin Cramer leads Sen. Heitkamp 48 to 44 percent in a Fox News poll released this week, while eight percent of voters remain uncertain about whom they will vote for in the November midterm election. The margin of error is 3.5 points, giving Cramer a lead beyond the margin of error sampling.Heitkamp faces an uphill election battle in a state that Donald Trump won by a staggering 36 points and where 54 percent approve of his job performance.Eighty-four percent of Cramer supporters and 85 percent of Heitkamp supporters say they are confident they will vote for their preferred candidate. Only 15 percent of voters say they may change their voting preference before the election in the next two months.Men prefer Cramer by 15 points, while women support Heitkamp by seven percent. The North Dakota Republican also received 30 percent support from white evangelicals and 30 percent of voters emphasizing the economy.Given the increasingly competitive race between Heitkamp and Cramer, the North Dakotan faces more pressure to back President Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, for the Supreme Court.One-quarter of North Dakota voters said if Sen. Heitkamp were to vote against Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, it would make them less likely to vote for Heitkamp in the midterm election; only 18 percent of North Dakotans suggested they would be more likely to vote for Heitkamp if she voted against Kavanaugh, while 53 percent said it would make no difference.Heitkamp is considered one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats up for re-election this year, along with Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-IN) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO).Daron Shaw, a Republican pollster, suggested that North Dakota is an  uphill fight  for Democrats this cycle. It s a red state overall, and anti-Trump sentiment just isn t a rallying point here like it is in some other states,  explained Shaw.Sen. Heitkamp s campaign faced backlash after the senator s brother, Joel Heitkamp, tweeted on Wednesday that President Trump will help potential victims of Hurricane Florence because  they re white. Contrary to Joel s tweet, the hurricane will affect Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia, which all feature significant black and Hispanic populations.The local radio host s controversial statement comes as leading strategists deemed the race for Sen. Heitkamp s re-election as  lean Republican  towards Cramer.

He added,  There s still, I think, a dozen senators, Democrat and Republican, who haven t declared where they re going to come out. I think it s clear that Judge Kavanaugh will not get 60 votes, and it is likely he will get 50 or more. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
