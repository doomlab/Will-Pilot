What s happened to our park in the last 34 days is irreparable for the next 200 to 300 years,  Sauer said, according to the Palm Springs Desert Sun.Three thousand miles away, President Donald Trump the previous day announced a short-term plan to reopen the government for three weeks.The announcement was a clear concession on his part, temporarily shelving his demands for $5.7 billion in funds for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border <U+2015> a project Democratic lawmakers firmly rejected. The short-term deal came on the 35th day of the shutdown, the longest in United States history, and after over 800,000 federal workers had already missed two paychecks. (Trump promised the affected workers would get back pay  very quickly or as soon as possible.)He said he is prepared to shut down the government again if funding for his border wall is not secured by the end of the negotiation period.The U.S. economy may never recover $3 billion lost during the shutdown, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.The political gridlock in Washington, D.C., also affected the country s many national parks, which were left open during the shutdown.National parks typically close during government shutdowns, but the Trump administration decided to keep them open, leaving them understaffed and vulnerable to misuse for over a month.Just eight rangers were on hand to oversee Joshua Tree s sprawling 790,636 acres during the shutdown. Spokesman George Land said in a statement this month that the park witnessed  incidents of new roads being created by motorists and the destruction of Joshua trees. With the gates open and minimal staffing, some visitors drove their vehicles off roads, graffitied rocks, started illegal campfires and cut down some of the famed trees that lend the park its name.Joshua trees grow just 1/2 to 3 inches a year and usually reach about 5 to 10 feet before they start to produce blossoms, according to the National Park Service. The tallest tree in the park rises to a whopping 40 feet. Some researchers think an average lifespan for a Joshua tree is about 150 years, but some of our largest trees may be much older than that,  the NPS says on its website.John Lauretig, who runs the Friends of Joshua Tree nonprofit, was one of a host of local volunteers who picked up the slack, cleaning overflowing toilets and trash areas and providing other basic maintenance work.  The local community is fed up with our parks being held hostage and the fact that it s open and partially staffed is not good for the park, it s not good for the public and it s not good for the local community here,  Lauretig said at Saturday s rally.  If the government doesn t fund or staff the parks appropriately, then they should just close the parks to protect the parks and protect the people. The NPS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Joshua Tree is a place of haunting natural beauty, a place where the American West and its associated longings and fantasies are manifested.But there s a deceptiveness to the hard, craggy stones, spiky trees and barren-seeming landscape.Casey Schreiner, a journalist who works to educate people on how to responsibly enjoy the West Coast s natural beauty, told The New York Times  California Today column this month that desert ecosystems are more fragile than they look.Deserts are home to delicate flora dependent on a fine layer of cryptobiotic soil that, as he told the Times,  can take literally thousands of years to form and can be crushed with a single footprint.

To qualify for the benefits, Meskunas had to demonstrate to the state that she s actively seeking work.So she applied for two administrative jobs in the private sector. They both pay better than her current position. They might lack job security, but federal government paychecks aren t reliable either these days.   I ve been with the government for 10 years, but if I m offered a decent package, I would seriously consider taking it,  said Meskunas, 56.  I don t want to go through this again. For workers like her, one of the most worrying effects of the record-setting partial government shutdown is the way in which it s making civil service less attractive. President Donald Trump s demand that Congress provide $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has led to the furlough of 380,000 federal workers, and an additional 420,000 deemed  excepted  have been working without pay. The shutdown marked its 31st day Monday, making it at least 10 days longer than the previous record. Nine of 15 agencies and roughly a quarter of government functions are affected by the lapse in funding.If the Trump administration really wants to diminish the federal workforce, a prolonged and painful shutdown could help toward that goal. Whether they re longtime civil servants or relatively new to the government workforce, many federal employees feel less secure and less valued each day they re locked out of their jobs.The uncertainty could easily lead many of the most productive employees to leave government for other work or could discourage some of the brighter prospects from ever applying.  We re going to see the fallout from this for a while,  Meskunas predicted.Grinding away at federal job security has been a hallmark of the Trump administration. Last year the White House issued a handful of executive orders aimed at weakening collective bargaining rights and making it easier to fire government workers. Key portions of those orders were blocked by a federal judge. The administration has also sought a pay freeze for civilian federal employees, resetting an automatic across-the-board raise to zero, and considered cutting federal worker pensions.Trump called federal employees working without pay  great patriots  on Sunday. But he also insulted furloughed workers last week, even as many are forced to seek loans from family members or accept food giveaways to feed their children. He retweeted a column from The Daily Caller, attributed to an anonymous Trump official, arguing that the shutdown is a good thing because the majority of federal workers don t do anything. We do not want most employees to return, because we are working better without them,  the author wrote. Trump retweeted his son Donald Trump Jr., who called the article  worth the read. To the unions representing federal employees, it often feels as if the Trump administration is at war with its own workforce. Despite their middle-class wages, federal workers have found themselves lumped in with the Washington  swamp  that needs draining. Never mind that most federal workers don t even live in the D.C. area. They know that this administration is hostile to them and their work,  said Jacque Simon, the political director at the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing 700,000 federal employees. Even so, she said she is not overly worried about workers being discouraged from entering civil service, despite the current uncertainties. One thing I m continually impressed by is the depth of commitment,  she said.  A lot of our members are veterans. There s a strong public service ethos. And as far as young people coming into government, there s always going to be people who care about the public good. The sense of public service is part of what attracted Rick Fernandes to government work. An Army veteran who served in Iraq, he said he made excellent money selling insurance but decided to seek out a stable federal job instead. He took a vast pay cut when he accepted a position with the Interior Department in Nevada. He figured the job security and sense of purpose could make up for the loss in salary. I noticed in the private sector many people were losing their jobs and not necessarily because they were bad employees,  said Fernandes, 33.  If you were looking for security and longevity, [the federal government] is probably one of the last institutions for that, other than the military.  After just a year and three months on the job, he has experienced three government shutdowns already. The first, last January, lasted three days, and the second, in February, just a few hours. Like the current one, both of those were due to lapses in government funding. Even though they were short-lived, those shutdowns still diverted federal agencies from their core missions by forcing them to develop contingency plans and prep for furloughs.The current shutdown has made clear to Fernandes that his livelihood will be used as leverage in political fights. Without any savings, he might have to seek a second job in order to be prepared for more shutdowns.  I was always reassured by more tenured employees that [shutdowns] only last a couple days.   I thought a week or so, at most,  he said.  It makes me wonder if government service is as resilient as it s believed to be. This shutdown proves it s not as stable as most people think. As the shutdown nears the one-month mark, it still isn t obvious how it will come to an end. Trump has offered to restore protections for certain undocumented immigrants and refugees after previously moving to restrict them but is still demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall that he used to say Mexico would pay for. Most Democrats quickly dismissed that offer, insisting that Trump agree to reopen shuttered agencies before bargaining over border security.Meanwhile, furloughed workers like Meskunas are at home tracking the news closely, waiting for any sign of a breakthrough to get them back on the job. At least until the next shutdown, anyway.  It s wearying,  she said.  It s like when the sea erodes the beach. You just feel like you lose a little more of yourself every time it happens.

Many employees are reporting that they are not able to report to work due to financial limitations,  the TSA said.A spokesman for the agency told HuffPost that data was not immediately available to compare the rate to that of past government shutdowns. But he noted that Sunday s absence rate was the highest the agency has seen since the current lapse in appropriations began on Dec. 22.TSA workers are among the 420,000 federal employees working without pay while President Donald Trump is gridlocked with Democrats over funding for his border wall. Many TSA workers live paycheck to paycheck, earning starting salaries of $25,000 to $30,000 a year, as HuffPost s Nick Robins-Early reported. The last paycheck these critical federal employees received was on Dec. 28, leaving many scrambling to pay bills and seeking short-term loans to make ends meet. To say morale is low is an understatement. People on both sides of the political argument are infuriated at this,  one TSA officer told HuffPost in December.  We feel completely and utterly unappreciated. Workers will likely receive back pay after the government reopens, but there is still no clear indication of when that will happen. On Monday, Trump offered to trade temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, for the $5.7 billion he has demanded for a border wall <U+2015> a proposal that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) equated to  hostage taking.  Despite the high number of unscheduled absences, the TSA said most of the 1.78 million passengers it screened on Sunday experienced waits of less than 30 minutes. National average wait times were within the normal bounds, the agency said, though  some airports experienced longer than usual wait times. The TSA was forced to close a security checkpoint at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on Saturday, citing  excessive callouts.  The agency encouraged travelers around the country to  seek current airline and airport information  and to  allow enough time to get through the airport and board their flight.

There s no reason to believe he ll follow through and I remember we ve been down this road many times with him,  Meyers said, pointing out Trump s continually shifting views about undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.But Meyers had an explanation for the president s sudden position changes.

Government workers, through no fault of their own, can t afford to put diapers on their newborns,  GoFundMe CEO Rob Solomon said in a statement Saturday.  Employees of the most powerful nation in the world are being forced to work without pay and line up at diaper or food banks. It makes no sense. As of Sunday morning, the fund had raised over $35,000 of its $50,000 goal. GoFundMe matched a $10,000 donation from author and speaker Deepak Chopra, according to the group s press release.National Diaper Bank Network and celebrity chef JosÈ AndrÈs  initiative to feed hungry federal workers will reportedly receive support from the fund. I wish we did not have to start a GoFundMe to help federal workers,  Solomon said.  Unfortunately we do. And because we live in an imperfect world, we have a simple choice: We can feel helpless while tragedy unfolds, or we can take action. He continued,  To all of the government workers out there furloughed or working without pay: We are with you. We hope this ends soon and your lives return to normal. The shutdown, which began Dec. 22, has affected over 800,000 federal employees across several government agencies, including the Interior Department and the Department of Homeland Security.Though these workers will likely receive back pay once the government reopens, those living paycheck to paycheck are struggling to make ends meet in the interim. What s more, government contract workers will likely never receive retroactive pay. It s unclear how many of these workers have been impacted, though estimates range from hundreds of thousands to millions.Over 1,500 GoFundMe campaigns have been launched by federal workers seeking money for food, rent and medical bills since the shutdown started. I just don t know how I m going to make it,  Nila Cleckley, who has been deemed an essential government employee and is a mother of two, wrote on her GoFundMe page.  I m never one to beg or ask for help but this is my only option. Failed negotiations between President Donald Trump and Congress have led to the longest shutdown in U.S. history <U+2015> with no apparent end in sight.Trump on Saturday offered to extend protections for refugees and undocumented immigrants who came here as children by three years in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding toward his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) dismissed the offer as a  non-starter. Trump s proposal is a  compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people s lives,  Pelosi said in a statement.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

People are missing paychecks. Food is not being inspected. Housing assistance is on the line. These families across the country who are very much struggling to make ends meet, it turns out, have absolutely nothing to do with the border wall.Lawmakers recently approved a proposal that promises to pay back federal workers affected by the shutdown. But that depends on the shutdown ending, and the reality is that not everyone affected by this is a federal worker. The ripple effect has begun, and everyday Americans, such as those in the stories recounted here, are paying for it. Valencia White is a Section 8 voucher recipient in Little Rock, Arkansas, which helps her stay in affordable housing. She has two young children and has a degenerative disc disease that prevents her from being able to work.  I ve got to pay rent, and I have to find ways to pay for food,  White said, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.  My children are the ones that s going to suffer the most. All contracts for Section 8 vouchers will expire at the end of February if the shutdown continues. The vouchers are under the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is already dealing with 1,150 expired contracts in its project-based rental assistance program, prompting a rash of eviction notices. About 3.4 million people use Section 8 housing assistance. Cynthia Wilson owns the Parsnipity Cafe in Wichita, Kansas. The cafe serves mostly federal workers in her building, but now the workers are furloughed because of the shutdown.Wilson told HuffPost she s lost about a third of her customers, deeply affecting her ability to pay the cafe s lease and her employees. She said she sympathizes with the furloughed federal workers but stressed that they at least are going to receive back pay when the shutdown ends. We don t get our money back,  she said. Sherry Kinard is a scientist at the Environmental Protection Agency and is based in Denver. She has two children, both with developmental disabilities.Kinard told MSNBC that with the ongoing shutdown, she doesn t know how she s going to pay for therapies and medication for her children. She and her husband recently married, and they spent a lot of money on the wedding. Now he s looking outside the state for a job that could better support the family. Angela Huffman works at Buster s Pawn Shop in Huntsville, Alabama. Huffman said she s seen more people visiting her store to make ends meet during the shutdown, but one visitor particularly struck her: a woman who came to pawn her wedding ring for extra cash. The woman, whom MSNBC s Stephanie Ruhle did not name, is apparently a furloughed worker and struggling to pay bills. Huffman said the woman s family eventually bought the ring back for her, highlighting the lengths some people are willing to go to survive the shutdown. Janusz Leja manages the Kava Cafe inside the Metcalfe Federal Building in Chicago. Leja is blind and works through an Illinois Department of Human Services employment program for the blind.With the shutdown lasting nearly four weeks, Leja s cafe has been closed, leaving him jobless. He still comes in every other day to toss out expiring food and check equipment. I had a little [money] saved for this month, but next month I don t know what s going to happen,  Leja told the Chicago Sun-Times while sitting in his empty cafe. John Boyd Jr. is a farmer in Virginia. He told the BBC he was supposed to receive a $15,000 subsidy for wheat seed that he never got from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.With no USDA to regulate farming, Boyd can t plant his crops.  I don t need a wall. I want money to plant crops,  he said. Anpetu Luta Hoksila is an indigenous psychologist working at an Indian Health Service medical facility in Arizona. He s been working long hours without a paycheck since the government shutdown began Dec. 22.Anpetu Luka Hoksila, who is going by his given Native name so he doesn t get in trouble at work, told HuffPost that he s prepared to quit his job and work as a barista at a coffee shop if the shutdown continues. On some level, it s kind of pitiful. But I don t care,  he said.IHS health care providers nationwide missed their first paycheck earlier this month but must keep working because of their  excepted  status as being essential workers. The agency provides health care to almost 2 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives. The longer the shutdown continues, the more difficult it will be for small tribes in rural areas to get essential medical services. Jackie Ramirez is an instructor for the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, also known as  Coast Guard City.  The Coast Guard is the only branch of the military that must work during the partial government shutdown because it s under the Department of Homeland Security instead of the Department of Defense.Ramirez said she s been making ends meet with help from a pop-up food pantry meant to assist Coast Guard members during the shutdown. This is a new experience for me,  Ramirez told HuffPost of the food pantry.  It gives me that comfort in case that next paycheck doesn t come.   Thank goodness for all this. I walked in and almost started crying. About 42,000 Coast Guard members recently missed paychecks for the first time since the monthlong shutdown began.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

IHS health care providers all over the country are bracing for their first missed paychecks on Friday <U+2015> and the reality that they have to keep working anyway. That s because employees like Anpetu Luta Hoksila are considered  excepted,  meaning they won t get paid during the shutdown, but they are also considered  essential  because the care they provide is vital to IHS services. The agency provides health care to nearly 2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through 45 hospitals and nearly 300 clinics in 35 states.HuffPost tried to get an exact number for how many IHS health care providers will stop getting paid this week but are still expected to work. An IHS spokesman, who was working despite being furloughed, said he is trying to track down that information.It s too early to know how severely the IHS funding freeze will hurt health care services to tribes. But it s already taking a toll. One urban IHS health care provider said morale has plummeted at her clinic in Michigan, where employees live paycheck to paycheck and are scared. A tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michigan s Upper Peninsula is mulling its own furloughs and pared-back health services. A nonprofit based in Boston and Baltimore that contracts with IHS expects to run out of money this week, and is looking at layoffs and suspended medical and mental health services.That IHS has even stopped sending money to tribes raises serious questions about the U.S. government not meeting its treaty obligations. The federal government is obligated to provide health care services to tribes because of treaties negotiated generations ago in exchange for huge swaths of land. IHS is funded by the Interior appropriations bill, though it is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. As long as IHS funding is cut off, the government appears to be in violation of tribes  treaty rights. In a roundabout way, they can say they are providing care. But the people that provide the health care are not getting paid to do so,  said one nurse practitioner who works at an IHS medical facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely. We have psychologists, psychiatrists, a plethora of people who provide care,  she continued.  They can only maintain working without pay for a certain period. People will start dropping out. They re going to have to find another job because they can t pay rent. I have enough for two months. That s it. Several of the health care providers who talked to HuffPost said the shutdown marks another chapter in the government s abysmal treatment of tribes. Native Americans suffer from many illnesses and diseases at rates several times higher than the overall U.S. population. IHS also has a long history of being underfunded. And the same federal policies that led to the creation of IHS <U+2015> disenfranchising marginalized and indigenous people <U+2015> are driving President Donald Trump s insistence on building a wall along the border. They re depressing our ability to provide health care to indigenous people while also trying to keep indigenous people out,  said Anpetu Luta Hoksila, who is an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians.  So it s like, I m a brown person trying to serve brown people while we re also trying to cause harm to other brown people. On a number of levels, it s really fucked up. That s the only way I can put it. Dr. James McAuley, the clinical director of Whiteriver Indian Hospital in Arizona, said he expects his staff of about 40 nurses and physicians to work without pay for as long as they can because people in health care  are generally altruistic.  But he is bracing for low morale and stories of financial hardship. His hospital is on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation and serves about 17,000 Native Americans. Generally, the public probably perceives physicians won t suffer. But we have young people just out of residency, with big student loans <U+2015> they ll have to make deferrals on those,  said McAuley.  More worrisome is what happens with support staff, who are making far less and supporting family members.  I think our local churches are anticipating a need to step in,  he added.Small tribes in rural areas will be hit the hardest by the IHS funding freeze. Some rely entirely on federal funding for all of their services, and others don t have a single clinic on their reservation. That requires people to commute, sometimes an hour or more, to a remote IHS facility that will now be struggling to operate because of the government shutdown.Monica Brady, the finance director for the Yomba Shoshone Tribe in northern Nevada, said that s the situation with this tribe. It doesn t have a clinic or generate its own income. Members of the community rely heavily on public transportation to get to their medical appointments. That s my biggest concern: We need these programs back up and running to transport our elders to and from their appointments,  said Brady, who expressed frustration that there hasn t been more news coverage of the shutdown s effects on rural tribes.  Do people realize that not every reservation in the nation has a casino? Brady, whose husband is a member of the tribe, was the only person in the tribe s administrative office when HuffPost called. It usually has 22 people in it. But she and all of her colleagues have been furloughed, and many are applying for unemployment. We re just muddling along until we know what we can do,  she said.  I m trying to make sure I m here a few days a week, just to make sure someone is answering any calls. Paulette Jordan, a former Democratic candidate for governor and two-term state legislator, is a member of the Coeur d Alene tribe in rural Idaho. She said her tribe s health care services are fine for now because it relies less on federal money than some other tribes. But she s worried about what a prolonged shutdown could mean. We live in health care deserts,  she said.  If our health clinics close up shop on reservations in rural communities, it poses a major threat to Native people who have been subject to governmental genocide for generations and are now left with increased demands for urgent and chronic care. Bigger tribes that generate significant money from casinos, like the Cherokee Nation, can pull from their general fund and get by for a longer period. The Cherokee Nation manages its own major hospital and eight health centers, and blends its own money with IHS money. For now, we re able to protect the Cherokee people,  said Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin.  Not all tribes in the country are so blessed. We need to remember that. But even as strong as Cherokee Nation is, we re not invulnerable to the effects of a long-term shutdown. Hoskin lamented that Congress has failed to carry out the most basic responsibilities of government, like balancing a budget and funding the government. It s bad for the country, No. 1, he said, and it s bad for tribes.Despite Hoskin s reassurances, some of his tribe s members are scared about what the shutdown could mean for ailing family members. Amanda Clinton, his spokeswoman, tweeted that she s afraid the freeze in IHS funding could affect care for her father, who began undergoing chemo to treat cancer.My dad recently began chemo for lymphoma. We just found out he may also have congestive heart failure. Because @IHSgov is stupidly under @Interior & they re #shutdown, can we stop talking about trash at parks & start talking about how ppl like my dad could die if this continues?For the moment, there are no signs of a deal for fully reopening the federal government. Trump and Democratic leaders continue to clash on the president s demand for $5.7 billion to build his wall along the Mexican border.In the meantime, for tribal health care providers trying to hang on without pay, it makes an already infuriating situation even worse when the president claims that affected workers support keeping the government closed until he gets his wall money. When I hear Trump say something like,  100 percent of federal workers not receiving a paycheck agree with my stance that we should have a resolution for wall funding,  it really bothers me,  said Anpetu Luta Hoksila.  Because here we are, unfunded without a resolution for our budget appropriations for this year, and it kills me to hear that.  I don t want your fucking wall and I want to get paid for my work,  he added.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

It s estimated that hundreds of thousands if not millions of government-contracted workers were also affected. Though federal employees are expected to receive back pay, contracted employees likely will not. Underlying those effects on the overall economy are much more significant effects on individual businesses and workers,  the CBO report stated.  Among those who experienced the largest and most direct negative effects are federal workers who faced delayed compensation and private-sector entities that lost business. Some of those private-sector entities will never recoup that lost income. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on Monday said he disagrees with the CBO s assessment of the shutdown s economic impacts, though did not provide any specific numbers. We frequently disagree with CBO,  Kudlow said during a White House press briefing.  With all respect, they re doing the best job they can. I get that. No, I won t acknowledge any of that right now. He added,  I think you have just a whole bunch of very temporary factors and now that the government has reopened, the switch goes right back on. There s certainly no permanent damage to the economy. President Donald Trump on Friday announced a deal with congressional leaders to reopen the government for at least three weeks while lawmakers debate funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats have steadfastly refused to support a spending bill that would include $5.7 billion toward the wall, which he repeatedly vowed Mexico would pay for.The government fully reopened again on Monday, though the president has pledged to the shut it down again or declare a national emergency to secure funds for the wall if Democrats don t cave to his demands by Feb. 15. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said the CBO s report confirmed the shutdown had  a debilitating effect on our entire economy.  If it were to resume in three weeks, millions of Americans would again share the pain of the 800,000 workers who spent the past month without a paycheck,  he said in a statement Monday.  This CBO estimate serves as a stark warning to President Trump on the consequences of using American workers as a bargaining chip.  Private estimates of the economic impact of a 16-day shutdown in 2013 put the economic damage at $20 billion or more, though that funding lapse affected more agencies.This story has been updated with Kudlow s comments.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But not everything will go back to normal. The shutdown will have some lasting damage.  For one thing, some federal contract employees won t get back pay. While Congress routinely approves back pay for federal workers during shutdowns, people who work for companies that provide services <U+2015> such as thousands of janitors and security officers who work in federal buildings <U+2015> don t receive the same consideration. For another, millions of Americans will have to stretch their food budgets. The federal government ordered states to distribute February s food benefit payments several weeks early because of the shutdown. More than 38 million Americans receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, and they ll now have to wait until March for their next payment. Some beneficiaries may have already spent the February allotment, thinking it was some kind of accidental bonus. States had to rush to get the money out and didn t have time to focus on informing beneficiaries. Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, said she heard stories about confused SNAP recipients from several organizations in her state.  They thought that because of the shutdown, if they didn t spend them all now the government is going to take them back,  Hamler-Fugitt said. Hundreds of people in subsidized housing received eviction threats because nobody in the federal government could tell their landlords the program hadn t lapsed. One renter told a local TV station he would try to borrow money to make payments. Some Transportation Security Administration workers may have taken new jobs. How many people want to take a position that often pays less than $40,000 per year that doesn t actually guarantee a regular paycheck? And it could take years to reschedule some of the immigration court hearings that were canceled because of furloughed judges. The monthlong shutdown will also have larger-scale consequences, such as reduced consumer confidence and economic growth. The government shutdown of 2013, which lasted less than three weeks, reduced gross domestic product by at least 0.1 percent and as much as 0.6 percent, according to a range of estimates. When President Trump announced Friday that he would give up on his quest to make congressional Democrats support a border wall that he previously said Mexico would pay for, he threatened to shut down the government yet again  if we don t get a fair deal from Congress. But Trump has just proven that his  fair deal  strategy was totally ineffective <U+2015> except for disrupting thousands of people s lives.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The shutdown has affected the U.S. travel industry in many ways, from TSA checkpoint closures to vandalism in national parks.Unfortunately, a large number of national parks have been forced to close during the shutdown. But if you re a fan of the great outdoors, you can turn to the many state-run options. With this in mind, the travel site Atlas Obscura put together a list of  wondrous state parks,  drawn from its user-generated database of destinations.

State parks are particularly great because of their hidden historical aspects, proximity to home (no extensive travel needed!), and they re often filled with unexpected flora and fauna and intriguing natural environments,  Wolfe added.  For example, New York s Green Lakes State Park contains meromictic lakes, which are rare geologic features only found in a few places across the United States.

It was the kind of thing that normally would have been a routine reminder. But this week, it filled her with dread because she doesn t have the money to buy them. Jojo, who requested to be referred to just by her nickname because she and her fellow employees were told not to speak to the press, is one of about 420,000 U.S. federal employees currently working without pay. Another 380,000 employees are furloughed due to the record-setting partial government shutdown, which started on Dec 22.Jojo is a corrections officer at a federal prison in Texas and is the sole earner of her household. Her husband stays home to care for their two sons, who are 3 and 4. The boys both have autism, are non-verbal and recently aged out of home services. After missing at least one paycheck, many federal workers can t pay for basics like food and medication and are taking desperate measures to get those items. Affording diapers, a costly expense even for families earning paychecks, has become a particularly difficult problem. Going without them isn t an option and there are no federal government programs that offer them. I can t not change them. They can t survive like that,  Jojo told HuffPost.  You have to take care of the little ones. You don t want to jeopardize their health and wellness. Jojo earns about $2,000 a month, and the family has been living paycheck-to-paycheck since they had children. In addition to their everyday expenses, they pay for special twice-weekly therapy services for their boys. Insurance covers most of the cost, but the family is required to pay $30 for every session. Because Jojo s job doesn t offer paid maternity leave, she had to take a few unpaid weeks off each time, during which she accrued $6,000 in credit card debt that she s still paying off.Diapers cost her about $120 a month, and Jojo couldn t afford to pay her mortgage or car note bills this month, either.Jojo was relieved to learn from a friend that she could turn to the Texas Diaper Bank to get some help. The San Antonio-based nonprofit is a two-hour drive from her house, but even after accounting for fuel costs, she said making the trek is still financially worthwhile. The group is offering six months  worth of diapers and wipes to government employees and contractors affected by the shutdown. Jojo plans to make the drive on Wednesday after she finishes her eight-hour shift at work.While the Texas Diaper Bank currently has the resources to provide extra supplies to government employees who may be seeking help for the first time, demand could very well exceed capacity, said Ashley Hernandez, program manager at the nonprofit. The group typically supports 20 families a day. On Tuesday alone, after announcing that it was extending help to families affected by the shutdown, the organization gave out diapers to about 25 families, and more calls are coming in. It s likely that many nonprofits, especially those that provide diapers, simply don t have the resources to meet this kind of additional demand, said Joanne Goldblum, CEO and founder of the National Diaper Bank Network. Nonprofits don t have more money because there s a shutdown,  Goldblum said.  It impacts and pushes on the resources of organizations that are already straining to meet the needs of people who rely on them on a day-to-day basis. The National Diaper Bank Network comprises more than 200 local diaper banks that follow a similar model to that of food banks. The local agencies provide diapers, wipes, feminine hygiene products and services to struggling families. Goldblum said the organization has seen a noticeable uptick in need since the shutdown, particularly among Coast Guard families and communities in the greater Washington, D.C., area, where there are high levels of federal employment. Although the network distributes about 52 million diapers a year, it s still not enough. In Connecticut alone, the diaper bank gives out around 1 million diapers a year, according to Goldblum.Other diaper-specific groups and general nonprofits say they re overwhelmed with requests for diapers from federal employees right now. The Cloth Option, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that just launched at the beginning of this month, provides reusable diapers. Since announcing on Facebook this week that its services are available to federal employees, the group has gotten a steady stream of applications, said Sadie Cora, chair of the group s board of directors.One application that stuck out to Cora was from a mother who has four children and is pregnant with her fifth. Her husband was furloughed and she said in her request that she was  scared  because she had no idea when they were going to see a paycheck again.  This is real for people,  Cora said. The Massachusetts Military Support Foundation, which provides aid to military personnel based in Massachusetts, said it can barely keep up with demand. It set up five pop-up pantries for Coast Guard families affected by the shutdown. In Rhode Island and Boston, the group went through three months  worth of diapers in two weeks, said Don Cox, the foundation s president. Cox said his organization is spending about six times what it normally spends per week to meet the needs of these military families. While the families are grateful for the help, they re also weighed down by stress, Cox said.  If you didn t get paid, and you had your Christmas bills, and your car insurance was due and you weren t sure when next paycheck was coming in, how would you feel?  he asked.While these organizations are providing crucial services, many families might not even be aware that they re available. Others might not live anywhere near an agency and may be forced to take desperate measures as a result.Teremy Henriquez, a furloughed federal employee who works for the Department of Agriculture in Puerto Rico, has a 1-year-old son. She s running low on diapers and has been keeping her child home from daycare to more closely monitor how many diapers he goes through and make them last a little longer. It s a last resort for a lot of struggling families: Rationing diapers can lead to diaper rash and other health risks.Jojo is grateful that her situation hasn t come to that. But she has plenty of other things to worry about right now. As the bills continue to pile up, she s considering where she can pick up another job, possibly at a nearby McDonald s. I was raised to go get a good job and support my family, in order to live a happy and healthy life,  Jojo said.  I went out and got a good job to support my family <U+2015> to allow them to be happy and healthy and not worry. Now, I m worried. HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

But the president made no mention of it in his State of the Union address Tuesday night.The partial government shutdown lasted 35 days, affecting about 800,000 federal workers <U+2015> in addition to thousands of federal contractors. Government employees missed two paychecks, with many wondering how they would pay for essentials like food, medicine and housing. They looked for new jobs, turned to relatives and friends for temporary loans and went to food pantries. The shutdown occurred because Trump insisted that Congress give him $5.7 billion to build a wall on the country s southern border, even though he once promised that Mexico would pay for that barrier. Democrats refused to go along with his demand and said he should simply fund the government and argue about immigration later. He refused. On Jan. 25, Trump caved and signed a bill funding the government for three weeks. He has insisted that if he doesn t get his money for a wall by Feb. 15, he may declare a national emergency allowing him to build it anyway. Trump never mentioned what federal workers went through during his speech Tuesday night. He expressed no remorse for the shutdown, and he didn t promise that it wouldn t happen again. The closest he came to referencing the shutdown was in urging Congress to fund the border wall when passing legislation to fund the government beyond Feb. 15.  Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland and secure our southern border,  he said.  Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers and human traffickers out of business. Even Trump s State of the Union address was affected by the shutdown. It was supposed to occur on Jan. 29, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) canceled it <U+2015> she has that power since the president delivers it in the Capitol <U+2015> and said they would discuss a new date only after the government reopened. Trump s approach is a break from what President Bill Clinton did in 1996, after what had previously been the longest shutdown ever. In his State of the Union speech that year, Clinton honored a heroic public servant who had been furloughed because of the shutdown. He then warned Congress to remember the pain of the shutdown when legislating in the future.  On behalf of Richard Dean and his family and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people,  Clinton said.  I challenge all of you in this chamber: Never, ever shut the federal government down again. In the Democratic response to Trump s address Tuesday night, Stacey Abrams <U+2015> who ran for governor of Georgia <U+2015> did address the shutdown.  Just a few weeks ago, I joined volunteers to distribute meals to furloughed federal workers. They waited in line for a box of food and a sliver of hope since they hadn t received a paycheck in weeks. Making their livelihoods a pawn for political games is a disgrace,  she said.  The shutdown was a stunt engineered by the President of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people <U+2015> but our values.

Annette Cowen manages 50 properties in Arkansas, mostly apartment buildings for low-income tenants with government-subsidized rent. She said her usual federal contact got furloughed when several agencies shut down last month, so she had nobody to tell her if the government would pay its share this month. So last week she sent her tenants some upsetting letters.  Due to the shutdown of the federal government, your rental assistance portion of your rent is not being paid,  Cowen said in her letter.  As of now, you have no rental assistance and your rent must be paid prior to January 20th or eviction procedures may begin against you. It turned out to be a false alarm. This week Cowen said she finally talked to an official who said she would still receive payments for the government s portion of her tenants  January rent. She said they would all get new, more reassuring letters. But the eviction threat may be a picture of what s to come if the shutdown continues. Cowen s tenants are beneficiaries of a little-known U.S. Department of Agriculture housing initiative that is essentially a rural counterpart to the Department of Housing and Urban Development s much larger programs. And those programs could be severely affected if the shutdown goes on for months or years, as President Donald Trump has said it might. The housing agency has already said it s unable to renew some contracts with landlords in its Section 8 project-based rental assistance program, which supports 1.4 million households. Under the program, HUD contracts with private building owners to set aside at least 40 percent of their rental units for low-income families, including seniors and people with disabilities. The shutdown has prevented the agency from renewing 1,150 contracts, affecting more than 40,000 households. An additional 2.2 million households use a different kind of Section 8 voucher that is portable, meaning families use it to find landlords on their own. That program is funded until March.Spokespersons for HUD have not responded to requests for comment about whether it would be legal for landlords to evict tenants because of the government s failure to pay. The department has asked landlords to dip into their own reserve funds to meet expenses if necessary. It has said shutdown evictions have never happened before. But it has not informed tenants about how the shutdown could possibly affect them. For the tenant-based voucher program, HUD regulations do not allow for landlords to evict tenants in the event that the government fails to pay its share. And the regulation doesn t allow landlords to charge tenants for what the government isn t paying.  During the term of the lease the owner may not terminate the tenancy of the family for nonpayment of the [public housing authority s] housing assistance payment,  the regulation says.Section 8 beneficiaries are typically required to devote 30 percent of their income to rent, with the subsidy making up the rest. If the shutdown drags on, and landlords start going broke, it s possible they could try to justify evictions based on another part of the regulation. It says owners can evict tenants for business or economic reasons,  such as sale of the property, renovation of the unit, or desire to lease the unit at a higher rental. The partial government shutdown, in its fourth week, is already the longest in history. Housing policy experts say landlords can only hold on for so long before they run out of money too. This is uncharted territory,  Michael Kane, executive director of the National Alliance of HUD Tenants, told HuffPost. He said the Section 8 system will  start to break down  as the shutdown continues, and building owners will be forced to eventually shift costs to tenants.It s not clear if the regulation prohibiting landlords from evicting tenants with portable Section 8 vouchers also applies to project-based vouchers or to USDA s rural housing assistance programs. Some members of Congress said they didn t think any evictions would be legal.  There s no way that they can evict anybody,  Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), the chairman of the House committee that oversees the USDA, said in reference to the Arkansas situation. The USDA told HuffPost this week that rural rental assistance is fully funded for January, but didn t say anything about the following months. Panic and confusion over a given program s status are the essential byproducts of a government shutdown. In 2011, for instance, the mere threat of a shutdown prompted a social services agency in Washington, D.C., to warn more than 100 elderly residents that they would lose their next home-delivered meal. The shutdown ultimately didn t happen. The Arkansas situation got resolved thanks partly to media attention. Local TV stations did stories on the eviction threat, and HuffPost and NBCNews followed up. One resident, a 76-year-old retiree named Jerald McLelland, said he had no idea how he would pay his full rent.  I ll have to call the finance people that my finances my car and see if they will extend my payment and I will have to take that money to pay the rent <U+2015> that s the only way I can do it,  McLelland told the local ABC affiliate. Cowen said that because the government had shut down, she believed her agreement with USDA to house subsidized tenants was no longer in effect. There was nobody to tell her otherwise.  These complexes are not designed to make money, only to try to break even on a yearly basis. This is done in order to keep the rents as low as possible,  Cowen said in an email.  If the government does not open soon, my management company will have to send my employees home and my maintenance people that maintain these complexes because there will not be funds to pay the employees. The USDA official who contacted Cowen this week, Cowen said, did so because there had been several inquiries from members of Congress, and presumably the news coverage had something to do with it.  We wouldn t allow that to happen,  Rep. Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) said Thursday of the eviction threats. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) walked away from a request for comment in a Senate hallway. The partial shutdown isn t anywhere near a resolution, and the threat to housing assistance is just one of many mounting problems. An estimated 800,000 federal employees have already missed paychecks. More than half of them have been deemed essential and have to keep working without pay. But President Donald Trump has been steadfast in his demand that Congress appropriate $5 billion for 200 miles of wall (or fence) along a border that already has nearly 700 miles of barriers. Democrats haven t budged an inch, pointing out that Trump has repeatedly promised Mexico would pay for the wall. If the shutdown goes on for another several weeks, it will begin to interfere not only with housing assistance but also the tax filing season and food benefits for tens of millions. And Cowen will be right back where she was last week.  The president says he s prepared for the shutdown to go on months, even years,  Cowen said.  My concern is, where am I going to get money?

A second shutdown threatens to kick in Feb. 15 if Congress can t cut a deal on President Donald Trump s demand for money to build a border wall.However, labor advocates think they have the answer on how to end government shutdowns. During the final week of the shutdown, sickouts spiked among federal employees who refused to show up for work, leaving staffing shortages, triggering airport delays and raising concerns over whether tax refunds would be processed on time.Meanwhile, there were indications of growing support for coordinated absences even as thousands of staffers were being encouraged to work without pay.Last week, former Clinton-era Secretary of Labor Robert Reich who was also temporarily an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, publicly urged employees to stop showing up to their jobs in protest.As a former secretary of labor, I urge federal workers who continue to toil without pay to stop working and those who are furloughed to picket their workplaces. Trump s callous disregard for all of you and for the public welfare must end. He must reopen the U.S. government.Joseph McCartin, a professor and director of Georgetown University s Kalmanovitz Institute for Labor and the Working Poor, told Voice of America, a government-financed news outlet, that the strategy could work. It would be about getting public attention, and even more important, causing the government to focus on this problem,  he said.  And hopefully, to delink the payment of wages to federal workers from the dispute that exists over the border. In an American Prospect Op-Ed published less than two weeks before, McCartin had pushed for workers to act, writing,  A sickout by unpaid federal employees could bring the impasse   and their status as hostages to the president s whim   to an end. Documentarian Michael Moore promoted the tactic in his Friday appearance on Stephen Colbert s  Late Show.  There s an easy way to end it,  he said of the shutdown.  Federal workers <U+2015> don t go to work without pay. Moore stressed that  we shouldn t be supporting anything that requires someone who s not paid working for us,  telling the audience to avoid flying and filing tax returns, suggesting they opt for extensions instead so as to avoid the need for workers.The day after Moore s appearance, the agreement to reopen the government was announced.While the future of government operations and Trump s border wall remain unclear, Democrats and Republicans have until Feb. 15 to find a solution before key parts of the government could again grind to a halt."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) from getting things done.Appearing on  The Late Show  Monday, the freshman lawmaker was asked a candid question about the shutdown by Stephen Colbert. What the heck is that like? Ocasio-Cortez noted that there have been some headaches as newly elected lawmakers such as herself haven t been able to situate themselves. We can t properly set up our district offices, we can t get laptops delivered, we can t start doing the work that we were elected here to do,  she said.  It takes the green stuff and those workers are furloughed. She added that  the bright side is that it gives us a lot more free time to make trouble. For Ocasio-Cortez, that included an attempt to track down a key figure in the shutdown: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).Making headlines last week, she and other lawmakers signed a letter calling for a vote to get Congress back in session and attempted to deliver it to McConnell. The only problem was they couldn t find him. We went to the cloak room, which is kind of like a snack room for the Republicans, we went to the Senate floor ... then we went to his constituent office in the Russell building <U+2015> we took a little, like, train that they have,  she recalled.Colbert wondered whether Ocasio-Cortez tried shouting  olly olly oxen free  on the Senate floor.

Standard & Poor s Global Ratings announced on Friday that its estimation is based on productivity loss from furloughed workers and economic activity loss to outside business, according to the news agency.  Although this shutdown has ended, little agreement on Capitol Hill will likely weigh on business confidence and financial market sentiments,  the company said in a statement.I wish people would read or listen to my words on the Border Wall. This was in no way a concession. It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, it s off to the races!President Donald Trump announced a short-term deal with Congress to temporarily reopen the government on Friday, which was the 35th day of what was the longest shutdown in U.S. history.Two competing proposals to reopen the government failed to pass in the Senate earlier this week, prior to Trump s announcement. The president backed down after a weekslong stand off with congressional Democrats, who refused to approve $5.7 billion in taxpayer money to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump had previously promised Mexico would pay for the wall during his campaign.Trump agreed to reopen the government for three weeks, until Feb. 15, so that hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have gone without pay, or have been furloughed, could get paid as border security negotiations continue. The president also promised on Friday that federal workers would receive back pay  as soon as possible.  During that same speech, Trump vowed to shut down the government again if he doesn t get a  fair deal from Congress. On Saturday, the president tweeted that  negotiations with Democrats will start immediately.  Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Restaurateur Ming Tsai has been dishing out free dumplings from his Boston establishment  Blue Dragon  to workers affected by the closure, the longest in U.S. history.  The idea to offer Shutdown Dumplings came from idea that the restaurant industry is one big family,  Tsai told HuffPost.

Through his nonprofit World Central Kitchen, AndrÈs opened a resource center on Tuesday in Washington to provide furloughed workers with supplies such as diapers, as well as provide free financial and legal advice. The chef also opened an emergency pop-up kitchen to provide hot meals to the employees.

The poll was conducted over Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend, as politicians continued to debate the terms of a possible deal and as furloughed workers braced to miss a second paycheck. Just over one-quarter of Americans say that they ve been personally affected by the shutdown or that they expect to be affected in the future. What they mean by that varies dramatically in scope and impact. For some, it s meant simply long lines at the airport or increased concerns about food safety; others have been plunged into acute financial distress by the shutdown, or are trying to help their friends and family make ends meet. But weeks into the partial shutdown, the ripple effects are increasingly clear.  Everyone is affected at this point,  summarized one Ohio woman who answered the survey.  People not being paid means they don t buy, which means creditors and retailers don t have income, which means they can t pay their employees, and so on. Schools are not receiving needed funding from the [federal government]. Student loan payments aren t going to my school. And so on  Here s what a dozen of the people we polled across the country during the last two weeks have said about the shutdown consequences they ve seen and whom they currently hold responsible for the standoff. Some quotes are lightly edited for brevity or clarity: My husband is an air traffic controller, deemed essential and working without pay during the shutdown. We are a single-income family, with a child who has special needs. This shutdown is causing us financial and emotional stress.  - California woman, says Trump and Republicans are responsible My volunteer fire department s DHS Grant to purchase new protective equipment isn t being processed.   - Colorado man, says Trump, Republicans and Democrats are all responsible Family business is a major federal government contractor. I and two other family members won t receive federal checks if the shutdown continues into February.  - New Mexico man, says Trump and Republicans are responsible Had to cancel a trip to a national wildlife refuge to see migrating birds. They will be gone by next month. Now we have to wait until next year.  - California woman, says Trump is responsible My partner s nonprofit works closely with the USDA. They are unable to request funds to continue building affordable homes. His pay comes from grants from USDA  - Washington woman, says Trump and Republicans are responsible Both of my sisters-in-law work for the federal government and both have not been paid. They need help from my family to cover household expenses and food for my nieces and nephew.  - Indiana woman, says Trump and Republicans are responsible Members of my family are active military, TSA, and Park Service. They will not receive paychecks until this shutdown is resolved. I hope the Democrats who partied with the lobbyists in Puerto Rico, Miami, Las Vegas, and Hawaii choke on their mai tais and fancy meals.  - California man, says Trump, Republicans and Democrats are all responsible My travel will be affected by the partial government shutdown because TSA agents are non-essential, not getting paid, and calling in sick, which is delaying flights by hours. Thanks, Trump.  - Montana woman, says Trump and Republicans are responsible My son is an essential federal worker with a one-year-old and no way to buy diapers or baby food. He has to work but is not being paid. I am helping him out, but my funds are limited, too. Also, my son-in-law is on unpaid leave, but luckily, my daughter is working full-time. But she s going on maternity leave in March, so they won t have any money, either. Our family is devastated.  - Arizona woman, says Trump and Republicans are responsible I work in a tax filing department of a payroll company, and certain services are unavailable from the government. It s now much more difficult to meet the Jan 31 deadlines for filing.  - Pennsylvania man, says Democrats are responsible  I can t apply for a federal job I ve been pursuing.  - Idaho man, says Trump and Democrats are responsible I live on different types of assistance. This will affect me and already has started to, with SNAP. I fear that I will not have enough aid, run out of food and suffer. I could lose my home due to not being able to pay for my rent. This is SCARY. The thought of losing my medical care, as a disabled woman needing surgery soon, has caused me trauma from living in fear.  - Connecticut woman, says Trump is responsibleAs in previous HuffPost/YouGov surveys, the public gives negative marks to everyone in Washington for their handling of the shutdown. Americans are 42 points likelier to disapprove than approve of the way Congress has handled the shutdown. By smaller margins, they also disapprove of congressional Republicans (-23), Trump (-17), congressional Democrats (-15) and their own representatives (-9). A 57 percent majority say Trump is at least partially responsible for the shutdown, a number that s unchanged from last week s survey. Forty-five percent name Democrats in Congress and 38 percent Republicans in Congress. Just 33 percent believe Trump is making a good-faith effort to end the shutdown rather than playing politics, with 34 percent saying the same of congressional Democrats, and 29 percent of congressional Republicans.Americans say, 50 percent to 35 percent, that Trump should have compromised on the border wall in order to prevent gridlock. Another 15 percent say they aren t sure.A review of other polling released in the past week finds Americans continuing to hold the president largely responsible for the impasse. Here s what some of them have found:Pew Research:  [B]oth opponents and supporters of expanding the U.S.-Mexico border wall overwhelmingly oppose making concessions to end the stalemate ... Overall opinion on the wall is little changed from last year, but these views have never been more sharply divided along partisan lines. Economist/YouGov:  As the partial government shutdown moves towards the end of its fourth week, the conflict between the Republican President and the Democrats in Congress is not one President Trump is winning   The [p]resident has been unable to convince most Americans that the wall is the best way to protect the country, or that a crisis on the border requires that he declare a national emergency in order to build a wall. Quinnipiac University:  American voters support 63 - 30 percent a Democratic proposal to reopen parts of the government that do not involve border security while negotiating funding for the [wall] ... The government shutdown has little effect on President Donald Trump s job approval rating as American voters give him a negative 41 - 55 percent score, compared to a negative 39 - 52 percent approval rating December 19, before the shutdown. PBS NewsHour/Marist:  Convincing Americans that the government shutdown is an effective tool to bring about consensus on border security is a tough sell for President Donald Trump. Reuters/Ipsos:  More than half of Americans blame U.S. President Donald Trump for the partial federal government shutdown, despite his repeatedly faulting Democratic lawmakers. Morning Consult/Politico:  As the partial government shutdown enters its 26th day, a new survey suggests Democrats are winning the messaging battle when it comes to whom voters blame   49 percent said they mostly blamed the president for the ongoing impasse, which has resulted in the shuttering of roughly one-fourth of the federal government. That figure is up 6 percentage points. Public Policy Polling (D):  The shutdown situation is not doing anything to help Trump s cause. Only 35% of voters agree with Trump that the government should be kept closed until he gets funding for the wall to 60% who disagree. The Hill/HarrisX:  An overwhelmingly 70 percent of registered voters in the latest The Hill-HarrisX poll said they want Trump and Congress to reach some sort of compromise, compared to just 30 percent who say that sticking to principles is more important than ending the partial shutdown. The poll found that while Trump s most fervent supporters approve of refusing to bend, no other demographic group did. Gallup:  As the federal government continues the longest shutdown in its history, Americans are most likely to cite  the government/poor leadership  (29%) as the most important problem facing the country.

The Bureau of Prisons told CNN there was no hunger strike, a claim that was contradicted by Eric Young, the American Federation of Government Employees  president of the Council of Prison Locals. Young wrote an open letter to senators last Tuesday, urging lawmakers to act to end the shutdown. We work in an already dangerous and stressful environment, where going to work distracted or fatigued can lead to serious injury or death,  he said, adding that employees are wondering how to pay bills, as many  are being required to work mandatory overtime, and do so without pay.  It is a recipe for disaster because a distraction could cost you your life. On Friday, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) met with federal employees, including two Bureau of Prisons staffers from the state s Fort Dix prison, and called attention to those struggling to make ends meet without a paycheck.The day before, Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) also met with local prison workers, highlighting the roughly 3,000 in his state who, he said,  have been risking their lives each day as they continue to work without pay. "

House Democrats won t come to the table and negotiate to reopen the government, but they ve been hard at work angling for more control over what you can say about them and how they get reelected,  McConnell wrote.Later Thursday, McConnell blocked legislation aimed at reopening most of the federal government, except the Department of Homeland Security, according to The Hill.An op-ed from @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell:Call H.R. 1 what it is: The Democrat Politician Protection Act. https://t.co/saz0P110es pic.twitter.com/1C8rwTysq1The act, the first major bill House Democrats have introduced to the 116th Congress, contains a package of reforms that aim to make voting more accessible, force President Donald Trump (and future presidential candidates) to release their tax returns and take power away from big political donors by incentivizing smaller donations and by requiring super PACs to make their private donors public. The bill also aims to make Election Day a paid holiday for federal workers, which McConnell dismissed as a  generous new benefit  for  federal bureaucrats.  In theory, that proposal would encourage private businesses to also make Election Day a holiday, allowing more people to get to the polls. McConnell also suggested that making private donors public was an attack on free speech. Apparently the Democrats define  democracy  as giving Washington a clearer view of whom to intimidate and leaving citizens more vulnerable to public harassment over private views,  McConnell wrote.The Republican also took issue with the bill s ban on removing people from voter rolls for not voting in a previous election, as well as a ban on voter caging, a practice in which election officials send non-forwardable mail to addresses on the voter rolls, then remove anyone whose mail is returned to sender. McConnell pointed to a mistake made in California that led to 23,000 voters being registered incorrectly, with errors including wrong party preferences.However, linking that part of the bill to the mishap in California is misleading, according to HuffPost s voting rights reporter Sam Levine.  It was an issue with software, and the head of the DMV resigned,  Levine noted on Twitter.  For context, there are over 19.6 million registered voters in CA. Automatic registration added 727,924 people to the rolls since launch in April.  The law congress is proposing authorizes the states to set up their own systems for registering voters. People have to be given the chance to opt out,  Levine tweeted. The law would prevent states from aggressively purging the voter rolls by removing people if they don t vote and don t respond to a single mailer from the state, he said.

It was initially scheduled to be delivered in the House chambers this Tuesday, but it fell victim to the shutdown. What I d said to the president is when the government is open, we will discuss a mutually agreeable date, and I ll look forward to doing that and welcoming the president to the House of Representatives for the State of the Union when we agree on that mutually agreeable date,  Pelosi said.SOTU on Tuesday?

It s time to send a message to President Trump and Senate Republicans: federal and contract workers are the backbone of our economy and their livelihoods should never be used as pawns in Republican political games,  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a statement.She said she invited Sajid Shahriar, a labor leader and an employee of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to join her for the address.Shahriar was one of roughly 380,000 federal workers furloughed during the shutdown, Warren s office said. Those furloughed workers, along with 420,000 federal employees who were required to report to work during the shutdown, went 35 days without pay while Trump sparred with congressional Democrats over $5.7 billion in funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.  I m humbled and honored to share that I will be representing federal workers at the State of the Union as the guest of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren,  Shahriar said in a statement.Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said Monday that her guest for the State of the Union would be Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik, an air traffic control specialist who was furloughed during the shutdown.Pesiri-Dybvik s husband is an air traffic controller and was required to work without pay during the lapse in appropriations. The family s home burned down in the 2017 Thomas fire. Since the tragic loss of their home, Trisha, Jed, and their three children have worked diligently to bounce back and reestablish a sense of normalcy in their lives, even amidst an unnecessary government shutdown that caused both of them to miss their paychecks for over a month,  Harris said in a statement.Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said Monday that she had invited Frank Lagunas, an employee of the Environmental Protection Agency, to attend Trump s address. Lagunas works as a project manager for the EPA s Superfund division and was furloughed during the recent shutdown. I want to show President Trump how his hostage-taking of American workers has a continuing impact on the lives of every day citizens, especially those who are dedicated to the public good,  Schakowsky said in a release.Trump is set to deliver the State of the Union address on Tuesday night.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had earlier asked him to postpone the speech, originally planned for Jan. 29, until the shutdown was over. When he initially refused to do so, she said she would not take the necessary steps to allow the address to proceed. After Trump announced a plan on Jan. 25 to reopen the government for three weeks, Pelosi invited him to deliver the address on Feb. 5.If he doesn t get funding for his border wall by the end of the negotiation period on Feb. 15, Trump has said he is prepared to shut down the government again.Pesiri-Dybvik said in a statement that federal workers feel added stress because of  the looming uncertainty of another potential shutdown. In his announcement about reopening the government, Trump promised that federal employees who had been affected by the shutdown would get backpay  very quickly or as soon as possible. But workers like Lila Johnson, a general cleaning services contractor at the Department of Agriculture, probably won t see any lost wages. Many government contractors <U+2015> from food workers and janitors to security services and computer software developers <U+2015> were also furloughed or received stop-work orders during the shutdown. But unlike federal employees, they likely won t receive backpay.Johnson will join Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) at the SOTU address, his office said. Low- and middle-wage federal contract workers who were locked out of their jobs during the shutdown have been stuck with mounting bills and no back pay,  Van Hollen said in a statement.Van Hollen and Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) last month introduced the Fair Compensation for Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act to ensure government contractors are paid for lost wages due to the shutdown. I appreciate the Senator inviting me to join him for the State of the Union to highlight the need for federal service contractors to be treated fairly,  Johnson said.  I know he is fighting for us, and I m grateful for his efforts. This story has been updated with Rep. Jan Schakowsky s guest.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

They ve become so radicalized and it s not going to work. They ve become crazy. The message doesn t even make sense anymore. It s almost an anti-American message. While the left overall has not advocated for totally open borders or sought the bankruptcy of all Americans as Eric contends, the exaggeration of liberal platforms has made them easier for conservatives to discount.Meanwhile potential democratic nominees for the presidency are either considering or actively throwing their hats into the ring ahead of 2020, including Sens.

He is placing the proposal on the table as a bargaining chip to end the partial federal government shutdown, which was caused in part by his demands for more than $5 billion to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But Belen Sisa, a Dreamer who spoke with CNN on Sunday, said it was the wrong solution. I think they should absolutely not take this deal, and the reason why is because right now DACA is still in place,  she told the network s Ana Cabrera.  Courts are upholding and protecting the program that President Obama passed, and we will continue to fight, but we will not do it at the expense of others.

To Sisa, the words were meaningless. If anything, this sounds completely hypocritical,  she said in response.  His actions are not matching his speech. They re not matching anything that he said. Continuing to bash the remarks, Sisa contended that Trump  has been running this country and even campaigned on us not being equal.  How could he turn around and slap us in the face? Though Trump announced the proposal only Saturday, it has already been turned down by many Democrats   including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.)   who said it s a one-sided push from the president to get $5.7 billion for his wall.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Bloomberg vowed to make sure the president doesn t serve another term. The presidency is not an entry-level job,  Bloomberg said.  There is just too much at stake.  And the longer we have a pretend CEO who is recklessly running this country, the worse it s going to be for our economy and for our security. This is really dangerous. He then panned Trump s White House with a film reference, suggesting there wasn t much separating the president from a villain.  It s like the government version of a bad horror movie, but instead of Freddy Krueger and the  Nightmare on Elm Street,  we ve got Donald Trump and the  Nightmare at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  Following his appearance at the business council s event, Bloomberg made a stop at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C., where he echoed his previous sentiments and laid out a strong condemnation of the shutdown. This is about competence and the lack of it we are seeing in the White House,  he said.  The government shutdown is a complete failure of executive leadership, and it s one of the worst cases of incompetent management I have ever seen. Bloomberg, who has flirted with the idea of a presidential run, has still made no mention of his plans for 2020. However, last month, he told NBC s  Meet the Press  that he would run as a Democrat and intends to make his decision early this year. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

It would make it easier to deport Central American children who arrive in the U.S. without their parents. It would expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement s detention and deportation budget by more than 20 percent.Perhaps most galling, it didn t even offer a better deal for Dreamers than the status quo, even though concessions on that issue were hyped as the compromise that would bring Democrats to the shutdown negotiating table. Under the draft bill, recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals protection could apply for a new program with stricter requirements that would offer similar deportation protection and work authorization, but that would permanently expire three years later.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is set to bring this legislation up for a pointless vote on Thursday. The measure is all but certain to fail in the Senate and would be impossible to pass in the House. It s beyond poisoned pills <U+2015> they didn t even try,  Ur Jaddou, former chief counsel for Citizenship and Immigration Services, told HuffPost.  There s not even an iota of effort to come up with a compromise. It s shocking. When Trump unilaterally canceled DACA in September 2017, many observers assumed that he did so in order to give himself leverage to demand concessions from Democrats related to immigration and border security <U+2015> like funding for a U.S.-Mexico wall, for example. Holding the security of 700,000 Dreamers hostage in order to fulfill his controversial campaign promise does have a certain logic to it.Events since his DACA strike have undermined Trump s position somewhat. Multiple federal judges have temporarily blocked the program s cancellation and so far the Supreme Court has refused to fast-track its consideration of the injunctions that allow Dreamers to keep renewing their DACA protections <U+2015> for now.Trump still has tremendous leverage when it comes to DACA. Having been created through executive action, the program can be reversed by hostile presidents who follow the law. And the program is currently stuck in legal limbo. Supporters of immigration reform, including Dreamers themselves, have long demanded a permanent solution, ideally with a pathway to citizenship.But Trump is not a Machiavellian strategist, using the twin weapons of deception and terror to achieve his ends. He s merely an obstructionist self-promoter for whom disaster is its own reward, as long as it s on brand.That s why he threatened to veto <U+2015> and thereby doomed <U+2015> a bill last year that would have made DACA permanent and set out a pathway to citizenship in exchange for $25 billion in wall money. And that s why the draft bill unveiled Monday night made an offer that the Democrats couldn t possibly accept. This is so far away from a good faith effort,  said Philip Wolgin, the managing director for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress.  It s nowhere near  Let s make a trade: DACA for the wall.  Some observers casting about for signs that a rational mind in the White House might honestly be cooking up a solution to the problem of Trump refusing to sign a shutdown-ending bill without some wall money are now watching Jared Kushner. Trump s son-in-law and adviser is trying to  figure out what bigger immigration reform looks like,  including a possible  path to green cards  for DACA recipients, according to an Axios report on Wednesday.The phrase  path to green cards  is another way of saying the more commonly heard  pathway to citizenship,  albeit in a form that sounds less objectionable to hardline immigration restrictionists. Perhaps that bit of language trickery offers a small sign that the thinking in the White House is evolving.What is less encouraging about the Axios report is its portrayal of Kushner. He seems unaware that the solution he s considering as if it were novel is the same one that his father-in-law has already rejected multiple times. If the president put up a bill with permanent protection for Dreamers for border security money, it would pass,  said Todd Schulte, president of the nonpartisan immigration advocacy group FWD.us and a major critic of Monday s draft bill.  If the president wants money for the wall, he knows how to get it. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The State of the Union is an annual message delivered by the president to a joint session of Congress.As House speaker, Pelosi (D-Calif.) can dictate whether a resolution to convene a joint session comes up for a vote in the House. Without a joint session, the president wouldn t be able to come onto the House floor to deliver his address.The president can technically enter the House chamber at any time, but as McClatchy reporter Emma Dumain noted, there might not be anyone else there, let alone C-SPAN broadcasting or even lights.Trump could technically face censure or removal from the chamber if he decided to enter House and begin his address without express permission from Pelosi, according to House rules. But as Pacific Standard outlined, there s no precedent for a president doing so against the wishes of the House speaker.Pelosi, who became House speaker this month after Democrats won control of the chamber, extended the traditional invitation to Trump on Jan. 3. Last week, she asked Trump to delay the State of the Union speech until after the resolution of the government shutdown.Her request sparked heated debate between the president and congressional Democrats, and speculation about how Trump might respond. Nancy Pelosi does not dictate to the president when he will or will not have a conversation with the American people,  White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Tuesday on Fox News.CNN s Jim Acosta, citing a senior White House official, reported Tuesday morning that Trump was considering delivering the address off-site, or even turning it into a rally.Trump could deliver his State of the Union away from the Capitol and might even do a rally, senior official confirms.  Contingencies need to be planned,  official says.ABC reported the president was preparing two addresses <U+2015> one to be delivered before Congress, and another to be presented at a political rally outside of Washington.The White House sent a letter to the House sergeant-at-arms requesting a walk-through ahead of the planned address, Fox News reported.Pelosi s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The church purchased over 300 Publix gift cards from a local grocery store in $50 increments. Within 30 minutes of opening the church s doors on Thursday, all the gift cards were gone, Collins said.The pastor said he was moved by how many people had lined up that morning at his church to receive the cards.  That was probably the most impactful moment,  he said.  Just seeing that many people who have done the right thing, prepared for a job, got a job, worked at a job and for circumstances beyond their control, now they re in need of temporary assistance.  Now in its fifth week, the partial government shutdown was triggered by disagreements between President Donald Trump, who is demanding more than $5 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, and Democrats in Congress, who don t want to allocate any new money for it. The shutdown has affected 800,000 federal workers, about 420,000 of whom must still report to work, even without being paid. In Alabama, nearly 40,000 federal employees have been affected by the shutdown, The Washington Post reports.Collins said that many members of his congregation are NASA or Redstone Arsenal employees. First Baptist is a conservative evangelical congregation aligned with the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and the Southern Baptist Convention.Below, Collins invites furloughed workers to attend a charity event at First Baptist Church of Huntsville.The pastor emphasized that his church is just one of many local organizations helping federal workers during the partial shutdown. He said the idea for Thursday s event came from workers at NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center who wanted to create an opportunity for local charities and businesses to connect with furloughed workers. As one of Huntsville s largest churches, First Baptist had the space to accommodate such an event. Eighteen community organizations set up information booths in the church, including the local food bank, the Alabama Department of Labor and banks offering low-interest loans, CNN reports. At least 700 people attended the event, Collins said. First Baptist s ministry staff are meeting on Monday to discuss future partnerships with community organizations helping furloughed workers, he said. Our only regret is that we didn t designate more money,  Collins said.  We had no idea how big the response would be. Across the country, other religious communities have pitched in to help federal employees affected by the shutdown. A church in Chula Vista, California, started a food bank for furloughed employees, and churches in Dallas and Atlanta and a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee, offered gift cards. Muslim youth groups across the country organized volunteers to clean up national parks amid the shutdown.Collins said he sees First Baptist s donation as a  natural response  to the crisis. It s kind of corny and all, but I think Jesus would be there giving away grocery cards or he d be right there volunteering with any organization that is helping,  Collins said.  So it s not like we re going above and beyond the call of duty. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The agency has been taking job applications on its website and plans a high-profile hiring push later this year. The Census Bureau was able to continue preparing for the count during the government shutdown with $1.1 billion from 2018 that could only be used for the 2020 census, The Washington Post reported.Pay for the jobs varies by location. In Washington state, for example, hourly pay ranges from $14.50 to $18, according to The Columbian.The Census Bureau jobs site says applicants should meet the following criteria:The bureau notes that most of the jobs require access to a computer with internet and email, and a car and valid driver s license, unless the employee is near public transit.The majority of the positions are for jobs that will last for a few weeks. Aside from census takers, other roles include supervisors, recruiting assistants and office staffers. "

There is no wall going up,  said Rick Tyler, a Republican consultant who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz s campaign during the 2016 presidential primaries.  So the only thing to conclude is that Trump is building a fake wall with fake pesos to stop fake caravans to prevent a fake border crisis for which he will declare another fake victory. The president triggered a 35-day government shutdown just before Christmas over the refusal by the then wholly Republican-led Congress to appropriate billions of taxpayer dollars for his signature campaign promise.A week ago, he signed the exact short-term spending deal <U+2015> with no wall money <U+2015> that he said he would not sign in December. On Thursday, he said he did so to help the 800,000 federal workers who already had missed a month of pay. He claimed, without evidence, that  many  of them had wanted him to continue the shutdown to get wall money. But I didn t want to do it because people were getting hurt,  Trump told reporters following an Oval Office photo opportunity.He added that the shutdown had great value because it focused attention on the wall and illegal immigration.  If I didn t do the shutdown, people wouldn t know, people wouldn t understand the subject,  the president said.  Now they understand the subject. They understand what a humanitarian crisis it is. Trump has taken to blaming former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan for failing to get him funds for a wall during Trump s first two years in the White House, when his own party controlled both chambers of Congress.  I was very disappointed in Paul because the wall was so desperately needed,  he told the conservative website Daily Caller.But one former Trump campaign official said the president failed to take advantage of his first-year power when he had it.  The fact of the matter was it s his fault for not getting it in his first two years, when he had control of Congress. He can blame Paul Ryan all he wants,  the official said on condition of anonymity.Now, with the House under the control of Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump is facing vocal opposition to his wall rather than just passive resistance.  There s not going to be any wall money in the legislation,  Pelosi said Thursday, but allowed that she is open to some new barriers in some areas as well as money for better technical monitoring.  That s part of the negotiation. Trump made illegal immigration and caravans of asylum-seekers heading to the border the centerpiece of his midterm election message last year. In speech after speech, he told audiences at his rallies and those watching at home that the migrants would bring crime and drugs and that Pelosi wanted  open borders  and would welcome those people in.Despite his efforts <U+2015> and in some congressional districts, because of them <U+2015> Democrats picked up 40 seats in the House. Meanwhile, Republicans, although they had the most favorable Senate election map in decades, picked up only two seats in that chamber.As a Dec. 21 government funding deadline approached, Trump resumed talking about caravans and immigrants coming to commit crimes <U+2015> including one particularly lurid but apparently apocryphal description of kidnapped women being bound and gagged with duct tape as they re smuggled across the border.On Thursday, Trump told reporters that he doubted the House and Senate conference committee negotiators working on a new Department of Homeland Security funding bill would include money for his wall. He acknowledged that he might yet declare a  national emergency,  which he believes would let him transfer money from other executive agency accounts to build the wall. I m waiting till Feb. 15,  Trump said, referring to the next shutdown deadline.  On Feb. 15, the committee will come back. And if they don t have a wall, I don t even want to waste my time reading what they have. Media reports from when Trump previously threatened to declare an emergency noted that he was thinking of raiding billions of dollars from the Defense Department s Army Corps of Engineers budget to repair hurricane damage in places like Puerto Rico and Houston. Those are not great ideas,  said Michael Steel, once a top aide to then GOP House Speaker John Boehner.Steel added that since Democrats seem willing to agree to money for some new physical barriers, he did not fully understand talk about an emergency or another shutdown. The president can say,  This is a wall.  The Democrats can say,  No, it isn t.  And everyone lives to fight another day,  Steel said.  It shouldn t be hard.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) shot down the deal to extend protections for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration proposal as a  non-starter. In a statement issued before Trump s speech, Pelosi said the idea was a  compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people s lives. Trump, meanwhile, falsely presented the proposal as something he had worked out with Democrats.He said he thought many Democrats would show their  enthusiastic support,  and he said his solution was a  compassionate response to the ongoing tragedy on our southern border. But the offer, which Trump made from the White House s Diplomatic Reception Room, seemed less like a serious effort to end the shutdown and more like his normal blame-shifting.In response to the speech, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said on MSNBC that Trump s deal was a  pipe dream,  and that Democrats would dismiss this speech as a publicity stunt.While the offer certainly doesn t seem to be a solution to the shutdown, it could potentially stir a new round of negotiations, and it signals Trump s willingness to make some deal trading DACA protections for border security money.Trump also signaled that he has moved from his insistence of a 2,000-mile border wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border to a more targeted approach. He referenced a  see-through steel barrier,  also known as a  fence.  He spoke of border security in broader terms, like in increasing the number of border agents. And he offered those trades for immigration <U+2015> specifically, three years of legislative relief for DACA recipients, and three years of protections for refugees.The Trump administration has attempted to shut down DACA, an Obama-era initiative that allowed around 700,000 young people, called Dreamers, to avoid deportation. It has also sought to severely restrict TPS, which allows people to reside in the U.S. if they come from certain nations undergoing conflict or recovering from a natural disaster. But both would get a three-year extension under Trump s offer.That proposal is likely to anger Trump s far-right base, however. Conservative author Ann Coulter <U+2015> whom Trump has taken policy cues from in the past <U+2015> tweeted that Trump s offer was  100 miles of border wall in exchange for amnestying millions of illegals.  So if we grant citizenship to a BILLION foreigners, maybe we can finally get a full border wall,  she said.Trump is also unlikely to move anyone on the left, but he and the White House are hoping there s a strong group of independents who will see Trump s effort to negotiate and begin blaming Democrats for the shutdown.Trump didn t spend time discussing the shutdown Saturday, but it s clear he s facing heat to get federal workers back to work. Polling suggests that 57 percent of Americans blame Trump for the shutdown, and his favorability has been slipping. But he s hoping he can at least convince some that he s working to find a solution <U+2015> even if his offer is one Democrats were able to easily reject.One thing Trump did intimate is that he still could use a national emergency declaration to get his border wall, or perhaps other statutes. Trump said he would get his border wall  one way or the other.  That may offer Republicans and Democrats some hope, actually, as many on Capitol Hill believe the only way out of this shutdown is for Trump to declare a national emergency and try to redirect funds to a wall, have that move tied up in court, and then allow both parties to pass funding without giving in to the other side.The other option <U+2015> Republicans, Democrats and Trump actually working out a deal <U+2015> is both unlikely and unpalatable to many. But there are some lawmakers who think Trump could find a way out of the shutdown by making a grand deal on immigration.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has been urging the president to offer the Democrats protections for immigrants to end the shutdown for weeks. And by offering support for the Bridge Act on Saturday <U+2015> legislation Graham co-sponsored <U+2015> the White House would allow DACA recipients to obtain three-year work permits and extend the TPS protections. But in a sign of the long odds such a deal would face, Graham s co-sponsor of the Bridge Act, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), said in a statement that he could not support the president s offer and did not believe it could pass the Senate.Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) supported reopening the government and starting border security negotiations. But if we reward this behavior it will never end, and the pain and chaos will be worse in the future,  he wrote over Twitter. If we open up the government I am open to negotiations. But if we reward this behavior it will never end, and the pain and chaos will be worse in the future. Let this be the last shutdown. They always backfire.Referencing an Axios report that Jared Kushner and Vice President Mike Pence led negotiations with Republican members of Congress, Schatz said in a later tweet:  You don t negotiate a compromise with your own Vice President and your son in law. That s not how this works. And Pelosi has said members of her party would not support any spending package that included funds for the wall that Trump envisions. In December, she said Democrats largely consider the massive infrastructure project  immoral, ineffective, expensive.   Nothing for the wall,  the speaker reiterated in a Jan. 2 interview with the  Today  show s Savannah Guthrie.Pelosi has also rejected the idea of exchanging border wall funding for DACA protections, saying in December that  they re two different subjects. Late last year, Democratic congressional leaders offered $1.6 billion for border security, to be used for technological improvements and fencing, but not the 30-foot-high structure proposed by Trump. The partial government shutdown has affected roughly 800,000 federal employees, who started to miss paychecks earlier this month. Many have shared their financial anxieties with news media, with some saying they have missed rent payments or are struggling to afford diapers.

Great record, especially when under pressure and when it mattered most. Do what everyone in Baseball knows is right! @marklevinshowIt may be a little too late: The New York Post points out that ballots were due three weeks ago.Still, Schilling appreciated the effort.Thank you Mr President! Do NOT give in on any of it! We are behind you! https://t.co/dAazba6GonSchilling was a three-time World Series champion, winning with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001 and the Red Sox in 2004 and 2007.He also finished second for the Cy Young Award three times, though he never won, according to Fox News.Schilling s most famous moment on the field was Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series, when he pitched and won the game despite having a serious ankle injury.But Trump most likely supports Schilling because of his post-baseball career.Schilling appears to reject the same things the president often rails against, including transgender rights, Muslims and an independent media.The 52-year-old Schilling was fired from ESPN in 2016 for an anti-transgender post he put on Facebook. That same year, he jokingly endorsed the lynching of journalists, which led some Hall of Fame voters to leave him off their ballot that year. In 2015, ESPN suspended Schilling for a tweet comparing Muslims to Nazis.To get into the Hall of Fame, Schilling will need to be named on 75 percent of all ballots. According to the Baseball Hall of Fame Tracker, Schilling is polling at around 71 percent of all the publicly released ballots and needs 162 more votes to make it.

Local people know who they are, when they go for groceries and everything else,  Trump said after being asked about Ross  statements.  And I think what Wilbur was probably trying to say is that they will work along. what pic.twitter.com/hBtyc7IqIDThe president noted that he hadn t heard Ross  comments himself and that  perhaps he should have said it differently.  But Trump defended the man and said that banks were also  working along  with those facing financial hardship during the shutdown,  and that s what happens in a time like this.  If you have mortgages, the mortgagees, the folks collecting the interest and all of those things, they work along,  Trump said.Ross has drawn fierce criticism for his remarks Thursday on CNBC that the media were forgetting people were  eventually going to be paid.  He said he didn t  really quite understand why  some people would have to rely on food banks. He also discounted the scope of those affected by the shutdown, alluding that the number of people only represented a fraction of the nation s financial output. Put it in perspective: You re talking about 800,000 workers, and while I feel sorry for individuals who have hardship cases, 800,000 workers, if they never got their pay, which is not the case, they will eventually get it, but if they never got it, you re talking about a third of a percent on our GDP. So it s not like it s a gigantic number overall. Ross, who also suggested that workers could simply take out loans to cover their expenses, is worth an estimated $700 million.The pair s comments fall in stark contrast to widespread reports of federal employees struggling to make ends meet. Workers are expected to miss their second paycheck of the year on Friday after Congress failed to pass any legislation meant to end the shutdown this week. An end to the impasse still appears to be far off.The commerce secretary s statements drew swift rebukes from congressional Democrats, who accused Ross of espousing the  21st century equivalent of  Let them eat cake.   Many federal employees live paycheck to paycheck,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday on the Senate floor.  Secretary Ross, they just can t call their stockbroker and ask them to sell some of their shares. They need that paycheck. The last thing federal workers need right now is the Trump Administration s  let them eat cake  attitude. #EndTheShutdown pic.twitter.com/h2FgHoaYG7Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

However, many staffers are reportedly skipping work, which could mean a delay.According to The Washington Post, hundreds of IRS employees have been granted absences due to financial hardship, and their union said that an organized protest could cause even more workers to stay home.With the shutdown dragging into its second month, National Treasury Employees Union President Tony Reardon demanded that the government figure out a way to help the IRS workers. Federal employees are about to miss their second paycheck and they are growing increasingly desperate,  Reardon said in a statement on Tuesday.  The suffering of thousands of middle-class working families has to end, and it has to end now. Reardon also said it was  grossly unfair that federal employees are the pawns in someone else s fight,  adding that  the situation is dire.  The Senate is expected to vote on Thursday on two competing plans to reopen the government. One bill is backed by Democrats and the other is backed by the GOP, yet both are almost certain to fail, leaving no clear end in sight to the shutdown.

This president and his administration continue to do incredible things for our country,  Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel said at its winter meeting. Republicans lost 40 seats and control of the House of Representatives last November and picked up just two seats in the Senate despite having the most favorable map in decades.McDaniel, however, spun the elections as a success for the party.  We minimized our losses in the House, in the face of a record 43 retirements,  she said   but failed to mention that many of the retirements took place because Republican members felt they could not win because of Trump s unpopularity.In her remarks, she did not mention Friday morning s indictment of former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone, but did refer to what she called  manufactured scandals and baseless allegations  against Trump.The indictment in the case, referred by special counsel Robert Mueller s office, states that Stone was in contact with a senior official of the Trump campaign in the final months of the 2016 presidential race regarding the release of stolen Hillary Clinton campaign emails. The U.S. intelligence community has stated that the emails were stolen by Russian spy agencies and passed along to WikiLeaks for release.Trump spent the final month of the campaign praising WikiLeaks at his rallies and telling his supporters to read the emails   even though the Department of Homeland Security and the director of national intelligence on Oct. 7 stated that WikiLeaks was acting in concert with Russia. We love WikiLeaks!  Trump said frequently.Shortly before her speech, McDaniel said she had not read or seen any news coverage about Stone s indictment and could not comment on it. Many other RNC members gathered at the Hyatt Tamaya resort outside Albuquerque also said they did not know much about the indictment. I haven t read it yet,  said Ron Kaufman, a longtime RNC member from Massachusetts.  I can t comment on something I haven t read. The RNC did, however, unanimously pass a resolution offering  its undivided support for President Donald J. Trump and his effective presidency. The statement of support, though, does not mean the RNC is locked into backing Trump against any challengers in a primary, particularly if the Mueller investigation winds up causing legal troubles for Trump or his family, Ohio RNC member Jim Dicke said. Actually these resolutions have no meaning,  he said, adding that it was done only because some members particularly supportive of Trump wanted to express that.  What are the rest of us supposed to do? Say,  No, we don t ? Dicke also said that an indictment that draws a connection between Trump s campaign and WikiLeaks was a significant development.  This is a big deal,  he said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Last week, she asked the president to delay the speech or to deliver it in written form, citing security concerns due to the government shutdown.As House speaker, Pelosi can dictate whether a resolution to convene a joint session comes up for a vote in the House. Without a joint session, the president wouldn t be able to deliver his address on the House floor.The president can technically enter the House chamber at any time, but as McClatchy reporter Emma Dumain noted, there might not be anyone else there, and C-SPAN wouldn t be present to broadcast the address to the American public.Pelosi s request last week to postpone the speech sparked heated debate between the president and congressional Democrats, as well as speculation about how Trump might respond.Despite several reports this week that the president was considering delivering the address at an alternate location, or even turning it into a rally, it quickly became apparent Trump planned to move forward with an address at the Capitol as planned. In his letter on Wednesday, the president noted that Pelosi s original invitation to deliver the speech came two weeks after the start of the shutdown, which began on Dec. 22. Pelosi responded that, at the time,  there was no thought that the government would still be shut down  by the end of the month.Trump also said he had received word from the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Secret Service that security wouldn t be an issue at the event. Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of the Union,  Trump wrote.The president said he looked forward to seeing the House speaker for the address on Jan. 29, writing,  It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location! But Pelosi said she would welcome Trump to the Capitol  on a mutually agreeable date for this address when the government has opened.

He has typically chosen to speak with networks that tend to give him more generous coverage, such as Fox News.Trump taped an interview with then-Fox News personality Bill O Reilly before the 2017 Super Bowl, and it aired on Fox s broadcast network as part of its telecast of the game. But last year, White House officials turned down the invitation from NBC, which Trump has frequently attacked.NBC News had last conducted a sit-down interview with Trump in May 2017, after his abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey.

The interview raised questions about whether Trump had obstructed justice by firing Comey amid the FBI s investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia.Trump has turned the game into red meat for his base by creating friction with the NFL, as he has regularly lashed out against players who have protested racism and police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem at games. Colin Kaepernick started the gesture in 2016, while he was with the San Francisco 49ers.The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!#StandForOurAnthemTrump famously said at a 2017 rally that NFL owners should  get that son of a bitch off the field,  referring to players who protest, and called on NFL fans to boycott games.Obama participated in the pregame interview each year of his presidency, answering rapid-fire questions about the game and his family s Super Bowl traditions, as well as topics in the news. Obama was interviewed by O Reilly in 2011 and 2014, with the latter exchange getting particularly heated."

His return-to-greatness vision came as he and the Fox panel blasted Obamacare as a freebie for those who  don t want to work.  Obamacare isn t free, and recipients pay premiums. You know what solves it?  Trump asked, referring to Obamacare.  When the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and everything is a disaster   then you ll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great. Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in December:  I ll be proud to shut down the government for border security.  He subsequently refused to sign a federal spending bill unless he was allocated $5.7 billion to begin work on his border wall. On Thursday, a joint statement from unions representing pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers said the risk to air safety of the partial government shutdown was incalculable  and   unprecedented.

Democrats have steadfastly denied his demand, calling the wall ineffective and immoral.Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been furloughed or, if deemed essential, continue to work without pay.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) offered a bleak prediction earlier this month if Trump were to give in to Democrats on the government shutdown and his border wall.  That s probably the end of his presidency,  Graham declared to Sean Hannity on Fox News. He s not going to sign a bill that doesn t have money for the wall,  Graham vowed on Jan. 2, just over a week into the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. I ll tell you exactly how this is going to end. The president is going to challenge the Democrats to compromise, and if they continue to say no, they re going to pay a price with the American people. ... If he gives in now, that s the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective president. That s probably the end of his presidency. Trump s agreement Friday to reopen the government in exchange for $0 for his wall isn t the end of negotiations, but he appears to have little left to bargain with in a face-off with empowered Democrats. He failed to win an allocation for his wall last year when the GOP was in charge of both the Senate and the House. Trump tweeted defensively Saturday morning that his decision  was in no way a concession. Graham tried to put the best spin on the latest development. He called it the  last best chance to take a major step toward fixing broken borders,  adding:  Thank you Mr. President. Hope Congress - in a bipartisan fashion - will work with the President and take advantage of this moment.  Last best chance to take a major step toward fixing broken borders and a broken immigration system. Thank you Mr. President.  Let s make this a win-win for America!Twitter reminded Graham of his prediction   and that the president gained no new ground with the shutdown.I thought this was the end of his Presidency?You guys passed a spending bill 100-0. The President refused to sign it. This whole thing was completely pointless.What are you thanking the President for....... this is the same deal he rejected 35 days and 800,000 American families  withheld paychecks ago.No wall.

New FBI recruits just starting their careers through their training at Quantico, Virginia, have never received a paycheck. The FBI SWAT team can t purchase critical gear. Some FBI employees are unable to put food on the table and are relying on food banks that FBI field offices have set up across the country. A new report from the FBI Agents Association, an outside organization that advocates for bureau employees, lays out the effects of the partial government shutdown on the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Thomas O Connor, the president of the group, held a press conference on Tuesday to call attention to the shutdown s impact on FBI employees and the need to fund the bureau. We are a motivated, professional, and patriotic lot, as you know, but we do have to make our bills like every other American   red, blue, green, or otherwise,  one 22-year FBI veteran said in the report.  Notwithstanding the obvious ... financial duress, there is also a very real impact on morale for us all.  The demoralization of employees is impacting operations because employees now have a significant point of stress distracting them as they perform their normal duties,  said another FBI employee.An agent whose wife is battling Stage 2 breast cancer is worried about being able to financially survive the shutdown and said he was  angry at the unnecessary stress this shutdown is putting on my wife who just survived cancer and my 9-year-old son. Two FBI employees who recently bought their first home in a new city can t afford their mortgage.  We contacted our lender, and they are refusing to work with us,  the FBI employee said.  They don t want our  Hardship Letter,  they want money, period. Another employee of 24 years whose wife is battling terminal cancer said they ve had to reach out for assistance from family and friends for the first time in his career. I am proud to be an Agent, proud to serve my country, and willing to sacrifice my life in defense of the people and the Constitution, but to have my family placed in the financial situation we are currently facing due to partisan politics is disgusting to me as a government employee and a citizen,  the agent said in the report. While President Donald Trump has used the threat of MS-13 as justification for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, the shutdown has affected investigations into the gang, according to one FBI employee. The employee said the bureau had been working an investigation into MS-13 for three years and had indicted a number of members, but has not had a Spanish speaker in the division since the shutdown. We have several Spanish speaking informants,  the employee said.  We are only able to communicate using a three-way call with a linguist in another division. Bureau employees are limited in what kind of outside jobs they can take, and already work long hours in often stressful jobs. O Connor credited FBI leadership with being flexible about the $3,000 cap on outside employment <U+2015> the FBI s shutdown Q&A page says  flexibility is warranted  with regard to the limit, given the unusual situation. But O Connor said FBI special agents shouldn t have to be contemplating part-time work to being with.  FBI agents should not have to go work at a store stocking shelves because they can t feed their families on their government job,  O Connor said.  When are they going to find time to go get that second job?  O Connor also worried about the long-term impact on the bureau s ability to attract talent, given that new recruits at the FBI Academy at Quantico still haven t received their first paycheck from the government. These people leave other jobs, many times taking a pay cut to join government service, they leave their families at home and they come to Quantico and they spend months at training. How long can you leave your family at home with your spouse and children, taking care of your family while you re away doing your job and becoming an FBI agent, and you have no money to pay for mortgage, food, medical, anything that you need?  O Connor asked.  Brand new agents, at an entry level, are getting nothing and have gotten nothing. An FBI employee in the central region said in the report that an incoming FBI agent may move in with him and his wife to save money.  We have a robust food bank going and hosted 200 federal employees for a free potluck lunch this week,  the FBI employee said.  We have a free breakfast planned for next week.  Another employee said that the  distraction of worrying about making ends meet is in the back of their minds.  I ve always prided myself on being able to pay my bills on-time and in-full. The fact that I can no longer do that is humiliating and degrading,  said one FBI agent from the southeast region.  Like many of my fellow agents, I took a sizable pay cut to come to serve my country as an FBI special agent. I accepted this position because I wanted to serve the cause of justice instead of clients. The idea that I d be forced to work without a paycheck or the ability to provide to my family was unthinkable to me when I made that decision to work here. O Connor said that he and his wife, who is also an agent, delivered an entire truckload of donated food to their office last night for an FBI employee in need.  Phenomenal,  O Connor said of the donations from citizens.  Also, I can t believe it s happening. HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

There are reports that there are some federal workers who are going to homeless shelters to get food,  host Andrew Ross Sorkin said. Well, I know they are but I don t really quite understand why because ... the obligations that they would undertake say borrowing from the bank or credit union are in effect federally guaranteed,  Ross responded.  So the 30 days of pay which some people will be out <U+2015> there s no real reason why they shouldn t be able to get a loan against it.

Asked about Karp s comments, Ross called them  hyperbole  and claimed 800,000 federal workers going without pay wouldn t hurt the overall gross domestic product that badly. I think that s a great deal of hyperbole,  Ross told CNBC.  Put it in perspective: You re talking about 800,000 workers and while I feel sorry for individuals who have hardship cases, 800,000 workers if they never got their pay <U+2015> which is not the case they will eventually get it <U+2015> but if they never got it, you re talking about a third of the percent on our GDP. So it s not like it s a gigantic number overall. WILBUR ROSS downplays 800k workers missing checks as  a third of a percent on our GDP. So it s just like it s a gigantic number.

A joint statement released Wednesday by the presidents of the National Air Traffic Controller s Association (NATCA), Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) and the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA warned of the incalculable risk to the safety and security of airlines and travelers.  This is already the longest government shutdown in the history of the United States and there is no end in sight,  the union leaders said.  In our risk averse industry, we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break. It is unprecedented. On Day 33 of this senseless #shutdown @ALPAPresident Capt. Joe DePete, #NATCA Pres @PaulRinaldi & @afa_cwa s @FlyingWithSara Nelson issued a joint statement that details growing safety concerns in the US #aviation system caused by the shutdown. Read here: https://t.co/MdD4KmYWrTUrging  Congress and the White House to take all necessary steps to end this shutdown immediately,  the union leaders said that they found it  unconscionable that aviation professionals are being asked to work without pay and in an air safety environment that is deteriorating by the day. Speaking to CNN s Chris Cuomo on Wednesday night, NATCA President Paul Rinaldi said that he had not intended  to put fear into anybody  when the statement was issued but that his concerns were both deep and real. He warned that air traffic controllers  in many of our busy facilities across the country  were currently working six 10-hour days a week due to a  staffing crisis  that has been exacerbated by the shutdown.  The government needs to open now,  he said.  Our national airspace system is an economic engine for this country. $1.5 trillion in gross domestic product yearly, 11 million well-paying jobs, and it moves packages and people from all over the world. We cannot allow this to be reduced by 50 percent. It s going to affect everyone from Wall Street to Main Street. President of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association @PaulRinaldi warns of dire consequences to the nation s air safety if the shutdown continues. https://t.co/lKufcYIIgj pic.twitter.com/Y5Z47MwJP3Earlier this month, air traffic controllers became the third group of federal employees to sue the Trump administration over the shutdown. The NATCA filed a lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order against the federal government, alleging it had violated the Fifth Amendment by depriving controllers of  hard-earned compensation without the requisite due process.

What about all of those contractors who don t necessarily have job guarantees?  Brennan asked Mulvaney.  Are they going to be made full? But Mulvaney breezed past the plight of contractors in his response, noting that the roughly 800,000 federal employees stung by the shutdown would likely receive retroactive pay in the coming days. Uh, the contractors will depend on the contract and, um, let s talk about the (government) employees for a second because I know a little bit more about that,  Muvlaney said. Some of them could be early this week,  he said of back pay for federal employees.  Some of them may be later this week. But we hope that by the end of this week all of the back pay will be made up. And, of course, the next payroll will go out on time. .@MickMulvaneyOMB on when federal employees can expect to be paid:  Some of them could be early this week.

But most government-contracted workers usually aren t as lucky.It s unclear how many contracted workers <U+2015> employed in a range of occupations, including food services, janitorial, security and computer software development <U+2015> were impacted by the recent shutdown. Estimates range from hundreds of thousands to millions.President Donald Trump and other high-ranking officials downplayed the shutdown s effects on Americans, pointing out that federal employees would eventually receive back pay.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday said he didn t  quite understand  why some workers needed to rely on food pantries during the shutdown <U+2015> the longest such closure in U.S. history <U+2015> when they could just take out loans until the government reopens and they receive their back pay.The Trump administration s tone-deaf statements also failed to acknowledge government-contracted workers who may never see the money they missed during the shutdown. The president signed a bill on Jan. 16 that guarantees back pay for federal employees at  the earliest date possible  once the government reopens, but the legislation did not extend protections to contractors <U+2015> many of whom are low-income earners.After vowing to veto a spending bill that would reopen federal agencies hit by the shutdown if it did not include $5.7 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, Trump caved to Democrats on Friday and signed a measure to keep the government open for three weeks.He has vowed to continue his push for wall funding during this period and, if again stymied, unilaterally move forward with erecting the barrier by declaring it s needed for national security reasons. If we don t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on Feb. 15, again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and Constitution of the United States to address this emergency,  he said Friday.Mulvaney on Sunday said he believes Trump is prepared to shut down the government again if his demands aren t met. He s willing to do whatever it takes to secure the border,  Mulvaney said.  He doesn t want to shut the government down <U+2015> let s make that very clear.

The bill, which also calls for major changes the would restrict asylum laws for Central American minors, is likely to get little or no Democratic support. Under the McConnell-Schumer deal, the Senate will also vote Thursday on a House-passed bill that would provide funding to re-open all parts of the government until Feb. 8 while congressional leaders and Trump focus on trying to reach an accord on border security issues. This measure is unlikely to get enough Republican support because it does not include funding for Trump s border wall, which as a candidate he promised Mexico would pay for.Only 10 GOP senators signed a bipartisan letter earlier this month calling on Trump to reopen the government with a similar short-term measure while negotiations over the border issues proceed. That s short of the 13 Republicans needed to advance the measure, assuming all 47 members of the Senate Democratic caucus support it. The GOP s Senate leadership actively lobbied members against signing the letter.The purpose of Thursday s showdown may be more political than practical <U+2015> Anxious senators up for re-election in 2020 on both sides of the aisle would be able to tell constituents and federal workers they voted to re-open the government. McConnell in a Tuesday floor speech urged Democrats to  put country over party  and  take yes for an answer  by accepting Trump s offer, which the president announced over the weekend in a speech at the White House. McConnell called it the  only proposal currently before us that can be signed by the president and immediately re-open the government. Schumer, meanwhile, slammed Trump s proposal as  one-sided  and  harshly partisan,  adding in his floor speech that no Democrats were involved in discussions over it. He called the proposed changes to asylum law in the bill a  poison pill,  and said the measure is  going nowhere fast. The competing rhetoric that had little chance of resolving the shutdown that began on Dec. 22 occurred as some furloughed federal workers lined up at a food bank in downtown Washington, just blocks from the White House. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) compared that scene to something out of the Great Depression.The furloughed federal workers just keep coming and coming to the World Central Kitchen.

Congressman, do you think it s appropriate to fly first class while 57 TSA agents aren t being paid?  the person says to Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), in an apparent reference to the Transportation Security Administration s 57,000 employees, who are being required to work without pay. A tipster who asked to remain anonymous shared the video with HuffPost, which hasn t been able to identify the person who approached Davis. Davis remained silent, prompting the person to say,  Taking that as a yes.  Taxpayers paid for this flight? Fair enough,  he added.Members of Congress can have the government pay for regular flights to and from their home jurisdictions, as maintaining constituency contact is part of their job. Unlike the paychecks of TSA workers, as well as those of hundreds of thousands of other federal government workers affected by the shutdown, those paid flights do not go away during a government shutdown.Davis did not use his taxpayer-provided budget to purchase a first-class ticket and has never done so, his spokeswoman Ashley Phelps told HuffPost in an email.His office bought a regular coach ticket, but he was upgraded automatically because of his frequent flyer status, she added.  There was no additional cost to taxpayers. Accepting the upgrade is not a violation of anti-corruption rules because it s something available to any person who accrues a certain number of miles and wasn t offered exclusively to Davis because of his position as an elected representative, an ethics officer in the House, who asked to speak on background since the episode is not under any official investigation, told HuffPost.All the same, for someone with power over people s paychecks to enjoy a luxe experience amid mass economic disruption makes for a jarring sight.A photograph of Davis in the first class section of the plane made it into Politico s Playbook PM newsletter on Tuesday.Most of the GOP has stood with President Donald Trump during the shutdown, arguing that he s right to reject deals to reopen the government until he gets the funding he wants for his promised wall on the border with Mexico.Davis has frequently supported the party on the issue, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, and praised Trump s approach. But the congressman recently sided with Democrats on bills to reopen some agencies <U+2015> a nod, perhaps, to his political vulnerability, given his tight re-election in the 2018 midterms.This story has been updated with comment from an ethics officer in the House.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in the Oval Office in December, tweeted that Schumer  essentially uses Trump s narcissism    and  attempt at machismo    to  get him to say  I will shut it down.  Schumer  almost can t believe Trump is dim-witted enough to take the bait,  Conway added.  But of course Trump is.  Conway also praised Schumer for his  superhuman efforts to avoid bursting into laughter at Trump s imbecility. Trump told Schumer then that he would be  proud to shut down the government for border security.  The president added:  I will be the one to shut it down. I won t blame [Democrats] for it.  The president later refused to sign a federal spending bill because it didn t include $5.7 billion to begin work on his border wall. The impasse shut down part of the government and now is the longest shutdown in U.S. history. Trump is now referring to it as the  Schumer Shutdown. .@BillKristol So much better is the video, showing as it does Trump s attempt at machismo, along withp Schumer s superhuman efforts to avoid bursting into laughter at Trump s imbecility. https://t.co/JDN786HnwdIt really is something to watch.  Kudos, Senator, for keeping it together. Most people wouldn t have been able to do it. https://t.co/doiLOAnhqMThe long version of the video is even better. Sen. Schumer essentially uses Trump s narcissism to get him to say  I will shut it down,  and then almost can t believe Trump is dim-witted enough to take the bait. But of course Trump is. https://t.co/nzF1SAE3TSConway also quoted a 2017 BuzzFeed article that cited an unnamed White House official who noted that Trump isn t capable of playing the  sort of three-dimensional chess  strategy required in complex political situations.  More often than not he s just eating the pieces,  Conway said in quoting the official. The former [White House] official said he doesn t think Trump is playing  the sort of three-dimensional chess people ascribe to decisions like this. More often than not he s just eating the pieces.  https://t.co/hPZzS1kot3Conway s Twitter followers loved his tear.Your dinner table must be lit.And if I recall correctly, it was Trump s idea to have cameras in the room, while @SpeakerPelosi  and @SenSchumer wanted a more private setting.

This back and forth thing is just not credible,  Smith said.  The president said:  I m shutting down the government. I ll own the shutdown. I m proud to carry the mantle.  And he shut the government down. And that s that. Wallace replied:  Well, I mean it takes two to tango. Smith responded:  There s no tango here. The president said,  I m shutting the government down. Wallace argued Trump would  shut the government down unless they gave him funding for the wall, and they refused to give him funding for the wall. Both sides are party to this. Smith noted, however, how Democrats ran in part during the 2018 midterm campaign on a promise that Trump would not receive funding for his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. They won 40 seats plus in the House of Representatives and they re not giving him a wall,  Smith said, adding that Trump  can reopen it tomorrow just like he closed it down. It s all on him, isn t it? Check out the clip here:Shep: This back and forth thing is just not credible. The president said I m shutting down the government. I ll own the shut down.

But they were the first tangible signs of movement in a dispute that has caused a partial government shutdown, which Saturday entered its record 29th day.Trump s refusal to sign spending bills that lack the $5.7 billion he wants to start constructing that wall, which Democrats oppose, has prompted the shutdown.The White House declined to provide details late Friday about what the president would be announcing. But Trump was not expected to sign the national emergency declaration he s been threatening as an option to circumvent Congress, according to two people familiar with the planning.Instead, Trump was expected to propose the outlines of a new deal that the administration believes could potentially pave the way to an end to the shutdown, according to one of the people. They were not authorized to discuss the announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.The move, amid a shutdown that has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without paychecks, represents the first major overture by the president since Jan. 8, when he delivered an Oval Office address making the public case for his border wall. Democrats have said they will not negotiate until the government reopens, raising questions about how Trump might move the ball forward.Democrats were proposing $563 million to hire 75 more immigration judges, who currently face large backlogs processing cases, and $524 million to improve ports of entry in Calexico, California, and San Luis, Arizona, the Democratic House aide said. The money is to be added to spending bills, largely negotiated between the House and Senate, that the House plans to vote on next week.In addition, Democrats were working toward adding money for more border security personnel and for sensors and other technology to a separate bill financing the Department of Homeland Security, but no money for a wall or other physical barriers, the aide said.It was possible Democrats would unveil that measure next week as the cornerstone of their border security alternative to Trump s wall, the aide said.Earlier Friday, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who chairs the House Appropriations Committee s homeland security subcommittee, said in an interview that some Democrats were asking leaders,  What is our plan? The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn t authorized to discuss the details publicly. The Democrats  spending plans were first reported by The New York Times.In a video posted on his Twitter feed late Friday, Trump said both sides should  take the politics out of it  and  get to work  to  make a deal.  But he also repeated his warnings, saying:  We have to secure our southern border. If we don t do that, we re a very, very sad and foolish lot. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said only that Trump was  going to continue fighting for border security  and  going to continue looking for the solution  to end what the administration had repeatedly referred to as a  humanitarian and national security crisis at the border. While few would argue that a humanitarian crisis is unfolding at the U.S.-Mexico border, as the demand for entry by migrants and the Trump administration s hardline response overwhelm border resources, critics say Trump has dramatically exaggerated the security risks and argue that a wall would do little to solve existing problems.Trump will be speaking from the Diplomatic Room at 3 p.m.Trump s Friday evening tweeted announcement came after Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Friday canceled her plans to travel by commercial plane to visit U.S. troops in Afghanistan, saying Trump had caused a security risk by talking about the trip.The White House said there was no such leak.It was the latest turn   and potentially the most dangerous   in the high-stakes brinkmanship between Trump and Pelosi that has been playing out against the stalled negotiations over how to end the partial government shutdown.And it showed once again the willingness of the former hard-charging businessman to hit hard when challenged.It was an unusually combative week between the executive and legislative branches.Tensions flared when Pelosi suggested Trump postpone the annual State of the Union address, a grand Washington tradition   and a platform for his border wall fight with Democrats   that was tentatively scheduled for Jan. 29.Trump never responded directly. Instead, he abruptly canceled Pelosi s military flight on Thursday, hours before she and a congressional delegation were to depart for Afghanistan on the previously undisclosed visit to U.S. troops.Trump belittled the trip as a  public relations event    even though he had just made a similar stop in a conflict zone during the shutdown   and said it would be best if Pelosi remained in Washington to negotiate to reopen the government.Pelosi, undeterred, quietly began making her own preparations for the overseas trip.But on Friday, Pelosi said her plan to travel by commercial plane had been  leaked  by the White House. The administration leaked that we were traveling commercially,  Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol. She said it was  very irresponsible on the part of the president. She said the State Department told her  the president outing  the original trip made the scene on the ground in Afghanistan  more dangerous because it s a signal to the bad actors that we re coming. The White House said it had leaked nothing that would cause a security risk.Denying military aircraft to a senior lawmaker   let alone the speaker, who is second in line to the presidency after the vice president, traveling to a combat region   is very rare.Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California slammed Trump for revealing the closely held travel plan, calling it  completely and utterly irresponsible in every way. Some Republicans expressed frustration. Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted,  One sophomoric response does not deserve another.  He called Pelosi s State of the Union move  very irresponsible and blatantly political  but said Trump s reaction was  also inappropriate. ___Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann, Kevin Freking, Jon Lemire, Matthew Daly, Andy Taylor, Mary Clare Jalonick, Matt Lee, Lolita C.

I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over,  the president said on Twitter, noting that he was  not looking for an alternative venue for the SOTU Address because there is no venue that can compete with the history, tradition and importance of the House Chamber. As the Shutdown was going on, Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union Address. I agreed. She then changed her mind because of the Shutdown, suggesting a later date. This is her prerogative - I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over. I am not looking for an........alternative venue for the SOTU Address because there is no venue that can compete with the history, tradition and importance of the House Chamber. I look forward to giving a  great  State of the Union Address in the near future!Trump quickly moved to shift blame for the delayed event to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). She replied to the president s missives with a tweet of her own shortly before midnight, saying she hoped  by saying  near future  you mean you will support the House-passed package to #EndTheShutdown that the Senate will vote on tomorrow.  Please accept this proposal so we can re-open government, repay our federal workers and then negotiate our differences,  she concluded.Pelosi had initially requested the president delay the address amid the ongoing shutdown, which has stretched into its second month. About 800,000 federal workers have been affected and are set to miss their second paychecks of the year on Friday.The president later fired back at the suggestion, saying he would give his address as planned on Jan. 29. Pelosi issued her own rebuttal, saying she wouldn t take the steps to authorize the address until the government was reopened. I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President s State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened,  the speaker wrote to Trump.Trump appeared to capitulate to Pelosi s tactics on Wednesday, saying it was her  prerogative  to suggest a later date.This afternoon, I sent @realDonaldTrump a letter informing him that the House will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President s State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened. https://t.co/r1oad0xEAh pic.twitter.com/kGEbayx95uThe Senate is preparing to vote on two competing proposals to end the shutdown on Friday, one backed by Republicans and the other by Democrats. The GOP proposal would give Trump the $5.7 billion he s demanded for a wall along the southern border, while the other plan would reopen the government through Feb. 8 without a wall but allow for negotiations to continue while federal employees get back to work.Neither proposal is expected to get the 60 votes needed to advance, meaning the shutdown will likely drag on for at least another week.Trump has continued to heap criticism on Democrats, telling reporters this week that the party had  become radicalized.  However, House Democrats said they d be willing to up the budget for border security, possibly to the $5.7 billion level requested by the president, if the government could be reopened and those funds be used for measures other than a barrier.This article has been updated to include a response from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

I don t think Federal employees are getting enough love and support, in these tough times, we want to extend the offer of a donation of medical cannabis to any Federal worker affected by the shutdown,  BudTrader CEO Brad McLaughlin said in the release.  We only hope our actions inspire larger companies to also try and help Federal employees affected by the shutdown. People who might qualify for the donations of dank should email support@budtrader.com.A company spokesperson told HuffPost that federal employees need to show proof they have indeed been furloughed, and said BudTrader staffers are looking at social media pages for verification as well.The website expects to fulfill any requests with the help of network of dispensaries all over North America.In addition, the spokesperson said at least five cannabis doctors have offered to consult with furloughed federal employees who might need a medical marijuana prescription.So far, federal employees aren t exactly coming out of the weeds looking for free pot.The spokesperson said only two federal employees have shown up at the company s San Diego-area headquarters since the announcement was made on Tuesday.One of those visitors got a vape pen while the other, a woman with a rescue dog currently on Prozac, received CBD doggy treats in lieu of the prescription medicine she can t afford for the pooch.Of course, there may be a good reason why the federal workers may not be attempting to score the free sensimilla.Federal law currently prohibits government employees from using marijuana, even in states that have legalized the drug.

As you may have heard, Drakes Beach is under new management,  Point Reyes National Seashore wrote on Facebook on Friday afternoon.  Elephant seals have taken over!!! The post said that while the beach would remain closed to humans this weekend  at the direction of the new management,  the nearby road and parking lot would be open during the day for elephant seal viewing.Earlier this week, SFGate reported that around 50 to 60 adult elephant seals had made themselves comfortable on the beach and around 35 pups had been born. The seals also plowed through a fence to spill out into the adjacent parking area.They did this all while wildlife management staffers were furloughed because of the government shutdown.John Dell Osso, chief of interpretation and resource education at Point Reyes National Seashore, told Vice that if the shutdown hadn t been underway, staffers would have been around to discourage the seals from congregating in the area, likely using tarps and waving at them to move off.But now that pups have arrived, it s best for the seals that they be allowed to stay, at least for a while. They re at a critical time: the pups have been born there, they re nursing,  Dell Osso told The Guardian.  We re not going to disrupt that process. The seals won t remain on the beach forever, though.  Pups usually wean from their mothers in late March - early April,  Dell Osso told HuffPost in an email.  So our best guess is by sometime in April, most of the elephant seals will disperse. This story has been updated with an additional comment from John Dell Osso."

The stories are becoming more desperate,  Victor Blackwell told audiences on Saturday morning s  New Day  broadcast.  People are pawning their wedding rings to pay rent, deciding between buying medicine and paying the power bill, selling their Christmas presents to make ends meet, to buy food. While Blackwell noted that he s fortunate to never have been without a paycheck, as furloughed federal workers are, he admitted that when he was younger and earning less money, times were tough. I know what it feels like to open the refrigerator and there s nothing but condiments and ice, to hope that it s someone s birthday at work the next day and there s a potluck so you can have lunch tomorrow,  he said. No working person, especially not people who work for us, who work for the American people, should have to struggle the way that federal workers are right now. That s when Blackwell announced,  I m going to do something that I ve never done,  promoting a local Atlanta food bank to which he d donated, and calling for viewers to do the same in their own communities.He s accompanying the initiative with a #ShutdownHunger hashtag on social media to help spread the word.The shutdown, which is nearing its second month, has left thousands of federal staffers either out of work or forced to show up without pay, impacting some 800,000 people, according to The Washington Post.On Saturday, Capital Area Food Bank told the outlet it had assisted 1,140 federal employees that day alone across eight locations in the Virginia area just outside Washington, D.C."

Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) spoke out against the move, arguing it was unjustifiably wrong.In a Fox News interview Sunday, the senator told anchor Maria Bartiromo that there was no good excuse for the five-week disruption in federal agencies across the nation. <U+2033>We should never ever close the government down as a bargaining chip in a budget negotiation, whether it s border security or Planned Parenthood or military funding or anything else,  Alexander said.Although the government is set to reopen, giving both sides of the aisle three weeks to come to an agreement regarding President Donald Trump s demands for more than $5 billion for the wall, Alexander remained confident, stating  we should  see funding by the Feb. 15 deadline.He also pointed out that the partial wall existed long before Trump s presidency, painting the president s efforts as a reasonable goal to shore up security, despite many Democrats  feelings it is both a waste of money and a representation of xenophobia.The solution, Alexander maintained, was cutting out Speaker Nancy Pelosi s (D-Calif.) influence. We need to get it out of the speaker s hands and the public debate and into the hands of members of Congress who have for 20 years known that a comprehensive border security plan includes more personnel, more technology and more physical barrier,  he said.Trump s request is to extend the wall by more than 200 miles, Alexander pointed out, noting it  would not build a wall from shining sea to shining sea as he said. As the clock ticks on negotiations, key Democrats, including Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, have offered no indication they ll waver in their opposition to the funding proposal.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Contrary to popular belief, the pay is not high, particularly at the entry-level pay grades. In fact, the base pay of more than 14,000 junior members of the Coast Guard (which is about one-third of the active-duty workforce) is considered at or just below the established poverty level. Most of these members do not have the resources to go without pay over any extended period of time. They don t deserve to have their pay held hostage by their own government leadership,  the former officers wrote.The four writers <U+2015> Rick Trent, Vincent Patton, Frank Welch and Skip Bowen <U+2015> held the post of master chief petty officer of the Coast Guard, the service s senior enlisted member, one after the other from 1994 to 2010.On Thursday, a former Coast Guard commandant also berated President Donald Trump and Congress over the shutdown, calling the budget impasse  disgraceful  and  insulting  to those working without pay.

A State Department spokesperson confirmed to HuffPost on Tuesday that the conference had been postponed as a result of the shutdown. In light of the very limited funding available during the lapse in appropriations, the Department will exercise judicious use of limited, remaining resources,  the spokesperson said in an email.The conference typically brings together roughly  270 export control and border security practitioners from 85 partner countries involved in dual-use and conventional arms policy, licensing, and enforcement to promote the development of effective strategic trade management and counter proliferation measures,  the spokesperson said. The Export Control and Related Border Security Program, which operates within the Office of Export Control Cooperation, works primarily to prevent the proliferation and transfer of arms, including weapons of mass destruction, across borders, according to the State Department website.Trump has proclaimed border security to be a top priority of his administration, demanding that Congress agree to $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats in the House have agreed to fund up to $1.3 billion in fence maintenance and other border security measures.The Senate is set to vote later this week on competing measures to reopen the government<U+2015> one put forth by Republicans, the other by Democrats, neither of which is expected to pass.The partial shutdown is now in its fifth week and has left some 800,000 federal employees either furloughed or working without pay.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Trump announced earlier this month that he would not personally attend the conference, as he did last year, but senior administration officials said at the time that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was still likely to lead a U.S. delegation to the forum starting Jan. 22. The announcement comes hours after Trump told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that he was canceling her delegation trip overseas amid their scuffle over postponing his State of the Union address.

FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who shares regular updates on Twitter, said that furloughed workers were being recalled to do their jobs unpaid.On Jan. 16, Gottlieb tweeted an update, saying a bill had been signed into law that would  guarantee that federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay will be compensated for the period of funding lapse. Most of the foods affected by the inspection delays are low-risk foods that aren t typically the cause of foodborne illnesses. Instead, FDA workers have been conducting regular inspections on  high risk  foods, which make up about 31 percent of the agency s workload. Here s the list of foods that are still being inspected:Modified atmosphere packaged products; acidified and low acid canned foods; seafood; custard filled bakery products; dairy products including soft, semi-soft, soft ripened cheese and cheese products, unpasteurized juices; sprouts ready-to-eat; fresh fruits and vegetables and processed fruits and vegetables; spices; shell eggs; sandwiches; prepared salads; infant formula; and medical foods.The FDA defines a foodborne illness, of which there are 48 million cases a year in the U.S., as a reaction to consuming food contaminated with pathogens, chemicals or toxins. Essentially, foods deemed to be at highest risk of carrying foodborne illnesses are still being regularly inspected. This could change, however, so it s important to check Gottlieb s Twitter account, which posts frequent updates.Regardless of the FDA s rate of food inspections, it s always a good idea to practice the agency s food safety guidelines when cooking at home.

Federal employees will get back pay  very quickly or as soon as possible,  he said. Shortly after the announcement, the Senate and House both passed a resolution to reopen the government through that date.The announcement comes on the 35th day of the longest shutdown in United States history and is a clear cave by Trump, whose impasse over the budget stems from his demands for $5.7 billion in funds for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border <U+2015> a project Democratic lawmakers say is a firm deal-breaker.Dem Hill source:  There is a tentative agreement between Congress and White House to do a 3-week CR+ a vehicle to go to conference to debate DHS bill / border security, with the caveat that nothing is final until the President signs it. If funding for his border wall is not secured by the end of the negotiation period, Trump said he is prepared to shut down the government again or issue a national emergency declaration in order to get funding <U+2015> a plan that would strip funding from disaster recovery efforts.Throughout the shutdown, Trump s reputation has suffered across parties as airports have grappled with severe delays and federal workers have gone without paychecks, putting many at risk of losing their homes, defaulting on loans and missing other crucial payments. Trump s statement comes a day after the Senate failed to pass his proposal to reopen the government with border wall funding in exchange for temporary legal protection for some undocumented immigrants.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was in the middle of a roundtable with Capitol Hill reporters when reports began surfacing of Trump s support for a short-term government funding bill. She was mum on whether she considered his proposal a final deal. We re going in that direction but we re not to that place,  said Pelosi.  I m hopeful. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke on the Senate floor shortly after Trump s announcement, congratulating lawmakers on the development. The solution to this impasse was to separate funding the government from our disagreements over border security,  Schumer said, adding that  we can never hold American workers hostage again. Trump spent most of his speech on Friday rehashing his usual talking points about crime at the border.  We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or a steel barrier,  he said.This story has been updated with more details.Jen Bendery contributed reporting.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

A Democratic bill that would have provided funding to reopen all parts of the government until Feb. 8 while congressional leaders and Trump focus on trying to reach an accord on border security issues also failed to pass, 52 to 44. Six Republicans bucked the president and voted for the measure: Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Susan Collins (Maine), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Johnny Isakson (Ga.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Mitt Romney (Utah). Both measures fell short of the 60-vote threshold to advance.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), the only Democrat who supported both proposals, said he did so because they represented  a start to finding a way to reopen  the government.Roughly a quarter of the government has been shut down since Dec. 22, after Trump refused to sign any appropriations bill that didn t include funding for the border wall. The consequences of the showdown have been mounting for 800,000 federal workers forced off the job, with many struggling to pay rent and other bills after missing paychecks.A top Trump adviser warned this week that the economy may show no growth in the first quarter if the shutdown lasts much longer. Democrats say they oppose building the wall   which Trump as a candidate promised Mexico would pay for   because it would be an ineffective deterrent against unauthorized immigration. They also argue that giving in to the president now would simply legitimize the tactic of shutting down the government over policy disagreements in future budget fights.Republicans, meanwhile, say additional barriers on the border are common-sense and needed. They also point out that congressional Democrats have agreed many times to fund construction of barriers on the border <U+2015> under Republican and Democratic administrations. It s unclear what, if anything, Thursday s votes accomplished.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in his office Thursday afternoon to discuss a way forward that involves reopening the government for three weeks while both sides continue talking over border security. The 30-minute discussion between two leaders followed weeks of competing rhetoric on the Senate floor, leading some observers to believe that a breakthrough on the shutdown was near.But the idea quickly ran into opposition from the White House, which insisted in a statement on Thursday that any short-term measure reopening the government include a  large down payment  on the wall.Senate Democrats, meanwhile, said they could not support the idea of giving Trump funds for his border wall unless he reopens the government first. What does he hold workers  wages hostage for next? How many times will he try to hold wages hostage?  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) told reporters on Thursday.Meanwhile, Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) haven t spoken in weeks <U+2015> save for a sharp exchange of letters about postponing the president s annual State of the Union address because of the shutdown.Pelosi on Thursday similarly shot down the latest White House proposal to fund the wall. That is not a reasonable agreement between senators,  Pelosi said on the House floor. A group of House Democrats are working on a package that would meet Trump s request of $5.7 billion but only for border security measures other than a wall, such as technology, more agents and measures intended to fortify ports of entry. It s unclear if he would accept such a proposal, but the legislation would allow some anxious Democrats to say they are negotiating with the president in good faith and trying to reopen the government.This story has been updated throughout.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

They also agree that security at the border must be bolstered. But the bipartisan group, which includes some of the most senior members in the House and Senate, reached few other groundbreaking conclusions during their first meeting in the basement of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. After an initial exchange of pleasantries, the panelists retreated to familiar talking points in their opening statements about why President Donald Trump s proposed wall is <U+2015> or isn t <U+2015> needed on the border with Mexico. Today we re just touching gloves,  said Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), one of the few members of the group who represent a southwestern border district, at the start of the meeting.Under the agreement reached by Democrats and Trump last week <U+2015> a temporary accord that ended the 35-day partial government shutdown without any money for the wall <U+2015> a bicameral committee is tasked with reaching a broader border security deal. He said he was giving Democrats an opportunity to debate a measure he says is needed to lower crime and the influx of drugs across the border.On Wednesday, before the committee members even met, he signaled he was prepared to shut down the government again, tweeting that if the lawmakers are  not discussing or contemplating a Wall or Physical Barrier, they are Wasting their time! Democrats, meanwhile, reiterated that while they support enhancing security measures   including improvements to ports of entry, additional aircraft, vessels and Border Patrol agents   they oppose the construction of a wall on the border. Smart border security is not overly reliant on physical barriers, which the Trump administration has failed to demonstrate are cost effective compared to better technology and more personnel,  House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) said in her opening statement on Wednesday.She declined to say on Wednesday whether Democrats will ultimately support money for new barriers on the border, as Trump has demanded, however. Everything is on the table,  Lowey told reporters after the meeting.The chances of reaching a deal on border security will likely depend on discussions among congressional staffers that will occur behind closed doors and away from the glare of cameras. Among lawmakers who met Wednesday were some of the most experienced appropriators in Congress <U+2015> people who are used to hammering out deals and who have been doing so together in a bipartisan fashion for years. Technology is important, but I think some fences and some other things are important too,  Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), one of those people, told his colleagues at the meeting on Wednesday.Trump remains, as ever, the wild card in the negotiations, however. He has demonstrated time and time again the ability to blow up agreements reached by Congress <U+2015> most recently after criticism from conservative opinion leaders and radio talk show hosts. In December, for example, he refused to sign a continuing resolution funding the government after being blasted by immigration hawks like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh for not doing enough to build a wall he initially promised that Mexico would pay for.Even if Democrats agree on additional funding for some form of physical barrier on the border, like fencing, which they previously supported, it s unclear whether Trump will accept it, given his previous demands for a barrier made of concrete or steel. The White House is in the [conference meeting]. They ll be careful observers of what we do,  Shelby reminded reporters on Wednesday.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

In a new letter to tenants this week, the company said they can keep paying their original rent. An official with Tri-State Management told HuffPost on Wednesday that the company had received new information from the U.S. Department of Agriculture about the rural rental assistance program that subsidizes most of its tenants  rent. The official declined to share the new information. PREVIOUSLY: WASHINGTON <U+2015> Hundreds of low-income tenants at housing complexes in four states now face rent hikes thanks to the government shutdown.A property management company told the tenants in a letter this week that because of the shutdown, the federal government is no longer subsidizing their rent.  As of February 1, 2019, all tenants will be responsible for full basic rent,  said the letter, an image of which was tweeted Friday by a low-income housing advocate.The company, Tri-State Management, confirmed it sent the letter to tenants at 28 buildings in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Mississippi. Altogether, the apartments have 758 units, but it s not clear if all of the units received the letter.An official with Tri-State told HuffPost that eviction proceedings could begin if the shutdown continues past February.  I hope it doesn t come to that,  the official said.  I hope the government shutdown is over. If the shutdown continues into February, rent hikes and eviction threats will probably spread as more landlords get antsy. The letter follows a similar note that a different Arkansas landlord sent to 50 properties last week. The buildings are subsidized by a U.S. Department of Agriculture rental assistance program that supports 282,000 households nationwide, most of them with elderly residents. The agency said last week that rental assistance is funded through January.The federal government s bigger housing programs, run by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, are funded only through February. Those programs support more than 3 million households. President Donald Trump forced the shutdown of several federal agencies, including HUD and the USDA, to put pressure on Democrats to support $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall that he previously said Mexico would pay for. Democrats have refused to budge. The shutdown will get worse with time as 800,000 federal workers continue to miss checks, landlords miss rent and some 38 million Americans miss out on food benefits come March. Members of Congress have been aware that HUD had failed to renew some contracts with landlords before the shutdown, jeopardizing subsidies for tens of thousands of households. But the swift response of USDA landlords has seemingly caught lawmakers off guard.Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who has encouraged Trump to stand firm for his border wall and downplayed tales of shutdown woe, said he did not believe landlords could hike rent or threaten to evict their renters because of the government s incompetence.  On most [rental] agreements it doesn t give them the ability to do that,  Meadows said, echoing a common sentiment among the lawmakers HuffPost has interviewed. But housing subsidy recipients do not have ironclad protection, according to a legal analysis the National Housing Law Project released Friday. While HUD s regulation for landlords with Section 8 vouchers does not allow rent hikes or evictions if the government stops paying its share, it does allow them to evict tenants for  business or economic reasons,  such as wanting to lease an apartment for higher rent.And there are no clear protections for tenants with USDA rental assistance.  What owners may do in the event of a government shutdown is not set out in [USDA rental assistance] regulations,  according to the analysis.The NHLP said 17,000 households would lose their USDA rental subsidy in February, and all the rest would lose theirs in March.The USDA s program finances both the landlord s mortgage and covers part of the rent, with tenants usually required to pay 30 percent of their income. Landlords have told HuffPost they will struggle to pay for staff and maintenance without the government s portion of their rental income. Neither the USDA nor HUD have responded to requests for comment about the possibility of the shutdown causing evictions. Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said the USDA is  clearly not prioritizing  its affordable-housing programs for the poor and elderly.  The longer the shutdown continues, the more eviction threats we ll see for residents of this and other subsidized programs,  Yentel said.

Cupp unleashed a scathing rebuke of the president in a Saturday night monologue, advising him to accept that he s not going to win his battle for border wall money. This is what losing looks like, Mr. President,  she said.  You ve lost this one. You re not getting your $5.7 billion border wall <U+2015> not from Mexico, not from Congress and, I m willing to wager, not from taxpayers either. Trump s inability to strike a deal with Democrats for the money, Cupp argued, stemmed from his focus on  too much tweeting, too much rallying, not enough governing.   It s a shame too, because when you had the opportunity, the public support, Republicans in control of Congress, Democrats against the proverbial wall, you couldn t get it done,  she added. So now it s time to accept the loss and move on to what s next. Cupp then mocked the president s tweet earlier in the day when he again said he was almost alone in the White House, an assertion he also made on Christmas Eve, just days after the shutdown began.I just watched a Fake reporter from the Amazon Washington Post say the White House is  chaotic, there does not seem to be a strategy for this Shutdown. There is no plan.  The Fakes always like talking Chaos, there is NONE. In fact, there s almost nobody in the W.H. but me, and...Some potentially productive uses for Trump s  me time,  Cupp joked, could be meditation, yoga or maybe even a better way to organize his goals. How about a vision board where you paste pictures of all the things you d like to accomplish this year? I got you started. Here s a picture of a wall, and here s a picture of you signing a bill into law. Put those up on your vision board. "

Now, they re being told to get back on the job without pay.Thousands of staffers from agencies including the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Aviation Administration will be forced to start punching the clock again, according to announcements made Tuesday.Per its newly published shutdown plan, the IRS will recall about 46,000 workers as tax filing season looms less than two weeks away. The added employees mean nearly 60 percent of the workforce will be on duty, which will help tax refunds to get out on time, but without compensation for the workers bearing the burden.Meanwhile a revised Department of Transportation shutdown plan indicates more than 3,600 FAA employees are back on the job. That number was calculated using the DOT s initial plan released last month.In a statement released last week, the FAA called safety its  top priority,  adding that it is  allocating resources based on risk assessment to meet all safety critical functions.  If we identify an issue, we recall inspectors and engineers to address it. The shutdown is the longest in U.S. history, dragging into its third week with no end in sight as Democrats face off with the GOP over President Donald Trump s demands for more than $5 billion to build a border wall.On Tuesday, Trump invited moderate Democrats to a White House meeting only to be turned down once they began suspecting it was the president s attempt at a divide-and-conquer strategy to work a deal to pay for the wall.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said the IRS plans to recall 36,000 workers; it plans to bring back about 46,000.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

It provides food and toiletries and is geared toward unpaid Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Federal Aviation Administration employees, who are required to work during the shutdown because their positions are considered vital for safety. We re glad we re able to help,  airport spokeswoman Emily Nipps told HuffPost. She said that the food bank had about 60 visitors within less than two hours of opening and that many local residents have dropped off items to help.Nipps said airport operations have remained normal, with not much change in TSA staffing numbers. She added that she hopes providing help gives agents an incentive to keep going in to work.Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have been struggling to pay for basic necessities as the shutdown has reached its 24th day, making it the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, thanks to President Donald Trump s refusal to sign any appropriations bill that doesn t include $5.7 billion for a southwestern border wall. At least 800,000 federal employees around the country have been affected by the shutdown, missing their first paycheck on Jan. 11.

We appreciate all they do to keep our airport safe. pic.twitter.com/lHIJp6sU6dThe Tampa International Airport food bank will be open until Saturday, and workers can receive food assistance with a valid form of identification. The airport also teamed up with Hillsborough Area Regional Transit to provide 500 31-day bus passes to federal workers and is working with local electricity companies to help employees with their utility bills. We look at our TSA partners as a part of our TPA family and hope to help them during this time,  the airport tweeted on Friday, using its three-letter code.Food pantries and nonprofit organizations nationwide are working to help federal workers obtain basic needs. In its first two days, a pop-up food pantry in Boston helped serve about 400 families of members of the Coast Guard, the only military branch working without pay because it is under the Department of Homeland Security. Second Harvest Food Bank in Tennessee told the Knoxville News Sentinel that it sent nearly 100 emergency food packages to McGhee Tyson Airport after receiving an  unprecedented  request from the local American Federation of Government Employees union to provide them for the facility s TSA workers. We ve never had this type of request before,  Second Harvest spokeswoman Rhea Ennist told the newspaper.  We ve been called for environmental emergencies but never before for this type of event. Renowned chef and humanitarian JosÈ AndrÈs announced he will assist in food distribution by opening a World Central Kitchen feeding site in Washington, D.C., for unpaid federal workers. AndrÈs has a history of setting up feeding stations in times of need, including in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria and in Houston after severe flooding.Big news!

While I realize this is not what you are owed for your hard work during pay period 26 and what you deserve, I hope these actions alleviate some of the financial hardship many of you are facing.Roughly 800,000 federal employees are either furloughed or working without pay. Since TSA services are considered essential, more than 50,000 TSA agents are among those forced to remain on the job.However, a significant number have been calling out sick. According to a CBS News report, on Saturday, sick calls were up by 70 percent from the same day in 2018.Last week the TSA union sounded the alarm on staff reductions, noting that some employees are starting to quit and warning it could present  a massive security risk  for travelers.Despite the sick calls and departures, screening times have remained somewhat consistent across the country, CBS reported."

Make America work again,  protesters chanted. Some hoisted signs in the air that stated  Let me do my job  and  Will science 4 food.

Many employees of government contractors are also not working and they will likely never see retroactive pay.The TSA has reported a surge in airport screeners, who remain on the job without pay, taking  unscheduled absences  this week. About 7.6 percent of TSA employees didn t show up for work on Monday, compared with 3.2 percent on a comparable day a year ago. Monday marked the first business day after TSA staffers first missed paychecks due to the shutdown.Houston s George Bush Intercontinental Airport, roughly 45 miles north of the space center, had to close a security checkpoint on Sunday due to  staffing issues associated with the partial shutdown of the federal government.  The checkpoint remained closed as of Tuesday afternoon.Broussard-Guidry told HuffPost that she has endured several shutdowns in the decades she has served in the federal government, but this one feels different.Democrats and Republicans  are not even going to the table and talking this time,  she said.  That s what makes everyone so uneasy. Trump has promised to veto any spending bill that would re-open the impacted federal agencies if it does not include $5 billion to fund his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats have steadfastly rejected his request, calling his wall ineffective and unnecessary and noting that he has repeatedly vowed Mexico would pay for it.Broussard-Guidry blasted Trump for continuing the budget impasse over border wall funding and urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to call a vote on a proposed spending bill. This shutdown can t last for months and years as the president said. It s not good for anyone <U+2015> the economy, the employees, the American people <U+2015> no one,  Broussard-Guidry said.

Many of the TSA s workers have called in sick rather than go to work, although the agency said the effectiveness of its security screenings would not be compromised during the shutdown.Around 800,000 federal workers missed their first paychecks on Friday, although Congress passed a bill last week to grant back pay to those workers and the president has signaled that he will sign it. Sylvester Turner, the mayor of Houston, linked the closure on Sunday directly to the shutdown and urged travelers to venture to the airport at least two hours early to make it through screenings. Shortage of TSA workers, unpaid during the US gov t shutdown, is causing this change,  Turner wrote on Twitter. He said the B terminal was solely used by United Airlines flights.Advice to always get to @iah 2 hours before your flight is especially important today. Shortage of TSA workers, unpaid during the US gov t shutdown, is causing this change. Terminal B is solely @united flights. pic.twitter.com/ijCKa4k1NPLast week, the TSA Council president for the American Federation of Government Employees said that agency workers had been suffering extreme financial hardship during the shutdown and that some employees had already walked off the job.  Every day I m getting calls from my members about their extreme financial hardships and need for a paycheck,  Hydrick Thomas said in a statement.  Some of them have already quit and many are considering quitting the federal workforce because of this shutdown. The loss of officers, while we re already shorthanded, will create a massive security risk for American travelers since we don t have enough trainees in the pipeline or the ability to process new hires. The ongoing shutdown has stretched into its fourth week with no end in sight as President Donald Trump has remained steadfast in his demands for some $5.7 billion for a wall along the southern border. He has walked back from plans to declare a national emergency to do so without congressional approval, but Republicans and Democrats remain at an impasse as to how they can resolve the conflict.Miami International Airport made a similar move on Saturday, saying one of its checkpoints at a smaller terminal would close early each day.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The Coast Guard is the only branch of the military not being paid under the partial shutdown, but thousands of members doing many essential services are still expected to work. The Navy Federal Credit Union serves the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, veterans and civilian members of the Department of Defense. The Congressional Federal Credit Union and the U.S. Employees Credit Union, which serves federal workers and retirees, are also offering interest-free loans to eligible employees.Some banks are following suit, including the Cabrillo Credit Union in San Diego, which is loaning government employees their paycheck value interest-free until the shutdown is over. Federal employees they weren t expecting this,  Cabrillo CEO Jonathan Zide told KGTV.  The important thing is for us to help them through this in the different ways that we can. Alpine Bank in Colorado has set aside $5 million to help furloughed workers pay their rent and mortgages, The Aspen Times reports. The bank loans are among increasing aid becoming available for unpaid federal workers while they are squeezed by finances. Thousands of furloughed workers are going to food pantries across the nation, including pop-up distribution sites in the District of Columbia. If you re a federal employee or contractor impacted by the government shutdown, it is our honor to provide support during this time,  notes the website for the End Hunger project in Calvert County Maryland.Cities and counties are providing lists of services available to workers. But workers continue to struggle with childcare and healthcare costs, as well as with rent, mortgage and education expenses for their childrenThe partial shutdown, the longest in American history, doesn t appear anywhere close to a resolution. President Donald Trump is refusing to sign a spending bill if it doesn t include $5.7 billion for his border wall.An estimated 420,000 federal employees are working without pay, and roughly 380,000 have been furloughed.Trump insisted again in an interview Saturday with Fox News  Jeanine Pirro, without evidence, that  a lot  of the people  that aren t getting their checks are letting us know,  We don t care,   because they want the border wall. People can t call the White House switchboard to express their opinions about the matter because it has been closed during the shutdown.Trump was attacked Saturday by one of his biographers as a  trust fund baby  who has no idea what it means for workers to suddenly lose their pay   and in many cases still be ordered to work. He s a trust fund baby,  Tim O Brien, author of the 2005 book TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald, said on MSNBC.  He was born with a silver [spoon] in his mouth and has absolutely no empathy or understanding for what average people go through, confronting things like not able to buy groceries, pay a mortgage or the utilities bill.

Both have  critical departments hamstrung by furloughs,  she wrote.Today, I wrote to @realDonaldTrump recommending that we delay the State of the Union until after government re-opens, as the @SecretService, the lead federal agency for #SOTU security, faces its 26th day without funding. https://t.co/K2oL8WGvqo pic.twitter.com/g3fIlxDbbK Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government re-opens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has re-opened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on January 29th. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The annual State of the Union address is traditionally delivered by the president before a joint session of Congress in the House chamber at the invitation of the speaker. Hours after she was sworn in as House speaker on Jan. 3, Pelosi extended the invitation to Trump.Asked to clarify whether Pelosi s letter on Wednesday rescinds the invitation, a spokesman for the speaker said  the letter speaks for itself. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the State of the Union is considered a  national special security event  that demands  some of the most complex and logistically complicated protective operations undertaken by the Secret Service, often requiring anywhere from 3 to 18 months of planning.  Delaying a presidential address to a joint session of Congress is not without precedent. In 2011, then-President Barack Obama agreed to delay a special address to Congress at the request of then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), after Boehner argued that the last-minute event required more time for arranging security.This article has been updated to include comments from Pelosi s spokesman.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

I recognize the anxiety and uncertainty this situation places on you and your family, and we are working closely with service organizations on your behalf,  Schultz said.Schultz also revealed the United Services Automobile Association donated $15 million to the Coast Guard Mutual Assistance fund, which will be distributed to  military and civilian workforce requiring assistance.  The American Red Cross will assist with distributing the funds, according to Schultz.Today you will not be receiving your regularly scheduled paycheck.

An estimated 42,000 Coast Guard employees are forced to work without pay as the longest U.S. federal government shutdown continues. Overall, up to 88 percent of Homeland Security personnel are also working without pay.  It is also not lost on me that our dedicated civilians are already adjusting to a missed paycheck   we are confronting this challenge together,  Schultz said Tuesday.The American Red Cross Service to the Armed Forces (SAF) will be administering a program that will  provide financial support  to Coast Guard members who did not receive their scheduled paychecks during the shutdown, a spokesperson for the aid organization told HuffPost. For now, Coast Guard members can access this financial assistance by applying through the organization s Hero Care Center or calling 1-877-272-7337.President Donald Trump has been unable to convince Democrats in Congress to allocate $5.7 billion in the federal budget for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall. Democrats also won t budge from the $1.3 billion set aside for border security currently in the budget. Negotiations remain at a standstill, resulting in the 24-day-long shutdown.Since Dec. 22, when the shutdown began, an estimated 420,000 federal workers are being forced to work without pay, according to the Senate Committee on Appropriations.Schultz on Tuesday encouraged Coast Guard members to continue working with pride despite the stalled paychecks. You have proven time and again the ability to rise above adversity,  he said.  Stay the course, stand the watch, and serve with pride. You are not, and will not, be forgotten. Numerous organizations have stepped up to the plate to provide support to federal workers who in financial straits due to the shutdown. The Massachusetts Military Foundation last week set up a pop-up pantry for Coast Guard members and fed almost 400 families in its first two days, according to NPR.Stacey A. Benson, a Coast Guard spouse stationed in Astoria, Oregon, told HuffPost last week that local businesses in her community are offering support to active duty Coast Guard members through free dinners, coffee and services, including workout classes and haircuts.Benson noted that she and her family will be financially stable during the shutdown thanks to her full-time job at the military-focused the nonprofit Semper Fi Fund and their family s emergency savings. Still, she is concerned for others who might be having a more difficult time during the shutdown. As always, we are concerned for our Coast Guard community overall,  she told HuffPost last Thursday.

President Donald Trump eventually caved on his demand for more than $5 billion for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and announced a deal for the government to reopen for three weeks.During the shutdown, planes have not undergone routine safety inspections, and workers across the industry were warning of what could happen when unpaid and overly stressed workers were still told to come in. Even though air traffic controllers and traffic management coordinators remain on the job, dedicated to the safety of every flight, they don t know when they ll receive their next paycheck and that adds more stress to an already stressful profession,  the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a statement this month.  This shutdown and the resulting furloughs are rapidly eliminating the layers of redundancy and safety on which the NATCA is built.  That stress came to a tipping point Friday when air traffic controllers appeared to call out sick en masse, on the heels of the Transportation Security Administration s announcement that it was seeing a spike in  unscheduled absences  among its workers. Luke Drake, a regional vice president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, told HuffPost he wasn t surprised that the continued stress of workers possibly unable to buy groceries would make them ill. I assume it has primarily to do with the stress with not only the nature of their work but having to do all of that while not being paid,  Drake said of air traffic controllers  absences.  I m not surprised, given we re now at our second lost pay period, that the stresses are increasing. In a statement Friday, the NATCA echoed his sentiment.  In the past few weeks, we have warned about what could happen as a result of the prolonged shutdown,  the union said.  Many controllers have reached the breaking point of exhaustion, stress, and worry caused by this shutdown. Each hour that goes by that the shutdown continues makes the situation worse. The halting of flights  is exactly what AFA and other aviation unions have been warning would happen,  the Association of Flight Attendants union said in a statement.   This is anything but a sick out - it is only about our safety and the air traffic controllers  absolute commitment to it,  the union said.

As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans,  Trump told members of Congress, his Cabinet, the Supreme Court and invited guests gathered in the House chamber for his State of the Union address.  Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation. The attempt to sound bipartisan and unifying, though, comes in stark contrast to his recent remarks about Democrats. Trump has called Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) a  clown.  Just last week, Trump claimed in interviews that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opposed border security and was OK with higher crime rates.Trump s calls for bipartisanship also did not prevent him from hitting a pair of his favorite themes. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,  he said, referring to ongoing and coming probes into his relationship with Russia and his business dealings.  It just doesn t work that way. Trump then referenced the elephant in the room: the recently ended and possibly returning government shutdown over his demand for a border wall that he originally promised Mexico would pay for. As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States,  he said, setting up for his argument that U.S. taxpayers should spend many billions of dollars for his wall.  In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall <U+2015> but the proper wall never got built. I will get it built. Trump, as is his custom, spent much of his speech boasting of accomplishments, including taking credit for things regardless of his actual role in them.He said the strength of the economy and low unemployment was a result of his presidency:  We have launched an unprecedented economic boom <U+2015> a boom that has rarely been seen before. There s been nothing like it. In fact, the economic trend lines have been relatively constant since the end of the financial crisis in 2009. Trump similarly claimed credit for the defeat of the self-declared Islamic State terror group, even though the strategy the military has used was developed under his predecessor, Barack Obama. He further took credit for a boom in U.S. energy production, even though that trend began under President George W. Bush and continued under Obama.In other instances, he made claims that were flat-out false or appeared to be apocryphal, adding to a running total of 4,235 such falsehoods since he took office.In the lengthy section of the speech devoted to illegal immigration, for example, Trump repeated a claim that kidnapped women and children are being smuggled into the country by  the thousands  to be sold  into prostitution and modern-day slavery. Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security has responded to numerous requests to provide details to support Trump s claims on the matter.As most presidents before him, Trump promised a number of new proposals: an initiative to eliminate the spread of AIDS, an effort to reduce drug costs and another to fight childhood cancers.Which, if any, of Trump s proposals advance at all beyond Tuesday night s speech is an open question. Trump s White House has been notoriously poor at following through on his professed initiatives.Trump promised a $1 trillion  infrastructure  plan to rebuild the nation s roads and bridges in his 2017 joint address to Congress five weeks after taking office and $1.5 trillion in last year s State of the Union. No such plan ever materialized, and not a single dollar has been appropriated. (Trump again called for an infrastructure plan Tuesday night, but this time did not propose a dollar value.)As far as reaching out to Democrats and other political critics, Trump has done that before in prepared remarks as well, only to undo it all within days or even hours with his unscripted remarks and tweets.In 2017, after declaring that the  time for trivial fights is behind us,  Trump within a few days had attacked Obama, the Democratic leaders in both chambers of Congress, the FBI investigation into his ties to Russia and, inexplicably, the host who replaced him on  The Apprentice  television show.Last year, after calling on  all of us to set aside our differences,  Trump a day and a half later attacked Democrats for having failed to support the tax cut legislation from months earlier and told audiences to replace them with more Republicans in the coming midterm elections.Apart from Trump s inability or unwillingness to stick to a message, Tuesday s speech will also soon be overshadowed by an actual deadline with real consequences.A temporary spending bill Trump signed on Jan. 25 expires a week from Friday, making another shutdown of a quarter of the government an imminent possibility. Last time, Senate Republicans <U+2015> who had already unanimously agreed to a short-term spending bill before Trump reneged on a commitment to sign it <U+2015> stood with Trump. After the resulting 35-day shutdown damaged their polling numbers, though, they may be less likely to go along with a second shutdown.And looming over the entire situation is Trump s threat to declare a  national emergency  if Congress doesn t give him the billions he is demanding for a border wall <U+2015> a declaration he believes will permit him to divert money from other programs. But House Democrats have already indicated they are prepared to pass binding legislation disapproving of the declaration, thereby forcing Senate Republicans either to vote for a legally dubious  emergency  to build a wall most Americans oppose or to oppose Trump and anger his base of supporters.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Familiar topics, including his efforts to secure funding for a border wall, were centerpieces of the 82-minute speech, but new initiatives, such as plans to meet again with the North Korean leader and to tackle the spread of HIV, were also highlighted.Here are some of the major takeaways from the address.Trump hasn t backed down from his demand for a wall along America s southern border, but his definition of it has continued to evolve this year amid the fallout from a 35-day partial government shutdown, a closure that led to a one-week delay of the State of the Union address. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier <U+2015> not just a simple concrete wall,  the president declared Tuesday.  It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down. He added that  walls work  and  save lives,  and urged lawmakers to forge a compromise that will  truly make America safe.  Democrats have long called for beefed-up border security, including new technology and more border agents, but have said a simple barrier would be costly and ineffective.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has continued to insist that there will be no  wall money  as part of a funding deal for the federal government, although she said she s open to earmarking money for other border security efforts.The president spent weeks before last year s midterm elections sounding an alarm over a large caravan of Central American migrants, painting the migrants as criminals in an attempt to build fears and garner support for his proposed wall. Many of those people were fleeing violence, hoping to apply for asylum at the U.S. border.Trump on Tuesday once again moved to paint a new caravan of about 1,600 people as a danger to American society, saying that,  as we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.  We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection,  he said, pointing to his order to send an additional 3,750 troops to the border this week. This is a moral issue,  he continued.  The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all Americans. The president has long touted his efforts to rein in North Korea s nuclear weapon program, and Trump said he would meet with the country s leader, Kim Jong Un, for a second time later this month in Vietnam. As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula,  Trump said.  Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. The meeting is scheduled to take place on Feb. 27 and 28, although critics have expressed skepticism about what progress can be made. Pyongyang has yet to give up any of the weaponry Trump has said it would, and American intelligence chiefs said last month that North Korea was  unlikely to give up all of its [nuclear] stockpiles. Trump has seized control of the anti-abortion talking point ahead of the 2020 election and urged Congress to  defend the dignity of every person  during his State of the Union speech. I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother s womb,  the president said.  Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children <U+2015> born and unborn <U+2015> are made in the holy image of God. The focus on such abortions comes after New York passed a new law last month that permits the termination of pregnancies after the 24th week only in the  absence of fetal viability  or if the  abortion is necessary to protect  a mother s life or health. Such abortions are rare, amounting to 1.3 percent of total procedures in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Abortion rights advocates have lambasted Trump s imagery and characterizations of the law as absurd.The president said he planned to implement a 10-year strategy to reduce and possibly end the spread of HIV infections in the United States, even though his administration has been criticized for its work on the issue so far. In recent years, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS,  Trump said.  Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America. Though the move would amount to a major American policy initiative, the Trump administration has been criticized for leaving major HIV leadership positions unfilled for months. Vice President Mike Pence has also been criticized for his policies while he was governor of Indiana, where he oversaw cuts to public health funding that contributed to the worst HIV outbreak in the state s history.Trump has long touted America s renewed interest in fossil fuel production as a boon to the economy, despite increasingly dire reports from the world s leading scientists about the scourge of climate change. We have unleashed a revolution in American energy <U+2015> the United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world,  the president said.  And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. Although his address didn t include familiar talking points about  beautiful  clean coal, the president s policies helped global carbon emissions hit record highs in 2018.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The board wrote in its op-ed that the resultant  pointless  five-week government shutdown  was proof  of Trump s  stark incapacity for leadership, which he confirmed Friday by threatening to re-shutter the government in three weeks. Trump had lost the argument over his proposed U.S.-Mexico barrier  with the American people,  it added, citing a poll that claims  a majority of whom oppose building the wall and blame him and Republicans in Congress for the shutdown. It was also  score one  for Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).Trump agreed Friday to reopen the government for three weeks.

Trump is refusing to sign a spending bill until he gets $5.7 billion for his wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Despite the efforts of [Fox News  Sean] Hannity and some of his fellow Fox News hosts, there is no sign that Trump s effort to shift responsibility to the Democrats is working,  John Cassidy wrote in the New Yorker earlier this month.

I want him to declare an emergency,  Eric Trump told Fox News  Sean Hannity on his show Tuesday night.Hannity, one of Trump s loudest cheerleaders in the media, agreed.  Oh, I think he will,  he said.After a 35-day partial government shutdown, President Trump on Friday agreed to a stopgap spending bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiates funding for border security. Democrats have steadfastly refused to carve out $5.7 billion in a spending bill to fund his border wall, which he has vowed for years Mexico would pay to build. If his border wall demands aren t met in the spending bill Congress is negotiating, Trump has threatened to not sign it, thus leading to another partial government shutdown on Feb. 15. He has also warned he might declare a national emergency to secure the funding. In declaring an emergency, the president has said he would use his executive power to redirect military construction funds to build the wall.Eric Trump, the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, on Tuesday claimed Americans want his father to go through with declaring a national emergency if Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) don t  negotiate something that s fair.  Honestly, if they don t, declare the emergency and build the wall with the United States military because that s what people in this country want,  Eric Trump told Hannity.  And then redouble your efforts on legal immigration, get great people in this country because that s what America wants and that s what America needs.

Pence said administration officials have been speaking with rank and file Democrats in order to get a deal done, though he wouldn t name those Democrats. He did, however, drop King s name as someone whose message could inspire the two sides to come together. The hearts and minds of the American people today are thinking a lot about it being the weekend we are remembering the life and the work of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,  Pence told host Margaret Brennan.  One of my favorite quotes from Dr. King was,  Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.  You think of how he changed America, he inspired us to change through the legislative process. But when it came to walls being used to divide people, King wasn t a fan. He delivered that message to over 20,000 people during a visit to both East and West Berlin in 1964, just two months after the U.S. passed the legislation Pence referred to, the landmark Civil Rights Act. It is indeed an honor to be in this city, which stands as a symbol of the divisions of men on the face of the earth,  King told East Berliners.  For here on either side of the wall are God s children and no man-made barrier can obliterate that fact. King in his speech talked of God s presence wherever efforts are made to break down barriers meant only to divide people. The Gospels speak directly and in parables about the responsibility which we have for one another regardless of the differences of race and nation,  King said.  And so it is not difficult for us to go a step further and assume that wherever reconciliation is taking place, wherever men are  breaking down the dividing walls of hostility  which separate them from their brothers, there Christ continues to perform his ministry. The partial government shutdown that stems from Trump s funding demand for the border wall has left about 800,000 federal employees without pay and shuttered a variety of government services. As of Sunday, the shutdown is in its 29th day.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

But instead, O Donnell explained, it was making  him look weaker  with  his polling numbers getting worse all the time and Republicans defecting from the Trump sinking ship every day, every time there s a vote. O Donnell said the opinion that Trump  has the worst Cabinet in history and the worst White House staff in history is beyond dispute.

In mid-December, when Pelosi and Schumer went to the White House to try to stave off a shutdown, she taunted him by referring to it as a  Trump shutdown  and essentially daring him to do it. When Trump said Pelosi was  in a situation where it s not easy for her to talk right now,  she shot back that she didn t need him diminishing her.  Mr. President, please don t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory,  she said. She later briefed House Democrats on the meeting and characterized the wall as  a manhood thing for him,  adding,  As if manhood could ever be associated with him.

Since the election, her favorability rating is up 8 percentage points overall, according to Civiqs, a progressive polling firm. Breaking down the numbers, she surged 14 points among Democrats, 8 points among independents and even gone up 1 point with Republicans. In Gallup polls, Pelosi is more popular than she has been in a decade. Trump s approval, meanwhile, is tanking. We re not surprised at all that it is a smart, effective and powerful woman that is finally putting a check on Trump. Speaker Pelosi is, and has always been, a boss,  said Shaunna Thomas with UltraViolet, a women s advocacy group. On Wednesday, Pelosi wrote to Trump that, with no end in sight to the shutdown, it would be best if he not deliver his State of the Union address to a joint congressional session on Jan. 29, suggesting that he provide the traditional speech in writing instead. She said it was wrong to hold the event since the Secret Service is among the agencies hit by the shutdown and its agents are working without funding. Pelosi, in other words, was taking away one of Trump s favorite things: a big TV audience. In response on Thursday, Trump said he was canceling a planned official foreign trip was spearheading that included a stop in Afghanistan, which required travel with military personnel. He informed her just an hour before she and other members of Congress were set to leave. In comments to HuffPost, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who had been one of the most vocal Democrats urging Pelosi to yield the speakership to someone else, couldn t bring himself to praise her for the job. But he also didn t criticize her.  I think we need to get a deal (ending the shutdown). We ve got to get these people back to work. It s difficult because the president s word isn t very reliable,  he said, adding,  I m just shaking my head at the whole thing.

A polar vortex brought record cold to Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and other Midwestern states <U+2015> with temperatures dropping to ñ50 degrees Fahrenheit with wind chill in some areas <U+2015> leading to schools being closed and communities rushing to provide help to homeless people. About 450 Red Cross blood drives were canceled across 30 states this month, largely due to winter weather, the nonprofit said. An estimated 14,000 blood donations were not gathered as a result <U+2015> with this week alone accounting for 75 percent of the uncollected donations.  What s more, the federal government s partial shutdown also affected donations in recent weeks, as about 30 blood drives hosted by federal offices were canceled during the shutdown, leaving more than 900 donations uncollected.  The need for blood doesn t stop for winter weather,  American Red Cross spokesperson Jessa Merrill said in a press release, urging people  unaffected by this winter weather  to donate blood.  This month s historic cold and snowy weather has caused blood drives from the Midwest to the East Coast to be cancelled and thousands of blood donations have gone uncollected. The organization also warned on its website of the safety threats posed by the  dangerous cold  and  life threatening  wind chills in some areas, recommending that people stay indoors.  Even before the freezing weather hit this week, the group faced a nationwide blood shortage after the winter holidays, with only a three-day supply in its inventory, lower than the five-day stock recommended, Virginia NBC affiliate WWBT reported.  Every two seconds, someone in the U.S. needs blood, according to the Red Cross. Blood donations can help surgery and transplant patients, burn victims and people battling leukemia, cancer and more.  The group has often experienced blood shortages, with the worst ones tending to hit in winter and summer months. When the Red Cross had a nationwide shortage in summer 2016, it offered $5 Amazon gift cards to motivate people to show up to donation sites."

Such a bill, Democrats say, could pass with enough support in the Senate <U+2015> 67 votes <U+2015> to override a presidential veto.  The issue here is the Senate really does need to do its job as a separate and co-equal branch of government,  Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said Tuesday on the Senate floor, urging McConnell to allow the Senate to make use of its powers under the Constitution to try to end the partial government shutdown.McConnell, however, has said that it would be pointless to vote on any spending bill that does not have the support of the president. He shot down the veto override suggestion on Tuesday, telling reporters at a weekly press conference that Trump is correct to push for additional border security funding. In a situation like this where the president in my view is in the right place trying to get the right outcome  of course not,  McConnell said when asked by an NBC News reporter if he would try to reopen the government with a veto override.But if McConnell believed the situation on the border was so critical that it needed additional security measures like Trump s wall, he could have pushed for that funding in December, when the Senate passed a short-term government funding bill easily by voice vote. The Kentucky Republican did not.McConnell instead called on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to sit down again with Trump and come to an agreement on wall funding, essentially attempting to take himself out of negotiations amid the ongoing shutdown. Let me repeat again what I ve said now for three weeks: The solution is a negotiation between the one person who can sign something into law, the president of the United States, and our Democratic colleagues,  McConnell said Tuesday.The last time Trump huddled with congressional leaders at the White House, the president walked out of the meeting after Pelosi said she did not support his proposed border wall. He just got up and said we have nothing to discuss, and he walked out,  Schumer said last week.  He just walked out of the meeting. Democrats and Republicans remain dug in on their positions as the shutdown continues this week, with no significant talks occurring to reopen the government. Trump invited a group of House Democrats to the White House on Tuesday to discuss the matter, but each one of them declined the meeting.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The shutdown is now in its 24th day and has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without a regular income. Most of the DHS  245,000 employees are classified as essential, meaning they must continue to work despite not receiving a paycheck.Federal workers, including DHS employees such as Transportation Security Administration officers, told HuffPost that the prolonged shutdown is putting them in dire financial situations as they struggle to make rent or mortgage payments, deal with medical bills and even pay for food. Some employees are taking on debt or being forced to find extra work. The number of TSA workers calling out of work sick has increased during the shutdown, causing some TSA checkpoints in Miami and Houston to close in recent days because of lack of staff.The partial shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history as President Donald Trump refuses to give up on his demand for more than $5 billion to fund a border wall with Mexico   a key campaign promise that he vowed Mexico would pay for.Read the full DHS letter below: Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Nearly one-third of the civilian federal workforce has served in the military, although the percentage varies greatly from agency to agency.Some 800,000 federal workers have gone without pay since Dec. 22. According to Stars and Stripes, an estimated 155,000 veterans work in agencies affected by the shutdown, 50,000 of them with a disability rating.The comments that prompted Wilkie s letters came from Edward Canales, a local AFGE president and a union liaison officer for veterans. Canales is an Army veteran who served in Operation Desert Storm and is  a 100 percent disabled veteran  due to combat injuries, according to his union bio. He told ABC News last week that he had fielded calls from veterans who work for the government and were distraught over how to pay their bills during the shutdown. If this shutdown does not stop, we are going to have fatalities,  Canales said, according to ABC.  We re going to have suicides. Wilkie apparently felt that remark was out of bounds. In a letter the VA made public on Monday, the secretary said that the union was promoting the stereotype of  veteran as victim.  He didn t buy the idea that stress brought on by the shutdown could lead to a veteran s suicide. [T]he notion that most Veterans are so fragile from their service that the slightest hint of hardship can push them to the brink of mental breakdown or even self-harm is preposterous, which is why Veterans and Veteran advocates are continuously fighting this shopworn canard,  Wilkie wrote.Wilkie called on AFGE s national president, J. David Cox, to apologize. Cox declined and instead fired back at Wilkie, saying the Trump administration  has been one of the worst on record for our country s heroes.  He also said that White House officials don t grasp the financial stress the shutdown is causing. The President and his cabinet have left [veterans] out in the cold, forcing them to work without pay and subjecting veterans and their families to the uncertainty of not knowing when or where their next paycheck will come from,  Cox said in a statement on Monday.  Financial pressures experienced by working people are apparently not something this administration either understands or cares about. The current shutdown became the longest in U.S. history on Saturday. The president, who said he would be  proud  to close the government over border security, has demanded that Congress provide $5.7 billion for a wall along the southern border that he used to claim Mexico would pay for. Democratic lawmakers have refused.Roughly a quarter of government functions have gone unfunded, leading agencies to furlough 380,000 workers and require another 420,000  essential  employees to work without pay. Democratic leaders in the House have moved several bills that would reopen agencies while Congress and the president negotiated over the wall, but Trump and Republican leaders in the Senate have declined to take up the measures.The House and Senate passed a bill last week approving backpay for government workers affected by the shutdown, as has been done in past shutdowns. But the workers won t get paid until the government reopens and payrolls are processed. Trump also has to sign the legislation.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

Paul Ryan, who was then the speaker of the House, told Trump he saw no way for Republicans to win a standoff. And Kevin McCarthy, then the House majority leader, warned that a shutdown during the holiday season was a bad idea. Trump, nevertheless, pushed ahead, refusing to sign legislation to keep the government operating <U+2015> unless he received money for his border wall, which during the campaign he said Mexico would pay for. Republican leaders had good reason to be cautious about shutting down the government: The GOP would probably get blamed for it. Historically, the public tends to hold the Republican Party for such impasses.  Republicans usually get the blame for shutdowns because they usually cause the shutdowns, which is inevitable as they have become more controlled by their ideologically extreme members,  said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster with Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. Trump is learning this lesson now. The current shutdown is the longest in history, with no end in sight. He continues to insist on money for his border wall, while Democrats refuse to give it to him. The public is blaming Trump for the mess, according to polls by HuffPost/YouGov and other news outlets. To be clear, no one in government comes out looking especially good during a shutdown, but he is being held responsible (as he once said he wanted to be). Although three Senate Republicans have called for the government to reopen, most are sticking by Trump <U+2015> even despite the loss of public support. He actually is moving the numbers in his direction compared to a year ago, in terms of the wall,  Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) argued Tuesday.Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) added that  the president has moved further in trying to find a balance there than the other side has. Voters blamed congressional Republicans for a shutdown in 2013 (when the GOP wanted to extract concessions on killing Obamacare) and two from 1995 to 1996 (when President Bill Clinton refused to go along with GOP budget cuts). Newt Gingrich certainly didn t help his party gain support for the shutdowns in the 1990s. Gingrich, who was House speaker, was already unpopular. Then he indicated that he had shut down the government for a very personal reason: He felt Clinton snubbed him on a flight from Israel in November.  This is petty,  Gingrich told reporters, according to a Nov. 17, 1995, article in The Washington Post.  [But] you land at Andrews [Air Force Base] and you ve been on the plane for 25 hours and nobody has talked to you and they ask you to get off the plane by the back ramp.   You just wonder, where is their sense of manners? Where is their sense of courtesy? Clinton also effectively used his bully pulpit to shame Republicans, highlighting the personal toll of the shutdowns, the second of which lasted 21 days. During his 1996 State of the Union address, he honored the service of Richard Dean, a heroic public servant who risked his life to save others during the Oklahoma City bombing the previous April. He was sat in the first lady s box for the address, and when Clinton honored Dean s service, the entire chamber applauded him. From Clinton s speech:I d like to give you one example. His name is Richard Dean. He is a 49-year-old Vietnam veteran who s worked for the Social Security Administration for 22 years now. Last year he was hard at work in the federal building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 169 people and brought the rubble down all around him. He re-entered that building four times. He saved the lives of three women. He s here with us this evening, and I want to recognize Richard and applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal heroism.Then Clinton delivered his kicker: Dean had been furloughed during the shutdowns. Clinton s call for Congress to never again shut down the government received boisterous cheers from Democrats. Gingrich, meanwhile, sat awkwardly at the dais behind Clinton. But Richard Dean s story doesn t end there. This last November, he was forced out of his office when the government shut down. And the second time the government shut down, he continued helping Social Security recipients, but he was working without pay.On behalf of Richard Dean and his family and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people, I challenge all of you in this chamber: Never, ever shut the federal government down again.The ensuing coverage declared Clinton s speech a success and panned the GOP response from Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (Kan.). The San Jose Mercury News praised Clinton s  conciliatory-sounding speech  and criticized Dole s  sharply partisan response.  President Clinton ate the Republicans  supper Tuesday night, but House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen. Bob Dole wound up with heartburn,  wrote Chicago Sun-Times syndicated columnist Carl Rowan two days later.And there was no doubt that House Republican Whip Tom DeLay (Texas) realized that politically, Clinton had won. According to the 1997 book Mirage by George Hager and Eric Pianin, DeLay went home and rewatched the State of the Union speech at 1:30 a.m. Tom DeLay screamed at Bill Clinton, fighting the urge to throw something,  Hager and Pianin write, adding that DeLay sat  raging at his television set, calling Clinton a  lying, disingenuous, smarmy son of a bitch.  The Trump administration, so far, has not gone the Clinton route of talking about individual federal workers and the toll the shutdown is taking on them. Democrats in Congress, however, have been doing so, in an effort to shame the president and congressional Republicans into giving up their border wall demand. Instead, Trump and his aides have downplayed being furloughed and missing paychecks <U+2015> comparing it to a vacation <U+2015> and claimed that most federal workers are standing behind him. (There is no evidence of that.)A 2018 shutdown, which lasted just three days, had blame spread more evenly. According to a HuffPost/YouGov poll, 61 percent of Americans surveyed said they blamed Congress as a whole, with equal blame going to Democrats and Republicans (and less to Trump). That shutdown was precipitated by Senate Democrats trying to incorporate into budget negotiations a deal to help the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.Shutdowns often don t have long-term electoral consequences, though. In the 1996 and 2014 congressional elections, Republicans made gains, despite shouldering most of the blame for recent shutdowns. But in 1996, Clinton won re-election, defeating Dole. And in 2018, Democrats took control of the House. So Trump may not bear the political costs of the shutdown in 2020. But then again, no shutdown has ever lasted this long, and it s not clear how steep the costs will be both on individuals and to the broader economy.Igor Bobic contributed reporting.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

And while the Trump administration s energy creed is no secret, the ongoing partial government shutdown <U+2015> the longest in the history of the United States <U+2015> is proof that for President Donald Trump and his team, few things take precedence over fossil fuels.As an estimated 800,000 federal workers went without paychecks, leaving many financially insecure as national parks around the country fell into disarray. Despite this, the Trump administration has still found a way to plow ahead with its  energy dominance  agenda. With a skeleton staff, the Interior Department continues working to expand oil and gas development in the Alaskan Arctic. The agency s Bureau of Land Management is processing fossil fuel drilling applications and permits. And last week, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management amended its shutdown contingency plan to bring back dozens of furloughed employees, some on an on-call basis, to continue work on offshore drilling activities. Those efforts, backed by carryover funds from 2018, included preparing for an upcoming lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico, processing Atlantic seismic exploration permits and developing a new five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program.The failure to hold upcoming Gulf lease sales would  have a negative impact to the Treasury and negatively impact investment in the U.S. Offshore Gulf of Mexico,  BOEM wrote in its updated plan. And the agency must press ahead with its revised offshore leasing plan  to comply with the Administration s America First energy strategy,  it said. We have not seen any major effects of the shutdown on our industry,  Mike Sommers, president of oil and gas trade group American Petroleum Institute, told reporters last week, according to Natural Gas Intelligence. Democrats in Congress and advocacy groups are aghast at the administration s priorities, especially while federal workers go without pay. In a joint statement Thursday, environmental groups Earthjustice, League of Conservation Voters and the Natural Resources Defense Council accused the administration of stooping to a  new level of  dirty.   Instead of working with Congress to end the longest government furlough in American history, the Trump Administration is prioritizing a radical, unpopular plan to subject America s coasts to more offshore drilling,  they said. In a Wednesday letter to David Bernhardt, the acting secretary of the Interior Department and a former fossil fuel lobbyist, House Natural Resources Chairman Rep. Raul Grijalva (Ariz.) and other Democrats accused the administration of caring  only about the [shutdown s] impacts on its favorite industry and not about workers, their families, and ordinary Americans.  They called on Bernhardt to reverse his  outrageous  decision to forge ahead with offshore drilling work or visit Capitol Hill to provide legal justification for the move. Over the last two weeks of the shutdown, BLM has significantly ramped up oil and gas permitting, according to an analysis by Colorado-based advocacy group Center for Western Priorities.CWP is tracking @DOIDepSec s @BLMNational oil & gas permitting and leasing during government shutdown. As of today, BLM has approved/accepted:  -10 new drilling permits-6 new oil and gas leases -154 drilling permit applications -109 lease nominationshttps://t.co/M0RVRGQuFHMeanwhile, the Interior s work related to offshore wind energy is at a standstill. BOEM has postponed several meetings to get pubic input on an 800-megawatt wind farm slated to begin construction this year off the coast of Massachusetts. And Bloomberg reported this week that wind energy reps fear that the shutdown <U+2015> now in its fourth week, with no end in site <U+2015> could complicate and impede offshore wind development in the Northeast. The Interior s preferential treatment of big oil since the shutdown began on Dec. 22 stands in contrast to the rhetoric from former agency chief Ryan Zinke, who claimed the administration doesn t play favorites when it comes to powering America.  The president and myself, we don t pick winners and losers,  Zinke said in May 2017 at the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston  We don t favor oil and gas over any other industry. Trump and his team have repeatedly accused the Obama administration of being at  war  with fossil fuels.  We have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal,  Trump declared in his 2018 State of the Union address.Despite two years of regulatory rollbacks and receiving priority treatment during the shutdown, some in the industry still aren t satisfied. In a blog post last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce s Global Energy Institute compiled a list of 20 regulatory reforms that could be impacted or delayed by the shutdown.  We are very concerned about the regulatory progress being stifled,  Christopher Guith, the institute s senior vice president, told the Washington Examiner.The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost s request for comment Thursday.

The publication stated that three black players also  each separately confirmed that many players, both black and white, had no interest in making the trip. All three acknowledged that Donald Trump was the reason they chose not to attend.  Most of the team s white players did attend, however. It wasn t like we had a team meeting or anything,  one player told the website.  Players were talking amongst each other but everybody was like,  I m not going to that.  The Tigers  coaches did not exert pressure on any athlete to attend, according to The Root. But one player suggested that some squad members took part only to avoid jeopardizing their scholarships or future playing time.A representative for Clemson appeared to attempt to play down the report, however. Joe Galbraith, Clemson s associate vice president for strategic communications, said in an email to The Root that 76 student-athletes, which is  approximately two-thirds  of the entire team, were in attendance. For a variety of reasons, several players were not able to adjust schedules to make the trip,  Galbraith claimed.  On the championship game roster, 26 players had already received their bachelor s degree, and had no planned obligations on campus beginning that week. Other student-athletes had class obligations as the spring semester began the week prior. "

Sound like anyone he might know?Trump on Monday boasted that he ll be serving offerings from burger chains to the national champion Tigers (15-0), who are visiting the White House to be honored after defeating the University of Alabama in the title game on Jan. 7. I think we re going to serve McDonald s, Wendy s and Burger Kings with some pizza,  he said of the menu planned for the Monday gathering.  I really mean it. It will be interesting. And I would think that s their favorite food. So we ll see what happens. But they re coming tonight, the national champions, subject to the weather. In addition to the underwhelming menu, the visit has caused additional controversy because some critics, including Clemson supporters, said the timing for a celebration is inappropriate amid the partial government shutdown.The traditional White House visit by championship teams in various sports <U+2015> normally among the most genial of presidential duties <U+2015> have proved contentious since Trump took office, as many athletes have aired their objections to him.Last year, after several members of the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles made clear they would skip a White House visit, Trump disinvited the whole team. He also pre-emptively declared that the winner of the 2018 NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and eventual champ Golden State Warriors would not be welcome.

In her column Monday, Rubin noted how there was little appetite for another shutdown (following the longest in U.S. history) among Trump s  Republican allies in the Senate. She also explained why Trump s other option, to declare a National Emergency to release money for the wall, was  preposterous on its face.  To threaten for months that he ll declared an emergency if he doesn t get his way underscores there is no emergency,  she wrote.  Moreover, his declaration of an emergency can be overridden by a simple majority of both houses, which would be even more humiliating than Trump s cave on the shutdown.

The IRS recalled 46,000 furloughed workers this month, ordering them to work without pay before tax filing season starts on Jan. 28. More than half of those employees are in the division that processes tax returns and handles taxpayer phone calls. And more than 14,000 of those workers either claimed a hardship exemption or could not be reached, according to a congressional aide. The staffing shortage was first reported Friday by The Washington Post. President Donald Trump has refused to approve government funding legislation unless congressional Democrats agree to include more than $5 billion for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, even though he previously said Mexico would pay for the wall. More than 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or working without pay since Dec. 22. The Trump administration initially said the IRS would collect taxes but not distribute refunds, which amount to hundreds of billions of dollars annually but then said refunds would be paid after all. For most households, tax season should be normal, according to the Tax Policy Center, but refunds may take longer than usual. Filers who have questions for the IRS about their returns, however, may run into trouble. Tax professionals have told HuffPost that the shutdown has made it difficult to help their clients because they can t get anyone from the government on the phone to resolve problems. Amber Morgan-Storms is an enrolled agent, a type of tax practitioner licensed by the Treasury Department, in Redlands, California. She has clients dealing with IRS liens that were mistakenly issued, she said, and the shutdown is making it difficult to do her job. I can t call the IRS and say this shouldn t have been assessed,  she said.  I can t advocate for the taxpayers.  Morgan-Storms said she has not noticed any improvement since the IRS called up more workers.  I tried again today, and the hold times are so ridiculous, I can t even get into the queue,  she said.  And then when I thought a call was getting transferred over, it got disconnected.   The shutdown came at a particularly bad time for the IRS, since this is the first tax filing season under the Republican tax law that Congress passed at the end of 2017. One member of the House committee that oversees taxes, Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), said the shutdown probably wouldn t spoil the new law for most people.  For most of the complexities, the tax planning actually happened months ago, because you do tax planning before the end of the year,  he told HuffPost this month, adding that the new law makes the tax code simpler for most individuals. It s still a horrible way to run a government,  Schweikert said. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

We re not paying people who keep us safe,  the speaker said, listing as one example the Transportation Safety Administration agents  who stop bombs from coming onto planes. As the record-setting partial government shutdown stretches into its 27th day, Pelosi s message echoed the concerns of airline industry groups that have pressed for a fully functioning government, citing safety issues. The TSA acknowledged Thursday that an unusually high number of its agents have been calling in sick because many cannot afford to work without a paycheck. Monday s call-out rate stood at 7.6 percent, compared with 3.2 percent the year before, according to TSA spokesman Michael Bilello. Wednesday s call-out rate was 6.1 percent. There is no definitive proof that flying is less safe during a shutdown. The woman who traveled from Atlanta to Tokyo with a gun in her carry-on luggage earlier this month did so on a day when a normal number of TSA agents were working, the agency said. And earlier this week, the Federal Aviation Administration called about 3,600 employees back to work to address safety concerns.But some industry insiders say exhaustion and anxiety over missed paychecks could be taking a real toll. A coalition of 34 air travel industry groups sent a letter to President Donald Trump, Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) last week to urge them to end the shutdown, outlining specific concerns regarding staffing, mechanics and other issues.On Wednesday, a top member of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association told CNN s Poppy Harlow that air travel has become less safe than it was before the shutdown began. Trump has pledged to hold out  as long as it takes  for a spending bill to pass Congress with more than $5 billion for his proposed border wall.  I would say [flying] is less safe today than it was a month ago, absolutely,  said Trish Gilbert, executive vice president of the group, which is suing the Trump administration over the shutdown. Gilbert explained:  We are working with barebones crews. We have controllers there doing what they do very, very well, but how long can you expect them to do it without all of the systems behind them to keep the system safe? And the planes in the air? A NATCA colleague expressed similar worries in an interview with The Washington Post but said definitively that the system is safe. For how long, though, he could not say. One of Gilbert s concerns was that the people whose job it is to address reports from air traffic controllers over potential safety problems are not working. This is a horrible game of chicken that we re in the middle of, and we need to get out of it,  Gilbert said. In a Jan. 10 letter addressed to Trump and congressional leaders, heads of the Association of Flight Attendants and Association of Professional Flight Attendants invoked the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in their plea for full government funding. Although paid by individual airlines, flight attendants would be among the first affected by any lapse in safety procedures. We serve as the last line of defense in aviation security,  they wrote.  On September 11, 2001, we lost our friends and colleagues while our profession changed forever. Calling airline security a  layered approach,  the flight attendants  representatives said that government agencies are necessary to conduct cybersecurity work and security inspections, and to assess passengers and certify infrastructure.Capt. Joe DePete, head of the Air Line Pilots Association, has separately written to Trump asking for an immediate end to the stalemate, saying  the disruptions being caused by the shutdown are threatening the safe operations of this network.  When contacted by HuffPost, though, DePete said in a statement that passengers should not worry. At this point, despite the shutdown, flying remains safe because no ALPA member or airline pilot would ever take off if there s any reason to be concerned about safety,  he said. Yet, as the shutdown drags on, DePete warned,  some of the programs and processes that help us maintain aviation safety and monitor the system s integrity are at risk of being weakened.

But it was too late to save her car. She fell behind on payments and the 2012 Chevy Malibu had already been repossessed <U+2015> taken away from her driveway by a tow truck just hours before President Donald Trump agreed to reopen federal agencies he d held hostage in a futile effort to win support for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. On Wednesday, when she first goes back to work, Onley will have to ask family members for help getting to the nearest subway station to her house in Olney, Maryland, which is about an hour outside of Washington.  I don t have any money to get to work,  Onley, 27, said in an interview.  I ve asked so many family members for help but they still have their life as well.  And unlike the 800,000 federal workers who will get five weeks  worth of back pay now that the shutdown is over, Onley will get nothing. She works for a security contractor, not the government itself. Congress routinely approves back pay for federal workers who missed wages during a shutdown, and the most recent funding lapse is no exception. But thousands of federal contract workers don t get paid back, leaving many contractor employees, such as food workers, janitors, security officers and computer software developers behind on their bills. Democrats introduced legislation that would direct federal agencies to adjust the terms of contracts with private companies that had been suspended or interrupted by the shutdown. Agencies would pay the contractors for the cost of their lowest-paid employees  missing wages, so long as it s not more than what the employees regularly earned. Firms  participation in the backpay scheme would be voluntary. It uses a mechanism that exists to reimburse contractors for expenses incurred under a shutdown ... it just applies it to labor costs, which has never been done before. It s a nice simple way of dealing with  the problem, Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), who introduced the bill earlier this month, said on Tuesday.Bills to repay federal employees are usually uncontroversial and bipartisan <U+2015> Congress has in the past voted to reimburse federal workers once shutdowns ended. The plan to repay contractors, however, has only Democratic supporters so far. Smith told HuffPost she hoped Republicans would support it  because it seems clear that if you support back pay for federal employees, these are the same people working side-by-side with federal employees and they should get the same kind of treatment. Trump signed legislation into law earlier this month guaranteeing back pay for federal employees who were forced off the job during the longest government shutdown in history, which sucked $3 billion out of the economy that will not be recovered, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That sum partly represents the unpaid wages of thousands of federal contractors. White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told CBS   Face the Nation  on Sunday that the issue of back pay for contractors will  depend on the contract.  Trump s chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow, meanwhile, said he wasn t familiar with the issue. I think the defense-related ones will   I honestly don t know,  Kudlow, who chairs the White House council of economic advisers, told reporters during a White House press briefing on Monday.Proponents of the effort to reimburse federal contractors for lost wages hope to include the Smith measure in a broader agreement on border security currently being negotiated by a bipartisan conference committee that was formed after Trump agreed to reopen the government last week. Those discussions on continued government funding face a deadline of Feb. 15, however, and it s not clear whether both sides will reach an accord in time, given Trump s insistence on funding to begin constructing a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border that Democrats oppose.Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said not all contract workers should get repaid and it would depend on their assignment.  I think you really have to do that on an agency-by-agency basis,  Tillis told HuffPost.  There s probably some instances when you should.  One problem for the bill is that it s not totally clear how many contract employees missed pay because of the shutdown or how many would benefit from the legislation. Democrats said Tuesday they re still trying to find out the total number of people who work for companies on federal contracts. According to an estimate by Good Jobs Nation, a labor-backed group that often advocates for federal contract workers, more than 1 million such workers were stiffed by the shutdown. The federal government uses contractors instead of employing people directly to cut costs, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said.   The federal government uses contractors <U+2015> that was work previously done by federal workers <U+2015> because they wanted to save money,  Norton said. But  we have no right to save money by depriving employees who were kept from going to work.  The legislation would cap payments at $965 per worker per week, so it would make workers whole only if they earn less than $50,000 annually. Workers who earn more could still be paid back for the portion of their wages that is less than $50,000 on an annualized basis, but the bill is designed especially for lower-paid janitors who clean federal buildings and security guards like Onley.Onley and several other non-government government workers came to the Capitol on Tuesday to stand with Smith and other sponsors of her legislation. The workers are members of a local chapter of the Service Employees International Union, which says it represents more than 600 janitors and security officers who were furloughed during the shutdown. Onley said she had already fallen behind on car payments before the shutdown. She d been unemployed for several weeks before she got her security guard job with Allied Universal in November. She has a 3-year-old daughter and managed the past five weeks with the help of friends and family, who gave her $20 here, $30 there. She s glad Democrats are pushing for back pay but aware that it might not work out.  That s the sad thing, it s not a definite,  Onley said.  We re here to fight for it. All we can do is pray. CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this story said the legislation would only benefit workers who earn less than $50,000. The bill actually would repay any worker but at a weekly rate that on an annualized basis is less than $50,000. This story has also been updated to include the Good Jobs Nation estimate of how many contract workers were furloughed by the shutdown. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

They will be getting a letter today letting them know that we would be funded and that they will continue paying the amount that they have been paying,  Annette Cowen, the manager, told HuffPost.She said an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture assured her on Wednesday that the rental subsidies she gets for her low-income tenants will still be distributed for this month s rent. She manages about 50 properties across Arkansas and said 80 percent of her tenants benefit from a rural housing assistance program that pays most of their rent. She had been unable to reach her USDA contacts since the shutdown started in December and had assumed the program had lapsed.  PREVIOUSLY: Some renters in Arkansas are already facing eviction, thanks to the partial government shutdown.  A property manager told tenants at properties in Alma and several other towns that the shutdown has cut off a federal rental assistance program that covers a portion of their rent.  Until the government opens again, you are responsible for ALL of your rental amount,  the letter said, threatening eviction if tenants don t pay up by the 20th. The shutdown is creating financial stress for hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers. If the shutdown continues, low-income renters could also feel the sting.Tens of thousands of low-income households relying on the federal government to help them pay rent could lose that assistance if the shutdown persists. Many of those households include seniors and people with disabilities. Diane Yentel, the director of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, called it  appalling  that a landlord has already threatened to evict tenants because of the shutdown. But she said it s ultimately on Congress and President Donald Trump, who said he won t sign a government funding bill that doesn t include $5.7 billion for his proposed border wall. It is incredibly reckless to risk the homes of some of our country s poorest seniors, people with disabilities and families with children as perceived leverage for a fight that has nothing to do with them,  she said. The Department of Housing and Urban Development said it can t renew some contracts with private landlords in its project-based rental assistance program, known as Section 8, which contracts with private building owners to reserve at least 40 percent of their rental units for low-income families. Project-based affordable housing supports 1.4 million households. An additional 2.2 million households use portable rental vouchers, which are funded until March.About 1,150 housing contracts under the program were up for renewal but expired in HUD s system after parts of the federal government closed Dec. 22. Those contracts include 500 expiring this month and affect roughly 40,000 households, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and two-thirds of those affected are elderly or are people with disabilities who, on average, have an annual income of less than $13,000. HUD expects an additional 550 contracts to expire in February. The National Low Income Housing Coalition created an interactive map showing where the expiring contracts are in the U.S. The only states that don t have households with Section 8 contracts that have expired or may soon expire are Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island and West Virginia.HUD has suggested that the rental contract expirations likely won t lead landlords to start evicting residents anytime soon. The department has asked landlords not to evict tenants and to dip into reserve funds to meet expenses, if necessary. But the low-income renters in Alma are apparently subsidized by a U.S. Department of Agriculture program for rural areas, not HUD. The property manager did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The longer the shutdown goes on, the more untenable it becomes for owners to keep scraping by without the federal funds they re expecting <U+2015> and the more likely it becomes that those owners will start resorting to rent hikes or evictions of these lowest-income renters, as we are now seeing,  Yentel said.A spokesperson for the USDA said the agency s rental assistance contracts with multi-family properties are funded through the end of January, but that a small number of owners may have faced a delay for December s payments. It s not clear what the problem is with the contract in Alma or the other Arkansas properties managed by ASC Property Management, the firm that sent the eviction threats. The shutdown is now in its 25th day   the longest shutdown in U.S. history. If the government doesn t reopen before the end of February, Section 8 s tenant-based voucher program will no longer have any funding. That means housing authorities won t make voucher payments to landlords nationwide when March rents are due, possibly leading to evictions.Additionally, the USDA s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program can guarantee food stamps only through February, leading many low-income families to face the prospect of losing both housing and food assistance. Food banks nationwide are pitching in to help as many furloughed workers as possible, and they re bracing for an influx of visitors if SNAP benefits halt.The partial shutdown doesn t appear to be anywhere near a resolution. An estimated 800,000 federal employees will not be paid until funding resumes; about 420,000 of them have been deemed essential and must continue to work.This story has been updated to include a response from the USDA and Annette Cowen s revised position.

I mean, just take your ego out of it,  he added. A HUD spokesperson told NPR that the secretary was specifically referring to congressional leaders.Carson, who has not spoken out since the shutdown began 35 days ago, runs one of the federal agencies directly affected by the closures.His comments followed remarks from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross shrugging off the shutdown s impact on 800,000 unpaid federal workers, many of whom are struggling to pay their bills. Ross, whose own net worth is an estimated $700 million, suggested Thursday that workers should take out loans to cover the costs of necessities instead of relying on food pantries.Two competing proposals aimed at reopening the federal government failed Thursday in the Senate. President Donald Trump has vowed to veto any bill meant to end the shutdown if it does not include $5.7 billion for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.Most of HUD s employees have been furloughed, and those who were called back on the job without pay are  working around the clock  to make sure people who had been receiving housing assistance don t face eviction, Carson said. HUD has already said it s unable to renew some contracts with landlords in a rental assistance program that supports 1.4 million households.Federal workers in the affected agencies are set to miss their second paycheck on Friday. Carson said those employees are only going to suffer more the longer the shutdown continues. We really need to think about them, as opposed to some political victory,  Carson told NPR.  And it does worry me about the future of our country. If we re going to do everything based on ideology and hatred, I just don t see how we are going to be successful as a country. The HUD secretary joins some former Trump administration officials in the growing call to end the shutdown. John Kelly and four other former secretaries of homeland security told Trump and congressional leaders on Wednesday that they needed to restore funding to that department. Former Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn called for the shutdown s end from the economic summit in Davos, Switzerland.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The awards, distributed annually to support junior faculty members in science and engineering, will provide her with a $500,000, 5-year grant to research and write a book about veterans in the criminal justice system.For the last two years, Rowen has been studying Veteran Treatment Courts, which provide addiction and mental health treatment to military veterans as an alternative to incarceration <U+2015> all issues that the Trump administration has prioritized. Rowen expected to receive final approval from NSF this month and funding in early February. But the ongoing partial government shutdown <U+2015> the longest in America s history <U+2015> has prevented awards from being processed. When you write out these grants, you write out timelines,  Rowen told HuffPost.  My timeline is now blown up. She s far from alone. The NSF hasn t divvied out a single dollar in grant money since the shutdown began Dec. 22. During the same time period a year ago, the federal agency awarded more than 400 research grants valued at $127.3 million, according to a running tally by Benjamin Corb, public affairs director of The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The impact on science is a slow strangling of the American scientific enterprise,  Corb wrote in an email.President Donald Trump s demand that Congress fork over $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has left some 800,000 federal workers without pay. The Senate is set to vote Thursday on a pair of measures aimed at reopening the government, but neither is expected to pass, as HuffPost reported.With seemingly no end to the political battle in sight, there s no telling when Rowen will receive the grant money to continue her work. She said she planned to hire three research assistants from three separate institutions as part of the project, along with summer undergraduate researchers. Those students are also now in limbo, waiting to hear if Rowen will be able to bring them aboard. She worries that if the government doesn t reopen soon, the students will be forced to find employment elsewhere. The delay has also impacted Rowen s ability to organize and pay for research trips she had planned for the spring and summer. It s sort of a first-world problem amongst all of the survival problems,  she said, referring to the financial hardships that tens of thousands of government workers now face because of missed paychecks.  But it s serious,  she said, showing the ripple effect the shutdown is having.The NSF is among several government agencies that fund research grants. And derailing the flow of grant money is just one of many ways that the shutdown has stymied scientific research around the country. Thousands of scientists remained furloughed across agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Geological Survey.Meanwhile, the administration has managed to forge ahead with fossil fuel development in its relentless push for so-called  energy dominance.  The Interior Department is continuing to process oil and gas drilling applications and permits and recently amended the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management s shutdown contingency plan to bring back dozens of furloughed employees to continue work on offshore drilling activities. Approximately 90 percent of NSF s 2,100-person workforce is furloughed, an agency spokeswoman said. At least 250 postdoctoral research fellows have gone without their stipends. The agency has had to cancel job interviews for key positions, including head of the Office of Information and Resource Management. And it was unable to send staff to a number of recent science conferences, including those of the American Astronomical Society and the American Meteorological Society. Among the many grants and awards that have been delayed are a batch of more than 180 small business innovation awards that were ready to go out when appropriations lapsed. Additionally, NSF has been forced to cancel dozens of review panels, groups of independent scientists and experts that evaluate grant proposals. The NSF makes decisions to fund or reject proposals based on these recommendations. More than 100 panels were scheduled to review nearly 2,000 scientific proposals between Jan. 7 and Jan. 25, according to NSF. Those included panels for chemistry, earth sciences, astronomical sciences and molecular and cellular biosciences. NSF s Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences has previously funded research looking at ways to target bacteria like E.coli and on bacteria that could help mitigate the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, Corbs told HuffPost. An NSF spokeswoman called the situation  unprecedented  and said the agency doesn t yet know the full extent of the shutdown s effects.  When the political standoff does finally end, NSF will have to tackle weeks of backlogged work in addition to everything on its regular agenda, which includes dozens of review panel meetings on the books for February and March. The rescheduling effort will be a  mess to untangle,  Corbs said. We will never know exactly which funding opportunities have been lost because of this shutdown, but we can be assured that American science [continues] to be hurt,  he said.Rowen, who was invited to be on a review panel in March, fears the shutdown could set science research, universities and careers back years. Universities rely on a stagnant pool of federal grant money to pay salaries and fund research. Roughly one-quarter of Rowen s $500,000 grant is to go toward operating costs at the multiple universities she has partnered with for the project.  I have little doubt that the hold-up of NSF funding will cost jobs and cause ripple effects in university administration,  Rowen said in a text message. These outside awards can make or break a career, she added. It was an NSF grant that funded her dissertation research at the University of California, Berkeley, which she says ultimately led to a job in academics. It s huge for people who are scholars to not have the certainty around this,  Rowen said.This article had been updated to reflect the changing value of grants that NSF distributed over the same period last year.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was the lone House Democrat to vote against a bill to reopen the government on Wednesday, a position she described as  a tough/nuanced call,  The Hill reported.The short-term measure included funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which Ocasio-Cortez explained in an Instagram story is opposed by many people she represents. Most of our votes are pretty straightforward, but today was a tough/nuanced call,  Ocasio-Cortez wrote.  We didn t vote with the party because one of the spending bills included ICE funding and our community felt strongly about not funding that. Rep.

Meanwhile, 223 Democrats and six Republicans voted yes.Ocasio-Cortez also voted  no  on Wednesday to a larger funding package for government agencies, though it did not include Homeland Security, according to Newsweek. Ocasio-Cortez received flak from critics on the left for voting earlier this month to approve stopgap funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which included allocations for ICE. That measure also aimed to end the shutdown, but was rejected by President Donald Trump because it did not include $5.7 billion for his promised border wall.Wednesday s House measure, lacking support in the Senate or with Trump, will likely never see the light of day, either.Ocasio-Cortez s New York City district includes many Latinos, some of whom are fearful or resentful of ICE.

Late Wednesday, Trump posted these two messages on Twitter:As the Shutdown was going on, Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union Address. I agreed. She then changed her mind because of the Shutdown, suggesting a later date. This is her prerogative - I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over. I am not looking for an........alternative venue for the SOTU Address because there is no venue that can compete with the history, tradition and importance of the House Chamber. I look forward to giving a  great  State of the Union Address in the near future!Trump s announcement was seen by many as a win for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who had asked the president to delay the State of the Union speech until the government shutdown ended.While speaking to CNN s Don Lemon, D Antonio said that it was clear the president was  afraid,  but doubted whether the decision to postpone was actually Trump s: It s shocking,  D Antonio said.  This sounds like something that maybe Ivanka wrote or Jared Kushner. It really doesn t sound like Donald Trump s language.

Given that reality, one easy peasy way to screw up  the FBI, federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies would be to  start taking away paychecks from all of those people all at once,  she suggested   which is what is happening during the shutdown, the longest in U.S. history. With that one genius move, you can break the family finances of basically every single federal law enforcement and national security agent in the country,  Maddow explained, later adding:  In one fell swoop with just this one neat trick, you screw up all of their careers. You can create security clearance problems for all of them, all at once, by putting them all under financial strain. In doing so, Maddow also suggested it would make the FBI and other agencies  seem like super risky, demoralizing places to work  and make it harder for them  from here to eternity  to recruit the best talent.Check out the full clip above."

There will not be any infrastructure package. When he tries to be presidential, it just isn t believable,  said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida.  Even when he speaks rationally, no one trusts him. And he owns that. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity at the insistence of the White House, said Trump s third address to a joint session of Congress would be  an inspiring vision of American greatness,  claiming the address would be both  optimistic  and  unifying. Yet Trump s two previous such speeches   the State of the Union last January and a 2017 address five weeks after taking office   called for unity, only to be followed by actions and statements that appealed primarily to the roughly 35 percent of the country that supports him strongly.In his 2017 speech   during which a frequent critic declared,  He became president of the United States in that moment    Trump said in his prepared remarks,  The time for trivial fights is behind us. Just two days later, he called an FBI investigation into his campaign s ties to Russia a  witch hunt.  Two days after that, he made the   false   accusation that his predecessor  wire tapped  his Trump Tower home and that Democratic congressional leaders should also be investigated for their ties to Russia. (He also attacked Arnold Schwarzenegger for having poor ratings hosting  The Apprentice,  the reality TV show that Trump rode to national prominence.)On Jan. 30, 2018, reading words off a teleprompter that others had written for him, Trump said,  Tonight, I call upon on all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve. Just 33 hours later, Trump wrote on Twitter,  NOT ONE DEM VOTED FOR OUR TAX CUT BILL! Need more Republicans in  18.  He subsequently attacked Democrats and urged his audiences to vote Republican at both official and campaign events for the next nine months. This president, however much he may try, however much he calls for unity, however much he calls for working together for the common good, those words just fall on deaf ears. He ruined that brand as part of his initial brand,  said Jolly.  All of his calls tomorrow will be ruined by a tweet attacking the one person he needs, [Democratic House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi. Apart from the tone, the contents of Trump s address may also be undone by inaction in the coming year.In his 2017 speech, for example, Trump called for a $1 trillion package to rebuild the country s roads, bridges and ports. In 2018 he called for $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending. In neither year did his White House deliver a detailed infrastructure proposal to Capitol Hill.In 2017 his White House suggested taking $200 billion from other programs and somehow leveraging that with private-sector money to total $1 trillion, but never made any serious legislative proposal. In 2018 the White House made no serious infrastructure effort at all.Rick Wilson, a longtime Trump critic and Republican political consultant, said trying to analyze either the tone or the content of the president s remarks is a waste of time. Because he is so prone to falsehoods and his administration is so bad with follow-up on policy matters, Wilson said, what Trump says is of no consequence, in any event. It s going to be:  Me, me, me. Build my wall, build my wall, build my wall. The economy is great,   Wilson said.Trump s speech in the House chamber was originally scheduled for Jan. 29 but was postponed by Pelosi because of the partial government shutdown. Trump, after 35 days, backed down from his insistence that he would not reopen the government unless Democrats supported spending billions for a border wall that he originally promised Mexico would pay for.But the spending bill Trump signed on Jan. 25 runs out on Feb. 15. If a new appropriations bill is not signed into law by then, about a quarter of the government could again shut down. He has threatened to allow that, but has also raised the possibility that he will declare a  national emergency  to build the wall, using money appropriated for other purposes.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) broadcast a populist message focused around a desire for greater racial and economic justice in the U.S. on Tuesday night, just an hour before President Donald Trump s State of the Union address. Let s fight for an America where the economy works for working people <U+2015> an America where health care and education are fundamental rights, not a privilege for the wealthy few,  she said. Speaking for only seven minutes on Facebook Live, Harris broached topics including health care, housing, education, wage stagnation, immigration, gun violence, the 2017 Republican tax bill, deregulation and Trump s travel ban. We also need our leaders to speak truth about the threat of climate change, about our broken criminal justice system, about our weakened position in the world and about the realities of racism, sexism, anti-semitism, homophobia and transphobia,  she said. On what would have been the 24th birthday of Trayvon Martin <U+2015> the unarmed Florida teenager who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman in 2012, sparking mass protests and outrage <U+2015> Harris spoke of  an America where no mother or father has to teach their son that people may stop him or kill him because of the color of his skin <U+2015> and where no parent has to send their child to school with a bulletproof backpack. Harris deliberately set herself apart from the president, predicting that Trump would deliver a speech Tuesday night that  seeks to score political points by driving us apart.  The strength of our union has never been found in the walls we build,  she said.  It s in our diversity and our unity, and that is our power.  When you hear claims that our problems would all be solved if we just built a wall on our southern border, don t forget the babies ripped from their parents  arms and the refugees fleeing violence and abuse who are being turned away,  she said.The Republican National Committee criticized Harris  Tuesday comments in a statement sent to HuffPost, describing her as  blinded by her opposition to President Trump. <U+2033>[B]efore he can speak about his bipartisan agenda at the State of the Union, she tried to advance her divisive leftist agenda of government-run health care, higher taxes, and open borders,  RNC spokesman Steve Guest said in a statement. Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is scheduled to deliver the Democrats  rebuttal immediately after Trump s address, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who will provide his own response to Trump for the third straight year.Since Harris told ABC s  Good Morning America  that she was running for president last month, she has pulled off the most successful campaign rollout of any Democratic hopeful this cycle, in the eyes of many political operatives. Within 24 hours, she raised $1.5 million. Over the next week, she appeared on MSNBC s  The Rachel Maddow Show,  presented her policy views during a CNN town hall, paid a visit to some of her sorority sisters in South Carolina and stood in front of more than 20,000 people at a rally in her hometown of Oakland, California.This month, Harris plans to keep campaigning with stops in each of the first four states to hold a Democratic nominating contest <U+2015> Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina <U+2015> according to her press secretary.Harris has said her State of the Union guest will be Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik, a California mother of three whose home was destroyed by the Thomas Fire in 2017. More recently, her family faced a crisis of another sort when it went about a month without a paycheck during the partial government shutdown, which affected her and her husband. (They are both air traffic controllers.) She is the definition of resilience and I m proud to have her here with me,  Harris said earlier Tuesday.Tuesday night, Harris preached a message of unity.  I believe we are at an inflection point in the history of our nation,  Harris said.  It s a moment where we must answer a fundamental question: Who are we? What is the state of our union?  As Americans, we have so much more in common than what separates us,  she added.This post has been updated to include a statement from the Republican National Committee.

We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection,  Trump said.  I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught. Trump also claimed that he wanted immigrants  to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally,  contradicting the Trump administration s policies and proposed plans that discourage legal immigration. In January, Senate Republicans released a draft bill that would severely restrict the refugee asylum program. Last year, the administration followed through with a proposal that makes it harder for migrants to get green cards if they are poor or could become poor.Less than three weeks earlier, Trump reopened the federal government after he failed to reach an agreement with Democrats to fund his multibillion-dollar barrier at the southern border. At 35 days, it was the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history, and it forced about 800,000 federal workers to go without compensation.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

There s talk of  banning billionaires,  and in the U.S. there are serious <U+2015> and popular <U+2015> policy proposals looking at how to raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy, most notably from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).  Americans have actually long supported raising taxes on the wealthy, surveys  show. But for years, the ultra-rich, Republicans and anti-tax extremists like Grover Norquist have kept that popular sentiment at bay, partly with rhetoric about freedom and partly by philanthropic deeds, not to mention good PR to portray themselves as benevolent, self-made geniuses.Now that Trump s in office. The tide has turned. The current occupant of the White House has rather taken the sheen off the billionaires,  said Justin Wolfers, an economics and public policy professor at the University of Michigan.  It s easier today to believe that a bunch of them are grifters rather than the value-creating entrepreneurs that we might hope for. In the past, Americans wanted to tax the rich to pay for specific policies. These days, the reasoning goes that taxing the ultra-wealthy will tamp down extreme inequality, said Matt Grossmann, a political science professor at Michigan State University. You re seeing more willingness to say it s just a moral issue that someone shouldn t start out with that much of an advantage in life,  he said.The recent popularity of tax-the-rich policies isn t simply a reaction to Trump, Grossman added, but part of a natural tendency in American politics for public opinion to swing in opposition to whichever party is in power.  Public opinion moves  thermostatically,   he said.  When Republicans are in office and policy moves to the right, public opinion moves leftward.  Still, it s fair to say that the Democratic Party s reaction to Trump has been more extreme than it would ve been under, say, a President Jeb Bush. Trump has energized progressives on issues, like women s rights, in resistance to the president, which has inspired record numbers of women to run for office. He s also been a catalyst for environmental issues, in a way. Before Trump took office, activists and scientists had trouble getting attention for climate issues, but now it s become much easier, in part thanks to opposition to Trump,  FiveThirtyEight recently reported.Of course, there are a host of other non-Trump reasons why tax-the-rich ideas are taking off now, including a rise in economic inequality that is hard to ignore and the work of economists, such as Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who ve been able to demonstrate, with hard data, how bad the situation has become. There s also the lingering effects of the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign, which pushed Democrats to the left on these issues. Sanders proposed raising taxes on wealthy Americans and railed against income inequality.  And outrage over inequality really hasn t gone away since the Great Recession a decade ago led to the protests of Occupy Wall Street.In the background, as these longer-term trends play out, is our super-rich president and his super-rich Cabinet. They ve demonstrated repeatedly how out of touch they are with regular people.Most recently, during the partial government shutdown, the multimillionaire (and reported grifter) Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had his  let them eat cake  moment when he told CNBC that he couldn t understand why furloughed workers would go to food banks when they could instead get loans to carry them through the loss of pay.Trump himself helped further along the out-of-touch narrative by claiming that grocery stores would work with these unpaid government employees to help them get food if they were short on cash. Former Goldman Sachs executive and millionaire Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin s wife, Louise Linton, caught flak in 2017 for comments she made online essentially boasting about the taxes she and her husband pay.  Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours,  she commented on an Instagram post, responding to someone who had criticized her.Beyond image, keep in mind that Trump s singular policy achievement is a massive tax cut that has mostly benefited corporations. Bloomberg recently reported that the nation s largest banks got a $21 billion  windfall  from the legislation but wound up cutting employees anyway.Finally, Trump s set himself apart from all other modern presidents by keeping his tax returns private <U+2015> inadvertently perhaps shining a light on how the rich often get away with not paying their fair share.  Politicians can come to embody problems that exist,  said Julian Zelizer, a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University.  The president all of a sudden becomes a walking reminder of the issue. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The world-renowned chef, invited by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), reportedly wore a shirt that read  Immigrants feed America.  Ahead of Trump s speech, AndrÈs also tweeted his own thoughts about the state of the union, calling for  longer tables, not higher walls!  In Tijuana, we met people seeking nothing more than a better future for their families,  the chef wrote, referring to his nonprofit World Central Kitchen s initiative to serve free meals to migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border late last year.

Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business,  Trump said in his prepared remarks.  Working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration   Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate <U+2015> it is cruel.  Last month, AndrÈs  nonprofit also served free meals to U.S. federal workers who were affected by the partial government shutdown and struggling to get by without pay. Trump s speech, originally planned for Jan. 29, was delayed after Pelosi asked him to postpone it until the shutdown ended. During the record-breaking, weeks-long shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal workers were furloughed or worked without pay, as Trump refused to budge on his demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border <U+2015> which Democratic lawmakers firmly opposed.  On Jan. 25, Trump announced a plan to reopen the government for three weeks <U+2015> but if he doesn t get funding for his border wall by the end of the negotiation period on Feb. 15, Trump has said he is prepared to shut down the government again.At the State of the Union Tuesday, several Democratic lawmakers invited formerly furloughed federal workers as their guests, including 2020 presidential contender Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).Ahead of the State of the Union, AndrÈs told the Washingtonian he was attending  on behalf of the 11 million who are waiting to be a part of the American dream, on behalf of the Dreamers, on behalf of those children who are separated from their parents without any logical explanation. The chef has long spoken out on behalf of immigrants, particularly amid Trump s anti-immigrant rhetoric and his administration s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. At an event in 2017, the chef gave a speech wearing a shirt that read  I Am An Immigrant  and made a moving plea for all hardworking immigrants <U+2015> regardless of status. They are working every day with the same pride as you and I, documented or not,  Andres said of immigrants at the time.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Deripaska was also personally sanctioned because the U.S. accused him of threatening rivals  lives, bribing government officials and having links to organized crime   all of which Deripaska has denied.As part of the deal to lift the sanctions in what was stated to be an effort to dilute Deripaska s control, EN+, the parent of his aluminum company Rusal, announced seven new directors, four of them American or British. They include former Deutsche Bank executive Christopher Bancroft Burnham, who served on Trump s State Department transition team. Deripaska and Trump have both been clients of Deutsche Bank. The bank has paid billions of dollars in fines for money-laundering, interest rate manipulation and toxic mortgage assets.Deripaska was also once a client of Trump campaign manager and convicted felon Paul Manafort.Burnham also served as undersecretary general for management of the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration when John Bolton   now Trump s national security adviser   was the U.N. ambassador. Deripaska hailed the administration s move on the sanctions, even as it was condemned by Democrats, who called it a capitulation to the Kremlin and to an oligarch close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A majority of House Republicans voted with Democrats to maintain the sanctions against Deripaska s three companies. But by then the measure had already failed in the GOP-controlled Senate. Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), a longtime critic of lifting the sanctions, called it a  sordid deal  on Twitter, adding that the Trump administration works seven days a week on  favoritism for Russia.  He also accused the president of being more concerned about helping Russian businesses than paying U.S. federal workers amid the newly ended government shutdown.NEW: Ignoring House disapproval of this sordid deal, refusing to have Secretary Mnuchin testify, & seeking to preempt Senate disapproval, Trump Admin works 7 days/week with favoritism for Russia.Discussed Trump s Russian sanctions relief in @nytimes: https://t.co/gcVcFDorlmRepresents yet one more step in undermining the sanctions law, which President Trump has obstructed at every opportunity. Russian aggression remains unabated.Deripaska s companies, including energy firm JSC EuroSibEnergo, financed a months-long lobbying battle against the sanctions, arguing that the penalties would harm the international aluminum market and U.S. companies.The Treasury Department insisted that the sanctions deal involved a restructuring to  sever  Deripaska s control of the companies. But The New York Times reported that a confidential document revealed that Deripaska and his allies (including a foundation founded and funded by Deripaska and relatives) will retain majority ownership of EN+.Treasury issued a statement insisting that the  majority of directors on the En+ and Rusal boards will be independent directors [with] no business, professional or family ties to Deripaska. Doggett has described the deal as a  shell game.  The binding agreement obtained by the Times also included sanction relief provisions that could potentially free Deripaska from  hundreds of millions of dollars in debt,  the newspaper reported.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Texas Rep.

Last year I got a $750 refund,  Williams said.  And this year I owe $4,600. There are two reasons for Williams  predicament. The 35-year-old lost his refund both because Republicans targeted wealthy (and heavily Democratic) metropolitan areas for tax hikes and also because of how President Donald Trump s administration implemented the law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cut rates for taxpayers at every income level and simplified the tax code for most filers. Part of that simplification meant getting rid of a lot of deductions, which people use to reduce the amount of their taxable earnings. One of the most controversial changes limited the amount of state and local tax payments that could be deducted. Previously, a tax filer could reduce their federal taxable income by subtracting the income taxes they paid to their state and local governments. The law capped such deductions at $10,000. Williams said he usually pays more than three times that amount in state and local levies. While preparing to file his taxes through the H&R Block website this week, Williams said the blood drained from his face when he realized how much he would owe. He had anticipated getting another refund that he would put toward a vacation.  I guess that my assumption was that the IRS withholding tables would have been updated to some degree or my company would have done something,  he said. There is probably no way Williams could have avoided paying higher taxes, given his circumstances. But if the government had administered the tax law more carefully, he could have been spared the February surprise. Employers are supposed to withhold federal income tax from their workers  paychecks, and the vast majority of taxpayers typically withhold more than necessary, resulting in a refund in the early part of the year. The average refund is worth nearly $3,000. But Republicans rushed their tax cuts through Congress at the end of 2017, making huge changes to the tax code without so much as a hearing, and gave the IRS hardly any time to implement the law, which took effect less than two weeks after Trump signed it.The IRS had to scramble to figure how it should change the way tax would be withheld from paychecks for 2018. Officials with the Treasury Department told the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, that they felt they had to work with the same basic W-4 forms that employers were already using to determine withholding amounts. A trade group for payroll providers told the GAO that substantially different forms would necessitate changes to withholding software that would have taken at least half a year. The IRS knew from its simulations <U+2015> which assumed that people would not adjust their withholding amounts <U+2015> that just plugging new numbers into its old withholding tables would probably reduce the number of tax filers getting a refund from 76 percent to 73 percent, according to the July GAO report. The number that owed money would increase by a proportional amount. That means millions more households getting a bill from the IRS. In Treasury s simulations, households that itemized deductions, such as New Yorkers with higher local taxes, were likelier to withhold less tax as a percentage of their total liability.  That is the group that ends up paying more tax under the new law,  said Nathan Rigney, lead tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H&R Block.  It s the people in New York who are losing such a large amount of the [state and local tax] deduction they can end up owing more tax because their taxable income goes up by so much. Tax filing season opened at the end of January, and the government shutdown may have hampered the IRS  ability to process returns as quickly as in previous years. Around this time in 2018, the IRS said it had processed 30 million returns and dished out 13 million refunds. (The total for the year was 150 million returns and 111 million refunds.) Similar data is not yet available for this year. The new law cut taxes for 80 percent of households, with the biggest benefit accruing to the wealthier ones, according to the Tax Policy Center, while roughly 5 percent saw a tax increase. The changes should have been evident in paychecks last year, though incorrect withholding may have obscured the policy until now. Republicans knew in advance that the households negatively affected by their tax changes just so happen to be clustered in states where people tend to vote for Democrats. And according to the GAO, the Trump administration may have been more worried about people withholding too much instead of too little, even though the latter can stick people with surprise tax bills and penalties, and reduces overall compliance. Withholding too little, on the other hand, makes people s paychecks bigger immediately <U+2015> and the Trump administration wanted to make sure to help the people it intended to help. Treasury officials stated that withholding more from paychecks than in past years for taxpayers whose tax liability is expected to decrease would be inconsistent with the intent of the law as they understood it,  the GAO said.HuffPost readers: Tax bill surprise?

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) asked Whitaker whether he was involved in the January decision of the DOJ s Office of Legal Counsel to alter an established legal interpretation of the Federal Wire Act in order to further limit online gambling and whether he had any communications with Adelson or any of the billionaire s lobbyists. The new opinion reversed a 2011 OLC interpretation of the act that had applied a prohibition on online gambling strictly to online betting on sports. State officials fear that the expanded ban could imperil their online gaming industries and even negatively impact the administration of state lotteries.Whitaker said that he was not involved in the decision and that he has never personally met with or spoken to Adelson. Your inference that somehow that process was corrupted or corrupt is absolutely wrong and the premise of your question I reject,  the acting attorney general said.Raskin was not satisfied with Whitaker s answers. The congressman and constitutional law professor told HuffPost that he would submit more questions to Whitaker about the OLC interpretation after Friday s hearing. This definitely bears further investigation,  Raskin said.  When and where and by whom remains to be seen. The investigation may come from officials in states with legalized online gaming, Raskin said. The OLC s sudden change of heart caused some of them to wonder whether any improper influence from Adelson, the biggest political benefactor of the president and the Republican Party, had affected that new take on the law.Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, pumped at least $205 million into campaign and party committees and super PACs to support Republican politicians over the last two election cycles, according to Federal Election Commission records. The biggest contributions from the Adelsons went to super PACs that helped elect Trump and congressional Republicans. The couple donated $85 million to a super PAC supporting Senate Republicans, $70 million to a super PAC helping elect House Republicans and $30 million to two pro-Trump super PACs. Sheldon Adelson was also a major funder of a dark money nonprofit group that helped Trump win the 2016 election, according to The New York Times.More recently, the Adelsons contributed $500,000 to a legal defense fund set up for Trump and his associates who are being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. They were the only donors to the fund.The revised legal interpretation, issued during the partial federal government shutdown, relied on materials submitted to the Justice Department s lawyers by lobbyists for a group set up by Adelson, according to The Washington Post.Now some of the affected states are fighting back. The Justice Department should  withdraw its opinion  because it rests on faulty legal grounding and could undermine state laws regulating online gaming and lotteries, argued a Feb. 5 letter to the DOJ from New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Grewal and Shapiro also issued a Freedom of Information Act request for any communications between the department and Adelson and his lobbyists.Besides the new interpretation itself, questions are being raised about its timing. Whitaker and others from the DOJ met with White House officials during the government shutdown to tell them of the plan to issue the new interpretation, according to The Intercept. This meeting came ahead of the Senate s confirmation hearing for William Barr, Trump s choice for a permanent attorney general. Barr had previously stated that he had no interest in reversing the 2011 OLC opinion.Since 2014, Adelson, the owner of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation <U+2015> which runs casinos in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore <U+2015> has led an effort to persuade politicians in Washington to ban all online gambling. The 85-year-old billionaire argues that the legalization of online gaming will hurt the bottom line for casinos. Banning or restricting online gaming, on the other hand, would hurt his competitors like MGM that invested in the new industry after the 2011 ruling.So Adelson launched the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling and hired a bevy of revolving-door lobbyists, including former Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and former Republican Gov. George Pataki of New York. Social conservatives like Ralph Reed were encouraged to rally the grassroots. The lobbying group doesn t campaign on the grounds that Adelson s hefty pocketbook may suffer from online gaming. Instead, the coalition argues that online gaming is bad for the children.The Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling initially sought to pass federal legislation to achieve its goal. But bills introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and then-Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) floundered in Congress amid opposition from both parties and lobbying from those casino companies that had invested in online gaming. Adelson s lobbying group then focused on convincing the Justice Department to simply issue a new legal opinion overturning the old one.Charles Cooper, a Washington lawyer working for Adelson, lobbied the Justice Department, sending a memo in 2017 that made the legal argument for upending the 2011 opinion, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.January s reversal wasn t the first big victory for Adelson under the Trump administration. Adelson is a longtime supporter of right-wing political parties in Israel and the idea of locating the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. In May 2018, he was a guest of honor at the opening of the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem after Trump decided to move it from Tel Aviv.The Trump administration s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal was also sought by Adelson, who had previously suggested the U.S. use its own nuclear weapons to destroy Iran s nascent nuclear program. Trump lobbied Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on behalf of Adelson s efforts to liberalize Japan s gaming laws and allow him to expand his Asian casino operations. And last year Trump awarded Miriam Adelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation s highest civilian honor, just one month after she contributed to his legal defense fund.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

He warned Trump that such a declaration might split the GOP and that Congress could pass a resolution opposing it, two Republican sources familiar with the conversation told the newspaper.In such a situation Trump might be forced into the first veto of his presidency   against his own party, McConnell pointed out, according to the sources.The exchange reportedly occurred in a face-to-face meeting in the White House that involved only the two men.It s difficult to know if the president s repeated threats to declare an emergency to take the legislature out of the picture to build the wall are just bluff or serious. Trump has insisted he will not agree to any deal unless it includes money for a wall. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) flatly told reporters Thursday:  There s not going to be any wall money in the legislation. The temporary funding bill that re-opened parts of the government expires Feb. 15. We will be looking at a national emergency because I don t think anything s going to happen  concerning an agreement, Trump told reporters at the White House.Some GOP legislators have already spoken out against an emergency declaration   and against another government shutdown. GOP Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said that an emergency declaration was a  terrible idea  and that he would oppose it. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said last month that to  give the president authority basically to do that all by himself would, I think, stretch constitutional boundaries. McConnell has expressed support for some kind of negotiated agreement.  I m for whatever works, which means avoiding a shutdown and avoiding the president feeling he should declare a national emergency,  McConnell said in his weekly news conference in the Capitol.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

These builders of walls that sow fear are looking to divide people and box them in,  the pope said during the opening ceremony of World Youth Day in Panama City. What do you want to be?  Francis asked the estimated 250,000 young people assembled for the rally. Builders of bridges,  his audience replied, according to a video of the ceremony published on YouTube by Vatican News.  Francis, the Catholic Church s first Latin American pope, also praised the youth for joining together for the rally, even though they come from diverse cultures and speak many different languages.During his flight to Central America on Wednesday, Francis responded to a reporter s question about the border wall by stating that the irrational fear of migration drives people  crazy.  On Thursday, he urged Central American church leaders, dioceses and parishes to help the rest of society overcome its fears about migration by welcoming migrants.  The Church, by virtue of her universality, can provide the fraternal hospitality and acceptance that can enable the communities of origin and of destination to dialogue and to help overcome fears and suspicions, and thus to consolidate the very bonds that migrations <U+2015> in the collective imagination <U+2015> threaten to break,  Francis said during a bishops  meeting. Francis  comments come during a partial government shutdown in the U.S. that was triggered by a dispute between Trump, who wants more than $5 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, and Democrats in Congress, who don t want to allocate any new money for it. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has affected 800,000 federal workers.Francis has made the plight of migrants and refugees one of the key issues of his papacy. In the past, he s made many pronouncements on the morality of a border wall.In 2016, while Trump was still a presidential candidate, Francis responded to a reporter s question about Trump s proposed border wall by suggesting that  a person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. In 2017, days after Trump released the first iteration of a travel ban temporarily halting refugee admissions and blocking immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Francis issued another strong indictment of walls. In the social and civil context as well, I appeal not to create walls but to build bridges,  he said during a catechism lesson.Catholic youth groups from around the globe attend World Youth Day, which is held every two to three years. The event is meant to revitalize young Catholics  faith.As part of his five-day trip to Panama, Francis also met with the country s President Juan Carlos Varela at the presidential palace. On Friday, Francis visited a juvenile detention center to hear the confessions of youth unable to attend World Youth Day.Francis is scheduled to stay in Panama until Sunday.

Amy Klobuchar s nascent 2020 presidential campaign   and done so in part because of the Minnesota Democrat s history of mistreating her staff, HuffPost has learned.Klobuchar, who plans to make an announcement about a potential presidential bid on Sunday in Minneapolis, has spent the past several months positioning herself to run for president. She s beloved in her state as a smart, funny and personable lawmaker and has gained national attention for her lines of questioning at high-profile hearings.But some former Klobuchar staffers, all of whom spoke to HuffPost on condition of anonymity, describe Klobuchar as habitually demeaning and prone to bursts of cruelty that make it difficult to work in her office for long. It is common for staff to wake up to multiple emails from Klobuchar characterizing one s work as  the worst  briefing or press release she d seen in her decades of public service, according to two former aides and emails seen by HuffPost.Although some staffers grew inured to her constant put-downs ( It s always  the worst,   one said sarcastically,   It was  the worst  one two weeks ago ), others found it grinding and demoralizing. Adding to the humiliation, Klobuchar often cc d large groups of staffers who weren t working on the topic at hand, giving the emails the effect of a public flogging. Senator Klobuchar loves her staff <U+2015> they are the reason she has gotten to where she is today,  a campaign spokesperson told HuffPost.  She has many staff who have been with her for years <U+2015> including her Chief of Staff and her State Director, who have worked for her for 5 and 7 years respectively <U+2015> and many who have gone on to do amazing things, from working in the Obama Administration (over 20 of them) to running for office to even serving as the Agriculture Commissioner for Minnesota. She is proud of them and the work they have done for Minnesota. Some people who worked for Klobuchar say they valued the experience: Klobuchar has an unrivaled command of details, puts in long, enthusiastic hours, and simply demands that her office meet those same high standards, several former staffers maintained. Those employees described working for her as a challenge, but an exhilarating one that caused them to grow and perform their best work. They question whether former co-workers who thought she was abusive were falling for sexist stereotypes about female leaders with high standards. Reached for comment, Klobuchar s office referred HuffPost to multiple ex-staffers who shared glowing statements about working for her. I ve heard people say she s tough to work for and I sometimes cringe when I hear it because I rarely hear that said about male bosses in Congress despite the fact that half of Congress is tough to work for,  said Tristan Brown, a former legislative aide who called Klobuchar  probably the most brilliant, hardworking person I ve had the privilege to work for. Erik Garcia Luna, who worked in Klobuchar s Minneapolis office from 2009 to 2014, remembers her as kind. He said that she called her staffers during the 2013 government shutdown to check in with them and make sure they and their families were taken care of. He said he had no idea why there were such divergent views from people who had worked for the senator:  I don t know what to make of them, to be frank. Do you have more information on what it s like to work for Sen. Klobuchar   or other members of Congress? Get in touch: scoops@huffpost.comWhat is indisputable, however, is that Klobuchar s office consistently has one of the highest rates of staff turnover in the Senate. Klobuchar s rate of turnover ranked No. 1 in an analysis of all Senate staff salaries between 2001 and 2016, conducted by LegiStorm, a widely used database of congressional staff salaries. (Klobuchar was sworn into office in 2007.) She s now third, behind Maryland Democrat Chris Van Hollen and Louisiana Republican John Kennedy. And this is not the first time Klobuchar has had issues building a team because of worries about her mistreatment of staff.A former employee in her Senate office recalled her struggling to find an outside candidate to replace an outgoing chief of staff. A staffer in another Hill office recounted losing interest in a job opening with Klobuchar when a current staffer, the one conducting the interview, conveyed that avoiding Klobuchar s anger was a significant part of the job.The senator has acknowledged she has  high expectations,  but many people who have worked with Klobuchar or interacted with her and her staff say her treatment of staff goes beyond the normal expectations of excelling in a job. Three former staffers said Klobuchar has tasked them or their co-workers with performing personal errands, such as making her personal appointments, washing dishes at her home or picking up her dry cleaning.Senate staff are generally prohibited by Senate ethics rules from performing personal duties for members.However, the practice is also common on Capitol Hill. A former staffer who was never aware of Klobuchar tasking a staffer with personal chores said many lawmakers make such requests.  The honest truth to this is, there are a lot of people [in Congress] who really take advantage of office staff,  the former staffer said.In egregious cases, members of the House of Representatives who violated rules against personal use of staff have been subject to ethics investigations.The reality of working for Klobuchar is at odds with the Midwestern-nice image she has cultivated in public: an unflappable workhorse and  the senator next door,  which was the title of her 2015 memoir.One morning several years ago, when most of the office staff was running late   the ex-staffer couldn t remember the reason   Klobuchar wrote out tardy slips and placed them on each missing aide s desk. The staffer recalls incredulous bursts of laughter as her co-workers arrived one by one to find the notes, but Klobuchar was deadly serious. An aide whom she called into her office walked back out in tears. She was constantly lighting new fires,  a former staffer said, sometimes at the expense of focusing on legislative work. When you have people who don t want to work for you, you can t be as effective,  the staffer added.Kevin Robillard contributed reporting.

The group convened for about an hour in the Roosevelt Room, where Trump sat  saying little but appearing taken aback,  the Times reported citing three unnamed sources familiar with the matter. They began with a prayer, the paper s sources said. Attendees also prayed at various times throughout the session. Thomas, who operates a one-woman political consultancy, has been criticized in recent months for pushing more obviously partisan messages than some deem appropriate for the spouse of a justice of the Supreme Court, an institution that has recently seen its impartiality questioned.Over Facebook, she regularly posts unvarnished praise for Trump and slams Democratic leadership. This week, she shared a racist meme about immigrants. (Not her first.) Thomas once called the Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivors  dangerous to the survival of our nation  because of their battle for stronger gun control policy. Others at the meeting were Connie Hair, chief of staff to Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas); Frank Gaffney, an anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist; and Rosemary Jenks, who works for the anti-immigration group NumbersUSA <U+2015> along with around six White House aides, the Times reported.Thomas and Hair were particularly hung up on certain administrative appointments they wanted Trump to make, accusing White House aides of blocking them, according to the report. One woman present reportedly argued that all women should be barred from military service due to their physical differences from men.Someone also told the president that Republican congressional leaders should be  tarred and feathered  over the partial government shutdown, although the attendees apparently did not say what the leaders should have been doing. While news of the meeting comes just after the White House agreed to temporarily reopen the federal government, at the time the shutdown would have seemed indefinite. At one point, Trump pulled his daughter Ivanka Trump, who is also a White House aide, into the meeting,  saying she would be beloved if she were serving a liberal president, instead of getting negative news coverage. The unusual meeting reportedly came to be after the president and first lady dined with the justice and his wife but had been delayed for months, the Times said.

He then sentenced each of the defendants to at least 25 years in federal prison.Three Kansas men <U+2015> Curtis Allen, Patrick Stein and Gavin Wright <U+2015> were convicted last April on weapons of mass destruction and civil rights charges for plotting to bomb a Garden City, Kansas, apartment complex predominantly occupied by Somali refugees. U.S. District Judge Eric Melgren sentenced Allen, a 52-year-old Iraq War veteran, to 25 years in prison plus 10 years of supervised release on Friday. Stein <U+2015> who used some of the most extreme rhetoric in the case <U+2015> received 30 years behind bars. Wright was sentenced to 26 years in prison.Stein did not offer any direct apology for his actions at his sentencing, and the judge said he did not appear to feel any remorse.  I take full responsibility for everything I said and everything I did. Nobody forced me to do any of it,  Stein said before Melgren imposed his sentence.Allen, however, did seem to show remorse. He had prepared remarks but was unable to finish them without breaking down.  I m just ashamed of myself, and I m sorry,  he said. The federal public defenders representing Allen argued in a sentencing memo that his  misguided patriotism was inflamed by the rhetoric of the 2016 political climate and the influence of the Russian information warfare campaign against the American people.  They cited extremist Facebook ads and pages that he likely saw on his feed that turned out to be part of a Russian propaganda operation meant to boost Trump s campaign. I did a lot of eye rolling, candidly, when reading that in the briefs,  Melgren said Friday. He said that he didn t want to downplay foreign interference in the election but that by running ads, the Russians  were doing nothing more  than what political campaigns did on a regular basis. He said that only someone who wasn t a student of U.S. history could say that the 2016 campaign season was particularly heated.  We ve had highly charged campaigns before,  he said.Attorneys for the men asked the judge to consider Trump s rhetoric about Muslims when sentencing them.Rich Federico, a federal public defender representing Allen, said that the defense team was  not blaming the Russians here  but that many of the ads that Allen viewed on Facebook were later revealed to be part of Russia s propaganda campaign and they could have had an influence on his conduct.Federal prosecutors wanted all three defendants to spend the rest of their lives behind bars.  The defendants stand before the Court convicted of a conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction to commit a mass murder that would send both a message and a threat: that Muslims are not welcome in America, and, unless the U.S. Government changed its immigration policies, more carnage would follow,  they wrote in a sentencing memorandum. Melgren ruled on Jan. 15 that terrorism enhancements and civil rights enhancements should apply in the case but decided to impose sentences outside the sentencing guidelines (which call for life imprisonment).Stein s lawyers, who argued that he was caught up in the  chaos  environment of 2016, said the context of Trump s anti-Muslim rhetoric was impossible to ignore. The court cannot ignore the circumstances of one of the most rhetorically mold-breaking, violent, awful, hateful and contentious presidential elections in modern history, driven in large measure by the rhetorical China shop bull who is now our president,  they wrote in a sentencing memo.Wright s attorneys also emphasized the impact of Trump s anti-Muslim rhetoric. Intellectual honesty requires this Court to confront a certain reality. As long as the White House with impunity calls Islam  a dangerous threat,  and paints average Americans as  victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad,  a mixed signal gets sent,  they wrote.  The President warns Americans that radical Muslims are  trying to take over our children.  The Commander-in-Chief exonerates violent extremists in Charlottesville as  good people,  while claiming that Muslims  by and large  want to  subjugate  the rest of the world. As long as the executive branch  condemns Islam and commends and encourages violence against would-be enemies, then a sentence imposed by the Judicial Branch does little to deter people generally from engaging in such conduct if they believe they are protecting their countries from enemies identified by their own Commander-in-Chief,  Wright s attorneys argued.(Because of the partial government shutdown over Trump s demand for billions of taxpayer dollars for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, federal prosecutors and FBI agents have been working the case without getting paid. On Friday the president announced a deal to reopen the government through Feb. 15 while negotiations continue over the wall and other border security issues.)This story has been updated to include details from the sentencing hearings.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Stacey Abrams will deliver the party s response to the State of the Union address, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Tuesday.  Three weeks ago I called Stacey Abrams and asked her to deliver a response to the state of the union,  he said. Chuck Schumer confirms the reporting from @chrislhayes: He asked Stacey Abrams three weeks ago to deliver the State of the Union response. She agreed, Schumer says. She has led the charge for voting rights, which is at the root of just about everything else.  Via ABC pic.twitter.com/kvD9dqhy8mAbrams confirmed the news on Tuesday afternoon. At a moment when our nation needs to hear from leaders who can unite for a common purpose, I am honored to be delivering the Democratic State of the Union response,  she tweeted.The decision to ask Abrams, who doesn t currently hold office but made history as the first black woman to be a major party nominee for a gubernatorial race last year, is a break from the standard practice of asking a longstanding member of U.S. Congress to deliver the party s response.  She is just a great spokesperson,  Schumer said Tuesday.  She s an incredible leader. She has led the charge for voting rights, which is at the root of just about everything else. The news was first reported earlier in the day by MSNBC s Chris Hayes.<U+0001F6A8>NEWS<U+0001F6A8>A reliable source tells me that Chuck Schumer called STACEY ABRAMS three weeks ago to ask her to deliver the Democratic response to the State of the Union.Democratic leaders also announced that California Attorney General Xavier Becerra would deliver a Spanish-language response to President Donald Trump s address.In an election plagued by reports of voter suppression in November, Abrams narrowly lost the Georgia gubernatorial race to Republican opponent Brian Kemp. She said last month that she plans to run for political office again. Despite her loss, she emerged as one of the many female minority trailblazers shaking up the party. Fair Fight Georgia, a voting rights organization Abrams founded after the election, has filed a federal lawsuit against Georgia election officials, alleging that they mismanaged the 2018 election. She is awaiting a response from them due by the end of this month.Trump is scheduled to deliver the State of the Union address next Tuesday at the request of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who battled with the president over an appropriate date in light of the partial government shutdown.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has been dubbed Congress  unofficial queen of social media.And now other Democrats want in on her success.The House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee tapped the 29-year-old congresswoman to teach her colleagues how to use Twitter  as an effective and authentic messaging tool  to connect with constituents, according to a notice sent to Democrats and obtained by CNN.Ocasio-Cortez, who has amassed 2.42 million Twitter followers, confirmed late Wednesday that she would be teaching the class Thursday. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) will co-teach the session, which is open to all members.Perks of being in the Democratic Caucus: I will be teaching a Twitter class tomorrow morning open to all members <U+0001F469><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+0001F3EB><U+0001F423> https://t.co/5DD82ndThRThursday s session will also go over  the importance of digital media storytelling,  a topic that has yet to be fully embraced by many members of Congress. The older generation of members and senators is pretty clueless on the social media platforms,  Himes told USA Today, noting that some members of Congress get 25-year-old staff members to manage their social media accounts.Some members of Congress also fall painfully flat when trying to utilize digital platforms.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, used an Instagram live-stream to announce her 2020 presidential run, then was mocked on Twitter after she declared she was  gonna get me a beer.  Other congressional Twitter feeds look more like a bulletin board than a place for discussion. I don t always drink beer. But when I m trying to look relatable, I do it on Instagram.  -Elizabeth Warrenhttps://t.co/YE5VyjVtLi pic.twitter.com/dTeeqlwtxQOcasio-Cortez, on the other hand, is effortlessly relatable on social media, giving her fans an inside look at life in Congress while also getting real about her policy positions.In a live-stream of her new member orientation, she geeked over and over again as she showed off her swag bag, discovered what she called Hogwarts (more formally known as the Library of Congress) and did coin laundry. On Wednesday, she tweeted photos of her and her staff looking for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) so they can talk about the government shutdown.800,000 workers are missing their paychecks and we re pushing to get them paid ASAP.We re here doing our job - the House has voted to reopen government whole or in part several times - so why can t we find GOP Senators to ask them do theirs? #WheresMitch pic.twitter.com/FogCPg6ayZThanks to everyone who joined me last night for my first Instagram Live Cook + Q&A!It was great answering questions casual and political alike from constituents and supporters across the country.See you next time! https://t.co/j1GZIfsqEtPeople keep giving me directions to the spouse and intern events instead of the ones for members of Congress <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>Even campaigns to smear her on social media seem to work in her favor. When a right-wing Twitter account attempted to  expose  Ocasio-Cortez with a video of her dancing on a roof, it backfired by going viral in her favor. Then she made a new dancing video, this time at her office on Capitol Hill. I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous,  she wrote in a tweet liked more than 787,000 times.  Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too. She s also quick to quip back at her haters on Twitter. Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker attempted to mock Ocasio-Cortez s proposal for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on annual earnings above $10 million with an analogy, but she used his own joke against him. Explaining marginal taxes to a far-right former Governor:Imagine if you did chores for abuela & she gave you $10. When you got home, you got to keep it, because it s only $10.Then we taxed the billionaire in town because he s making tons of money underpaying the townspeople. https://t.co/Wcnn2sEgekRepresentatives of Twitter and the House Administration Committee will be at Himes and Ocasio-Cortez s social media session Thursday.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

To say [Pelosi] has mastered the art of dealing with President Trump would be a gross understatement,  the conservative Washington Post columnist wrote on Wednesday. The trick, Rubin said, is to treat Trump like a toddler in the middle of a meltdown. Pelosi sent a letter to Trump on Wednesday asking to postpone the State of the Union address due to the government shutdown and security issues. Or, as Rubin put it,  she s taking away the president s TV  in response to his  nearly month-long temper tantrum. Rubin added: You wonder why in the world Democrats ever considered replacing her.

There s not going to be any wall money in the legislation,  Pelosi told reporters on Thursday.Nancy Pelosi on the conference committee negotiations:  There will not be any wall money in the legislation.  pic.twitter.com/WTrbqWlJhlPelosi also rejected the idea of trading temporary protections for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in exchange for a permanent border wall, as Trump proposed earlier in January. Those protections were there until you decided to take them away, so now you re going to come back and say,  I ll give them to you for three years  <U+2015> that is not a protection,  she said.  A protection is something that has certainty to it. Trump reached an agreement with Democrats last week that offered a temporary reprieve from the 35-day partial government shutdown and tasked a bicameral committee with reaching a broader border security deal.The president didn t get his wall money, but said he was granting Democrats an opportunity to further consider his demand for $5.7 billion in funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump has repeatedly insisted that the measure is necessary to lower crime and suppress the supposed influx of drugs across the border. The committee held its first meeting on Wednesday to start working on a new border deal, but gained little ground.Trump tweeted that if the lawmakers were  not discussing or contemplating a Wall or Physical Barrier, they are Wasting their time! Meanwhile, Democrats said they support enhancing security measures   including improvements to ports of entry and additional aircraft, vessels and Border Patrol agents   but oppose new construction of a wall on the border. Smart border security is not overly reliant on physical barriers, which the Trump administration has failed to demonstrate are cost-effective compared to better technology and more personnel,  House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday.On Thursday, Trump claimed on Twitter that the  Humanitarian Crisis taking place  at the border is  worse even than Afghanistan.

In a morning tweet, the president offered encouragement to politicians in several states who have pushed legislation that would allow public schools to offer an optional elective course on the historical significance of the Bible. Numerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible,  Trump wrote.  Starting to make a turn back? Great! Numerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible. Starting to make a turn back? Great!He posted the tweet soon after a  Fox & Friends  segment reporting that at least six states <U+2015> North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia, Virginia and Florida <U+2015> have seen the introduction of Bible literacy legislation this year. North Dakota state Rep. Aaron McWilliams, who is co-sponsoring a Bible literacy measure, appeared on the conservative talk show Monday morning to defend these bills.Under his bill, the Bible courses would be entirely optional for schools to offer and for students to take, McWilliams said. The classes, he explained, would explore the Bible s influence on history, legal systems, America s founding fathers <U+2015> and other much broader concepts. The concept of forgiveness, the concept of recompense, these are things that all come from the Bible,  McWilliams said.  If we don t have a good foundational understanding of this, we re not going to understand how the founding fathers of our country and other countries put it together to have the world that we have today. Watch the  Fox & Friends  segment with McWilliams below.Trump s approval of Bible literacy classes drew backlash from some of his critics on Twitter, with many chiming in to question his scriptural bona fides.The president, who identifies as a Presbyterian, has repeatedly claimed that the Bible is his favorite book. Yet he s had a few public blunders when asked to display his own knowledge of the Scriptures. He said in 2016 that his favorite Bible verse is the one that demands  an eye for an eye  as punishment for crimes. But that verse from Exodus was later specifically addressed by Jesus, who told his followers to  turn the other cheek  to their enemies instead.During a visit to Liberty University the same year, Trump famously referred to the biblical book Second Corinthians as  Two Corinthians,  eliciting some snickers from students at the evangelical school.Family Research Council president Tony Perkins, a longtime Trump ally who helped craft the Liberty University speech, later admitted that the presidential candidate s botched reference  shows that he s not familiar with the Bible. Trump s ability to quote Scripture appears to have improved after he was elected to the White House, including in speeches after the Las Vegas and Parkland, Florida, mass shootings.  Still, some Christian and Jewish Americans suggested on Monday that there were other Bible verses the president should familiarize himself with. Some pointed out that the Bible calls on people of faith to welcome the stranger <U+2015> something Trump s critics believe his immigration policies have failed to do.Bible literacy? Excellent! Lesson one: show compassion and care for the stranger and resident alien among us. https://t.co/cp8iY1Y9crWill the Bible Literacy classes cover God s heart for immigrants? https://t.co/UtTBnEiOPdFrom this week s Torah reading: You shall not oppress the stranger, since you know the feelings of the stranger, having been strangers in the land of Egypt.

You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love that person as yourself. Lev. 19:33 https://t.co/Pk1HwOEdiZOthers pointed out that the Bible often presents God as a defender of the poor, the sick and the powerless <U+2015> and that it calls on religious people to show compassion for those marginalized members of society. Good idea. I d suggest we start with the passages that talk about welcoming the stranger, helping the poor, forgiving those who have wronged you, praying for your enemies, turning away from the love of money, embracing humility and leading a life of love, mercy and compassion. https://t.co/tJd5nIdW0AThe Bible tells the story of the God who has worked thru poor & rejected people to build a movement that lifts up the humble & removes the mighty from their thrones. #BiblicalLiteracy #PoorPeoplesCampaign pic.twitter.com/C6VE1Oyqi3 The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.

He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.  (Luke 1:50ñ53) https://t.co/b4HqNtZEAATwitter users noted that this responsibility to care for the marginalized doesn t extend only to individuals. The Bible, they said, calls on governments to be just, too. Before @realDonaldTrump celebrates #BiblicalLiteracy, he should read the more than 2000 Scriptures on how governments & politicians are called to treat the poor, immigrants, the sick, women & children. B/c his policies are not in line with the call of love & justice in the Bible https://t.co/TZ4TfYq4OT Woe to those who make unjust laws, to those who issue oppressive decrees, to deprive the poor of their rights and withhold justice from the oppressed of my people.  #BibleLiteracy https://t.co/GmDAqUjineRachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, described Trump s tweet as an attempt to  pander to his Religious Right base,  particularly in light of recent polling that suggests his approval rating among white evangelicals dipped during the partial government shutdown. As the leader of our diverse nation, the President should support religious freedom for all, not a select few <U+2015> and these bills do just the opposite,  Laser told HuffPost in an email.In 2018, lawmakers in Alabama, Iowa and West Virginia floated Bible literacy bills that were eventually defeated, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The effort had been more successful the previous year in Kentucky, where lawmakers passed a bill that allowed Bible courses to be taught in public schools. The ACLU contends that, in practice, these classes in Kentucky often flout constitutional restrictions that prohibit public school teachers from proselytizing students. Americans United for Separation of Church and State says these bills are part of a larger coordinated campaign by Christian nationalist groups. The effort, dubbed Project Blitz, seeks to flood state legislatures across the country with centrally crafted  model  bills that promote conservative Christian views.Along with the Bible literacy bills, there s been a recent push to have the national motto  In God We Trust  posted on public property, including public schools. Lawmakers in Alaska, Kentucky, Missouri, South Carolina and Indiana have already introduced  In God We Trust  bills this year. Project Blitz has also been associated with bills that seek to allow workers in the private and public sectors to deny service to LGBTQ people and others based on the workers  religious beliefs.  As evidenced by Project Blitz, the goal of these [Biblical literacy] bills is not to have an objective discussion about the Bible at all but to promote Christianity and ultimately to push a more aggressive political agenda that allows religion to be used to discriminate,  Laser said.

Listeria  can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems,  the announcement stated.No illnesses have been reported in connection with the possible contamination, which was made public just one day before the end of the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.The affected fruit was distributed at  small retail establishments  in Alabama, California, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia.Fruit sold in the following Walmart, Costco, Aldi, Fairway Market, Hannaford and Market Basket stores are also subject to the recall:Some 1,727 cartons of peaches, 1,207 cartons of nectarines and 365 cartons of plums are being recalled.

Al Sharpton called Donald Trump the  most insensitive president we ve seen in our lifetime. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) branded Trump s election a  giant step back  for all the things Martin Luther King Jr. believed in.Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.) dubbed Trump  a reality TV star trying to drag us into an episode. But at the National Action Network s annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration in Harlem, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries  (D-N.Y.) anti-Trump riff left the biggest mark. These are challenging times in the United States of America. We have a hater in the White House: the birther in chief, the grand wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,  Jeffries said, referencing the head position of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan. The remark drew guffaws and cheers from the hundreds of people in attendance. One of the things that we ve learned is that while Jim Crow might be dead, he s still got some nieces and nephews who are alive and well,  Jeffries added.The comments, which immediately went viral on social media, reflected the degree to which Democrats were using the national holiday commemorating the birth of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. to paint Trump and Republicans as enemies of King s vision.Of course, Trump has given Democrats ample ammunition <U+2015> not merely in his long record of racist comments and hard-line immigration policies, but also in his response to MLK Day this year.  Trump and Vice President Mike Pence visited the King monument in Washington on Monday following criticism that the White House had not planned any official events to mark the holiday.Sharpton lit into Trump over the absence of events at an MLK Day event in Washington on Monday morning and again in Harlem that afternoon, calling the last-minute gesture a  drive-by,  since Trump was driven there in a hastily planned visit.Sharpton also noted the irony that MLK Day comes during the longest-ever partial shutdown of the federal government. King was assassinated while advocating for striking Memphis, Tennessee, sanitation workers <U+2015> public employees just like the 800,000 federal workers who have missed at least one paycheck so far due to the shutdown. There could be nothing more offensive to the legacy of Martin Luther King  than to keep those workers from getting paid on time, Sharpton said.The Trump administration seemed to invite these kinds of comparisons themselves. Speaking on CBS   Face the Nation  on Sunday, Pence argued that King s leadership should inspire a resolution to the impasse over border wall funding that has kept the government shutdown going. One of my favorite quotes from Dr. King was,  Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy,   he said.  You think of how he changed America; he inspired us to change through the legislative process. In recent years, progressive politicians and activists have sought to restore King s legacy to its radical roots, which they argue has been sanitized to exclude the controversial beliefs he espoused toward the end of his life. King elicited ire from many of his onetime establishment allies for speaking out so vocally against the Vietnam War and for the kinds of social democratic policies he believed were necessary to eradicate poverty.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) was one of the speakers at the National Action Network celebration to highlight King s less well-known quest for economic equality.  It s not the whole Dr. King that a lot of times is remembered,  de Blasio said.  Dr. King spoke about a struggle for justice, and not just racial justice, as I said   he believed you could not have racial justice without economic justice. De Blasio used the occasion to tout the city s plans to guarantee health care to all residents. He also announced that in the interest of trying to  live in Dr. King s image in today s world,  the city planned to mandate two weeks of annual paid time off for every New York City worker. Here in this city, we re going to lead the way. We re going to show what can be done,  de Blasio declared.  We re going to show that working people will get the wages they deserve, the benefits they deserve, the life they deserve. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

But Democrats are far from convinced that Barr <U+2015> who s been nominated to replace frequent Trump foil and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions <U+2015> would protect the Russia probe, and plan to use Barr s confirmation hearing on Tuesday to extract additional commitments.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) <U+2015> in a letter obtained by HuffPost that the senator hand-delivered to the 68-year-old Barr at a meeting on Thursday <U+2015> laid out several lines of questioning ahead of Barr s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday morning. Whitehouse raised a number of questions he had for Barr about his communications with the Trump White House, Justice Department officials, and Trump s legal team.Whitehouse s letter zeroes in on an unsolicited June 8, 2018 memorandum that Barr sent to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, whose anticipated departure has only heightened Democratic concerns about Barr s appointment. Barr s 19-page memo suggested that it wasn t legitimate for Mueller to investigate whether the president obstructed justice by pressuring former FBI Director James Comey to drop the FBI investigation of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn. In the letter, Whitehouse also raised concerns that Trump might want Barr to play the role of Robert Bork, the former solicitor general who <U+2015> after Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned in protest <U+2015> followed President Richard Nixon s order to fire independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox as he investigated Nixon s role in Watergate. Whitehouse wrote about an agreement that Bork, then acting attorney general, signed in the wake of what became known as the  Saturday Night Massacre  that offered assurances about the independence of Leon Jaworkski, who replaced Cox as special prosecutor.   Your agreement to follow in the footsteps of Robert Bork would provide significant assurances to those who fear your appointment is a prelude to another Saturday Night Massacre,  Whitehouse wrote to Barr.Barr s confirmation hearing should make for compelling television. The Senate Judiciary Committee, now chaired by frequent Trump defender Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), includes several prominent Democrats, including a few who are expected to seek the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The hearing is taking place as the nearly 20-month-old Mueller probe enters a pivotal stage, as Mueller appears to be wrapping up his investigation and preparing a highly anticipated report on his conclusions that might jump-start a movement to impeach Trump in the Democratic-controlled House. And it all comes amid an ongoing partial government shutdown, which has left much of the Justice Department Barr hopes to head furloughed or working without pay. Republicans control the Senate with 53 members, so Democrats can t do much to stop his confirmation on their own. But they can press Barr for commitments to insure the independence of the Mueller investigation as it enters a crucial timeframe.Barr, in prepared remarks provided to reporters ahead of Tuesday s hearing, seemed to be operating under the notion that he would seize control of the Mueller investigation after his confirmation. His prepared opening remarks make no reference to consulting with career ethics officials within DOJ about whether his unsolicited memo about the Mueller probe created an appearance of impropriety that might suggest he should recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who defended Trump on cable news before joining the Justice Department, rejected the advice of a DOJ ethics official who suggested he should recuse himself from the Mueller investigation. Whitaker, who was not confirmed by the Senate during the Trump administration, had faced questions over the legitimacy of his unprecedented appointment as acting attorney general following Sessions  forced resignation after the 2018 midterms.Barr s opening statement, however, operates on the assumption that he would in fact be in charge of the Mueller investigation upon his confirmation. If confirmed, I will not permit partisan politics, personal interests, or any other improper considerations to interfere with this or any other investigation,  Barr will say in his prepared remarks.  I will follow the Special Counsel regulations scrupulously and in good faith, and on my watch, Bob will be allowed to complete his work. Barr will also tell senators that he didn t pursue the position, and that he was  reluctant to be considered  when his name first came up because he s 68,  partially retired, and nearing the end of a long legal career.  He ll say that he and his wife were looking forward to spending time with their family, note that he d already had the gig before, and say he ultimately decided to accept the nomination because he believed in public service.At least one Democrat on the committee said he thought that Barr s opening statement offers some reassurances, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Monday that Barr set a  good tone  with his prepared remarks before the committee, adding that he  helped himself significantly  by addressing some questions regarding his past criticisms of the Mueller investigation.The Senate Foreign Relations Committee member added, however, that he still has outstanding concerns about Barr s views on presidential power, the use of pardons, and his willingness to submit to advice from the department s ethics officials. His last confirmation hearing was 27 years ago <U+2015> we can t pretend that these are similar times. These are very different times and I think its very important he makes his commitment to the rule of law and, in particular, the protection of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller,  Coons said during a conference call with reporters.Additional reporting by Igor Bobic.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The Guatemala native s attorney advised her not to return to work after revealing her immigration status to The New York Times in December, and she currently faces deportation.Morales will attend Trump s State of the Union speech as a guest of Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), a member of the House Homeland Security Committee. The Washington Post first reported the invitation, which Watson Coleman s office later confirmed in a news release. President Trump justified shutting the government down for five weeks by demonizing immigrants as the scourge of the country and the root of our nation s crime and insecurity,  the news release said.  We need to implement a true bipartisan immigration reform plan <U+2015> one that both secures our border and establishes a pathway to citizenship for people like Victorina, who are positively contributing to our communities. Today, I invited Victorina Morales, a constituent, as my guest at the #SOTU, Ms. Morales, an undocumented immigrant, was fired from the Trump National Golf Club, and has since campaigned for rights and fair treatment for undocumented immigrants. https://t.co/o8bjrSojpl pic.twitter.com/WaVvkOTSZcThe invitation came after reports of the Trump Organization failing to properly check its employees  work status while the president himself demanded $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The wall demand led to the government shutdown that recently ended after 35 days.The president s son Eric Trump said Tuesday that the organization plans to institute E-Verify, a federal program that allows employers to check employees  immigration status.Elected officials will sometimes use the opportunity to invite a guest to the State of the Union as a way to make a social or political statement. Trump used his first address in 2017 to invite relatives of people he said were killed by undocumented immigrants. President Barack Obama in 2016 invited a Dreamer, an undocumented immigrant brought to the U.S. as a child, who served in the military.Morales, who came to the U.S. illegally in 1999, has been vocally campaigning for fair treatment of undocumented immigrants since she lost her job. On Tuesday, she joined three other former club workers on Capitol Hill to push lawmakers for protection and an investigation into the Trump Organization s hiring practices. I hope that in his State of the Union address, Donald Trump will finally acknowledge the real face of immigrants in this country <U+2015> women and children fleeing violence, law-abiding, tax-paying people who would do almost anything to be Americans,  Watson Coleman s release said.

Significant parts of the government are shut down right now over a dispute about how much money Congress <U+2015> and therefore taxpayers, not Mexico <U+2015> will dole out for new barrier construction along the U.S.-Mexico border.But don t tell that to Republicans. For the most part this week, Republicans refused to contradict President Donald Trump s contortionist explanations for why, technically, sort of, in a roundabout way, Mexico is footing the bill.  I certainly understand the president s logic, and I ve always got it,  Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) told HuffPost Friday,  that if we have more jobs in America, because of an improved [North American Free Trade] Agreement, that it ll be more economic tax base for the United States. The new trade agreement negotiated last year has not yet been approved by Congress and does not mention the wall. If that explanation wasn t confusing or tenuous enough, Marshall also said the wall was  an investment.  This is the best $5.7 billion of American taxpayer money that we can use,  he said.  It ll come back in multiples for decades to come if it keeps out drugs, if it keeps out terrorists, if it keeps out criminals.  Over the course of more than two dozen conversations this week, Republicans tried their best to evade questions about who s paying for the wall, though some members acknowledged it was not Mexico. But plenty of GOP lawmakers were happy to accept Trump s arguments that Mexico would eventually pay, that new trade deals would offset the cost, or that, hey, doesn t a wall pay for itself anyway? We are paying as taxpayers for not having border security,  Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.) said.  I can tell you that. We are already. Roe added that  the wall will pay for itself, absolutely,  but he acknowledged that Mexico wasn t actually footing the bill.  The taxpayers are gonna pay for it, but we re paying for it already,  Roe said.  Whether we don t protect our border or we do <U+2015> we re paying the bill.  That was essentially the argument that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) offered as well. He said if America built the wall,  by virtue of the reduced illegal immigration that it will cause, it ll be a great savings. Republicans also said that the tax cuts they passed at the end of 2017 would pay for themselves. The theory <U+2015> which most experts considered ridiculous <U+2015> was that lower taxes would boost economic growth, lead to higher corporate profits, and then more tax revenues from those profits. The theory proved wrong: despite solid growth in 2018, corporate tax revenue for the year fell 15 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Of the Republicans who took the president s side that Mexico would pay for the wall, the explanation was overwhelmingly that, because of the new trade agreement, Mexico was technically paying for it.  The president s point is that, indirectly, we will be receiving more revenue from them as a result of the new fair trade law, and I think he s got a good point there,  Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) said.  In an indirect sense, he s right. In a direct sense, no, they re not writing us a check,  he conceded.Trump used to say Mexico would make a direct payment of $5 to $10 billion, an idea so absurd that Trump himself begged the president of Mexico in 2017 not to contradict him publicly, saying it was  the least important thing that we are talking about  anyway. But Trump has shifted to claiming that Mexico would pay indirectly thanks to the new trade deal, which would not be true even if Congress approves the latest version of the deal.The idea that trade pays for the wall is confusing <U+2015> which may be why Republicans have latched on to it.  The president says the Mexicans will be paying for the wall through NAFTA,  Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said.HuffPost asked Thune if that made any sense, given that the new agreement doesn t even mention the wall.  Well look, however the wall gets paid for, I think everybody agrees that border security s a pretty important issue, especially now,  Thune said. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) sort of acknowledged that the trade talking point made no sense, but still plowed through it anyway.  I think what the president s talking about is this is a term of reference that under NAFTA that we re going to save a lot of money,  Shelby said, adding that even though NAFTA and the wall are entirely separate things,  It s still all part of the government. That s what he s talking about. Rep. Bob Gibbs (R-Ohio) said he was saying it even before Trump was saying it: The trade agreement will indirectly pay for the wall.How? Because we got a better deal,  Gibbs answered, going on to explain that stopping  a bunch of illegals  from coming to America would also pay for the wall.  That s probably a bigger savings,  he said. The only way the new trade deal could pay for the wall, according to Lori Wallach of Public Citizen, would be if it added a 20 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico. It doesn t. Many Republicans offered agnostic arguments about whether Mexico would pay for the wall.Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) repeatedly said he has  no idea.  Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) said we would have to  wait and see  on that. And Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) said he s  struggled with the mechanics of  Hey, it s going to be because of incongruous trade, it s going to be because of this and that.   It ll be fascinating to see how that math actually works,  he said.Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) said the president has his arguments on Mexico funding wall construction, and he would leave those to him. Asked if he bought those arguments, Thornberry said it wasn t for him to  buy or sell the argument.  I focus on the things that I think are important for national security, and I will continue to do that,  he said. And when we commented that he was looking at us like we re crazy for even asking the question, Thornberry agreed.  You are crazy,  he said.Many other Republicans ducked the question entirely. Rep. Trey Hollingsworth (R-Ind.) remained completely silent and kept walking while we trailed behind him asking about Mexico paying for the wall, as well as his thoughts on Trump declaring a national emergency to circumvent Congress to build his barrier.Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) said he wasn t  going to comment on that at the moment,  though, with some prodding, he said,  from an accounting standard, not directly, but indirectly, there s a lot of transactions between our two countries. Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.) repeatedly said his concern was border security, not who was paying for a wall.  You can ask me that question as many times as you want,  Mitchell said.  You re not going to trap me into a conversation about whether Mexico is paying because it s not my problem, nor my concern. And Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.) was a wall of talking points. No one wins in a shutdown, no one wins if the border s not secure,  he said, repeating the phrase like a mantra in response to further questions, before going silent.There were some Republicans who broke with Trump. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), and Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) all said it s been clear that Mexico is not paying for the construction of a 2,000-mile barrier.Asked what he thought of arguments like the trade deal paying for the wall, or that the wall would somehow pay for itself, Amash said those rationales were  silly.   That s not money going to the wall from Mexico. It doesn t go to the Treasury that way and then go to the wall,  he said.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) also told HuffPost this week that he  never thought Mexico was gonna pay for the wall. But those were the exceptions. By and large, Republicans were willing to accept Trump s trade deal argument, even though if it were true, there would be no need to shut down the government to try to force Democrats to support a $5 billion in wall appropriation funding.This week, some 800,000 federal employees are missing their first paychecks since funding lapsed in December. And if the shutdown continues for several more weeks, it will imperil housing vouchers and food assistance for millions. If you expected Republicans to break with Trump over the shutdown anytime soon <U+2015> like perhaps Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) choosing to hold a vote on a clean funding bill and then Republicans in both chambers voting to override the president s veto <U+2015> just remember those GOP members who refuse to break with Trump in favor of reality.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations,  Trump continued.  If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn t work that way!

Mueller s team has already indicted or received guilty pleas from at least three Russian companies and 34 people, including former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and the president s longtime adviser Roger Stone.Some observers on social media compared Trump s comments on Tuesday to former President Richard Nixon s call to end the Watergate probe during his 1974 State of the Union address.

Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), a lawmaker known for his mild temperament, launched into an impassioned speech on the chamber floor Thursday, lambasting fellow Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for his role in the ongoing partial government shutdown. I seldom, as you know, rise on this floor to contradict somebody on the other side,  Bennet said shortly after Cruz spoke.  But these crocodile tears that the senator from Texas is crying for first responders are too hard for me to take. .@SenatorBennet responds to @Sentedcruz:  These crocodile tears that the Senator from Texas is crying for first responders are too hard for me to take.  pic.twitter.com/g4FBxdfiGYThe episode reflects heightened tensions between lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who failed to advance two separate bills to reopen the government on Thursday. About 800,000 federal workers are expected to miss their second paychecks of the year on Friday due to the impasse, which has centered on President Donald Trump s refusal to sign spending bills that don t include $5.7 billion to begin work on a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.During Bennet s speech, which lasted nearly 25 minutes, he quickly grew fired up. He attacked Cruz s role in another government shutdown in 2013 when the Texas Republican led a failed effort to block the Affordable Care Act. The government closed for 16 days while Colorado was still recovering from rampant flooding. The Washington Post noted that the event caused federal emergency funds to be held up. When the senator from Texas shut this government down, my state was flooded,  Bennet, shouting at times, said.  It was underwater. People were killed. People s houses were destroyed. Their small businesses were ruined forever. And because of the senator from Texas, this government was shut down. Cruz fired back after the speech, slamming Bennet for  attacking me personally  and saying he d never  bellowed or yelled at a colleague on the Senate floor.  I hope I never do that,  Cruz added.Bennet also lobbed a shot at Trump, saying it was  ludicrous ... that this government is shut down over a promise the president of the United States couldn t keep and that America is not interested in having him keep. This idea that he was going to build a medieval wall across the southern border of Texas, take [land] from the farmers and ranchers that were there, and have the Mexicans pay for it isn t true.

Pelosi delayed Trump s address amid a partial government shutdown, during which 800,000 federal workers went without pay for 35 days as Trump demanded funding for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.Read Trump s State of the Union remarks as prepared for delivery below:Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation.The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America s interests first.There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America s mission, and the power of American pride.In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade <U+2015> the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution <U+2015> and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America s future. The decision is ours to make.We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom <U+2015> a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs <U+2015> something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history ñ- 157 million.We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty <U+2015> and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.We have unleashed a revolution in American energy <U+2015> the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone <U+2015> almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States <U+2015> and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn t work that way!We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate ñ some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population <U+2015> and far beyond.Alice s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing <U+2015> and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.In June, I commuted Alice s sentence <U+2015> and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.When I saw Alice s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.Inspired by stories like Alice s, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption.We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well-being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.No issue better illustrates the divide between America s working class and America s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration <U+2015> reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate <U+2015> it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities <U+2015> including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they re going to keep streaming back in.Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.I ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families ñ no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon s granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter, Madison.To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says:  If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I ve done my job.  Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement <U+2015> and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE.My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall <U+2015> but the proper wall never got built. I ll get it built.This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier <U+2015> not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime <U+2015> one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation s most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities.Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.As we work to defend our people s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before <U+2015> and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount <U+2015> reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods <U+2015> and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don t blame China for taking advantage of us <U+2015> I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried <U+2015> until now.Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement <U+2015> or USMCA <U+2015> will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA.Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America s crumbling infrastructure.I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill <U+2015> and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity.The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs <U+2015> and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.Already, as a result of my Administration s efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children s Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read:  Last Day of Chemo.  Grace <U+2015> you are an inspiration to us all.Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America s children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave <U+2015> so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother s womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother s womb.Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children <U+2015> born and unborn <U+2015> are made in the holy image of God.The final part of my agenda is to protect America s National Security.Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military <U+2015> with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO <U+2015> but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System.Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America s interests.For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can t ñ- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom <U+2015> and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence ñ- not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.Our approach is based on principled realism <U+2015> not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel <U+2015> and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor <U+2015> and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement <U+2015> but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation s power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole <U+2015> and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery <U+2015> but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall <U+2015> more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah s 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah s family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy:  It s the Americans. A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks.  To me,  Joshua recalls,  the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky. I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman s story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight <U+2015> seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation.When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn.Why did they do it? They did it for America <U+2015> they did it for us.Everything that has come since <U+2015> our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice <U+2015> all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.Think of this Capitol <U+2015> think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.We must choose whether we are defined by our differences <U+2015> or whether we dare to transcend them.We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance <U+2015> or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.This is our future <U+2015> our fate <U+2015> and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness.No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America s destiny <U+2015> that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

My reason for running for governor was simple: I love our country and its promise of opportunity for all,  Abrams said, beaming against the blurred backdrop of a group of men and women of different races.  I stand here tonight because I hold fast to my father s credo: Together, we are coming for America, for a better America. Abrams, who is the first black woman to give a Democratic response to the State of the Union, denounced the president s policies on immigration, LGBTQ rights, gun safety, education and health care. She didn t need to name the president directly when she urged Americans to hold people  in the very highest offices  accountable for racism. But she did call Trump out directly for shutting down the government last month, making federal workers go without pay for weeks in his push for border wall money. Making their livelihoods a pawn for political games is a disgrace,  said Abrams.  The shutdown was a stunt engineered by the president of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people but our values. Still, Abrams extended an olive branch to Trump, urging him to consider how much Democrats and Republicans can accomplish by working together. Even as I am very disappointed by the president s approach to our problems, I still don t want him to fail,  she said.  But we need him to tell the truth, and to respect his duties and the extraordinary diversity that defines America. For all the potential of America, Abrams said, nothing is possible without  the bedrock guarantee  of people s right to vote. Let s be clear: Voter suppression is real,  she said.  From making it harder to register and stay on the rolls to moving and closing polling places to rejecting lawful ballots, we can no longer ignore these threats to democracy. The issue is personal for her. Abrams lost her governor s race in November to Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp (R) amid allegations of voter suppression. Kemp refused to recuse himself as the state s top election official in his own election, which many said was a conflict of interest. He also faced scrutiny after his office placed 53,000 voters  registrations in suspense because their names didn t exactly match a state record. Nearly 70 percent of the people on the list were black.Abrams included a call to fight for voting rights in Tuesday night s response and took a shot at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who recently called a group of proposed voting reforms in Democratic legislation a  power grab.  We must reject the cynicism that says allowing every eligible vote to be cast and counted is a  power grab,   she said.  The foundation of our moral leadership around the globe is free and fair elections, where voters pick their leaders <U+2015> not where politicians pick their voters. Ultimately, Abrams said, the American promise stems from basic family values like the ones she grew up with as her family fluctuated between being lower middle class and working poor. She talked about her parents coming home from work  weary and bone-tired  but still showing her and her siblings all that they could be. Our power and strength as Americans lives in our hard work and our belief in more,  Abrams said.  My family understood firsthand that, while success is not guaranteed, we live in a nation where opportunity is possible. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The veteran news reporter offered his thoughts on immigration during a roundtable discussion on the government shutdown over President Donald Trump s demand for funding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The problem is in Wyoming and in South Dakota, they think they need a wall. And in Texas and in Arizona, they don t,  host Chuck Todd said. And a lot of this, we don t want to talk about,  Brokaw said.  But the fact is, on the Republican side, a lot of people see the rise of an extraordinary, important, new constituent in American politics, Hispanics, who will come here and all be Democrats. Also, I hear, when I push people a little harder,  Well, I don t know whether I want brown grandbabies.  I mean, that s also a part of it. Brokaw:  The Hispanics should be working harder on assimilation.  pic.twitter.com/D4QGQhSRZh It s the intermarriage that is going on and the cultures that are conflicting with each other,  Brokaw went on.  I also happen to believe that the Hispanics should work harder at assimilation. That s one of the things I ve been saying for a long time. You know, they ought not to be just codified in their communities but make sure that all their kids are learning to speak English, and that they feel comfortable in the communities. And that s going to take outreach on both sides, frankly. Later in the broadcast,  PBS NewsHour  White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor addressed Brokaw s remarks. I would just say that we also need to adjust what we think of as America,  Alcindor said.  You re talking about assimilation. I grew up in Miami, where people speak Spanish, but their kids speak English. And the idea that we think Americans can only speak English, as if Spanish and other languages wasn t always part of America, is, in some ways, troubling. Thank you, @Yamiche, for speaking up.This tweet was written by an  assimilated  Latina who speaks English. pic.twitter.com/p2kpnaXOTONo one on the panel asked Brokaw to clarify who has told him they didn t want  brown grandbabies. Many Twitter users declared Brokaw s remarks xenophobic. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) called Brokaw  stunningly ignorant of the Hispanic community. .@tombrokaw, for a celebrated @NBCNews journalist who spent years chronicling American society you seem stunningly ignorant of the Hispanic community in this country. Unfortunate to see xenophobia pass for elevated political commentary @MeetThePress https://t.co/nKoLhjWdbk Unfortunate to see xenophobia pass for elevated political commentary,  Castro wrote on Twitter.Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and activist Jose Antonio Vargas, who has written at length about his experience as an undocumented immigrant in America, also hit back at Brokaw, arguing that the country s diversity is part of its strength.Dear @tombrokaw:Define  assimilation.  I m sure you know that the United States of America does not have an official language. The USA speaks in many tonguesññthen as now. That linguistic diversity is part of our strength, especially in a globalized economy. https://t.co/qnrOafoFKiBrokaw addressed his comments Sunday evening via Twitter. I feel terrible a part of my comments on Hispanics offended some members of that proud culture,  he wrote.  From my days reporting on cesar chavez to documenting the many contributions of hispanics in all parts of our culture [...] i ve worked hard to knock down false stereo types. in my final comment in Meet i said ALL sides hv to work harder [...] at finding common ground - which i strongly believe. dialogue not division. i feel terrible a part of my comments on Hispanics  offended some members of that proud culturefrom my days reporting on cesar chavez to documenting the many contributions of hispanics in all parts of our culturei ve worked hard to knock down false stereo types. in my final comment in Meet i said ALL sides hv to work harderat finding common ground - which i strongly believe dialogue not divisionmy twitter acct failed me at the worst time.i am sorry, truly sorry, my comments were offensive tomany. the great enduring american tradition of diversity is to be celebrated and cherished. yamiche, thank u for your comments.let s go forward together.A spokesperson for NBC News responded Monday to Brokaw s remarks, calling them  inaccurate and inappropriate.

Just 37 percent of Americans polled said Trump and the GOP should keep working to pass a bill that funds a wall on the border with Mexico, while 54 percent said they want to see Republicans turn their attention to other issues. But those surveyed said they re not entirely optimistic the government will avoid further gridlock: 72 percent said it s at least somewhat likely that there will be another government shutdown within a month, Respondents gave negative ratings to everyone in Washington for the shutdown, with disapproval of Congress  performance 41 percentage points higher than approval. The public also gave negative net ratings to congressional Republicans (ñ25), Trump (ñ19) and, by a lesser margin, Democrats in Congress (ñ8) and their own representatives (ñ5).More than 80 percent of Hillary Clinton voters said they approved of Democrats  handling of the shutdown <U+2015> a change from the shutdown a year ago, when barely more than half said the same. Nearly two-thirds said Democrats compromised about the right amount in resolving the shutdown. Forty percent of Trump voters said the president compromised too much, while another 40 percent said that he compromised about the right amount and 9 percent that he compromised too little. The rest said they were unsure.But that doesn t appear to have significantly dampened their view of the president s performance. Eighty-four percent of Trump voters approved of his handling of the shutdown, with 70 percent strongly approving. Remarkably, his approval numbers are close to identical among those who said he compromised too much and those who said he compromised the right amount.Seventy percent of Trump voters said they expect the president to succeed in eventually funding a border wall, with an additional 9 percent saying he has already done so. Eighty-three percent said they want him to keep working to do so, with only 12 percent saying that he should move on to other issues.Few other post-shutdown polls have yet been released. But in a Monmouth University survey published Monday, 32 percent of Americans surveyed said that the resolution to the shutdown made Trump look weaker, 24 percent that it made him look stronger and 41 percent that it had no effect. Despite what was objectively a climbdown in Trump s position, these poll results provide more evidence that public opinion of the president has been largely baked in since day one,  Patrick Murray, Monmouth s polling director, said in a statement.

It wasn t immediately clear which flights would be affected at LaGuardia. An NBC reporter said flights are still taking off and landing but that  the rate of them has slowed. Airlines are telling me the FAA has not halted ALL flights into LGA. Planes are landing and taking off. The rate of them has slowedThe FAA s flight delay site reports arriving flights to LaGuardia are being delayed by an average of one and a half hours.President Donald Trump reportedly has been briefed on the situation.NEW from @PressSec on air traffic control issues:  The President has been briefed and we are monitoring the ongoing delays at some airports. We are in regular contact with officials at the Department of Transportation and the FAA. Despite frantic online alerts about the groundings, the scene was quiet and orderly at LaGuardia late Friday morning, and there were nearly as many reporters arriving to cover the expected commotion as there were frustrated travelers still outside the security checkpoint. One uniformed airport employee, who declined to give his name, said most of the passengers impacted by the groundings were already through security.Still, some travelers were frustrated due to flight delays and other complications to their travel plans. Lana Tanca and three relatives, all from Miami, sat near the baggage claim in Terminal B of the airport. They texted another family member who said her flight from Jacksonville, Florida, was stalled in Washington, D.C.  She said they had to divert it, then they deplaned, then they put her back on the flight,  Tanca said.  Now they re apparently going to divert her again. Elected officials and union leaders have argued that the ongoing government shutdown puts flight passengers at risk. Many air traffic controllers and other staff members aren t being paid, leading some to resign.It s not yet clear whether the increase in sick leave has anything to do with a worker strike, but unions representing all aviation workers on Wednesday called for action amid the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. It is unprecedented,  said the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the Air Line Pilots Association and the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.  This is already the longest government shutdown in the history of the United States and there is no end in sight. In our risk averse industry, we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association released a statement Friday in which it hinted that the sick days and staffing issues may be tied to a broader coordinated attempt to strike <U+2015> without actually using the word  strike.  The statement read, in part:NATCA does not condone or endorse any federal employees participating in or endorsing a coordinated activity that negatively effects the capacity of the National Airspace System or other activities that undermine the professional image and reputation of the men and women we represent.Air traffic controllers take their responsibility to protect the safety of the flying public at all costs very seriously. Nothing else matters except safety.With that said, in the past few weeks, we have warned about what could happen as a result of the prolonged shutdown. Many controllers have reached the breaking point of exhaustion, stress, and worry caused by this shutdown. Each hour that goes by that the shutdown continues makes the situation worse.Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, told New York magazine on Friday that flight attendants could also walk out to show solidarity with government employees affected by the shutdown. We re mobilizing immediately,  she said.Separately, in a press release, she called for the shutdown to  end immediately.  Do we have your attention now, [Senate Majority] Leader [Mitch] McConnell? All lawmakers?  she said.  Open the government and then get back to the business of democracy to discuss whatever issue you so choose. This shutdown must end immediately. Our country s entire economy is on the line. The controllers union warned Wednesday that a shortage of controllers, who have been working without pay for more than a month, was creating risks to the air-travel system. Staffing in our air traffic control facilities is already at a 30-year low and controllers are only able to maintain the system s efficiency and capacity by working overtime, including 10-hour days and 6-day workweeks at many of our nation s busiest facilities,  it said. Luke Drake, a regional vice president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said his people are also feeling the stresses add up, and that he isn t surprised at the increased number of sick air traffic controller workers. I assume it has primarily to do with the stress with not only the nature of their work but having to do all of that while not being paid,  Drake said of workers calling out.  I m not surprised given we re now at our second lost pay period that the stresses are increasing. Drake said it hasn t helped that administration officials in the White House <U+2015> including Trump <U+2015> have downplayed workers not being paid. One of the really infuriating comments I ve seen is the expectation that our people should have reserve accounts for the government being shut down as if that s a normal thing now,  he said.  Somehow because we re federal employees we re supposed to have money set aside to deal with political calamities, and that s just unconscionable to me.

Sometimes in the middle of an unreal day, you just really need to hug your mom,  she wrote, the text paired with a cute photo of her hugging an older woman bearing a striking resemblance to her.It felt like a typically millennial type of milestone post. Except that Hill s new job was congresswoman for California s 25th District, and when she was hugging her mom, she was surrounded by TV cameras arranged to document her swearing-in ceremony.Sometimes in the middle of an unreal day, you just really need to hug your mom.

We grew up thousands of miles apart, but in many ways, I see myself in her. We both make jokes about our respective  resting bitch faces  and take photos in snowstorms. I know this because she posts those photos on Instagram.Hill is, unquestionably, my peer. So is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (29, D-N.Y.), Max Rose (31, D-N.Y.), Haley Stevens (35, D-Mich.), Lauren Underwood (32, D-Ill.), Abby Finkenauer (30, D-Iowa), Ilhan Omar (37, D-Minn.) ... and 14 other freshman members of Congress, comprising one of the most diverse classes in United States history. At the start of the 115th Congress in January 2017, there were just five millennials (individuals born between 1981 and 1996) in the House of Representatives. But as of January 2018, when the 116th Congress convened, there are 26. According to Pew, more than one-fifth of the 91 congressional freshmen are millennials, and two-thirds (14) of those representatives are Democrats. For the first time, the millennial generation <U+2015> my generation <U+2015> is represented in Congress in numbers that really matter. And for the first time, the millennial generation can see those numbers in action. We can watch Stevens enter her office for the first time. We can witness Omar beam with pride as she gets sworn in with her hand on the Quran. We can follow along as Ocasio-Cortez and Hill and Underwood try to track down Mitch McConnell to confront him about the government shutdown. (#WheresMitch.)   Because here to combat Donald Trump s clapback presidency, defined by one-sided exultations and blocked accounts on Twitter, is a cohort of freshmen congresspeople who are naturally inclined to view social media as a public forum.800,000 workers are missing their paychecks and we re pushing to get them paid ASAP.We re here doing our job - the House has voted to reopen government whole or in part several times - so why can t we find GOP Senators to ask them do theirs? #WheresMitch pic.twitter.com/FogCPg6ayZPredictably, there has been a swift backlash to these (diverse, mostly female) newly minted, digital native politicians. The negative reaction has been especially vicious toward Ocasio-Cortez, who, as a progressive young woman of color, would have stood out in Congress even without her dynamic social media presence, but seems to be perceived as a threat to both the establishment of her own party and sexist obsessives outside of it.  She needs to decide: Does she want to be an effective legislator or just continue being a Twitter star?  one House Democrat told Politico last week, suggesting that those two things must be mutually exclusive, as though a fiery Twitter presence must be indicative of a purely self-serving desire for fame rather than a genuine desire to communicate with the public. This is a perception that Stevens takes issue with.  I think we should be celebrating the way that this freshman class is using social media to bring a new level of transparency and access to our government,  she told me.  That s a great thing!  * * *The arrival of these social media-savvy millennial congresspeople is thrilling to watch on another level; an indication that people my age are growing up to become the power brokers and thought leaders that a wider culture told us we were too lazy and entitled to be.  I have always been fascinated by politics, but up until this election, it felt like something the  grown-ups  handled,  Kate Ormonde, 34, told me, explaining how the photographs that came out of swearing-in day affected her.  [There were] so many women of different backgrounds, dressed in bright colors, contrasted with white men in dark suits. At 22 percent of the population, millennials are poised to become the largest living generation, currently ranging in age from 23 to 38, a prime time to be entering into the ranks of power inside and outside government.We re also an endlessly <U+2015> and arguably, unfairly <U+2015> mocked generation. We ve allegedly  killed  everything, from Applebee s to beer to home ownership to diamonds. We re too sensitive, too self-absorbed and too focused on buying avocado toast to save up for a home or focus on building stable careers. Look a bit closer, and we re the first generation that is predicted to be financially worse off than our parents. We re saddled with student debt. We re perennially burned out even as we try harder and harder to optimize our lives. It s becoming infinitely harder to prepare for retirement.Many of the millennials I spoke to for this piece mentioned these lived experiences as a reason they were so thrilled to see a critical mass of their peers so visibly in government.  They understand that younger people have to work harder than their parents to achieve the same quality of life,  said Aaron Huertas, 34.  They grew up with the climate crisis as textbook science. They ve adopted more democratic forms of communication and seem friendlier to grassroots politics.   It s amazing to see people have our ideals in mind, advocating for issues that impact us,  added Eva Rubinoff, 31, citing student loans and social security as things she d hope to see prioritized.  Of course, these freshman congresspeople are still determining which issues to tweet about, what photos and videos to share and what stories to promote. No social media account is going to be truly unfiltered, and as a public forum, social media certainly has its clear faults. But by breaking down some of the traditional barriers that have long existed between elected leaders and their constituents, these representatives are projecting a different sense of accessibility <U+2015> one that works in these newly elected officials  favor. Not only are younger voters relating to them, but constituents are more able to view social media as a place of discussion rather than one-sided doomsday announcements and opaque decision-making. The expectations that the public has for its elected officials <U+2015> both online and off <U+2015> is shifting.Stevens told HuffPost that she often uses Facebook and Twitter to direct-message with constituents, including those who vehemently disagree with her. Sometimes, she says, she even takes those conversations offline by asking for her constituent s phone number so they can talk about the issue in a more personal way. She sees her Instagram as more of an open window; by posting informal photos and videos of her day, she hopes people can get a daily glimpse of what she s up to behind the closed doors of Capitol Hill.This is a sentiment that Hill echoed to CNN.  I don t want to become more formal. That s not on the table,  she said.Perhaps no congressional newbie better encapsulates the shift in public discourse than Ocasio-Cortez. She has posted Instagram stories of her office, her voting card, her press-on manicure, postcards from her constituents and her dance moves. Last week, she posted a photo of herself on the couch, under a fuzzy blanket with a pint of Ben & Jerry s ice cream.  Spoiler alert: Congress is like any other job where you have your long and tiring days and just want to eat ice cream at the end of it,  she wrote. What a gift to see the job of a congressperson as just that <U+2015> a job, not something that is separate from most of us, not entailing decisions made in an ivory tower by wealthy white elders. It s too early to tell what the legacy of these young politicians might be, but damn if it doesn t feel good to watch your peers take charge of the messy country we ve collectively inherited.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified the state that Rep. Lauren Underwood represents. The piece has been updated to reflect that she represents Illinois. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

She gets a pass  on Fox News, Cuomo said on  The View.   The administration favors that place because it s the mothership. President Donald Trump revealed this week that he told Sanders  not to bother  any longer with White House press briefings. Her last meeting with the press was more than a month ago, on Dec. 18, before the partial government shutdown, which has become the longest in American historySanders said Wednesday on  Fox & Friends :  We re in the business of getting information to the American people, not making stars out of people that want to become contributors on CNN. Cuomo said on  The View :  Here s the line: At the end of the day ... if you re in the business of communication with the American people, your currency is integrity and telling the truth, and owning it when you get it wrong. This administration  lies more than anything I have ever seen in public life,  said Cuomo, son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and brother of current Gov. Andrew Cuomo. I was raised in politics, so I have a very low bar for [politicians] being truthful because I ve been raised around politicians. So I m used to how it can be spun,  he added.  I ve never seen anything like this. Check out Cuomo s take on Sanders in the video above.And check out the stunned look on his face below when Trump s attorney Rudy Giuliani insisted earlier this month on Cuomo s program that he never denied there was collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.

And after three-plus weeks of government shutdown, it should be clear by now <U+2015> if it wasn t already<U+2015> that President Donald Trump is uniquely terrible at the practice. Trump is so out of the ordinary when it comes to negotiation, in fact, that the quarterly published by the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, devoted its latest issue to him. For the first time in the Negotiation Journal s 35-year history, it s used a whole issue to talk about a U.S. president.Due out next week, the Journal drills into the central paradox of Trump and negotiation: The president spent his career positioning himself as the consummate deal-maker. He s listed as the author, after all, of the  Art of the Deal,  though it was ghost-written. Yet, there s little evidence he s actually good at deal-making. Many of his best real-estate deals were actually put in place by George Ross (who handled real estate negotiations), and Roy Cohn, the legendary attorney, was Trump s original fixer and known for being a brutal negotiator, writes University of Pennsylvania Wharton School professor G. Richard Shell in a piece for the issue. Without Cohn, who died in 1986, there have been mostly business failures and bankruptcies and lawsuits.   In the close to 15 years that I ve been editing the Journal, nobody has used Donald Trump s the Art of the Deal as a citation in their article. Never. Not once,  said Nancy Waters, the managing editor of the Journal, which is the publication for the Program on Negotiation, a consortium that includes Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Tufts University.The omission was not out of elitism. Waters said that the publication, which has contributors across disciplines from around the globe, has covered other more pop-culture-esque business books. Trump s just never turned up.That may be because Trump s negotiating style at a base level contradicts all the best practices generally agreed on by experts in negotiation. The way he negotiates directly challenges what is almost a half-century of tools and principles and methods that have emerged in the field,  said Joel Cutcher-Gershenfeld, a professor in the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, who is the editor of the Journal. To start, Trump claims to use a zero-sum strategy in which he wins and the other side loses. The win-lose equation is considered out of date, ineffective and generally counterproductive among those who study negotiation. Win-lose dealmaking is a tough sell in a democracy or anytime you re trying to reach an agreement with a powerful counterparty who has enough leverage to withstand the demands of the bully across the table, like Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) fresh off her party s electoral victory in the 2018 elections. In such cases, you re not likely going to get exactly what you want. So a good negotiator has to think empathetically about what the other side wants and then sell them a deal that could be viewed as a so-called  win-win.  Trump isn t known for empathy.Still, this isn t complicated.  All the other presidents knew how to make deals,  said Carrie Menkel-Meadow, a professor of Law at the University of California Irvine Law School and a co-editor on the special issue. Trump doesn t understand the basic principle: To get what you want, you have to give other people what they want,  said Menkel-Meadow, who was at Georgetown Law during the Clinton-era shutdown and trained negotiators at the Department of Justice.A solid deal-maker also doesn t make an enemy out of his counterparty. Ideally in politics or diplomacy, he s built up some goodwill with them. Trump, on the other hand, demonizes and belittles his political opponents (and sometimes his allies).Nancy and Cryin  Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!Former President Barack Obama used to get criticized for not schmoozing with Republicans in the House. This president, on the other hand, not only isn t here to make friends, he s actively terrorizing his colleagues via Twitter. What we re seeing here is the cost of not building a relationship with the Democrats and their leaders, and now when it s absolutely essential because they re more powerful and he needs their votes, he s incapable of doing it,  said Thomas Kochan, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology s Sloan School of Management, who wrote about Trump s effect on business negotiations.  They don t trust him; he doesn t trust them. Lack of trust is the third critical piece of the failed Trump strategy. Negotiation experts concede that a hard-driving win-lose strategy sometimes can work. But not without trust.Former President Lyndon Johnson, for example, was known for his hard-driving, persistent, negotiation tactics. And, of course, Johnson was able to push through civil rights legislation at a time when his own party was dominated by segregationists. This was a case of someone staking out a position and forcing everyone to his side.But one of the key ways Johnson differed from Trump, Cutcher-Gershenfeld pointed out, is trust.  His word was his bond,  he said.Trump has already famously backed out of immigration deals he s agreed to.There may be some upside to Trump s willingness to break the established norms of negotiating, said Cutcher-Gershenfeld.  I don t want to say it s all bad, but I do want to say when you break the rules of the game you should know what you re doing.  He pointed that in the case of Trump opening talks with North Korea, there could possibly be some upside to the president s unconventional approach.The zero-sum strategy and willingness to walk away from the deal may also have been better suited to one-off real-estate transactions. Politics is different.  In negotiations with Congress, when you walk away there isn t another Congress to walk to,  he said.Right now, Democrats seem to be just as locked into their position as Trump. On Tuesday, a group from the House declined the president s offer for a lunch meeting, though there were reports that behind-the-scenes talks were happening.In the Negotiation Journal s special issue, 35 experts in negotiation from across a wide range of disciplines <U+2015> lawyers, trade negotiators, psychologists, business school professors, political scientists <U+2015> examine the effect Trump s deal-making strategy is having on the world, from international diplomacy to gender and race relations here in the U.S. Many of the authors have advised both Democratic and Republican policymakers over the years.The study of conflict resolution really took off during the Cold War when the stakes of failed negotiation and zero-sum gamesmanship were truly apocalyptic: nuclear annihilation. The stakes today seem increasingly high, as well, with Brexit threatening to destabilize the U.K. and Trump s sketchy diplomacy skills threatening to upend so much else. Still, many of the experts in the field are true believers in the proposition that there is no dispute too thorny to untangle. Many still believe there s a path to peace in the Middle East if only the right strategy is employed. And so, several who spoke with HuffPost did see a way out of the shutdown that didn t involve the courts. (That s where you go when negotiations break down, said Menkel-Meadow.)MIT s Kochan suggested  reframing  the debate. Instead of making this a fight about a wall, making it a negotiation more broadly about border security. That way there s more to bargain over <U+2015> not just a wall yes or no, but also funds for greater resources. Democrats could argue for support for the Dreamers and a path to citizenship. He and other experts also recommended bringing in more people to negotiate <U+2015> a tried-and-true tactic. Kochan suggested that the president, the Senate and the House should create an expert panel that would figure out a path forward.  Since this is Trump we re talking about perhaps the key to unlocking the stalemate begins and ends with the president s perception of himself.  Any solution has to feed his ego,  Kochan said.  As much as it s painful to play into that. Right now, he s backed himself into a corner and if his opponents truly want to break this impasse they have to help him figure out a way to save face, said Deborah Kolb, a professor emeritus at the Simmons University School of Business in Boston and the author of Negotiating at Work: Turn Small Wins into Big Gains. He s really locked himself in,  she said, adding: Great negotiators just don t do that.Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify that it was George Ross who negotiated many of Trump s real estate deals.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But for all his bluster, Trump has not racked up the draconian immigration enforcement record he threatened from the campaign trail. By the most important enforcement metric, deportations, Trump has trailed far behind his more liberal predecessor Barack Obama. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported about 95,000 people from the interior of the United States last year. Interior deportations in Obama s first three years in office topped 200,000 annually. Only in his final two years in office did Obama register numbers lower than Trump s. Trump s comparatively low deportation numbers are no coincidence: They are a direct result of the administration s chaotic attempts to overhaul the immigration system. Each ill-planned and legally dubious move the Trump administration makes to change the enforcement system clogs up some part of the federal bureaucracy and makes it harder for the administration to achieve its stated goals. Trump s fixation on the wall <U+2015> or fence, or steel slats, or  peaches,  or whatever he s calling it this week <U+2015> is a great example of how his policies tend to kneecap immigration enforcement.  The federal government is responsible for enforcing immigration law, so no one truly obsessed with deporting people would allow the federal government to shut down because that would further jam up a complex enforcement system that is already backlogged in the federal courts by more than 1 million cases. That s exactly what s happening. The country s immigration courts are largely closed. Those who miss their court dates because of the shutdown are getting sent to the back of the line, according to The New York Times <U+2015> which can mean delays of up to four years. As of last week, nearly 43,000 hearings had been canceled, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse project at Syracuse University <U+2015> with an additional 20,000 or so cancellations expected for every week the shutdown drags on. ICE is about to blow through its detention budget again, raising legal questions about whether the agency can continue to detain some of the people in its custody, according to BuzzFeed. These are not the kinds of results one would expect with a hard-liner in the White House. But it s a perfectly logical outcome for Trump, who campaigned on a border wall to solve a contrived crisis of illegal immigration at a time when unauthorized crossings stood at 45-year lows.  Trump s other actions have undermined enforcement, too. Within a week of taking office, he signed a sweeping executive order that, among other things, did away with Obama-era prosecutorial discretion guidelines that had directed ICE to focus its arrests on people with serious criminal records, recent border-crossers or people with previous deportations on their records. The message, which Trump s first acting director of ICE, Thomas Homan, repeated often, was clear: No one would be exempt from enforcement of federal law.It was terrifying for migrant communities, which now feared more indiscriminate enforcement. But it also undermined the goal of increasing deportations, because it s a more complicated and longer process to remove someone from the country who has a clean criminal record and the right to a hearing before an immigration judge. Likewise, the Trump administration shuffled judges to the border in an attempt to rush through the cases of Central American families that have shown up in larger numbers in recent years, often requesting asylum <U+2015> effectively putting cases guaranteed to be lengthy at the front of the jam-packed docket. But the judges didn t share then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions  enthusiasm for disposing of asylum cases quickly and skeptically. And the backlog in their home jurisdictions grew, too. On top of all this, the Trump administration s hostility toward migrants and hyper-polarization of the immigration issue has made Democratic-led jurisdictions far more likely to embrace  sanctuary  policies limiting cooperation with ICE than they were under Obama. The consequence of Trump s lack of diplomacy is that ICE now has far less leeway to make arrests at local jails than it once did, reducing the agency s efficiency. So, now the president who entered office promising to deport up to 3 million people is actually removing far fewer people than the Democrat who preceded him <U+2015> even though ICE s budget ballooned by more than 15 percent to $7.1 billion last year. And Trump s fixation on securing partial funding for a wall is only making him more inefficient. None of this should be particularly surprising. Trump has fabricated a vision of the border untethered from reality to sell his wall proposal. But it has become increasingly common, as the shutdown drags on, for Trump s Republican backers in Congress to defend the president s intransigence as a common-sense plea for a long overdue commitment to a more vaguely defined  border security.  But there s no unusual crisis at the border other than a high number of Central American families and children, who hardly present a security threat. And to judge from Trump s record so far, he s more committed to the idea of a wall, regardless of the cost, than to actual immigration enforcement. Some of this turns out to be good news for Trump s critics. When Trump took over the White House, he inherited an enforcement system capable of expelling a quarter-million migrants from the interior annually. But if the shutdown debacle offers any insight into his thinking, it would appear Trump does not care. He d rather have a wall. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

He left the job in 2015 after his wife became governor.National parks and forests are usually closed during government shutdowns to protect them. But during this shutdown   the longest in U.S. history   parks generally have been ordered to remain open even though skeleton staffs at best are policing the areas. The federal open spaces have consequently been overwhelmed by trash, vandalism, human feces and destructive off-roading. Some of the iconic trees of Joshua Tree National Park in California have been cut down by off-roaders to open up the wilderness to their vehicles, triggering outrage among park fans and environmentalists.So everybody keep in mind that 1) there are 417 National Park sites 2) 95% of the excrement will not be cleaned up 3) 5% will be cleaned up with a shovel and a bucket and 4) right now Forest Service gates are being ripped out of the ground and trees are being cut over for fun.Some federal workers are now being called back   with pay   to help supervise hunts on public land.The National Wildlife Refuge Association, the Coalition to Protect America s National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Retirees Association on Wednesday called on Trump to either completely staff public lands or keep all national parks and wildlife refuges closed during the shutdown to protect them. It is simply impossible to steward these shared American treasures properly, leaving thousands of lands and waters accessible to the public with no staff on site, even for an emergency,  the groups wrote in a letter.  The adverse impacts upon our nation s cherished lands and waters could take years to recover. The Trump administration has continued to safeguard drilling and mining access to public lands during the shutdown. The federal Bureau of Land Management has accepted and published 22 new drilling permit applications in Alaska, North Dakota, New Mexico and Oklahoma since the start of the shutdown, The Washington Post reported.

Several airports, including Miami International Airport and George Bush International Airport in Houston, have had to close checkpoints during the shutdown because of TSA callouts.While the TSA says the national average for wait times on standard lines is still  normal, hovering around 30 minutes, a blizzard barreling down on the Midwest and Northeast is already making matters worse.The winter storm, which is expected to continue through the weekend, has sent flight cancellations soaring, topping 2,500 on Saturday, according to FlightAware.com."

In this iteration of Cardi B talking to Lahren like her pet, Lahren had tweeted this mocking post of rapper 21 Savage. It features Lahren twisting lyrics to the rapper s song  Bank Account.

The rapper, whose legal name is Sha Yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, is actually from the United Kingdom, ICE said. While Lahren has not yet responded to Cardi B s clapback, another Twitter user did call out the pundit for her insult of 21 Savage.

Earl Blumenauer (Ore.) is the fourth and latest Democrat to announce plans to skip President Donald Trump s State of the Union address on Tuesday. The thought of spending Tuesday night in the House Chamber listening to the reckless, self-centered man who occupies the White House holds no interest for me,  Blumenauer said in a statement released Monday.  Just like in past years, I plan to skip a speech that will be filled with lies, deception and divisiveness. Blumenauer has skipped the State of the Union every year since Trump took office. This year, the lawmaker invited Nate Mook to replace him, according to his statement. Mook is the executive director of World Central Kitchen, the organization founded by famed chef JosÈ AndrÈs that provides meals for people in need, including federal workers furloughed from the 35-day government shutdown. The amount of damage, division and confusion Trump has inflicted on the American people over the last six weeks has been a blemish on the new Congress and I refuse to be witness to his continued antics,  Blumenauer s statement read.Blumenauer joins Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen (Tenn.) in skipping Trump s address Feb. 5. I will not attend the State of the Union once again this year,  Cohen told The Hill.  I ll come to the House Chamber for the State of the Union the next time I can hear from a president who will tell the truth about the state of the union. Georgia Reps.

Other boycotters that year included Reps. Maxine Waters (Calif.), Pramila Jayapal (Wash.) and Frederica Wilson (Fla.).Some Democrats attending the address this year are bringing guests who help send a political message, including federal workers affected by the partial government shutdown.Trump will deliver the address Tuesday after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) prohibited the speech from occurring until the shutdown ended.

At the yearly gathering hosted by the World Economic Forum, there is much talk of  worrying geopolitical and geo-economic tensions.  But, to its critics, Davos embodies everything that s wrong with the current moment. They gather to talk about making the world a better place. But instead they commandeer our conversation,  said Anand Giridharadas, author of Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World, who will not be attending.The U.S. government is in its longest shutdown on record. Britain is spiraling out of control over Brexit. Flames of rage engulf France. But  the plutocrats who shattered the world order are gathering to make out in the mountains,  Giridharadas said.According to a report from the anti-poverty coalition Oxfam, timed to coincide with Davos, the world s 2,200 billionaires grew 12 percent wealthier last year. But the wealth is not trickling down. The poorest half of the world got 11 percent poorer in 2018, and today the top 26 billionaires own the same wealth as the poorest 3.8 billion people. The economy we have today is fundamentally inhuman,  Paul O Brien, Oxfam America s vice president for policy and campaigns, told HuffPost.  You re not going to get a decrease in extreme wealth until you have leadership committed to tackling its root causes, and right now we don t.  In the U.S., wages have been essentially stagnant for decades while members of the Davos elite have gotten significantly richer. The fortunes of a dozen 2009 Davos attendees have jumped by a combined $175 billion in the years since, a Bloomberg analysis found.Among those on the list were Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who has tripled his net worth since 2009, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose wealth grew 1,853 percent in that period.Zuckerberg is not scheduled to attend Davos, but Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is using the gathering as a stop on a Facebook  apology tour,  after a slew of bad publicity over its role in the spread of misinformation in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and evidence that the company helped stir violence in Sri Lanka and elsewhere.The problem with Davos is that it provides  a moral glow of heroism to people who should be begging for society s mercy for their role in breaking our social contract,  said Giridharadas.  No one at Facebook should be on a panel explaining anything. They should be apologizing   for breaking our democracy and for enabling ethnic violence. To Giridharadas, Davos amounts to a week of  rich-splaining,  characterized by terms that shift the conversation away from actual social change:  Win-win  replaces a debate about social justice.  Lean in  gets in the way of maternity leave. Talk of  micro-credits  takes the place of a discussion about a wealth tax.  These elites have essentially used the rhetoric of changing the world to prevent change,  he said.Seemingly taking note of populist protests that most recently have hit France, Klaus Schwab, WEF s executive chairman, told reporters before the yearly meeting that globalization has to become more inclusive.  Globalization produces winners and losers, and there are many more winners in the last 24, 25, 30 years,  he said.  But now we have to look after the losers, after those who have been left behind. But in Davos, it s business as usual: Schmooze and be schmoozed. On the main street, the Russian and Saudi governments have set up shops, advertising that they re open for business. After pressure from the Kremlin, WEF reportedly reversed its decision not to invite three high-profile Russian tycoons facing U.S. sanctions, including billionaire Oleg Deripaska, known in Davos for his rowdy parties and in the U.S. for his business dealings with Paul Manafort, the now-jailed former Donald Trump campaign manager. Those dealings are now reportedly part of special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.The budget for the World Economic Forum has more than doubled since 2009, to $337 million last year. What WEF sells at this ski resort, of course, is access, and it s a bit of an inside-Davos joke that the stream of exclusive parties and private events provoke FOMO among even the most high-powered attendees. This year, however, the joke may have lost its punch line. The action is clearly somewhere else. President Trump, British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron are all staying home to deal with fractured politics and public anger.Giridharadas believes the moment has come. Davos has to end,  he said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The president s tweet, published on Tuesday, was in response to growing criticism that the White House has not held a press briefing in over a month   or since the partial government shutdown, which began on Dec. 22.  The reason Sarah Sanders does not go to the  podium  much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely & inaccurately, in particular certain members of the press,  Trump wrote.  I told her not to bother, the word gets out anyway!  he continued  Most will never cover us fairly & hence, the term, Fake News! The reason Sarah Sanders does not go to the  podium  much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely & inaccurately, in particular certain members of the press. I told her not to bother, the word gets out anyway! Most will never cover us fairly & hence, the term, Fake News!The last White House press briefing, which used to occur on a near-daily basis, was held on Dec. 18, ABC News reported. Sanders  most recent press briefing before December s was held 21 days prior, on Nov. 27. White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley fielded a question about the clear decrease in White House press briefings during an interview with Fox News on Tuesday.Gidley defended the absence of briefings by pointing to Trump s impromptu news conferences that are often held on the White House lawn when he s on the way to Marine One.  A lot of times when we don t come to the podium, it s because the president has addressed the American people himself,  he said, adding that Trump is  the most accessible president in history.  As for Sanders, Gidley said the White House press secretary will return when she  finds a reason to do that.  Sometimes we see a need to come to the podium and communicate things, and sometimes we don t,  he later added. The White House Correspondents  Association president Olivier Knox released a statement on Tuesday, calling the lack of press briefings  a retreat from transparency and accountability.  Being able to question the press secretary or other senior government officials publicly helps the news media tell Americans what their most powerful representatives are doing in their name,  the statement read in part.

It won t be without controversy,  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Fox News this week, just days after meeting privately with Trump on the matter in the Oval Office.  If he goes that route we ll just hash it out. Trump has been threatening for months to declare a  national emergency  and divert money from other programs to build hundreds of miles of wall along the Mexican border if Congress does not appropriate $5.7 billion for the project. He previously forced a 35-day partial government shutdown over the issue. He had claimed he would not let it end until he got the money, but wound up caving after 800,000 federal workers   including his own Secret Service detail   began their second month without a paycheck.Now, many Trump allies say he has no choice if Congress again refuses to give him what he wants in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill currently under negotiation by a House-Senate conference committee.One former White House official said on condition of anonymity that Trump would lose a significant percentage of his supporters if he did not deliver on the wall, a campaign promise he first made on the day he announced his presidency. It s the only way he gets it done,  said another Republican adviser close to Trump, also on condition of anonymity, adding that the politics make sense for Trump even if the money is taken from hurricane reconstruction projects in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.The adviser added that the Republican governors of Texas and Florida would back Trump.  And screw Puerto Rico,  the adviser said.  Puerto Rico doesn t have electoral votes last time I checked. What Trump wants and what Trump can get away with, though, may be two different things.While Trump has the authority to declare a  national emergency,  the same law that allows him to do so also lets Congress end that emergency by passing a bill   a bill that, unlike most in the Senate, cannot be blocked by the majority leader from coming to the floor and which needs 51 votes, rather than the usual 60, to pass.One of those 51 is likely to be Mississippi Republican Roger Wicker.  I would be inclined to vote for the resolution of disapproval,  he said of the possible emergency declaration.  I think it s bad law and I think it s bad strategy for the president.  Trump and his White House, of course, argue that the situation at the southern border is a national security crisis and clearly constitutes an  emergency  that a president has the power to act on unilaterally. Yet that argument may be undone by Trump s own words and actions about the necessity for the wall, which have waxed and waned with the politics of the moment.Migrant caravans, for example, have existed for years, as refugees escaping violence in their home countries and those seeking a better life band together traveling north across Central America and Mexico. But Trump only started warning about them as a threat to U.S. citizens in April 2018, with midterm elections on the horizon, claiming that they were filled with  gang members  and  very bad people. When the November election passed, so did Trump s interest in the caravans. The daily drumbeat disappeared. Trump did not bring up  caravans  until 10 days after the election, as a December deadline for a government spending bill started drawing near.Trump critics also point to his tendency to play up violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants, even though illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Trump invited the family of an elderly Nevada couple allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant to his State of the Union speech this week to build his case for a border wall. But he has ignored last month s shooting of four Houston police officers by a pair of white, middle-aged drug dealers as well as the execution-style killings of five women at a Florida bank a week earlier. A 21-year-old Indiana native   also white   has been charged in those slayings. He continues to activate fear in the public with things that he knows will scare them. That s his MO. It s not new,  said Wendy Feliz, spokeswoman for the American Immigration Council.  Unfortunately, it works, among some people. But it s really cynical politics. Cynical or not, Trump appears to be holding with that strategy in the days remaining before a quarter of the government again runs out of spending authority on Feb. 15.Trump is planning a re-election campaign rally on Feb. 11 in El Paso, Texas, a city Trump has repeatedly   and falsely   claimed had a high crime rate until a fence was constructed along its border with Mexico. The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime <U+2015> one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities,  Trump said in his State of the Union speech Tuesday.  Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country. Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives. That brought a rebuke from the city s mayor the next day.  We are considered the safest city with a population greater than 500,000,  Dee Margo, a Republican, told MSNBC.  I talked to our police chief, through his staff, today, and found out in 2008, we were like second. In 2009, after the fence was built, we were still second. But we ve progressed to be the No. 1 safest city in the nation. Primarily Republican senators and primarily Democratic House members are likely to deliver a compromise spending plan next week that likely will not have anywhere near the $5.7 billion Trump has demanded as a down payment for the $25 billion wall he once insisted he would make Mexico pay for.While Trump could choose to veto a spending bill and trigger another shutdown, his GOP allies believe he is more likely to declare a national emergency and try to divert money from already approved projects in the budgets for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers.Doing so would likely trigger lawsuits as well as the drafting and passage of a  joint resolution  of disapproval in the Democratic-controlled House. After it is sent to the Senate, it can be called to the floor after 15 days, and McConnell would have no power to block it.What s more, that particular resolution is not subject to a filibuster, meaning it would need only 51 votes to pass, not 60. Trump could only afford to lose three Republicans   and could possibly lose a good deal more.Some Republican senators worry about ceding too much power to Trump, particularly on spending matters, because he could set a precedent that subsequent Democratic presidents could use to declare national emergencies for, say, climate change or universal health care. I m urging the president to tread carefully,  said Texas Republican John Cornyn.Susan Collins and John Thune, of Maine and South Dakota, both told reporters this week that they hope Trump does not declare a national emergency. Missouri s Roy Blunt said that he, too, was not a fan of the approach.  I think I ve expressed serious concern about going down that path but let s wait and see what the president does before we decide,  he said.Their advice, though, may be falling on deaf ears. In his most detailed remarks on the topic recently, Trump appeared to have made up his mind.  I think there s a good chance we ll have to do that,  he told reporters late last week.  We will be looking at a national emergency, because I don t think anything is going to happen. I think the Democrats don t want border security. If Congress were to pass the disapproval measure, Trump would have the opportunity to veto it. It would be his first veto of any bill yet in two years in office ñ and would immediately set up the possibility of an override vote.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

And with new advances in technology, the project s creators say the process can be done cheaply and legally at home.Atlas Arms, a firearms research nonprofit based in Tennessee, is working to develop a computer-aided design file of the bullets, and plans to release it for free to the public. People would then be able to download the blueprint and input it into a computerized milling machine, which would carve rounds out of a base material purchased separately by the user.In a news release last week, Atlas Arms argued that armor-piercing ammunition is  critical to a well-regulated militia,  because the government is already able to use such bullets. The project, called the Dagny Dagger, is an attempt to  reclaim the forbidden fire, by outflanking the regulators  definitions and imaginations,  the group wrote. (Dagny Taggart is the protagonist of Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand.)The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has yet to approve the Dagny Dagger. A spokesperson for the bureau did not respond to a request for comment. Like many federal agencies, the ATF is currently being affected by the government shutdown.The Dagny Dagger is the latest entrant into the rapidly evolving world of DIY gunsmithing, which in recent years has ignited a contentious battle around intertwined issues of gun rights and freedom of speech and information.Last year, self-described  crypto anarchist  Cody Wilson drew nationwide attention when his company, Defense Distributed, began publishing downloadable blueprints for 3D-printed plastic guns. At the time, Wilson said he believed having a gun was a  fundamental human dignity  and a  human right.  He was also open about the subversive nature of his mission to create a world in which anyone with a 3-D printer and an internet connection could have access to firearms, which he claimed would lead to the death of gun control. A federal court eventually put a temporary hold on distribution of the Defense Distributed plans, but not before thousands of people got hold of them.Efforts to undermine the government s ability to regulate firearms have long been essential to pro-gun activists and lawmakers, said Timothy Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University who s written about regulatory issues around guns.  This is part and parcel of the mainstream gun rights movement,  he said.Austin Jones, a former aerospace engineer leading design efforts around the Dagny Dagger, told HuffPost that he  admired  Wilson s work and shares his mission to  build a prohibition-proof future.  In an email, Jones said his goal is to help equip everyone with armor-piercing ammunition, including anti-government militia groups.  They re sure to want to maintain weapons that are still relevant in a modern firefight and on-par with their most-likely opponent,  Jones said.The sale and manufacture of armor-piercing rounds was banned in 1986, under a bipartisan measure signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. The legislation covered handgun bullets manufactured with specific metals or designs that increase their ability to penetrate bulletproof vests commonly worn by police and other government officials.That regulatory framework still exists today, but the creators of the new campaign say their bullets will comply with federal law <U+2015> largely because they re being designed using a model that is deliberately intended to circumvent the ban, according to Jones.Each Dagny Dagger round is expected to cost about $2, though Atlas Arms says it hopes eventually to halve that price. The company is beginning with designs for a 9 mm round that it says will be able to  defeat all level III body armor,  which is supposed to provide protection against most handgun and rifle threats.  The ATF has fairly wide discretion in determining whether a new design is forbidden by existing law, though such rulings are often beholden to the political climate of the overseeing agency or presidential administration. While the ATF generally has a pro-law enforcement orientation and tends to be  extremely suspicious  of efforts to increase civilian firepower, Lytton said, it s harder to predict how President Donald Trump might approach the issue. Part of his base is law enforcement and people who would be extremely opposed to allowing this kind of variation on armor-piercing ammunition, while another part of his base is gung ho to try and circumvent the kinds of controls we have on firearms and ammunition,  Lytton said.  Which part of his constituency he nods to really does depend on his current mood and the last person to have spoken to him. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

But the latest details in the proposal, which Senate Republicans unveiled Monday in a bill they plan to vote on this week, make the offer appear less of a compromise and more of a wish list for immigration hard-liners like White House adviser Stephen Miller.Trump is offering a three-year extension for the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. as kids. The offer would also give a three-year extension to 300,000 people from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Honduras who are living in the U.S. under the temporary protected status program.Democrats rejected the offer before Trump even announced it on Saturday, however, maintaining that it didn t go nearly far enough and that the president ought to reopen the government before any negotiations over the border proceed. But the GOP bill incorporating his offer would also gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims from Central America, ban asylum for minors who present themselves at ports of entry, gut the concept of temporary protected status for future cases and expand immigration detention <U+2015> all measures making it more likely to be dead on arrival in the Senate. Given the poison pills stuffed into a proposal that was supposed to entice Democrats we can now say the Trump  offer  isn t about getting to a deal but about shifting blame. So obvious. So predictable. So pathetic,  Frank Sharry, the executive director of the immigration advocacy group America s Voice, tweeted on Tuesday.The bill would ban asylum for Central American minors, including those who arrive at the border with their parents, unless the minors apply for asylum in their home country. It would also cap the number of Central American minors who are allowed to apply for asylum each year at 50,000 and limit the number of asylum applications that could be granted per year to 15,000. The administration has for months tried to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in the U.S. as part of a broader effort to stem the flow of Central American migrants crossing the border from Mexico. Trump s administrative attempts to curtail the asylum process have faced legal challenges in two federal courts, however, prompting this week s legislative fix. This bill includes the most extreme changes on asylum that I ve ever seen,  Kerri Talbot, the director of federal advocacy at the group Immigration Hub, said on a press call on Tuesday.Under the GOP bill, minors who apply for asylum would face much stiffer consequences for filing an application found to be frivolous <U+2015> including permanent ineligibility for future protections.The bill s changes to asylum law alarmed immigration activists online, as well some on the right, including attorney and conservative writer Gabriel Malor.Anyway, I ll look through it again tomorrow, but Democrats shouldn t support this bill, and to be honest, Republicans should be shooting question marks at McConnell too.Trump s efforts to win over Democratic support on the bill <U+2015> which will require at least 60 votes to pass in the Senate <U+2015> hit even more trouble on Tuesday after the Supreme Court once again did not act on the administration s effort to end DACA. The move essentially left protections for Dreamers in place for at least the next several months <U+2015> giving Democrats less incentive to agree to Trump s offer of protections to DACA recipients.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly included Sudan among the countries for which immigrants  temporary protected status would be extended.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Dear @AnnCoulter -- Please tell the President it s OK to open up the government.While the president has a documented history of borrowing ideas from right-wing commentators, the pair recently had somewhat of a falling out on Twitter after Coulter called him  gutless  for failing to deliver on the U.S.-Mexico border wall.Twitter users were quick to find the humor in Speier s trolling while others pointed out that it would have been funny  if it wasn t spot on. Yes @AnnCoulter Please give Trump permission 2 Re-Open the Govt. We need groceries and to pay bills.Hubby could use gas $ to get to back and forth to work, guarding this countries most dangerous convicted criminals, seeing as he is still working without getting paid a dime.Dead. @RepSpeier for the zingerThis may require approval from @foxandfriends.This would be funny if it wasn t spot on. https://t.co/gpB7jF1mmD.@realDonaldTrump Ann says it s OK now.

On Tuesday, those who wished to visit Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park to celebrate the civil rights icon s 90th birthday were out of luck, as the park remained closed.The Atlanta site encompasses the Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King served as co-pastor alongside his father for eight years, along with a museum and the home where King was born, on Jan. 15, 1929. As is the case with other national parks across the country, officials said in a statement that the MLK park is closed  for the protection of park resources and the safety of visitors.  It may be for the best: While hundreds of parks have been closed since the shutdown began Dec. 22, the ones left open have seen heaps of trash pile up, with few staffers left on duty to take care of the problem.King s burial site, which is run by his family, remains open nearby. Celebrated on the third Monday of January <U+2015> Jan. 21 this year <U+2015> Martin Luther King Jr. Day usually is the busiest time of year for the park, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Would-be visitors will likely be out of luck next week too, as there is no clear end in sight for the government shutdown, which is due to President Donald Trump s demand for a border wall.Trump has said he will not agree to a spending package that would fully reopen the government unless it contains more than $5 billion for a wall along the border with Mexico. While Democratic leaders in Congress have agreed to provide funding for border security measures, they refuse to fund the wall.  HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

Just one of the many homemade posters out here today: pic.twitter.com/95uUqwjA0aInside, at the annual convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation, Trump talked up his current trade battles, even though they re hurting famers. Trump s withdrawal from an Asia-Pacific trade agreement means that U.S. farmers are struggling against advantages granted by the new Trans-Pacific Partnership to Canadian and Australian competitors in such markets as Japan. Other countries have also imposed retaliatory tariffs on many American farm products. China, traditionally a major buyer of U.S. soybeans, has turned to other markets.Trump promised his audience that the trade battles will eventually pay off.The rural vote helped put Trump over the top in the 2016 election, but farmers aren t doing so well with him in the White House. Net farm income fell an estimated 12 percent last year, down about 40 percent from its peak in 2013. We weather the weather,  farmer Kristin Duncanson, who raises hogs, corn and soybeans in Minnesota, told NPR.  It s weathering the politics that makes managing our businesses a little tougher than they have been in the past. Wisconsin lost over 600 dairy farms last year and Trump s trade wars haven t helped. Now, Wisconsin farmers are again caught in the middle of the #TrumpShutdown and can t get the tools they need to make it through these challenging times.https://t.co/iIFE3OQV2GThe president spent much of his speech touting his southern border wall, even though many farmers are short of labor because of the Trump administration s crackdown on immigrants. In a surprise twist in his message Trump received resounding applause when he vowed to  make it easier  for some immigrants to come into the country to do farm labor.  You need these people,  he added.President Trump gets a round of applause when he tells farmers at a New Orleans convention he s going to make it  easier  for people to enter the US  to work on farms:  I m going to make that easier for them to come in ... we re keeping the wrong ones out  https://t.co/9AwgcaMPH9 pic.twitter.com/e8nDHi7QiSOddly, Trump disparaged immigrants who actually show up for their court hearings in their bids to stay in the country as  not smart.  The government shutdown, which Trump has warned will continue until he gets $5.7 billion for a border wall, is also hurting farmers, who can t get access to valuable crop forecasts and other statistics while the number crunchers aren t working. They re also grappling with a freeze on some government-backed loans, subsidy payments and other federal services during the shutdown. Trump s $12 billion taxpayer bailout for farmers to weather the trade war is also on hold during the shutdown because the Department of Agriculture isn t being funded. The USDA is doing everything in its power to help farmers deal with the ongoing shutdown,  Trump promised, though he didn t offer details.In a gaffe during his speech, Trump, who intended to refer to a supportive Arizona farmer, Jim Chilton, mistakenly referred to surveillance of the  Clintons  ranch.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).Trump made fun of an Instagram video post by Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate, in her kitchen.  If Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash,  Trump mocked on Twitter.Native Americans weren t laughing.Not only was the reference to Pocahontas insulting, as people have complained repeatedly, but the casual reference to Wounded Knee   and the Battle of Little Bighorn   as part of a disdainful joke astounded many. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the casual and callous use of these events as part of a political attack,  said Jefferson Keel, president of the National Congress of American Indians.  Hundreds of Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho people lost their lives at the hands of the invading U.S. Army during these events, and their memories should not be desecrated as a rhetorical punch line. The chairman of the Rosebud Sioux tribe, Rodney Bordeaux, called the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre in South Dakota  one of the darkest and most tragic chapters in the history of the Sioux Nation  in which as many as 400 unarmed Native Americans, many of them women and children, were slaughtered by U.S. soldiers. Bordeaux called Trump s tweet  racist and disrespectful,  and demanded the president apologize for his  shameful and ignorant misstatement. Sioux tribal lawyer and writer Ruth Hopkins tweeted:  This isn t funny. It s cold, callous, and just plain racist. +300 of my people were massacred at Wounded Knee. Most were women and children. This isn t funny, it s cold, callous, and just plain racist. pic.twitter.com/9xgnSUTp4kCongress formally apologized to the descendants of the victims of the Wounded Knee massacre 100 years after the fact and expressed  deep regret  in a resolution that made no mention of reparations.In the Battle of Little Bighorn, hundreds were killed in 1876 in what is now Montana when the Lakota Sioux, Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes fought the U.S. Cavalry led by Lt. Col. George Custer.The anger by the Native Americans is particularly sharp given Trump s ongoing campaign against immigrants and his insistence on a government shutdown until he gets $5.7 billion to build a wall along the southern border. To Native Americans, Trump is an immigrant. Flippant references to deadly historical conflicts and name-calling that mocks Native identity have no place in our political discourse,  said Keel.  I urge the president to focus instead on doing the people s business, including ending the needless government shutdown that is harming so many Native people. Storm Reyes, 69, a member of the Puyallup tribe in Washington state, told The New York Times that the president s use of Wounded Knee was  equivalent to making a  joke  about 9/11, Pearl Harbor or the Holocaust.  She said it was  awful that not only did Trump use this tragedy as a joke, weapon and insult, but that his ignorance of American history is so great that he didn t even know that Wounded Knee was a massacre and not a battle.  As a Native person, Puyallup Tribe, I can t begin to tell you how angry and sickened I am by this tweet.  When the hell will his racism stop???  And for anyone who laughs at his  joke , a pox on your house. https://t.co/r0tmipo2QfComrade Trump, Little BigHorn was a battle between warriors and soldiers. Wounded Knee was a massacre of innocent Sioux women and children. Pocahontas was raped by a white man when she was only 12 years old. You. Are. A. Racist.

The government (Bureau of Indian Affairs) offered to pay $1,000 to each person who survived the massacre.No comment.pic.twitter.com/fsMfYsbDYZWarren has been repeatedly mocked by Trump as  Pocahontas  because of her past claims that she has Native American ancestry, based on family stories.She released results of a DNA test last year that she said showed  strong evidence  of Native American heritage and indicated she may have had an American Indian ancestor as long as 10 generations ago. But she was criticized by a leader of the Cherokee Nation for conflating a blood test with tribal affiliation. A DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship,  Secretary of State for the Cherokee Nation Chuck Hoskin Jr. said in a statement after Warren released the test.  Sovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship. Warren acknowledged the distinction. She tweeted in response that she agreed  DNA and family history has nothing to do with tribal affiliation ... which is determined only by tribal nations.  I won t sit quietly for @realDonaldTrump s racism, so I took a test. But DNA & family history has nothing to do with tribal affiliation or citizenship, which is determined only ñ only ñ by Tribal Nations.

Upon the customer s disclosure, the airline reported the incident to TSA,  a spokesperson for Delta told HuffPost in an email.The TSA said its security checkpoint was fully staffed and unaffected by the partial government shutdown that has prompted some security staff to call in sick to protest working without pay. Standard procedures weren t followed, the agency said.  TSA will hold those responsible appropriately accountable,  the agency said of the screening that failed to discover the weapon.A representative for the Atlanta airport did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.TSA employees have worked without pay since Dec. 22 amid what has become the longest federal shutdown in the nation s history.The shutdown prompted the Houston Bush Airport to close one of its TSA checkpoints on Sunday because of a lack of staff. Miami International Airport also closed one of its concourses for half of the day on Saturday and Sunday for similar reasons.Firearms are discovered in carry-on luggage with alarming frequency.A record of 30 firearms were confiscated in May from passengers at Atlanta s airport. During one week last month, the TSA reported finding 78 firearms <U+2015> 63 of them loaded <U+2015> at airports nationwide.Authorities say it s extremely rare for a gun to get past security. Still, the TSA in 2015 investigated a report of a Georgia man carrying a loaded gun through the Atlanta airport security and onto a plane headed to Chicago. The man said he mailed his gun home once he reached his destination and realized what he had done, WGCL reported.Atlanta s airport is the busiest in the country, seeing 103.9 million people each year, according to website World Atlas."

That reportedly sent the president into a fit, as he cut off Mulvaney, telling him,  You just fucked it all up, Mick. A CNN article also published Sunday told the same story, citing an official in the room who recalled Trump saying,  Stop, stop, just stop <U+2015> What are you doing? You re fucking it all up, Mick. A Trump administration official told Axios the report was  an exaggerated account of the exchange that doesn t reflect the good relationship Mulvaney has built over the last two years with the president.  Mulvaney, who is also the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said last week that he didn t think the partial federal government shutdown triggered by debate over the border wall will end any time soon. Now in its fourth week, it has become the longest shutdown in U.S. history.While the official who spoke to Axios contended that Mulvaney had a positive rapport with the president, a 2015 radio interview resurfaced by CNN s KFile showed that Mulvaney once called Trump s position on the wall  absurd and almost childish. Furthermore, in 2016, The State, a South Carolina newspaper, reported that in the run-up to Election Day, Mulvaney said he was supporting Trump  despite the fact that I think he s a terrible human being.

During my exclusive interview with Pres Trump I said Speaker Pelosi was in Puerto Rico with a bunch of her Democrat colleagues. I based that on numerous reports that turned out to be wrong. The Speaker s office says she has been in DC all weekend and I take them at their word.The slip-up related to news on Puerto Rico s opening night of  Hamilton,  the Broadway hit that debuted on the island Friday, helping to raise money for the area as it continues to recover from Hurricane Maria.Speaking with Trump about his fight for border wall money, the cause of the partial federal government shutdown, Pirro painted Pelosi as a lax congresswoman blowing off work in Washington at a tumultuous time. Nancy Pelosi s in Hawaii over the holidays,  Pirro said.  Now she s in Puerto Rico with a bunch of Democrats and lobbyists enjoying the sun and partying down there. It is unclear which reports Pirro was citing in her correction tweet, because articles on the event said Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was expected to attend, not that she was actually in Puerto Rico.An update to a CBS News report Thursday made clear that Pelosi had not attended the  Hamilton  performance in Puerto Rico. Newly minted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was expected to be among them, the father of the Broadway hit s creator told CBS News, but a spokesperson for Pelosi said the speaker did not ultimately travel to the island with the delegation,  the story read.NPR also stated on Friday that Pelosi was  expected to attend,  not explicitly reporting that she was already there.However, certain Twitter users weren t satisfied with Pirro s mea culpa or her interview.Your  interview  was a joke.

A huge share of government workers were going to take vacation days, say, between Christmas and New Year s,  Hassett said during a  PBS Newshour  interview.  And then we have a shutdown, and so they can t go to work, and so then they have the vacation, but they don t have to use their vacation days.

President Donald Trump has refused to reopen the government unless Congress gives him around $5.7 billion for a wall along the southern border, a sticking point Democrats have refused to budge on. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers missed their first paycheck of the year on Friday, many of whom have still been required to go to work during the shutdown. Congress approved a bill last week to grant back pay to those workers and others who were furloughed, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has signaled that Trump will sign it when it reaches his desk.Pressure has been building on both sides of the aisle to end the shutdown amid worries from Republicans that the standoff is hurting the party s reputation. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), an ardent supporter of the president, urged Trump on Sunday to temporarily reopen the government while negotiations continued and attempted to talk him off plans to declare a national emergency. Trump has been mulling that option as a means to bypass Congress and build his wall unilaterally, although such an effort would prompt a near-immediate legal battle.He has reportedly pulled back from that option in recent days. I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug,  Graham said during a  Fox News Sunday  interview.  See if we can get a deal. If we can t at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

A Democrat, the woman gave low marks to President Trump and the Republicans for their actions, but said she believed her party was making a good-faith effort to end the standoff.Views about who s to blame for the shutdown remain sharply divided along partisan lines. Another woman surveyed also said her family members are going unpaid. She described herself as very concerned about the shutdown and held the president and both parties in Congress at least somewhat responsible. But as a Republican, she also backed Trump s desire to hold out for a border wall and believed that he and his congressional allies were working to bring the shutdown to an end.Overall, as in previous HuffPost/YouGov surveys, Americans give everyone in Washington low marks for their handling of the shutdown <U+2015> but the GOP is faring especially badly. Americans are 45 percentage points likelier to disapprove than to approve of the performance by Congress as a whole. They disapprove of congressional Republicans by a 29-point margin, of Trump by a 17-point margin and of congressional Democrats by a 13-point margin. Members of the public are close to evenly split on how they feel about the performance of their own representatives.  In the newest HuffPost/YouGov poll, 57 percent of Americans say they hold Trump at least partially responsible for the shutdown, an uptick from the 49 to 51 percent who have said the same in previous weeks. The 44 percent of the public who assign some responsibility to the Democrats and the 39 percent who point to the Republicans are less changed from previous surveys, although the GOP number is slightly increased.Americans say by a 23-point margin that Republicans are playing politics rather than working in good faith to end the shutdown. They say the same of Trump by a 19-point margin and of Democrats by a 14-point margin.Several other polls about the shutdown have also been released since Friday. Taken together, they paint a consistent picture that s also in accordance with earlier surveys: When asked who s most to blame for the shutdown, Americans largely point their fingers at the president. Some of the highlights: <U+2015>In a CNN/SSRS poll released Sunday morning, 55 percent of Americans hold Trump mostly responsible for the shutdown, with 32 percent blaming congressional Democrats and 9 percent saying both are responsible. Fifty-six percent of Americans say they oppose building a wall along the border with Mexico.<U+2015>Americans  reject the president s assertion that there is an illegal-immigration crisis on the southern border,  according to a Washington Post/ABC News survey released Sunday. In that survey, 53 percent of Americans say Trump and the Republicans are mainly to blame for the shutdown, with 29 percent calling Democrats mostly at fault, and 13 percent believing both sides share equal responsibility. A 54 percent majority oppose building a border wall, although that s down from 63 percent in a Post/ABC survey taken last year <U+2015> the change is due largely to increased support among Republicans. <U+2015>Trump, Democrats and Republicans  all draw lackluster marks for their handling of the government shutdown,  according to a CBS/YouGov survey out Friday. Forty-seven percent say that Trump is most to blame, 30 percent that Democrats are, 3 percent that Republicans are, and 20 percent that all share the blame equally. Two-thirds of Americans don t think Trump should declare a national emergency to pay for a wall if one isn t funded by Congress. <U+2015>Three-quarters of the public, including most Republicans, think the shutdown is  embarrassing for the country,  per an NPR/Ipsos survey released Friday. About 7 in 10 agree that the shutdown will hurt the country and economy, with a similar number saying Congress should pass a bill to reopen the government now while budget talks continue. Just 31 percent want the government to remain closed until a border wall is funded.<U+2015>Reuters/Ipsos tracking finds that 51 percent majority of Americans now give Trump the most blame for the shutdown, up from about 46 percent at its start. Democrats receive about 32 percent of the blame and Republicans about 7 percent.(A methodology sidenote: The new Post/ABC and CNN/SSRS polls are also notable for being the first of this shutdown to be conducted using traditional live-interviewer phone calls, rather than cheaper methods such as online surveys. That fact highlights how much the face of political polling has changed since the 1995 shutdown, when pollsters like Gallup were conducting multiple surveys a week on the political ramifications of the government s closure. Gallup, under new leadership, recently announced it would  discontinue almost all  spot  polls in the U.S.   overnight polls, usually political, of immediate front-page interest. )As is often true in polling, the framing of a question about the shutdown can have a significant effect on the responses. Survey questions about who s responsible are a case in point. Some polls have asked Americans to pick between blaming Trump, Democrats or Republicans. In those surveys, very few respondents name congressional Republicans as the group primarily to blame.But does that mean people are inclined to let the Republicans off easy? The Post/ABC survey, which instead ties Trump and the congressional GOP together, finds them mutually shouldering the blame. And in the HuffPost/YouGov poll, GOP legislators  overall marks on the shutdown are actually worse than either Trump s or their Democratic counterparts .Neither format for those questions is inherently wrong. But it does matter which of those frames manages to best represent the way ordinary people are thinking about the shutdown when they re not fielding direct questions about it from pollsters.So far, despite the claim of Trump s campaign manager that the shutdown has boosted the president s numbers, there s little publicly available data to suggest that the shutdown has been politically helpful to anyone. At best, surveys show Trump s numbers remaining more or less stagnant. Several poll aggregators, meanwhile, have found Trump s disapproval rating rising modestly in the new year, albeit remaining well within the narrow range of approval ratings seen in his presidency thus far. As hazy as the immediate political impact of the shutdown may be, its implications for the future are still more unclear. In the past, those effects have often been ephemeral. The 2013 government shutdown sent ratings for the Republican Party falling to historic lows, but faded quickly from public memory and didn t prevent the GOP from claiming victory in the midterms a year later. As the current shutdown stretches on, however, there s still room for that calculus to change.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 12 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Big Tommy, who served as a Maryland congressman and later the mayor of Baltimore. Big Tommy D Alesandro Jr. taught little Nancy how to count,  Dowd wrote.  Fred Trump taught Donald, from the time he was a baby, that he didn t have to count   or be accountable; Daddy s money made him and buoyed him. The scathing column called out what Dowd identified as major contrasts in the childhoods of Donald Trump and Pelosi, presenting one as the antithesis of the other.For the columnist, the point of digging into the past was to further understand the divide between the president and the congresswoman as the partial federal government shutdown wades into week four. At this fraught moment when the pain of the shutdown is kicking in, President Trump and Speaker Pelosi offer very different visions   shaped by their parents   of what it means to be an American,  Dowd said.The problem, she contended, is that unlike Pelosi, Trump was never really raised to be an adult, his father having bailed him out of trouble time and time again. Over the years, Fred funneled tens of millions of dollars to clean up Donald s messes,  Dowd wrote.  The father even gave the son $3.5 million in chips to save an Atlantic City casino. By the time he was in his 40s, Donnie s allowance was more than $5 million annually. No wonder he s still an infant. Saving her most searing words for last, Dowd ended the column by suggesting it was useless for Pelosi to deploy  her  mother of five  voice on our tantrum-prone president, perhaps in an effort to reparent him,  asking,  how do you discipline the world s brattiest 72-year-old? Pelosi continues to butt heads with Trump over his demands for more than $5 billion to build a border wall, a request that sent the government into its prolonged shutdown.She has teamed with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in opposing the wall, which she called an immoral  waste of money  this month.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated incorrectly that Dowd s column compared Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi as the children of immigrants. She wrote about how they are the grandchildren of immigrants.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Starting Wednesday, AndrÈs  nonprofit World Central Kitchen will have a kitchen set up near the Navy Memorial on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., providing free meals to  any federal family that needs food,  the chef announced in a video posted to Twitter Monday.   World Central Kitchen is always there to respond to any disaster to make sure that Americans and people around the world will not go without a plate of food,  AndrÈs said.  Today we face another type of disaster emergency in the United States: More than 800,000 federal workers are without a job.    We believe that no person should have to go through the pain of not knowing what to feed their children,  he added.  Four weeks into the shutdown <U+2015> the longest in U.S. history <U+2015> President Donald Trump has shown no sign of budging on his demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, which Democratic lawmakers have firmly opposed. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have been furloughed or working without pay since late December. Thousands of contract workers <U+2015> including low-wage employees like janitors or food service workers <U+2015> have also been left out of work, and with no hope of receiving retroactive pay. Big news! We will open a kitchen on Pennsylvania Ave this week to join private sector effort to feed federal employees during the shutdown.

The woman, who said that she ended up at the Eastern Panhandle Empowerment Center after fleeing an abusive boyfriend in another state, had saved $600 <U+2015> enough for the first month s rent in a mobile home. In December, the staff at the shelter offered to cover her security deposit, using a special fund for emergency client expenses. For the woman, a new start was within reach. She paid the application fee and was approved for the rental. And then, the government shutdown happened. The shelter could no longer help her with housing costs. She lost the mobile home.  I feel hurt, hurt, hurt,  she said.  I m already starting out with absolutely nothing. I don t know what is going to happen now.  The government shutdown <U+2015> which on Saturday became the longest in U.S. history <U+2015> has thrown the fate of domestic violence shelters across the country in limbo. Many, like the Eastern Panhandle Empowerment Center, rely heavily on federal funds to stay afloat. With the government closed for business, they can t access the federal payments they so desperately need. The same funds they planned to use to help the woman with housing.Not knowing when the shutdown will end, shelters around the country are preparing for the worst. Many are curtailing services, cutting all but the most essential costs and planning for layoffs.Katie Spriggs, executive director of the Eastern Panhandle Empowerment Center, said her agency can no longer afford to provide any financial support to its clients. In addition to helping clients find permanent housing <U+2015> which moves them out of shelter, opening up a spot for another person in need <U+2015> the shelter also offers support for taxi rides to appointments and prescription medicines.  The things that we know they need to make their daily lives easier <U+2015> even if it only costs a little bit of money <U+2015> we can t help with now,  she said. Many of their clients live in extreme poverty, she said. For some, financial insecurity is the main reason why they don t leave their partners. They simply can t afford it.  People will call and say  I would love to come in, but I have no way to get to work on Monday, or no way to get my kids to school,  she explained.  We used to tell them not to worry because we could alleviate some of that financial burden. But now we can t because we don t have any money.  The center has also been forced to halt another crucial program: Mobile outreach. Normally, advocates make daily trips to visit abuse victims in their own homes who can t make it into the shelter for services. Many women in the community don t own vehicles, Spriggs added. Others are too sick or depressed to leave the house or have young children.  So we meet them where they are,  she said. Advocates will assess their needs and help them fill out paperwork for court, such as protective orders and divorce and custody filings, and do safety planning.Spriggs said she was concerned about the victims who are missing out on services because they cannot make it into the shelter. She is also concerned about having to lay off staff. If the shutdown does not end within two weeks, that will become a reality, she said.Inside the shelter, the mood was somber. Lisa, a 45-year-old woman with a traumatic brain injury, said she had been living in the shelter for two months. The shutdown had already negatively impacted her life. The shelter could not afford to pay for her transport to her doctor s office, so she had missed a few medical appointments. They couldn t pay for her prescriptions at CVS, so she was going without. And instead of the hot meals usually served, they were eating a lot of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, she said. Food was being rationed to save money.  You can feel the stress in the air,  she said.  We try to work as a family, they are a lot of very wonderful women here, but it is hard right now.

Since then, the photo, which was taken by the National Parks Service, has gone viral, provoking a wave of backlash on social media.The reason for the felled trees was to make way for off-roading vehicles, it was reported. During the shutdown, with Joshua Tree National Park open but no staff on duty, visitors cut down Joshua trees so they could drive into sensitive areas where vehicles are banned. We had some pretty extensive four-wheel driving.  https://t.co/EbSB4bF8hK pic.twitter.com/8kVFClVqxZAmong the reactions to the vandalism were shock and anger, some wondering why park visitors would commit such an act and shaming President Donald Trump for digging in his heels on the shutdown.Who the FUCK goes to Joshua Tree to cut down the Joshua Trees????  https://t.co/rKSjIsLgHPMy God.

Donald Trump is literally destroying America. https://t.co/Dpd6UmXANyWhile Trump was at the southern border doing a propaganda video with federal employees working without pay, he must have missed the fact that Americans cut down two precious Joshua trees at Joshua Tree National Park. They did it to go off-road during the government shutdown. pic.twitter.com/kNQX78wCpiWhile the park service had stated on Tuesday it would close the park, it reversed the decision by Wednesday, announcing it would keep parts of the park open to the public, including all campgrounds, a few roads, a picnic area and a trail.The park service cited  revenue generated by recreation fees  as the resource that helped the area to avoid a total closure.Despite the periodic release of statements, the banner of NPS s website warns it will not be consistently update during the shutdown, and that most parks will have  no National Park Service-provided visitor services, such as restrooms, trash collection, facilities, or road maintenance. Saturday marks the start of the fourth week of the government shutdown, making it the longest in history."

Just seven members voted against it, all Republicans:Justin Amash (Mich.)Andy Biggs (Ariz.)Paul Gosar (Ariz.)Glenn Grothman (Wisc.)Thomas Massie (Ky.)Chip Roy (Tex.)Ted Yoho (Fla.)Polling indicates that Americans are more likely to blame Trump for the shutdown than congressional Democrats. Not approving the backpay measure could come off as an unnecessarily cruel decision from the president. Lawmakers have always approved backpay for workers when previous shutdowns have put people out of work.The legislation is a welcome development for the 380,000 workers who are furloughed and not working and the 420,000  essential  personnel who are clocking in but not receiving paychecks while certain government functions are going without funding. But those workers still have bills to pay and won t receive their wages until the government reopens and enough time passes to process payroll.The National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, an advocacy group for federal workers, said the legislation provides  some comfort  to the federal workforce but isn t  an immediate solution  to the mounting problems created by the shutdown, which began on Dec. 22. Federal employees are scrambling to make arrangements for unpaid bills, including tapping their retirement accounts,  Ken Thomas, the group s president, said in a statement.  Evictions are becoming a real possibility, medical issues go untended, local economies are suffering and services to citizens have ceased as workloads pile up.  The partial government shutdown marked its 21st day on Friday, and it is now tied for the position of the longest shutdown on record. Trump is demanding $5.7 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he used to say Mexico would pay for. Democrats have refused to give him that money. The president has said he is considering declaring a national emergency to secure the funding, a move that would inevitably draw legal challenges.Because of the impasse, Congress has not appropriated money for roughly one-quarter of the federal government, leading to furloughs at agencies such as the Interior Department and the Department of Homeland Security. For thousands of workers, Friday marked the first typical payday without any pay.Workers are planning to use several strategies to eke by without steady income, including taking out loans, applying for unemployment benefits, borrowing money from family members and even forgoing medication.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

The lawsuit also alleges that the Federal Aviation Administration violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by not paying minimum wage to controllers being required to work during the shutdown, and by not promptly paying overtime to union members. The air traffic controllers, traffic management coordinators and other excepted aviation safety professionals that NATCA represents remain on the job, dedicated to the safety of every flight, but they don t know when they will receive their next paycheck,  the union said in a statement sent to HuffPost on Friday.  If not for the shutdown, NATCA members would have begun to receive direct deposit of their pay into their accounts as of this morning. On Thursday, air traffic controllers missed their first paycheck since the shutdown began. On Friday, hundreds of thousands of other federal workers missed their first paycheck of the year due to the shutdown, as President Donald Trump continued to demand billions in funding for a border wall.The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal workers, filed its own lawsuit Jan. 8. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, filed a lawsuit in December, days after the shutdown began. Both of those lawsuits allege that more than 400,000 federal employees are being illegally forced to work without pay.Members of NATCA and other aviation industry employees gathered outside the U.S. Capitol Thursday to call for ending the partial shutdown, which has gone on for 21 days.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

Instead, he now plans to build the wall himself. When I created this fundraiser, I said if we did not reach our goal we will refund donors,  Brian Kolfage said in a statement posted to the GoFundMe page.  I am honoring that commitment today. We will promptly refund your donation unless you tell us you approve our new plan for action. Kolfage, an Air Force veteran, claimed that he would start his own charity and organize resources to begin construction on the wall. He tapped former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and Blackwater founder Erik Prince as advisers. We are better equipped than our own government to use the donated funds to build an actual wall on the southern border,  he said.  Our team strongly believes that we can complete our segments of the wall for less than half of the government s estimated costs on a per mile basis. The campaign had raised $20 million as of Friday afternoon. HuffPost was unable to verify the charity s status, and the GoFundMe page is still active. GoFundMe spokesman Bobby Whithorne said  it s up to the campaign organizer to turn donations off.  He said donors will be given a choice to either receive a refund or have their contributions transferred to the new organization, which he said GoFundMe reviewed. Friday marked the 21st day of a partial federal government shutdown over funding for the wall. Trump has repeatedly said he will not sign any legislation to reopen the government unless it includes $5.7 billion for construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and Democrats have refused to comply with that request. As the online fundraiser gained steam last month, Kolfage came under scrutiny over his involvement with a series of Facebook scams.

Transportation Security Administration workers who would normally screen that terminal will be moved to busier checkpoints. We felt we had to make a decision before the weekend,  Chin told the Herald.  They re erring on the side of caution. Planes will be able to drop off passengers at the terminal during the closure, but departing passengers won t have gate access. The terminal is expected to open Sunday and Monday for morning flights before closing again in the afternoons, Chin said. United, Frontier and Bahamas Air are among the airlines found in Terminal G. United said it does not anticipate any negative impact from the closure, as it plans to use gates in two other terminals. The airline said it will also tell customers to arrive early and to double-check their departure gate. We will work to ensure we do everything we can for our customers flying through Miami, and continue to work closely with the TSA and other relevant agencies,  United spokeswoman Andrea Hiller told HuffPost.Hundreds of thousands of federal employees, including TSA workers, missed their first paycheck on Friday. TSA employees have been either working without pay throughout the shutdown or increasingly calling in sick as they look for new jobs or take on extra work to pay the bills. Aviation industry workers gathered outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday to call for ending the shutdown. President Donald Trump remains no closer to ending his stalemate with Democrats over his demand for $5.7 billion to build a border wall.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

Taking $ from disaster areas to pay for a wall is the egotistical response of a man who gets his way or brings everyone down,  Mayor Carmen YulÌn Cruz (D) of San Juan, Puerto Rico, tweeted Thursday.Taking $ from disaster areas to pay for a wall is the egotistical response of a man who gets his way or brings everyone down. @CNNPoliticsTrump has asked Congress to approve $5 billion of taxpayer money for his wall, and partially shut down the government when he was denied the funding.He s now considering alternate methods of payment. An official who spoke to CNN said the White House has asked the Pentagon to provide it with a list of funds that were meant to go to relief projects but have not yet been spent, which totals an estimated $13 billion.The shutdown, which has entered its 21st day, has left an estimated 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay. Trump said last week he can  relate  to the unpaid workers, but that  they ll make adjustments. On Thursday, Trump said he had the  absolute right  to declare a national emergency to build his wall and said that Mexico will  indirectly  pay for it. I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency, the lawyers have so advised me,  Trump said outside the White House.  I m not prepared to do that yet, but if I have to, I will. I have no doubt about it. I will.  But the easy route for me would be to call a national emergency and do it,  he added.Rep. Jenniffer Gonzalez (R-Puerto Rico) said late Thursday that Trump is playing  political football.  While the President has broad military authorities, as the Commander in Chief, when it comes to declaring a national emergency, I cannot and will not support reallocating funding we approved in a bipartisan effort in Congress for the recovery and reconstruction of Puerto Rico,  Gonzalez said. We haven t received the funding after more than a year and using this as a political football is not what the American citizens in Puerto Rico deserve,  she continued.My initial statement to news report <U+0001F447> pic.twitter.com/d79xGgLX2ATrump has been criticized for his response to the disaster in Puerto Rico.In November, he reportedly told Congressional leaders he didn t want any more money going to Puerto Rico for their disaster relief because, he believed without evidence, that the Puerto Rican government was mishandling the money and instead using it to pay off debt.

Trump has refused to budge on the demand for wall money, prolonging the government shutdown he provoked.Mark Morgan, chief of the U.S. Border Patrol in the Obama administration, reiterated his support for the wall to Ingraham on the show. He noted that many Democrats once favored a barrier by voting for the Secure Fence Act of 2006.However, that was far less substantial than what Trump wants. The measure called for 700 miles of fencing along the border, more checkpoints and advanced surveillance technology such as satellites and drones, The Washington Post noted. Trump himself has called the 2006 fence a  nothing wall.  Is it the size and the height of the barrier that now makes it immoral?  Morgan asked on Ingraham s show, in a clip provided by Media Matters.To which Ingraham responded:  It s political, it s 2020. They think they can flip states with a massive immigration surge, illegal, legal, into the United States.

Operations at nine departments, including Homeland Security, Justice, Treasury, the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA, have been affected.The government shutdown began Dec. 22 and is now the second-longest ever. Because of the lapse in funding for roughly a quarter of the government, about 380,000 workers have been furloughed and sent home while 420,000 continue to work as  essential  employees but without pay. Many of the essential workers are law enforcement personnel in the Department of Homeland Security, including Border Patrol and Transportation Security Administration agents.Many stories of federal workers anxious about paying their bills have emerged, even as thousands of employees have continued to work without any guarantee they ll be compensated after the shutdown ends. Morale is, I believe, close to rock bottom, and I think things will start getting really bad if this isn t fixed by this weekend,  a TSA officer who last received a paycheck on Dec. 28 told HuffPost s Nick Robins-Early.Congress would have to pass a law granting those workers backpay once the government reopens, as it has after previous shutdowns. Many workers received their last paycheck shortly before the new year and now may have to rely on savings, loans, credit or unemployment benefits to cover their bills.The impasse is the result of Trump s demand that Congress sign off on more than $5.7 billion for a wall along the southern border, a structure he originally said Mexico would pay for. He has not budged on his request, and Democratic leaders have refused to give in, describing the wall as wasteful and foolhardy. The White House is now flirting with declaring a national emergency in order to secure the funding.Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said Trump was holding the federal government  hostage.  Over 200,000 employees at DHS <U+2015> charged with protecting our skies, waterways, and borders <U+2015> will also not be paid while still working,  Thompson said in a statement.  Because of the President s childish behavior, families will face difficulties paying rent, keeping the lights on, and putting food on the dinner table. He should not be treating them like pawns in his pathetic pursuit to fulfill an absurd campaign promise. The White House has also felt the effects of the shutdown, with only 156 employees deemed essential out of 359. Efforts to reopen the government have largely floundered since the start of the year, and the shutdown is on track to become the longest since the 1970s if it isn t resolved by Saturday. The president reportedly stormed out of a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) on Wednesday after being told they would not give in to his demands, slamming his hands on a table and saying,  Bye-bye. The Democratic leaders have criticized the president s behavior, equating it to a temper tantrum. It wasn t even a high-stakes negotiation,  Pelosi said Wednesday.  It was a petulant president of the United States. Trump is getting more comfortable with the prospect of securing wall funding through a national emergency declaration. Several media reports noted the president has been eyeing billions of dollars in disaster recovery and military construction funding from the Defense Department to build the wall, and a source told The Washington Post that Trump would like to begin work on the wall within the next 45 days.Title 10 of the U.S. Code allows the use of such unspent money in the case of a national emergency.The president, in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity during a visit to the southern border on Thursday, said that if he can t make a deal with Congress, he ll  most likely  seek to declare a national emergency. The law is 100 percent on my side,  Trump said.  I mean we have the absolute right to declare a national emergency, and this is security stuff. This is a national emergency.

Speaking to Hannity during his visit to the border at McAllen, Texas, on Thursday, Trump said he d likely declare the emergency if he couldn t reach a deal with Democrats in Congress for funding to begin building the wall. If we don t make a deal with Congress, most likely I will do that,  Trump said.  I would actually say I would.  I can t imagine any reason why not, because I m allowed to do it. The law is 100 percent on my side,  he added.Trump expressed similar certainty to reporters before leaving for Texas, saying at the White House that he could almost say  definitely  that he would declare the emergency.Trump was less clear about when he would make the call but suggested to Hannity that it could be soon. We re going to see what happens over the next few days. They should do it immediately,  Trump said, referring to Democrats in Congress who have not agreed to the president s demand of $5.7 billion for the wall.     Look, we re not going anywhere,  he continued.  We re not changing our minds. The government remains in a partial shutdown as Trump and Democrats fail to reach an agreement over how much money in the federal budget should be set aside for his proposed wall.Democrats have offered to allocate $1.3 billion in the budget for border security, which includes building and refurbishing barriers at the border, but Trump has reportedly refused any offer less than his demand of $5.7 billion.Reacting to the stonewalled negotiations, the president last week began threatening to declare a national emergency in order to circumvent Congress and build the border wall  very quickly.  By declaring a national emergency, the Trump administration would gain access to funds to build his wall elsewhere in the government.Trump is already moving forward with these plans by reportedly looking into spending money in the Department of Defense s disaster recovery and military construction fund that hasn t yet been spent. Such drastic measures would likely prompt Democrats in Congress to legally challenge the administration for violating the appropriations clause in the Constitution.Late Thursday, the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security had already slammed the administration over reports that Trump was considering using disaster recovery funds, and he promised to stop any efforts to do so.In a statement, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.) demanded that Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  disavow  the reports. These funds were intended by Congress to be used for real emergencies and to help millions recover from hurricanes and other disasters,  Thompson said.  Under no circumstance are these funds to be used to fund the President s pet project so he can claim a win. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

For the next 30 days, using previously appropriated funds, we will bring back a limited number of employees to resume work on high priority projects and activities that support the Service s mission and meet the public s desire for access to Refuge lands,  Everson said in an email.Barbara Wainman, assistant director for external affairs at FWS, said the paychecks of 244 employees will be funded so they can return to the refuges in order to oversee scheduled hunts, continue backlogged maintenance projects and prepare for the fire season, The Hill reported.Meanwhile, several iconic trees of Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California have been felled by off-roading drivers aiming to open up new access to wilderness areas for their vehicles. The park was nearly closed this week due to the vandalism and trash, but then the National Park Service decided to use entrance fees for staffing to keep it and other parks operating.This is just a minuscule example of what #GovernmentShutdown will do to U.S. precious National Parks ... #JoshuaTree has turned into a four wheel driving circuit with tree cutting along the way ... pic.twitter.com/8lUxBCMCWbFederal parklands and refuges are typically closed during government shutdowns to protect them. This time most were ordered to stay open even though at best there have been skeleton crews to protect, maintain and police them. The National Wildlife Refuge Association, the Coalition to Protect America s National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Retirees Association on Wednesday called on President Donald Trump to either completely staff public lands or keep all national parks and wildlife refuges closed during the shutdown to protect them. It is simply impossible to steward these shared American treasures properly, leaving thousands of lands and waters accessible to the public with no staff on site, even for an emergency,  the groups wrote in a letter.  The adverse impacts upon our nation s cherished lands and waters could take years to recover. We oppose the opening of 38 National #WildlifeRefuges during the #GovernmentShutdown! Each refuge is part of a system of lands & waters that must be managed as a system! Please take action & urge your Congress & @realDonaldTrump to fund @USFWSRefuges https://t.co/oSuR0MpgLf pic.twitter.com/rsyqhEdnPDJeff Ruch, president of the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, told The Hill that the FWS decision appears to violate the terms of its own shutdown contingency plan, which allows emergency fund use only for safety and the protection of property. Hunting access is not needed to protect  property,  in this case wildlife. I am sure the wildlife do not feel protected by being shot,  Ruch said.Critics say that, although the administration is protecting and encouraging aggressive consumption of public land during the shutdown, there is little to nothing being done to protect wildlife and habitat. Besides accommodating hunters, the Trump administration is also continuing support for oil and gas development.on public lands. The federal Bureau of Land Management has accepted and published 22 new drilling permit applications in Alaska, North Dakota, New Mexico and Oklahoma since the start of the shutdown, The Washington Post reported.  It seems that the oil companies are getting services from the Department of the Interior when the public is not,  said Kelly Fuller of the advocacy group Western Watershed Project.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The old saying is once that camel gets the nose in the tent, you can t stop them from coming the rest of the way in,  he said in an interview published Tuesday.While emphasizing that he s generally in favor of banning lynching, Staver claimed the bill is being used to further other proposed federal legislation that would explicitly protect queer Americans from discrimination at work and in other contexts. This is a way to slip it in under a so-called anti-lynching bill, and to then to sort of circle the wagon and then go for the juggler [sic] at some time in the future,  he said.Liberty Counsel has spent years advocating against LGBTQ rights, prioritizing the religious liberty of conservative Christians over the civil rights of queer Americans. The organization represented Kim Davis, the now-former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Staver, who served as her lawyer, painted her as an evangelical Christian heroine, comparing her at one point to Jewish people who were persecuted by the Nazis.On its surface, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act isn t about queer rights. The bill addresses the crime of lynching <U+2015> extrajudicial executions carried out by a mob. According to the NAACP, lynching was used after the Civil War to resolve  some of the anger that whites had in relation to the free blacks.  At least 4,742 people, predominantly African-Americans, were reportedly lynched in America from 1882 to 1968.Since a new session of Congress has begun, the Senate-approved act and a corresponding bill in the House that s still in committee will likely have to be reintroduced.As of now, the Senate bill defines lynching as two or more people  willfully caus[ing] bodily injury  because of the victim s actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, disability, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity.Staver told OneNewsNow that if passed, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act would be the first federal law to mention gender identity and sexual orientation.Jenny Pizer, the law and policy director for the advocacy organization Lambda Legal, refuted that idea. She pointed to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which passed in 2009 and covered crimes motivated by a victim s actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. The Violence Against Women Act, which expired in December amid the partial government shutdown, also explicitly mentioned sexual orientation and gender identity.Pizer said LGBTQ Americans still urgently need comprehensive and explicit federal anti-discrimination laws. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, only a minority of states have laws that specifically protect queer people. Lambda Legal, the ACLU, and other progressive organizations have been pushing for the passage of the Equality Act, a bill that would prohibit discrimination against queer people in employment, housing, education and other areas of their lives. Because there continues to be confusion and debate about whether LGBTQ people already are legally equal   and whether or not we should be equal   we need the law to be inclusive and crystal clear,  Pizer told HuffPost in an email.In response to backlash it received for Staver s position on the anti-lynching bill, Liberty Counsel released a statement Thursday claiming that what he actually meant in the OneNewsNow interview was that including a list of protected categories in the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act would limit the law s application. Lynching should be prohibited no matter the person s reason for committing this violent crime,  Staver said in the statement.The organization also said it has received death threats over the issue.In a YouTube video defending the organization, Jonathan Alexandre, Liberty Counsel s public policy director, said that some politicians and media organizations are using lynching s  horrible history  to  push unrelated political agendas.  He confirmed that Liberty Counsel is questioning members of Congress about the  created list of protected categories.  The historical victims of lynching should not, as I do not, tolerate the hijacking of this issue by political agenda,  he said. Liberty Counsel has not responded to a request for comment on why it believes LGBTQ Americans should not be treated as a protected class. Pizer said she believes Liberty Counsel has repeatedly used an  ends-justify-the-means approach  to furthering its goals. With the grossly disproportionate rates of hate crimes against LGBTQ people, and the horrifying rate of murders of transgender women of color in particular, a demand to strip [sexual orientation and gender identity] out of an anti-lynching bill is truly dumbfounding, and beyond comprehension,  she said.  That it would be done by someone claiming to be motivated by Christian teachings just shows how deeply perverse and inhumane that anti-LGBT advocacy can become. "

I think he wants the fight. As Trump eyes his re-election bid,  I think he wants the slogan ... to take it into 2020,  Sykes added.Even if Trump starts to back down in the standoff that has led to a partial government shutdown, top White House aide Stephen Miller <U+2015> known for his hardline stance on immigration issues <U+2015> would simply  pick up the phone and call Ann Coulter and [right-wing radio host] Rush Limbaugh and the base will get riled up, and the president is completely prepared to renege,  Sykes said.That prompted Ruhle to say that  Coulter calling the president a fraud and a weenie is what s stopping  a White House deal with congressional Democrats to re-open the government.A similar scenario reportedly occurred in December. Trump apparently had agreed to sign a bipartisan spending bill that would have prevented a shutdown, then flip-flopped in the wake of an onslaught of criticism from Coulter, Limbaugh and various Fox News hosts.Coulter, in a Dec. 19 Twitter post, referred to Trump <U+2015> in all caps <U+2015> as the  GUTLESS PRESIDENT IN WALL-LESS COUNTRY. The shutdown began a few days later.Sykes, who rose to prominence as the longtime host of a Milwaukee-based radio show, is among the corps of conservative critics of Trump who have never made peace with him. In his MSNBC appearance, he commented on the difficulty of dealing with Trump. Referring to the famed character in the  Peanuts  comic strip, he said,  How many times do you have to have Lucy take the football away before you realize that you re not going to be able to make a deal with somebody like Donald Trump, who is an unreliable negotiator? He said that if any real progress was being made in negotiations to end the shutdown, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would be there because he  knows how to get this sort of thing done.

Some of the money Trump wants to use may come from funds slated for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Texas, California, Florida and other regions devastated by fires, hurricanes and other natural disasters. According to the official who spoke with CNN, the White House has asked the Pentagon to provide it with a list of funds that have been earmarked for relief projects but have not yet been spent <U+2015> a sum totaling around $13 billion. Use of that unspent money for a national emergency is allowed by Title 10 of the U.S. Code.According to one of the sources who spoke with the Post, Trump has put pressure on the Army Corps of Engineers to give him a timeline for signing on construction contracts and would like to begin work on the wall within the next 45 days. Though Trump has characterized undocumented immigration through the U.S.-Mexico border as a major security threat to the U.S., the data do not back up his claims.Democratic leaders have instead called for better infrastructure at ports of entry, better technology for scanning cars for drugs, and additional personnel working at the border to facilitate both trade and immigration.  Make no mistake: Democrats and the president both want stronger border security,  Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a rebuttal to Trump s Tuesday address on the border situation.  However, we sharply disagree with the president about the most effective way to do it. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Republicans and Democrats have basically stopped negotiating. Yet, members and aides on Capitol Hill believe a solution is imminent.It s not that there s going to be a legislative breakthrough. It s more that everyone now recognizes there is no deal to be made <U+2015> not when President Donald Trump won t come down from his $5.7 billion figure for border wall construction, conservatives oppose a larger immigration deal, and Democrats don t trust and won t accept any offer but full capitulation.Instead, the solution to the impasse seems to be Trump declaring a national emergency at the border, using a dubious authority to reprogram military construction money for the wall, and then Congress passing clean funding legislation <U+2015> without wall money <U+2015> while Trump s executive maneuver gets tied up in court.Trump has moved from toying with the idea of a national emergency declaration to all but promising it. He said Thursday that, if negotiations don t work out,  probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely. Three senior GOP aides said Thursday that they expect Trump to declare a national emergency as a way of getting out of the shutdown, though all said they hadn t heard anything specific about timing. And while there s been a scramble among some lawmakers to put together a deal involving the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program in exchange for wall funding, that offer seems to be dead on arrival.According to Politico, the chief architect of a DACA deal, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), has all but given up.  I think we re stuck. I just don t see a pathway forward. I don t see a way forward,  Graham said Thursday.  I have never been more depressed about moving forward than I am right now. So with the grand immigration bargain falling apart before it ever came together, and with Trump stuck on $5.7 billion for the wall and Democrats stuck on $0, the logical conclusion for most lawmakers is Trump acting through executive power.Specifically, Trump would use existing authority to reprogram unspent funds for military construction <U+2015> or redesignate funds earmarked for ongoing projects <U+2015> and build his wall that way. There s believed to be about $13 billion floating around in the military construction budget that hasn t been spent, along with $10 billion in new money for projects in fiscal 2019 <U+2015> more than enough for Trump to get started on his border wall. In effect, however, the move would be challenged in court immediately, tied up for years potentially.If there were enough backlash in Congress, Democrats and Republicans could team up to pass legislation blocking Trump s use of the military construction fund for his wall. But initial reactions from Republicans have skewed more toward support, or at least not opposition, for Trump declaring a national emergency to subvert Congress.On Thursday evening, Graham tweeted his support of Trump using an emergency declaration to build the wall.And House Republicans were just as deferential Thursday when HuffPost continued asking members about Trump potentially using his executive power to build the wall. Hopefully negotiations will work, but if the Democrats refuse to negotiate, I don t think the president has much of a choice,  Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Thursday.And even among those who said they would  prefer  Congress fund the wall <U+2015> members such as Reps. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) and Phil Roe (R-Tenn.) <U+2015> no one was willing to lay out what repercussions they would support if Trump acted on his own.HuffPost repeatedly asked Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) on Thursday whether she opposed the president declaring a national emergency to build the wall, and she repeatedly restated her position that  Congress needs to do our job  without actually answering the question. (She actually offered some variation of  Congress needs to assert its authority  or  Congress needs to do our job  five times when HuffPost asked if she opposed the president declaring an emergency.)The point is, Republicans may not love Trump going around Congress, but they don t seem willing to do anything real to block him at this time.On top of that reluctance to openly oppose Trump, lawmakers see the utility of Trump claiming victory and reopening government, with neither side actually giving an inch. Trump would not get to build his wall <U+2015> at least not until a court said so <U+2015> and Democrats would get to end the shutdown without giving the president a dollar.The difficulty is such an arrangement will inevitably derail future appropriations talks, as Democrats would push for riders blocking Trump s authority to reprogram money and the president wouldn t sign a bill undercutting his ability to unilaterally build his wall, even if the ultimate decision was for the courts.Basically, we d just be deferring the fight for the time being. But such a move seems like the least messy option as more than 800,000 government workers continue to go without paychecks.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

A photo obtained by @NBCNews shows the results of the test. https://t.co/SNxn6YneG9 pic.twitter.com/UP9EgHGxDxPresident Trump was asked about the photo Thursday morning outside the White House.  That was a wall designed by previous administrations,  Trump said. The design had been used by previous administrations, but this particular prototype was built under the current administration, according to NBC News.A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection told KPBS originally that the walls weren t designed to be  indestructible,  only to  impede or deny efforts to scale, breach, or dig under such a barrier, giving agents time to respond. The government is nearly three weeks into a partial shutdown largely due to President Trump s demand that Congress fund his border wall to the tune of $5.7 billion.  All Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans,  Trump said during a national television address from the Oval Office Tuesday. Democrats have offered Republicans multiple proposals to keep the government open, including one that already passed the Senate unanimously,  Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Tuesday in a joint rebuttal to the president.  All of which include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security ñ not the president s ineffective and expensive wall. Despite Trump s claim, illegal immigration from Mexico has been steadily declining for a decade.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

These policies are not coming out of nowhere. Most of them have been implemented and tested in cities and states across the country. Within the last five or six years, you just got more and more of these solutions happening at the state and local level,  said Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), the bill s chief sponsor.  It s not a unicorn. It s not like we re talking about something that exists in the atmosphere of Jupiter. This is happening in America. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, in a famous dissenting opinion from 1932, asserted the freedom of a state or local government to  serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.  This  laboratories of democracy  concept holds that state and local governments are the proper place to test policies before they move to the national stage.That is exactly what has happened with the sweeping policies in Democrats  H.R. 1, which they re calling the For the People Act. The bill s campaign finance provisions on public election financing, dark money disclosure and democracy vouchers have all been field tested. The same is true of automatic voter registration, felon re-enfranchisement and the use of independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions.Since 2015, 15 states and the District of Columbia have adopted automatic voter registration, a popular reform among advocates who believe it can significantly expand the number of people on the voting rolls in the United States.The policy works slightly differently in each state, but the basic premise is the same: When someone interacts with the state motor vehicle or other agencies, they are automatically registered to vote unless they opt out. If they are already registered, their information gets updated if needed. Federal law already requires state motor vehicle and some state agencies to offer people the opportunity to register to vote, and automatic voter registration essentially tweaks the process to make registering an opt-out choice instead of an opt-in.Oregon, considered the model for automatic voter registration, was the first state in the country to pass it in 2015. While it s still relatively early to assess the impact, the early evidence is encouraging. The policy went into effect in January 2016 and in a little over a year and a half, the policy added 375,000 people to the voter rolls. A 2017 analysis from the left-leaning Center for American Progress found over 116,000 people had been added to the rolls who wouldn t have otherwise registered.Automatic voter registration also went into effect in California last year, where it added 727,924 new voters to the rolls since its launch in April and updated the addresses of 269,365 people. (There were around 5.5 million eligible but unregistered voters in the state as of October.) The program also attracted scrutiny when it emerged the DMV made errors on thousands of voter registrations, including registering people who were ineligible to vote. The head of the DMV resigned and the agency imposed an additional level of review on the voter registrations it received.Forty-eight states don t allow people with felony convictions to vote while they are incarcerated, but states have widely different policies on when and how ex-felons can get back their right to vote. Some states allow former felons to vote once they re released from prison, while others bar them while they re on probation or parole. The various policies can be extremely confusing and deter people from registering to vote, even if they re eligible.The For the People Act aims to fix this problem by automatically restoring voting rights once someone is released from prison. Currently, 13 states and the District of Columbia do this, but having a federal statute would help make the process easier for everyone involved. I think having a uniform rule that applies to everyone, everywhere and making that loud and having some action on it would be really helpful,  said Sean Morales-Doyle, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, a New York-based nonprofit advocating for campaign finance reform and voting rights.  Having a uniform policy would clear up confusion among voters. It would also clear up confusion among elections officials. It would make keeping track of voter lists a lot easier. The Supreme Court s 2010 Citizens United decision led to an explosion of undisclosed money spent by nonprofits, trade associations and corporate entities in elections. Congress attempted to fix the court s collateral damage to transparency with the Disclose Act in 2010, but it fell one vote short of clearing a Republican filibuster in the Senate.States have since stepped in to pass their own Disclose Acts or to issue regulations to stop dark money in state elections. Varying disclosure rules to plug the holes created by the Supreme Court have been adopted in California, Delaware, Montana, New York, Texas, Vermont and Washington. Some of these laws provide more disclosure than others, and that can help Congress determine the best option for federal elections. California s Disclose Act is great but limited,  said former Federal Election Commission Chairwoman Ann Ravel, now with the pro-disclosure nonprofit MapLight.The California government has enacted two disclosure bills since the Citizens United decision. The first was passed in 2014 to require any group spending more than $50,000 on elections to disclose its donors. The second, enacted in 2017, mostly focuses on requiring independent spenders to post disclaimers detailing their top three donors on their advertising and campaign materials. Ravel believes that the $50,000 threshold for disclosure could be lower <U+2015> which is something the House Democrats  bill does.A little-noticed provision in Democrats  big reform bill would create a pilot program for  democracy vouchers  <U+2015> a proposal to provide every citizen with vouchers that can be used as small-dollar political donations. These vouchers would come in $25 increments, but could be used to give donations as low as $1.The  democracy vouchers  idea was first proposed by constitutional law professor Bruce Ackerman decades ago, but had never been adopted until Seattle voters backed a 2015 initiative to implement the idea. The program has already enabled a large number of people who would otherwise be incapable of affording political donations, including homeless people, to participate in the political process by contributing to candidates. One study found that 84 percent of people who used used their vouchers in the city s 2017 elections had not made a political contribution in at least the previous two election cycles.The vouchers also provide an alternative fundraising system for candidates who lack the kind of connections to big-money donors that are often seen as necessary to run for office.In 2017, Seattle City Council candidate Teresa Mosqueda became the first person in the country to win their first election running with democracy vouchers. She had kept hearing that she should run for City Council from participants in a program she ran for the AFL-CIO that encouraged women, people of color and working-class people to run for office. She was the kind of person she was trying to get to run: a Latina in the labor movement who didn t come from money. But her background also presented an obstacle to funding a campaign <U+2015> until Seattle s democracy vouchers became available. The democracy vouchers program really took the pressure away from having to see yourself bankrolling a campaign or frankly having to dial for dollars for the majority of your time,  Mosqueda said. I was able to spend more time talking with people about what they wanted to see in government,  she added.The pilot program in the Democrats  bill would be implemented in three randomly selected states to test how it works for congressional elections and whether it should be expanded to the whole country.The For the People Act would require states to allow people to register on the same day they vote and to allow voters to cast ballots for at least 15 consecutive days before Election Day. It would require poll sites to be open at least four hours each of those days and, to the greatest extent possible, that they be located near public transportation.Twenty states and the District of Columbia have approved some form of same-day registration. It s seen as a reform that can greatly drive up voter participation rates because people start paying more attention to an election the closer it gets. Federal law currently lets states cut off voter registration 30 days before an election. Activists also embrace early voting because it gives people more time to go to the polls at their convenience.Early voting in particular has been at the center of many recent fights between Republicans and Democrats over voting laws. The conventional wisdom is that early voting benefits Democrats, so Republicans in several states have moved to limit its availability. But one 2017 paper published by four political scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison suggests that reality may be more complicated. The authors analyzed early voting in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 presidential elections and found that while Election Day registration tends to benefit Democrats, early voting on its own is more likely to benefit Republicans. The type of voter who takes advantage of early voting <U+2015> older, whiter, and wealthier <U+2015> is already likely to vote, and more likely to vote Republican,  the authors wrote in a blog post last year.  Our findings confirm that early voting on its own has a negative and statistically significant effect on Democratic vote share in all three presidential elections we analyzed. The availability of early voting in isolation raises the Republican vote by about six percentage points. When same-day registration is combined with early voting, the paper found, voter turnout aligns more with the conventional wisdom.H.R. 1 would require states to create independent commissions that would be responsible for drawing congressional districts. State lawmakers currently have the power to draw districts once a decade, and both parties have manipulated that process to their advantage. In 2011, Republicans saw an opportunity to take control of state legislatures, control the redistricting process and lock in an electoral advantage for the next decade. They executed that plan extremely precisely and well.Six states <U+2015> Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana and Washington <U+2015> use independent redistricting commissions to draw lines for state or congressional districts. (Voters in Michigan, Utah and Colorado passed ballot measures establishing independent commissions in the November election.) Advocates say lawmakers have firm incentives to draw districts that favor their parties, and the independent commissions offer a firm check to make sure districts are fair. In 2011, California s independent redistricting commission drew electoral boundaries for the state for the first time. Anyone can apply to serve on the 14-member commission <U+2015> which is made up of five Democrats, five Republicans and four people not affiliated with either party <U+2015> but there are strict requirements on who can serve. Eligible applicants must be registered to vote in California and have voted in two of the last three elections. In the 10 years leading up to submitting their application, they also can t have run for office, worked for a lawmaker, political party or as a lobbyist, or donated $2,000 or more to a party or candidate. Votes from multiple Democrats, Republicans and independents are required to approve a plan. H.R. 1 would impose similar safeguards on the independent commissions it creates to help ensure the districts are fair. When lawmakers draw their own lines, they lose all of their philosophical ideals and they become ugly monsters that are willing to cut out competitors, punish people from the other party and try to draw the most protective district for themselves so they don t have to face serious competition for the next 10 years,  said Kathay Feng, national redistricting director at the good government group Common Cause, which championed the creation of California s commission.The For the People Act s main campaign finance reform is the creation of a small-donor matching system to publicly finance congressional elections. It is based on the decades-old public financing program run for New York City elections.New York adopted a small-donor matching system to publicly finance its elections in 1988 in response to a series of corruption scandals throughout city government. At the time, the system provided a 1-to-1 match for donations of $1,000 or less. A candidate received $1 in public funds for every $1 of a contribution up to $1,000. But the system has changed to boost the power of small donors over the years.Proponents of New York City s matching fund system point to changes that greatly enhanced the role of small donors as the public match was increased and the contribution limit for matching funds was lowered. Currently, the system provides an 8-to-1 match for contributions up to $175. That means a $175 contribution actually counts as a $1,575 contribution after the public funds are added in. Democrats  For the People Act uses a 6-to-1 match, a rate used by the New York City system from 2009 through 2018, for contributions up to $200. The fact that it s been around for 30 years and it s still working, I think that s pretty remarkable,  said Lawrence Norden, a lawyer for the Brennan Center for Justice.New York City s system has enabled candidates <U+2015> especially those from less affluent neighborhoods <U+2015> to more consistently rely on small donors in their districts.  The city s public financing system gives candidates an incentive to reach out to a broader and more diverse array of constituents to fund their campaigns,  a 2012 study by the Brennan Center and the progressive think tank Demos found.This small-donor matching system has also spread to other states, cities and municipalities. Some matching funds programs have existed for years, but in the past five years, adoption has spread rapidly to Washington, D.C.; Montgomery and Howard counties in Maryland; and Suffolk County, New York, among other places. New York state lawmakers are currently debating the statewide adoption of such a program.  If New York City is any guide, it actually changes how candidates raise money,  Norden said.  So, right now you have many candidates raising many more contributions than we ve seen in the past raising from small donors. I think we would see even more of a change of going to constituents and small donors as a source of funding rather than the biggest donors. <U+FEFF>CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Teresa Mosqueda was the first candidate in the country to run and win using democracy vouchers. She is the first first-time candidate to win.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

A handful of Republicans met in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s (R-Ky.) office Thursday afternoon to discuss a plan that would have funded construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border in exchange for legislative protections for Dreamers <U+2015> young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children <U+2015> as well as protections for immigrants from countries such as El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan.The proposal mirrored a measure the Senate rejected last year after opposition from the White House and senior adviser Stephen Miller.But the deal considered Thursday never really stood a chance. It lacked support from both Republicans and Democrats <U+2015> the latter of whom were not included in the day s discussions. It also didn t have the backing of President Donald Trump, who shot down the proposal shortly after it was pitched to him by the Senate GOP on Thursday, according to Politico. I have never been more depressed about moving forward than I am right now. I just don t see a pathway forward,  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and one of the main proponents of the idea, told reporters afterward. The South Carolina Republican later tweeted that Congress faced a  complete stalemate  over reopening the government, pinning the blame partly on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her fellow Democrats  refusal to give an inch on funding a wall Trump initially promised Mexico would pay for.It s unclear where talks go from here <U+2015> if any occur at all. Trump on Thursday toured the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas to draw attention to the need for more border security. He also canceled a trip to the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland, scheduled for later this month, citing Democrats   intransigence  over the wall.Trump so far has refrained from building a wall via a national emergency declaration, which would free up unidentified Pentagon funds to start its construction. While he maintains that he has the  absolute right  to do so, both Republicans and Democrats believe the move would be challenged in court. If this doesn t work out, I probably will do it, maybe definitely,  Trump told reporters on Thursday before leaving for the border.Some lawmakers believe a presidential emergency declaration could be one way out of the showdown over border wall funding. By making the declaration, the theory goes, Trump could save face with his base by claiming he has begun building the wall and later blame the courts if they block it. It might break an impasse. And it needs to be broken one way or the other. I d rather it be broken in negotiations,  Senate Appropriations Chair Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) told reporters about the idea on Thursday.Graham tweeted later on Thursday that he supports a presidential emergency declaration to build the wall.  I hope it works,  he added.The consequences of the partial government shutdown are mounting <U+2015> for national parks, airports, food inspections, emergency preparations and a host of other services. Additionally, some 800,000 federal workers will start missing paychecks this week.Senate Democrats on Thursday attempted to call up for a vote several bills that would reopen the government, but each time Republicans objected.Democrats are also reportedly threatening to block the Senate from adjourning this week, a move aimed to heighten pressure on the Senate majority leader and further highlight the standoff over the shutdown. I would just say three words to my friend the majority leader: Open the government. It s in your hands,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday on the floor.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The park reopened campgrounds and a number of hiking areas that were closed at the end of December as a result of the government shutdown.With the U.S. government now in the third week of a partial shutdown <U+2015> which has left 380,000 federal workers furloughed and another 420,000 working without pay <U+2015> Joshua Tree has found itself sorely understaffed and vulnerable to irresponsible visitors. Spokesman George Land said in a statement on Tuesday that the park had witnessed  incidents of new roads being created by motorists and the destruction of Joshua trees in recent days. A temporary closure was set to begin at 8 a.m. local time on Thursday  to allow park staff to address sanitation, safety, and resource protection issues in the park that have arisen during the lapse in appropriations,  Land said.National parks typically close during government shutdowns, but the Trump administration kept them open during this partial shutdown without funding.Just eight rangers were on hand as of Tuesday to oversee Joshua Tree s sprawling 790,636 acres, Land told the Los Angeles Times.But on Wednesday, officials said they would be able to use Federal Land and Recreation Enhancement funds to  bring on additional staff to ensure the protection of park resources and mitigate some of the damage that has occurred during the lapse of appropriations. Officials also thanked volunteers who have helped with cleaning and maintenance during the shutdown. Their efforts have contributed significantly to the reopening of campgrounds and restoring access to other closed areas of Joshua Tree National Park,  officials said. Even with the park largely reopened to the public, some experts warn against visiting Joshua Tree anytime soon to avoid straining the delicate desert ecosystem.Casey Schreiner, a journalist who works to educate people on how to responsibly enjoy the West Coast s natural beauty, said deserts can appear more robust than they are to an untrained eye. If you re not a desert person, you don t understand how fragile these environments are,  Schreiner said in an interview for The New York Times California Today newsletter.Deserts are home to delicate flora dependent on a fine layer of cryptobiotic soil that, as Schreiner told the Times,  can take literally thousands of years to form and can be crushed with a single footprint.

Instead, workers are bracing for the next phase of the shutdown as they worry how to pay for gas, rent and food with no income in sight.Now, the effects of the shutdown will get a whole lot worse, the TSA employee union and several officers told HuffPost. Morale is, I believe, close to rock bottom, and I think things will start getting really bad if this isn t fixed by this weekend,  one TSA officer told HuffPost, requesting anonymity out of concern over repercussions at work.TSA employees received their last paycheck on Dec. 28, giving them money that would typically last through the next pay period <U+2015> but which will now have to stretch much further. Many TSA workers live paycheck to paycheck, with the starting salary for officers between $25,000 to $30,000 a year. The shutdown has already forced some employees to look for new jobs or take on extra work, TSA staff say, and the pressure is immense for employees and families with no other source of income.  I don t know how people are going to get to work next week, when we don t get a check,  said Joe Shuker, a regional vice president for the TSA employee union. Shuker says many workers will have to choose between the cost of getting to their job at the airport and covering everyday living expenses. The shutdown is taking an increasing toll on federal workers, adding stress to already difficult work environments such as airport security. As the situation deteriorates at these jobs, some experts warn that it may also increase the risk of corruption at borders, prisons and airports. Meanwhile, the TSA employee union claims that a loss of staff over the shutdown could create a  massive security risk  for travelers if the agency is left short-handed.Although TSA officers will very likely receive back pay when the government eventually reopens, that does little to help with their immediate expenses and concerns. Because TSA workers are classified as providing essential services, they must continue to work through the shutdown with no pay coming in and can face disciplinary action for unexplained absences. Already the shutdown has resulted in hundreds of employees calling out of work sick, according to union officials. The TSA has rejected reports of widespread callouts, however, with a representative telling HuffPost that rates are only slightly higher than at this time last year <U+2015> but multiple employees say that they do know of some officers who are calling out due to the shutdown. No one wants to go to work and not get paid, especially for a job like TSA,  another TSA officer told HuffPost, also on the condition of anonymity. The shutdown is now in its 20th day, and there is no sign of a breakthrough in negotiations over President Donald Trump s demand for $5 billion to fund a border wall with Mexico. On Wednesday, Trump abruptly walked out of a meeting with top Democratic leaders <U+2015> which Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) described as  a temper tantrum because he couldn t get his way.  Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are either furloughed or working without pay during the shutdown, often resulting in them scrambling to make rent or even pay for medicine. Federal workers have already held or planned protests in major cities, including one in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, and Shuker expects more to come if the shutdown isn t resolved soon. I can t imagine it being a good situation next week, because people are out of money already,  Shuker said. We ve got a lot of dedicated people, man, but sooner or later they re gonna break.

I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency, the lawyers have so advised me,  he said Thursday morning outside the White House.  I m not prepared to do that yet, but if I have to, I will. I have no doubt about it. I will.  But the easy route for me would be to call a national emergency and do it,  Trump added.TRUMP:  When during the campaign I would say Mexico is going to pay for [the wall], obviously I never meant they are going to write out a check. I said they are are going to pay for it. They are. They are paying for it w/the incredible [unapproved] deal we made called the USMCA.  pic.twitter.com/YVCrSQty2vAlso, Trump falsely claimed that he never said Mexico would directly pay for the wall he is now putting on taxpayers. When during the campaign I would say Mexico is going to pay for [the wall], obviously I never said this, and I never meant they re going to write out a check. I said they re going to pay for it. They are. They are paying with the incredible deal we made called the USMCA. Trump made the same talking point days earlier during his Oval Office address. The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico,  Trump said Tuesday night in a televised speech. That trade deal, the United StatesñMexicoñCanada Agreement (USMCA), would replace the current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) but has not been approved by Congress. And with Democrats now in control of the House, it seems unlikely that its ratification will become a top priority anytime soon.I often stated,  One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.  This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!The president s pivot is a far cry from what he promised his supporters in his 2016 presidential campaign: that Mexico would directly pay for the construction, either through  reimbursement  or by deducting costs  from Mexican foreign aid,  among other possible solutions that have not come to fruition.In April 2016 he sent a memo saying Mexico would directly pay. It s an easy decision for Mexico: make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year,  the memo read.Our border is being breached daily by criminals. We must build a wall & deduct costs from Mexican foreign aid! http://t.co/jEgR6jSQ5JBut if Trump truly thought Mexico would pay for his wall, he would not have allowed a government shutdown that has left an estimated 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay after Congress refused to give him $5 billion from taxpayers for his wall. The shutdown, which has reached its 20th day, has led to the Food and Drug Administration postponing routine checks for food safety and has made air travel less safe as air traffic controllers have worked without pay and safety inspectors have been furloughed. Trump said last week he can  relate  to the unpaid workers, but that  they ll make adjustments. During his Thursday morning meltdown, the president also claimed he was  a professional at technology,  said he didn t slam a table during a failed meeting with Democratic leaders on Wednesday and called Democrats  crazy.

Trump asked Pelosi if she would approve funding for the wall within 30 days if he reopened the government and then left the meeting after that request was denied. The president is attempting to secure some $5 billion in taxpayer money for the project.Schumer told reporters after the meeting that,  Again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldn t get his way, and he just walked out of the meeting. Trump tweeted directly after the meeting and again on Thursday morning, writing that he didn t slam a table, but  politely said bye-bye.  Cryin Chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that I  slammed the table & walked out of the room. He had a temper tantrum.  Because I knew he would say that, and after Nancy said no to proper Border Security, I politely said bye-bye and left, no slamming!Trump doubled down on his defense and told reporters on the White House lawn on Thursday that the Democrats are  Pinocchios.  Well the news incorrectly reported, because I said,  Well, if we go back and everything is peachy dory and you say we ll talk over thirty days, at the end of thirty days are you going to give us great border security, which includes a wall or a steel barrier, she said no,  said Trump.

Trump met with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for just a few minutes before walking out after the House speaker said her party would not agree to spend billions on a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.He left the lawmakers with a  bye-bye.  Not only was the president unpresidential <U+2015> surprise, surprise <U+2015> yesterday in his behavior, I think the meeting was a setup so he could walk out,  Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill. Pelosi said she had wanted to stress that Democrats value border security in the form of spending on surveillance technology and other evidence-based fixes. The effectiveness of a physical wall is debated.The partial government shutdown, now on Day 20, hinges on Trump s demand for $5.6 billion for his pet infrastructure project, a promise that was central to his 2016 campaign. Trump has said that he is prepared to hold out  as long as it takes  for a spending bill that includes wall funding before fully reopening the government <U+2015> despite the toll on federal workers and the public. Pelosi said that she believed the president was using the debate over the wall as  a distraction  from  his other problems,  which she called  unfortunate.   I don t even know if the president wants the wall, he just wants the debate,  Pelosi said.  It s a luxury our country can t afford under any circumstances,  she added later.After the meeting on Wednesday, Schumer said that Trump threw a  temper tantrum,  going so far as to slam his hand on a table. Trump took issue with that characterization, denying that he acted out of anger.  I didn t smash the table. I should have, but I didn t smash the table,  he told reporters on Thursday outside the White House.Trump floated the idea last week of declaring a national emergency about the situation at the southern U.S. border in order to immediately move forward on construction of the wall. He renewed that threat Thursday shortly before departing for Texas to visit the border. Pelosi said Democratic lawmakers were moving forward with legislation that would fund the government without a border wall <U+2015> something that would perhaps trigger the president to declare an emergency.She urged congressional Republicans to support the legislative measures, issuing a challenge:  Did you take an oath to the Constitution or an oath to Donald Trump?  The House speaker also criticized the president s threat to withhold disaster aid funding from wildfire-ravaged California communities. You re punishing your own voters,  she said, before turning her attention to Republican lawmakers from California. People died, communities were wiped out and they re just cavalier about it because of the president of the United States,  she said.

CNN s  New Day  invited two of those government employees on the show Thursday to discuss the shutdown s impact on their lives.Lisa Honan, a program assistant for the Environmental Protection Agency, said both she and her husband have been furloughed, leaving them financially strapped caring for their two young children and paying for a brand-new house. We were fortunate enough to have a little bit in savings, but once we bought the house, we pretty much drained that,  Honan told CNN.  We re going to cut back as much as we can with food, with gas. ... I just want this to end. I want the government to reopen.  It probably will come down to ... where you could drive for a ride-sharing service,  Honan said later.  I just hope that it doesn t drag on for much longer to where we will have to start selling our family s heirlooms. Furloughed U.S. Forest Service fire captain who has 7 daughters and a wife recovering from cancer, to politicians on the shutdown: Come to an agreement.   Folks want to get back to work and provide what we provide to the community and to the country.  https://t.co/WHi0tV4A5I pic.twitter.com/VaKcQG5hRIMarc Munoz, a furloughed U.S. Forest Service fire captain, said his family has faced significant financial strain since the shutdown began on Dec. 22. He said he has been picking up odd jobs to provide for his seven daughters and wife, who is recovering from cancer. It brings a lot of stress,  Munoz said of the shutdown.He continued:  A lot of the folks that look up to you in the community look at you like,  Wait, you re a firefighter. You work for the federal government. You re supposed to be in a secure job, a strong profession.  And when they hear that you re furloughed and you re not working and you re possibly asking for loans and extensions on your utilities <U+2015> it s unacceptable. The shutdown stalemate focuses on President Donald Trump s demand for more than $5 billion to build his long-promised U.S.-Mexico border wall. The president has said he would reject a spending bill to reopen the government that doesn t provide for the wall, which he has promised Mexico would pay for. Democrats have refused his demand.Though federal employees will likely receive retroactive pay, many families are struggling to pay rent and buy necessities in the meantime. What s more, government contractors likely never will receive back pay.The shutdown has also jeopardized food security and health care for American Indian tribes, which rely heavily on federal funding to operate under longstanding treaties with the U.S. government. Food assistance benefits for 38 million Americans could run out in March.Both Munoz and Honan agreed the shutdown needs to end immediately for the sake of all Americans. I don t know how long financially that our family will be able to hang in there,  Honan told CNN.  And it s not just us <U+2015> many families outside of federal employees are affected by this as well. So just end this now <U+2015> the sooner the better.

Instead, the furloughed federal employee will be looking in her mailbox for an unemployment insurance check.  I should get it this week, hopefully in the next day or so,  said Evans, who lives in Oregon and works for one of the government s natural resource agencies.Many federal workers like Evans are about to mark their first expected payday without wages since the partial government shutdown began Dec. 22. As they go longer without pay, more and more are expected to take the step Evans was quick to: file an unemployment claim with their state in order to find a lifeline until the government fully reopens and their pay resumes.Roughly a quarter of government functions are unfunded as President Donald Trump demands Congress approve more than $5 billion for a wall along the southern border that he used to say Mexico would pay for. Some 380,000 federal workers have been furloughed and are off the job, while another 420,000 are continuing to work as  essential  personnel but without pay. It would require an act of Congress to retroactively pay both groups of workers once the government reopens, as has typically been done in the past. In the meantime, workers still have mortgage payments to make, credit cards to pay down and groceries to put in their cabinets without knowing when their next paycheck will arrive. So far, the number of federal workers and contractors seeking unemployment benefits has been rising but appears to remain small as a share of the overall furloughed workforce. Unemployment agencies said they expect the number of claims to rise in the coming days, if more workers fear the impasse will stretch beyond their savings.The District of Columbia, which has a disproportionate share of federal workers compared with states, had seen 3,745 federal workers and an estimated 822 federal contractors apply for benefits due to the shutdown as of Tuesday night, the D.C. Department of Employment Services told HuffPost. The agency is dealing with the influx of cases by having staff work extended hours.  A total of 1,328 workers in Maryland had applied for unemployment as a result of the shutdown as of Monday night, according to the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. The state has some of the highest concentrations of federal workers in the country. It has been increasing since the start, and like with any extended shutdown, we anticipate that the number of claims will continue to increase,  said Theresa Blaner, an agency spokeswoman.William Walton, the unemployment insurance director for Virginia, said the state has verified only 279 claims as a direct result of the shutdown. We are certainly seeing claims here in Virginia, and we do see them trending upward,  Walton said.  The longer the shutdown continues, the more claims we will see. Many federal workers live paycheck to paycheck, and as HuffPost previously reported, they are buckling down for a long shutdown by maxing out credit cards, looking for interest-free loans and borrowing money from relatives, among other budget-tightening moves.Only workers who are furloughed are eligible for unemployment payments; those who are continuing to work without pay don t qualify since they are still employed. When federal workers are granted backpay after a shutdown, they are required to pay back any unemployment benefits they received. (The U.S. Office of Personnel Management has issued guidance for federal workers on applying for unemployment.)Workers are entitled to a weekly payment as a percentage of their annual gross pay, though each state has its own cap on benefits. In general, workers are also required to look for jobs as they receive benefits, even though they know they will return to work for the federal government once the president and Congress reach a deal. People aren t going to get a huge portion of their wages replaced. The average is one-third to half. At least it s something,  said Michele Evermore, a policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group.Evans, who is 66, said the unemployment payments she expects are well under her regular salary. The maximum weekly benefit in Oregon is $624. She estimates that would leave her with a shortfall of about $800 over the course of a full month, relative to her normal wages.She already paid her rent for the month, but soon she ll have to deal with a car payment and utilities. She has repayments to make on two loans and reached out to her creditors to ask for leniency. With 42 years of service with the government, Evans said she would much rather be doing her work than filling out unemployment forms and applying for jobs she won t be taking.  This sitting idle knowing that you have work to do and want to serve the public <U+2015> we re going to be further and further behind,  Evans said.  I m trying not to focus on that. I m trying to do what I need to do for the unemployment insurance, hunkering down at home and visiting family.  As for whether the benefits will be enough to cover all her bills, she said she doesn t know yet. We ll find out if this goes on a couple more weeks,  she said.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

The result of that particular focus is ultimately a dishonest look at the impacts that drilling would have on the refuge, its wildlife and the indigenous populations that rely on it for subsistence,  she said. Last month, the administration took a significant step toward opening large swaths of the remote refuge to fossil fuel production, releasing a report that calls for leasing to begin as early as this summer and details potential effects on the unspoiled landscape. The lengthy draft environmental impact statement <U+2015> one of former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke s final acts at the agency <U+2015> explores three alternatives that would make available for lease between 66 percent and 100 percent of the refuge s 1.5 million-acre coastal plain.The Trump administration s own analysis makes it clear that spills of oil and other substances are not only possible but likely.The Bureau of Land Management report estimates that future development in the refuge could result in up to 1,745 oil spills by 2050, including six  large  events of at least 1,000 gallons. Additionally, the agency concludes that  the probability of a spill over 100,000 gallons is low,  noting that  only three spills  of that size were documented on the North Slope from 1985 to 2010. But CAP s review suggests the federal government s estimate is far too conservative. The group points to a 2007 report by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation that shows there were an average 448 spills per year on the North Slope from 1995 to 2005, with spills averaging 428 gallons <U+2015> or roughly 10 barrels. And since 2002 there have been 16 large oil spills in Alaska, five of them over 100,000 gallons, according to the Oil Spill Task Force.The arctic refuge, considered one of Alaska s crown jewels and often described as  America s Serengeti,  covers more than 19 million acres in northeastern Alaska. It is home to polar bears, caribou, moose and hundreds of species of migratory birds. For years the refuge has been a battleground between environmentalists and fossil fuel interests. The GOP tax law passed by Congress in late 2017 included a provision, introduced by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), that requires the Interior Department to approve at least two lease sales for drilling   each covering no less than 400,000 acres.The Trump administration has prioritized arctic refuge drilling as part of its  energy dominance  agenda. Even amid the current partial government shutdown that has left national parks around the country damaged and overflowing with trash and human waste, the Department of the Interior has found a way to continued that work, holding public meetings as part of its ongoing environmental review process, Alaska Public Media reported. CAP s review suggests the administration s assessment minimizes the potential harm that energy development would have on wildlife, specifically imperiled polar bears and caribou. Polar bears, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, maintain a constant presence in the refuge s coastal plain, which contains important habitat for pregnant mothers to den and give birth. In its assessment, BLM acknowledges that  the potential for injury or mortality [of polar bears] could be high when developing new oil and gas projects  but provides no estimate of how many bears could be harmed. Seventy-seven percent of the refuge s coastal plain is denning habitat identified as critical for polar bears, although BLM says not all of those acres are suitable for maternal dens. To mitigate potential effects on bears, surveyors can use infrared technology to spot heat coming from occupied dens. BLM says this technology is  proven to be an effective means of locating dens  but that it does  not provide perfect detection and occupied maternal dens are sometimes missed.  In its analysis, CAP points to a review of proposed seismic surveys in the refuge by Steven Amstrup, the chief scientist for Polar Bears International. In 2004, Amstrup evaluated the effectiveness of the infrared technology in spotting dens. His findings suggest that  a 50 [percent] detection rate is probably close to the highest that could reasonably be expected from a single survey effort,  Amstrup writes in the review.In December, Mother Jones magazine reported on an internal U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service memo in which FWS experts warned the administration about the threat seismic exploration posed to polar bears. To rely on infrared technology to safeguard a species that s already at risk is highly concerning, Kelly said.CAP also says BLM s assessment fails to accurately detail the amount of water required to support planned energy development, as well as the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. CAP estimates that up to 1.3 billion gallons of water would be needed to drill the oil wells, and then 5.7 billion gallons per year to support oil production. The Trump administration projects that annual greenhouse gas emissions would range from 0.7 million to 5 million metric tons, but CAP pegs the figure at closer to 62 million metric tons <U+2015> equivalent to the annual pollution of 13 million cars.A BLM official told HuffPost on Wednesday that, due to the lapse in appropriations, the department is unable to answer media inquiries unrelated to the ongoing partial government shutdown. An email sent to the Interior Department s press office bounced back as undeliverable.Republicans have been working for decades to gain access to the oil and gas below the refuge s coastal plain, also known as the 1002 Area. President Donald Trump has said he  really didn t care  about opening the refuge to drilling, but then a friend  who s in that world and in that business  called and told him about the longstanding battle. Murkowski has dismissed the idea that fossil fuel production puts this remote swath of northeast Alaska at risk, saying at a Senate hearing in 2017 that  this is not a choice between energy and the environment.  We are not asking to develop all of the 1002 Area,  Murkowski said.  We are asking for 2,000 acres, about one ten-thousandth of [the refuge]. The GOP tax law Trump signed in late 2017 allows for the development of 2,000 acres of the coastal plain above ground with well pads and support facilities. That stated surface disturbance is another area where CAP and other conservation groups argue the administration has twisted the truth, saying the 2,000-acre figure excludes potentially hundreds of miles of elevated pipelines and ice roads.  If you dig into the details contained in this review, it becomes clear what a huge footprint the oil and gas operation would have,  Kelly said.  They are contemplating that exploration and production would last for nearly a century. We are talking about something that impacts future generations quite literally. Previous CAP research showed that the purported economic incentive of opening the refuge could be wildly off-base. The Interior Department has said the oil and gas leases would generate an estimated $1.8 billion in federal revenue over a decade, while the Congressional Budget Office has pegged the figure at closer to $1.1 billion. But CAP found that the U.S. government would likely collect only $37.5 million over 10 years."

But some of their parents are federal employees who now can t take paid leave.Federal workers <U+2015> like many other Americans <U+2015> don t get paid parental leave. But most are covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. They can substitute paid annual leave during that time to take care of the new baby or recover from labor. But during a government shutdown, scheduled paid time off is canceled.New parents who stay home furloughed may be paid retroactively, like other federal employees, if Congress acts. But the uncertainty about when or if they ll get paid is putting pressure on families. Employees like Bill Striffler, the head of the local air traffic controllers union in Newark, New Jersey, worry if they stay home, they risk losing paychecks. Striffler and his wife Theresa, are expecting their first child on Friday, Jan. 18. Theresa, who works in sales, is hoping to collect disability pay. In the meantime, Bill considered an  essential  employee as an air traffic controller at Newark Liberty International Airport plans to work up until the baby is born. At that point, he was intending to take accrued paid vacation time. But if the shutdown continues, and he takes that time off, it will be considered furlough, or unpaid time, and he doesn t know whether he ll recover the back pay. That could influence how much time he takes, he told HuffPost. If she really needs me home, that s going to be my priority, and we ll figure out the finances later,  Bill said.  But it definitely is going to have impact.   I was looking forward to him being able to take a couple weeks off and being paid for that time, but now there s no guarantee that he ll ever be paid if he does,  Theresa added.  It makes the situation scary. The partial government shutdown over President Donald Trump s desired wall on the southwestern border, began Dec. 22 and affects only certain agencies. It has forced hundreds of thousands of federal employees deemed essential like those protecting public safety to work without pay, while others have been furloughed. They won t get paid retroactively unless Congress acts, which has happened in past shutdowns, but in the meantime, bills are piling up. From fearing eviction to forgoing Lupus medication, Americans are feeling the effects of the shutdown ripple across their lives.Expecting parents are in a particular lurch. Another employee who works in enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Fort Worth, Texas, and asked not to be named because of concerns about the political climate, was due to have her second child Wednesday. The employee has been saving up paid leave for almost a year in anticipation of having her baby, she told HuffPost on Tuesday, noting that she has approximately 140 paid hours from vacation and 60 paid hours in sick leave. Her paid leave was due to start on Wednesday, but because of the shutdown and her being furloughed, she now won t be receiving her paycheck, she said.She s fortunate, she noted, in that she ll be able to access her paid leave when the shutdown ends. (Generally, the government also recommends that  use or lose  leave be restored if lost due to a shutdown.) Her supervisors are very understanding, she added, and her unpaid leave is, of course, protected under the law. But she has had to borrow money from her parents, an option not everyone has, she pointed out. She worries about having to eventually file for unemployment benefits,  which I don t really want to have to do,  she said. Because she was furloughed, she also couldn t work for several days before her maternity leave as planned, she said, which added more stress as she was  worried about the workload I may have left somebody else. Many employees represented by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association can use their own paid leave for an uninterrupted period of up to six months to care for a new child, said Nick Daniels, the Fort Worth center president for the organization. But if an employee decides to come to work to not be furloughed, this interrupts that time, he said.One of Daniels  co-workers, an air traffic controller in Fort Worth, had a baby less than a week ago, he noted.  Does he stay home with his wife and two other children and risk not getting paid, or go to work and at least he knows he will get paid when the governments reopens?  Daniels asked.He called the decision  excruciating  and added that new moms, as well as co-workers with sick children, are facing a similar dilemma. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and others have backed legislation that would provide retroactive pay to employees impacted by the shutdown at the earliest date possible after the shutdown ends. It would also allow  excepted  employees to take leave during a shutdown and be subsequently paid. But for now, as Trump continues his public relations campaign for $5.7 billion for a barrier along the border, with no end to the shutdown in sight, federal employees and their families will continue to shoulder the burden.  With the baby coming, it s scary,  Bill Striffler said.  It s not what I want to be worried about right now getting paid for what I ve actually been working.

It is impossible to overstate how ridiculous this is,  Lemon said.  This is the behavior of a toddler who is not getting his way so he just says  bye-bye.

Scott Gottlieb, the head of the agency, said in a series of tweets that the FDA would normally inspect about 160 domestic manufacturing and food processing plants each week, about a third of which are associated with high-risk foods (like seafood, soft cheeses, and fresh fruits and vegetables). But such inspections have not been scheduled as usual due to the shutdown. FDA s professional staff remain fully dedicated to our mission,  Gottlieb said in a tweet Wednesday.  We re taking whatever steps we can to support our colleagues as they fulfill our commitments to the American people under challenging circumstances. THREAD: Food Safety During Shutdown: We re taking steps to expand the scope of food safety surveillance inspections we re doing during the shutdown to make sure we continue inspecting high risk food facilities. 31% of our inventory of domestic inspections are considered high riskThe commissioner said he was working to bring back 150 inspectors as early as next week who have been furloughed during the shutdown, according to both The New York Times and The Washington Post. Foreign food inspections have proceeded as normal, and the Department of Agriculture has continued to inspect domestic meat and poultry, the Times reported.The FDA oversees about 80 percent of America s food supply and many overseas imports, and helps counter food-borne diseases that send about 128,000 people to the hospital each year, according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Just last year, the agency and the CDC helped pinpoint an outbreak of E. coli to romaine lettuce and track breakfast cereal that sickened some people with salmonella.The shutdown has stretched deep into its third week and is on track to become the longest since the 1970s if the government doesn t reopen by Saturday. President Donald Trump has remained steadfast in his demands for $5.7 billion from Congress to construct a border wall and resisted Democrats  efforts to forge a deal to reopen the government without it.On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) said the president abruptly walked out of a White House meeting to discuss ending the shutdown, saying Trump threw a  temper tantrum because he couldn t get his way.  A total waste of time,  the president declared of the meeting afterward.  I said bye-bye, nothing else works! While the FDA s inspections are an important part of American food safety standards, there are tens of thousands of food facilities in the country, and it would be impossible for the agency to inspect all of them every year. I think most people agree these inspections are important. But there are 80k food facilities in the U.S.,  Helena Bottemiller Evich, an agriculture reporter for Politico, noted.  The idea that a couple weeks of no routine food inspections puts us all in danger is probably a bit of a stretch. Other consumer advocacy groups have argued that postponing the FDA inspections will put the American food supply at risk.My former colleagues at @US_FDA have a hard enough job when the government is  open.   It s nearly impossible when the government is  closed.   https://t.co/LEoSQ6m1AV via @lauriemcginley2 @joelachenbachDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Federal employees are already paid about 32 percent less than private-sector employees for doing the same work, according to the Federal Salary Council. Now, about 380,000 are on furlough while another 420,000 are being pressed into working without pay. And though government employees have received back pay for every previous shutdown, it s not guaranteed that they will this time. And contractors working for the government have never been approved for back pay.President Donald Trump has said he s willing to let the shutdown continue for years if Democrats don t bend to his demands to fund a wall along the U.S. southern border. If you re one of the Americans affected by the shutdown, there s no denying it s an incredibly difficult position to be in. However, there might be a few steps you can take to stay afloat.If you were sent home on furlough, the first thing you should do is apply for unemployment benefits. In general, furloughed government employees <U+2015> including contractors <U+2015> are eligible under the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees Program. Eligibility varies by state; you can look up your state s contact information here. Most states pay out a maximum of 26 weeks of regular benefits.Keep in mind that if you do end up receiving back pay, you ll need to repay your unemployment funds to the state. In most cases, you can take care of it online.Whether you re furloughed or working without pay, you ll need to determine which bills have to be paid now and which can be put on the back burner.For example, you might want to prioritize payments for utility services such as electricity and gas. However, you should call your service providers and let them know about your situation <U+2015> it might be possible to work out a deal so that your service goes uninterrupted during the shutdown while you defer payments.Another priority should be payments on any collateral loans, such as your home or car, since you could lose them if you fall behind. Plus, your credit will take a hit for any payments late by 30 days or more. Again, you might be able to temporarily pause payments by informing your lenders of the situation (more on that below).Food is another major expense that you can t simply eliminate from your budget. However, there may be community programs you can take advantage of from food banks and churches. As of now, the federal Women, Infant and Children nutritional assistance program can be utilized by those who might temporarily qualify for it during the shutdown. But WIC also may have to stop its operations if the funding standoff drags on through February.As for other expenses, consider freezing or cutting off services that aren t essential, such as cable or streaming services, gym memberships, internet, cell phone data, etc.If you have outstanding debt, your lenders may be willing to work with you during the shutdown. Call your lenders, explain your situation and ask about any financial hardship programs. Some lenders might temporarily modify the loan or allow you to defer payments.The federal Office of Personnel Management provides letter templates you can send to creditors, lenders and landlords to inform them of your employment and income status during the shutdown and document the terms of any changes to your payments. However, OPM suggests speaking with letter recipients first, since it may take some time for them to see your correspondence. You should also make sure you have all the necessary information in your letter, including contact information and account numbers. Keep copies for your records.You might have started off the shutdown with existing credit card debt, or racked up a balance trying to keep up with expenses since the shutdown began. Either way, those payments are one more cost it s tough to cover with no income. And if you re only able to make the minimum payments, credit card interest will add up fast.Try asking your card issuer about extended grace periods or a temporary reduction in the minimum payment. Alternatively, you might want to try a fairly simple solution if your credit is in decent shape: Perform a balance transfer.Credit card companies will often entice new customers by offering promotional interest rates on balances transferred from competitors. If you can qualify for a balance transfer credit card, you can enjoy 0 percent APR on that balance for about 12 months in most cases <U+2015> maybe longer. Usually, there is a balance transfer fee of around 3 to 5 percent, but that is likely worth the interest savings.The longer you go without pay, the more difficult it is to stay on top of basic living expenses. But unless you re able to score a 0 percent APR deal, adding to your credit card debt will probably create a bigger mess for you to deal with later.Fortunately, many banks and credit unions across the country are offering low-interest loans to borrowers affected by the shutdown. For instance, Launch Federal Credit Union is offering 12-month loans of up to $3,000 at 0 percent interest. Navy Federal Credit Union is also offering interest-free loans of up to $6,000.If you need to borrow money to make ends meet, this could be a more affordable way to do it. Contact your local banks and credit unions to find out what options you have.Money, Home and Living Reporter, HuffPost"

Many who were forced off the job told HuffPost that they re fearful about taking on debt to cover housing, medicine and food costs.President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the shutdown could continue  for as long as it takes,  with Democrats holding fast to their refusal to fund construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that Trump had repeatedly said Mexico would pay for.The Federal Employee Civil Relief Act, introduced by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.), aims to give those workers a helping hand while the government remains shuttered.The bill would prohibit landlords and creditors from taking action against federal workers or contractors who are hurt by the shutdown and cannot pay rent or repay loans. It would also allow federal workers to sue creditors or landlords that violate those protections, which would remain in effect during and for 30 days after a shutdown.The bill is modeled after the Servicemembers Relief Act of 1940, which protects military members from being sued while in active service for their country and for up to a year after active duty.The new proposal  prevents eviction, foreclosure, repossession, and loss of insurance. It basically allows any federal worker or contractor who is behind on monthly expenses to have relief until the government is reopened,  Schatz told HuffPost on Wednesday.The bill has broad support from Democrats in the House and Senate, but no Republican co-sponsors <U+2015> yet. Schatz said he hoped to get at least a few of them on board.Some banks have already moved to forgive late payments and service fees from furloughed federal workers, including Wells Fargo, Chase and Capital One.Over the weekend, Trump told reporters that he could empathize with those who aren t getting paid as a result of the shutdown. I can relate,  he said on Sunday.  And I m sure that the people that are toward the receiving end will make adjustments, they always do. And they ll make adjustments. People understand exactly what s going on.  Many of those people that won t be receiving a paycheck, many of those people agree 100 percent with what I m doing,  the president added without evidence.Trump later encouraged landlords and lenders to  be nice and easy  to furloughed workers.UPDATE: Jan. 10 <U+2015>  Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Thursday that while he had not yet seen Schatz s proposal, he welcomed the concept of legal protections for furloughed federal workers. I certainly support the idea that we should be protecting them. I feel terrible for them. It s not their fault. They re caught in the crosshairs of something that has nothing to do with them and it s unfair,  Rubio told HuffPost.

Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are wondering when they might see their next paycheck.Chapin Fay, a former National Republican Congressional Committee aide, joined Fox News   The Daily Briefing  on Wednesday to discuss the ongoing partial government shutdown, which has left 800,000 federal employees furloughed or, if deemed essential, working without pay.Though these workers will likely receive retroactive pay after the government reopens, some are struggling to pay rent or buy groceries in the interim. What s more, government contractors likely will not receive back pay.But Fay didn t seem too concerned with their plight on Wednesday, even suggesting he would welcome additional shutdowns in the future. Trump is winning the shutdown showdown because he s made it all about immigration, the wall, national security <U+2015> these are things that motivate his base,  Fay told Fox News.  I just don t think that the average American is motivated yet about shutdown politics. He added,  I think actually some of us wonder if the government shouldn t be shut down more often. Host Dana Perino laughed off Fay s insensitive suggestion:  Well, okay, well we could try that. Asked later to clarify his remarks, Fay told HuffPost:  I have sympathy for the federal workers not getting paid as I ve been a government employee at the municipal, state and federal levels. But the size and scope of government is out of control and the country would be better off with less government not more. The shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, has affected several federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Interior Department. Without staffing, national parks like Yosemite in California and Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado are being overwhelmed with trash and vandalism.The Department of Agriculture announced Tuesday that Americans who receive food assistance will still get benefits for February even if the shutdown continues, though the agency did not make any promises about March. Suspending benefits, which is what would apparently happen if the shutdown continues past March, would have serious economic consequences <U+2015> and create a lot more hunger for the nation s 38 million Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program enrollees.Watch Fay deliver his head-scratching proposal around the 21:50 mark below:This article has been updated to include Fay s comment to HuffPost."

The reversal suggests that a funding bill similar to last month s could pass in this Congress, too, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refuses to allow a vote on any spending bill that does not have the support of the president. It s possible a bill to reopen the government could pass with enough support to override a presidential veto. But Republicans suggested Wednesday they wouldn t dare. I m going to defer to the president on the best strategy and I would never vote to override a veto on something that the president didn t think was the best approach,  Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told HuffPost while carrying a lapdog named Mitch to McConnell s office on Wednesday. Fun meeting Mitch Tillis, the newest addition to the Tillis family! #mitchmeetmitch pic.twitter.com/0g41vfh9ktOther Republicans scoffed at the prospect of overriding a veto. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of GOP leadership, called the prospect of 20 Republicans joining all Democrats in bucking Trump over the wall  a waste of time,  adding that it would  never happen.  But if this Congress worked as the founders intended <U+2015> as a branch of government that is equal to the White House <U+2015> lawmakers could at least be given a chance to vote on a bill to reopen the government <U+2015> especially one they already passed less than a month ago. The Constitution doesn t make Congress subservient to the president,  Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said.  No one here has to follow the order of President Trump, especially when he s doing something bad for the country.  The funding bill that the Senate passed in December <U+2015> which would have kept the government operating until February but did not include any wall money <U+2015> passed easily, without a roll call vote, meaning zero out of 100 senators opposed it strongly enough to demand a roll call. Any Republican senator currently repeating the Trump administration s line about a  crisis  on the U.S.-Mexico border could have forced a recorded vote on the measure over its lack of border security funding, but none did. Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) said Wednesday that he was one of two senators who said  no  to the December funding bill on the Senate floor during the voice vote. The Appropriations Committee member did so, he said, because of a general objection to funding government via a short-term  continuing resolution  <U+2015> not the fact that it contained no funds for Trump s wall. I keep telling myself I m never voting for a CR again,  Moran told HuffPost. Before the Senate agreed to the resolution, McConnell said Republicans would  fulfill our duty to govern  even though Democrats were being intransigent about funding Trump s border wall (which, after all, the president had previously said would be funded by Mexico, not Congress). But then the House of Representatives, which was still under Republican control at the time, refused to hold a vote on the Senate bill because Trump had belatedly decided he opposed it, contrary to previous signals from the White House. The new Democratic House has approved funding but couldn t send the previously passed Senate measure to the president without the Senate passing it again.  The government has been shut down since Dec. 21, and the consequences are mounting. A range of services, including trash pickup in national parks, have ceased. This week, some 800,000 federal workers will start missing paychecks. The Internal Revenue Service announced an ad hoc plan to pay tax refunds, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it could pay food benefits for February but not necessarily March. Trump repeated Wednesday that the shutdown could continue  for as long as it takes,  raising the possibility that his push for a border wall could result in mass hunger for the 38 million Americans who currently receive food benefits each month.  Nevertheless, a funding bill that didn t include money for Trump s wall would not succeed now, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said. What we need is a negotiated outcome, not trying to vanquish your political foes, which is the exercise we re engaged in right now,  Cornyn said. HuffPost pointed out to Cornyn that Congress and the White House are coequal branches of government and that lawmakers could override a presidential veto.  With 67 votes,  Cornyn said, implying that the higher vote threshold for a veto override would be unreachable. While presidential veto overrides are rare, they have occurred many times in history. Most recently, Congress voted overwhelmingly to override President Barack Obama s veto of a bill that allowed families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-V.t.), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, predicted that a bill funding the government that did not include money for a wall would pass  overwhelmingly  if it was allowed to come to the floor. Every Republican will tell you that privately,  Leahy told HuffPost on Wednesday.Still, there are no signs that Republican leaders are planning on backing down. Trump visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday to reassure uneasy rank-and-file members and urge them to stand firm as the shutdown barrels toward its fourth week. Several moderates <U+2015> including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado <U+2015> have called for votes to reopen most of the government without a resolution on the wall funding.But some of the president s biggest allies in Congress say the issue of the wall is a life-and-death situation for the Trump administration <U+2015> and maybe even the Republican Party writ large. If we undercut the president, that s the end of his presidency and the end of our party,  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Tuesday in an interview on Fox News.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The Democratic leaders had begun by stressing the need to reopen the government.  I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO,  the president tweeted.Trump has made his proposed border wall the sole focus of the shutdown: Unless he can secure some $5 billion for the project, he will not agree to any budget proposal that would fully reopen the government.He continued:  I said bye-bye, nothing else works. Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!Schumer confirmed Trump s version of events, telling reporters gathered in front of the White House,  Well, unfortunately the president just got up and walked out  after Pelosi said she would not agree to funding for the wall.  He just got up and he said,  Then we have nothing to discuss.  And he just walked out. Again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldn t get his way,  Schumer said.According to a source familiar with the meeting, the Senate minority leader had confronted Trump in the situation room about the human cost of the partial shutdown, which has left some federal employees with diminishing means to pay for basic necessities.  You re using people as leverage. Why won t you open the government and stop hurting people?  Schumer said.According to the source, Trump replied:  Because then you won t give me what I want. Outside the White House, Pelosi echoed Schumer s message, telling reporters that she did not believe Trump fully appreciated the financial impact on the federal workers who have been showing up to work without getting paid, or who have not been able to work at all since the shutdown began just before Christmas.  The president seems to be insensitive to that. He thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money,  Pelosi said.  But they can t.  If you don t understand financial insecurity, then you would have a policy that takes pride in saying,  I m going to keep the government shut down for months or years unless you totally agree to my position,   she said.Asked whether the president acted out of anger, as alleged by Schumer, Vice President Mike Pence said he remembered Trump behaving calmly.  The president walked into the room and passed out candy. I don t recall him ever raising his voice or slamming his hand,  Pence said. The vice president told reporters that the Democratic leaders also objected to Trump s characterization of the situation at the southern border, which Pence referred to as  a humanitarian and security crisis.  Pelosi, Pence said,  began to argue whether we even had a crisis or whether facts are true.  The Trump administration <U+2015> including the vice president <U+2015> has invited sharp criticism this week for its numerous misleading claims about what is happening on the U.S. border with Mexico to justify the proposed wall. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed in a Sunday interview on  Fox News Sunday  that 4,000  known or suspected terrorists  had come into the U.S. illegally, prompting host Chris Wallace to fact-check her; the figure stemmed from people captured at airports. Pence cited the same misleading statistic in a Tuesday morning interview with  Good Morning America.  In his Tuesday evening address to the nation, Trump repeated many of the same lies and half-truths he has long told in regard to the wall, falsely claiming that Democrats want  open borders  and painting the migrants arriving at the border to seek asylum as dangerous criminals.

Roy Cooper (D) on Wednesday implored President Donald Trump to end the partial government shutdown in order to unlock funds meant to help the battered state recover from a destructive hurricane season.The shutdown, which began Dec. 22, poses a significant risk to North Carolina s farming economy and its ability to rebuild after deadly Hurricane Florence pummeled the state in September, Cooper wrote in a letter to the president. The people of North Carolina are strong and are working hard to rebuild,  Cooper wrote.  But we are equally determined to hold the federal government to its promise of help.  During your visit following Hurricane Florence, you promised me the 100 percent support of the federal government in North Carolina s recovery,  the letter continued.  This shutdown makes that promise harder to keep. Please work with Congressional leaders to end this shutdown so our communities can rebuild quickly and effectively.  Florence left 41 people dead in North Carolina and dumped an estimated 8 trillion gallons of water, flooding homes and businesses across the state. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in September designated $1.68 billion for states impacted by 2018 storms, but hasn t notified those states about how much funding they will receive, Cooper wrote.Additionally, HUD awarded North Carolina $168 million last April to make the state s flood-prone areas safer, but the state is unable to use those funds until guidance is published in the Federal Register, which cannot happen during a shutdown, the governor added. The government shutdown is also threatening the livelihood of our farmers, many of whom were swamped by the same hurricane waters that destroyed homes and businesses,  Cooper wrote.  Help from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for hurricane affected farms is unavailable, and farmers hoping to plan for this year s planting season are running out of time. North Carolina farmers and livestock producers suffered an estimated $1.1 billion in losses due to Florence, which killed at least 5,500 hogs and 4.1 million chickens and turkeys, the state s Department of Agriculture announced in September. The weekslong budget impasse centers on Trump s demand for $5 billion to build his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Several agencies, including the USDA and the Department of Homeland Security, have been affected by the shutdown. About 800,000 federal workers across the country have been furloughed or, if deemed essential, continue to work without pay.The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost s request for comment.Read Cooper s letter to Trump below:Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Three weeks after the start of a partial shutdown of the federal government shuttered many of the EPA s services, Trump sent Wheeler s formal nomination to the Senate for confirmation. I am honored and grateful that President Trump has nominated me to lead the Environmental Protection Agency,  Wheeler said in a statement.  For me, there is no greater responsibility than protecting human health and the environment, and I look forward to carrying out this essential task on behalf of the American public. Wheeler is the latest former employee of an industry regulated by the agency he now leads to be on the verge of ascending in the president s Cabinet.Last year, the Senate confirmed Alex Azar, a former executive at the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. On Jan. 1, former Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan took over as acting secretary at the Department of Defense after Secretary James Mattis  abrupt resignation. The next day, David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist and No. 2 at the Department of the Interior, became acting secretary when the agency s boss, Ryan Zinke, stepped down amid mounting ethics probes. Wheeler s promotion was expected. Trump announced plans to nominate Wheeler to the job in November. Wheeler, the former deputy administrator, told The New York Times that month that he felt he was  making a difference.   This is a transitional time for the agency,  he said.  We ve started a number of initiatives that I d like to see through to conclusion. Wheeler took over the agency six months ago when scandal-plagued former Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in disgrace. Close allies of Pruitt, including Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), swiftly touted Wheeler as an adequate replacement who would reliably carry out Trump s pro-fossil-fuel agenda. Wheeler delivered. In August, he proposed gutting fuel economy standards for new vehicles in a move seen as a  giant giveaway  to oil companies even as electric automobile technology made historic leaps forward. Weeks later, he unveiled a rule to weaken a landmark Obama-era power plant regulation, allowing by the EPA s own calculus enough pollution to cause an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year.  In November, when scientists at 13 federal agencies, including the EPA, determined in the annual National Climate Assessment that global warming was rapidly worsening, Wheeler responded by threatening to intervene in the next report s drafting. In December, Wheeler handed two more victories to the coal industry that paid him to lobby until mid-2017. In the first week of the month, he proposed softening a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. By the end of the month, he announced plans to relax a rule restricting how much mercury and other dangerous pollutants coal-fired plants can release into the air.  Installing Wheeler as the nation s 15th EPA chief is a formality. Last month, Wheeler became the longest-serving acting administrator in the EPA s 48-year history, surpassing Bob Perciasepe s roughly five-month stint as acting administrator in 2013. Acting rules for the EPA are vague and have generally gone unchallenged, and some argued Wheeler could have remained in his current role for the rest of Trump s first term.Yet with a Republican majority in the Senate, Wheeler seems likely to win confirmation. His nomination to serve as Pruitt s No. 2 faced little opposition. Democrats largely overlooked him during the initial confirmation hearing in November 2017. He couched blatant climate change denial in smooth legalese. He appeared moderate next to Kathleen Hartnett White, the right-wing ideologue nominated to serve as the head of the Council on Environmental Quality, whose humiliating performance captured Democrats  attention at the confirmation hearing she shared with Wheeler. Wheeler s nomination finally came up for a vote in the Senate last April as allegations against Pruitt began to surface. Ahead of the vote, at least one Democratic senator warned that the process seemed  like a shadow confirmation vote for the next administrator of the EPA.  Yet every Republican and three Democrats in the Senate <U+2015> more support than Pruitt himself received in his confirmation vote <U+2015> confirmed him as Pruitt s No. 2.Republican challengers unseated two of those Democrats, and the remaining one, Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), is expected to support Wheeler again.Wheeler has faced his own controversies. As HuffPost reported in October, the agency chief repeatedly engaged with incendiary, partisan content on his personal Facebook and Twitter accounts over the past five years. The online activity included liking a racist image of former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama on Facebook and retweeting an infamous  Pizzagate  conspiracy theorist. At least two Democratic senators called on him to resign. In early February last year, The Intercept reported that Wheeler held fundraisers for Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Inhofe in May, five months before his formal nomination to be deputy administrator came before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, on which the senators serve.That same month, HuffPost reported that two nonpartisan groups of regional air pollution regulators accused Wheeler of abusing his power as a Senate aide in the early 2000s to  bully  and  intimidate  the organizations when they opposed a bill Inhofe, Wheeler s boss at the time, introduced.  In a statement Wednesday, Barrasso, the Environment and Public Works Committee chairman, vowed to push to confirm Wheeler as administrator.  Acting Administrator Wheeler has done an outstanding job leading EPA and is well qualified to run the agency on a permanent basis,  he said.  I will work with committee members to get him confirmed. This story has been updated with statements from Barrasso and Wheeler.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The bizarre proclamation furthers the administration s attempt to pin the devastation on environmentalists while ignoring the clear impact climate change is having on extreme fires out west.  Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forrest (sic) fires that, with proper Forrest (sic) Management, would never happen,  he wrote in a since-deleted post to Twitter.  Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money! There was no further information on the veracity of Trump s Twitter claim. The White House and FEMA did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday. FEMA is also impacted by the ongoing partial government shutdown and, as Washington Post reporter Damian Paletta highlighted, doesn t have money to send to the state.The announcement comes as California reels from one of its worst wildfire seasons on record. The Mendocino Complex fire, the largest wildfire in the state s recorded history, burned more than 450,000 acres north of Santa Rosa in July. November s Camp fire <U+2015> the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California s history   engulfed more than 153,000 acres, destroyed nearly 19,000 structures and killed at least 86 people.Trump has blamed the state s devastating infernos on everything from a lack of raking to a nonexistent water shortage resulting from  bad environmental laws.  And the administration has used the disasters to push partisan policy, connecting the blazes to a longstanding fight between farmers and environmentalists over water resources.But the reality is that the federal government manages more land in California than the state. And many of the state s worst fires have burned primarily federal lands, as the Redding Record Searchlight reported.Last month, Trump signed an executive order to boost logging and forest thinning on more than 4 million acres of federal lands to combat extreme wildfires. The order directs the Interior Department and the Department of Agriculture to identify ways to reduce  regulatory barriers  to better manage forests and get rid of hazardous fuels, and it calls for  treating  4.25 million federal acres   an area larger than Connecticut   to cut fuel loads.Newly inaugurated California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) were among the state leaders that swung back at Trump s announcement. Disasters and recovery are no time for politics,  wrote Newsom, who on Tuesday announced an interstate partnership and a pair of executive orders to combat the wildfire problem.  I m already taking action to modernize and manage our forests and emergency responses,  he added in a post to Twitter.  The people of CA <U+2015> folks in Paradise <U+2015> should not be victims to partisan bickering.  We should work together to mitigate these fires by combating climate change, not play politics by threatening to withhold money from survivors of a deadly natural disaster,  Harris wrote in her own post.

This will be about 30 bucks,  he said.  It s a big expenditure right now. Thirty bucks 19 days ago was not a big deal, but with the government shut down and no end and no pay in sight, every dollar counts. Our last paycheck was near the end of December, and went to cover our mortgage, electric bill, car note, insurance, cable and internet, cellphone bill, and medications. I paid everything at once, not knowing when this shutdown would end and when we would get another paycheck. We are a one-income family <U+2015> my husband s paycheck.My husband, whose identity I am keeping hidden for fear of agency retribution or loss of his job, is an essential government employee, which, unlike furloughed employees, means he must go to work or lose his job. But, like furloughed workers, he is not getting paid. It will depend on Congress whether he eventually receives back pay. His job helps ensure the safety of the flying public. He manages resources (flight data and radar systems) for the air traffic controllers, which can be a stressful operation if one of the systems breaks or goes offline.During this shutdown, he has worked every day since New Year s, and will not have a scheduled day off for four more days. He also has been pulling overtime occasionally, as there are not enough workers to man the systems.Each day this shutdown continues, he and his co-workers become more nervous. One co-worker has three sons and is worried about feeding them. Another is worried about paying her daughter s college tuition. Some of his co-workers said they were running out of money entirely and will soon have to figure out how to get to work, since they won t be able to afford gas. They are paying for school, mortgages, groceries, light bills and other everyday things, and are not receiving a paycheck. This cannot hold.My husband has diabetes. I have asthma, severe allergies that require three medications, and anxiety and depression. We have been stretching the budget as far as possible; we ve canceled doctor appointments, suspended IRA contributions, shopped our freezer and pantry, have not been able to pay our $500 homeowner association fees, did not renew our Costco membership, and kept the heat very low and the lights off for most of the day to save on our electric bill. We are responsible people. We have never been frivolous or spendthrifts. We drive newer used cars, buy generic brands, cook our meals at home, haven t had a vacation in years, and always buy things on sale. We live in a modest house. We save for retirement, pay our bills, and add to our savings when we can. But when you ve spent $15,000 on a new roof that needed to be torn down to the decking after Hurricane Harvey and you had to put in new floors, savings are pretty much depleted. I check our bank account and the budget every few days to see how long we can go without a paycheck. We have enough money to last into February, but after that, we are in serious trouble. The money we do have can only pay for bills, groceries, and essentials like that cat litter. If we have an emergency   a car breaks down, an illness, hospitalization, anything, really   what money we do have will be in jeopardy. I have tremendous gratitude for help we ve received, like a few gift cards for Amazon and Walmart, which went to buy one of my allergy medications, toothpaste, rice, my husband s NescafÈ, and cat food.We try to offer thanksgivings for any money in the bank, a roof over our head, food on the table, a bed to sleep in, and central heating, and we pray a lot that this ends, soon. However, we have little faith that the president understands the plight that we and 800,000 other government workers are in   the serious and real decisions about food, shelter, lights, gas that are being made right now.Even friends, family members and, of course, internet trolls, have voiced their opinions on how  these people  (federal employees) should have prepared better, saved three months  expenses  because Dave Ramsey says that s what you should do.  I ve also heard from people that it s basically a vacation, right? But I m not quite sure what vacation one would go on that has them worrying about paying for toilet paper, food, medication and electricity. And no federal worker whom I or my husband has spoken with wants to trade their paycheck for a wall.This situation demonstrates the impact that this political fight has on working families in America. American workers should not be held hostage to any political whim or budgetary fight. When 800,000 government employees, including us, who have worked hard and given their lives to make this country a safer and better place are either forced out of their job or, like my husband, forced to work without a paycheck, this highlights the glaring divide between the economic class structures in this country and the quick descent of class mobility.This must end.

Now, some are quitting altogether, their union says.In a statement released Tuesday, the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents the workers, warned that safety could take a big hit in transit hubs as the federal government shutdown drags into week three, leaving staff without pay. Every day I m getting calls from my members about their extreme financial hardships and need for a paycheck,  said Hydrick Thomas, the organization s TSA Council president.  Some of them have already quit and many are considering quitting the federal workforce because of this shutdown. The loss of officers, while we re already shorthanded, will create a massive security risk for American travelers since we don t have enough trainees in the pipeline or the ability to process new hires. Last week, AFGE launched a lawsuit against the federal government for forcing federal employees to show up to work uncompensated, calling the demands  inhumane.  Around that time, the union said TSA agents were starting to skip work. The situation now appearing to be escalating.In addition to raising security issues, fewer staffers on duty would increase wait times with longer lines at airports. It is completely unacceptable that the women and men who risk their lives safeguarding our airports are still required to report for work without knowing when they ll be paid again,  AFGE National President J. David Cox Sr. said.Cox argued that compared with other agencies, the workers are facing tougher conditions and lackluster wages, making the shutdown especially grueling. TSA Officers already have the least amount of rights of any federal officer, some of the lowest pay and highest attrition rates in government, and among the lowest morale of any federal agency. Working for weeks on end without being compensated <U+2015> while already being short-staffed <U+2015> only makes their situation worse,  he said.The federal government spiraled into a partial shutdown last month over Congress  inability to pass a spending bill including President Donald Trump s demand for border wall funding. He s seeking more than $5 billion, but Democrats have yet to budge and no end to the impasse is in sight.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

The funding package passed the House last week, but stalled in the GOP-led Senate. The nine representatives include Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, the only black Republican member of the House.Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Texas), who supported the House measures, asked on Monday that Trump  put his calls for a physical barrier to rest.

Jay Inslee (D) signed a pledge Tuesday promising to reject donations from the fossil fuel industry ahead of a likely run for the White House that he s vowed to uniquely center on climate change. In an interview with HuffPost, Inslee, 67, said he added his name to the list of more than 1,300 politicians across the United States who took the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge. The vow, administered by a coalition of 16 left-leaning environmental groups, commits candidates to  adopt a policy to not knowingly accept any contributions over $200 from the PACs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies   companies whose primary business is the extraction, processing, distribution, or sale of oil, gas, or coal.  This is just one small statement that they should not continue to have undue influence over our decision-making over the existential threat against our nation,  Inslee said by phone Tuesday night.  This challenge calls for the scale of national effort similar to when we went to the moon, similar to when we beat fascism.  Inslee is the second governor to sign the pledge, following newly elected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D). California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who was sworn in this week, took a similar pledge <U+2015> called Oil Money Out <U+2015> but the oath was limited to the oil industry in the Golden State. But Inslee is the third likely contender for the next Democratic presidential nomination to take the pledge, after Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). The Democratic Party has to put a candidate forward who will make it the primary commitment to get this stuff done,  Inslee said.  It can t be put in just one of the baskets of many issues.  By signing, Inslee is laying the groundwork for a historic, if long-shot, bid for the presidency on the single issue of scaling back planet-warming emissions and preparing for climate change. The move is bold but timely. Record-breaking storms, droughts and wildfires wreaked havoc across the U.S. over the past three years as President Donald Trump attempted to boost the fossil fuel industry by gutting or delaying nearly every major federal climate regulation. Even amid a three-week partial government shutdown leaving federal workers scrambling for pay, the Trump administration is continuing to approve oil and gas drilling permits, Bloomberg reported. In October, United Nations scientists issued a dire warning, giving world governments a 2030 deadline to halve emissions or face a cataclysmic temperature spike. Yet emissions hit an all-time high last year and look set to continue soaring as new estimates released Tuesday showed a 3.4 percent surge in the United States alone. A new generation of left-wing Democrats, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), ran as champions of a Green New Deal, a sweeping federal policy to end fossil fuel use and guarantee high-wage clean-energy sector jobs to every American. It s a popular idea. One poll released last month pegged the number of registered voters who support a Green New Deal at 81 percent, including 57 percent of conservative Republicans.Yet only some of the high-profile Democrats hoping to challenge Trump in 2020 have made the issue a top priority. Sanders held a town hall on climate change in December and is preparing legislation on a Green New Deal. Merkley was the first senator to back a Green New Deal last year. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) followed soon after, explicitly tying his push for a federal job guarantee to the climate proposal.Former Rep. Beto O Rourke (D-Texas) and Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) voiced tepid support for the concept of a Green New Deal. The pledge, even more than the Green New Deal, represents a true litmus test for serious climate action in 2020 and beyond,  R.L. Miller, the president of the political action committee Climate Hawks Vote, said by email of Inslee s announcement.  Our democracy is being drowned in a dark oily tidal wave of dirty money and it needs leaders who can rise above. Inslee stands alone as the first candidate to say climate change takes priority over other hot-button issues like health care, immigration and inequality.  The political capital that needs to be invested, the intense gathering of allies to push this through Congress, just requires an all-out effort,  Inslee said.  That s not going to be done just because somebody now decides they re interested in climate change. It takes someone who s frankly cared about it for years and years.  Inslee boasts a lengthy record on climate. In 2006, Inslee, then one of Washington s 10 U.S. representatives, spearheaded an effort to set a renewable portfolio standard in the Evergreen State. In 2007, he co-authored a book called Apollo s Fire: Igniting America s Clean Energy Economy, which, as the title implies, laid out a vision for bolstering the renewable-energy and electric-vehicle industries. In 2009, he co-founded the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition in the House of Representatives. Later that year, he sponsored the federal cap-and-trade bill known as Waxman-Markey. Since he was first elected governor in 2012, Inslee repeatedly championed incentives for electric vehicles, with the goal of getting 50,000 on Washington state roads by 2020. In 2016, he became the first governor to issue an executive order capping carbon dioxide emissions. A glowing profile published last week in The Atlantic credited Inslee with pursuing  arguably the most progressive and greenest agenda in the country, with fields of solar panels, fleets of electric buses, and massive job growth to show for it. In just the past year, Inslee kiboshed two major fossil fuel projects and added new regulations on existing infrastructure. Last January, he personally intervened to reject permits to build what would have been the nation s largest oil-by-rail facility at the Port of Vancouver. He signed a bill in March putting a new tax on pipelines, forcing the operators to fund a state program to protect against oil spills. In May, he blocked construction of a $680 million coal-export terminal on the Columbia River. This is the 11th hour,  Inslee said of the time that s left to halt catastrophic global warming.  But it should be our hour to shine. Inslee fought over the past year to pass Initiative 1631, a ballot measure that would have put a $15 per metric ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions and directed the money toward expanding public transit, energy-efficiency retrofits for big buildings and new wind- and solar-powered plants. The proposal, dubbed by some a state-level Green New Deal, failed after the oil industry spent a record $31 million pressuring Evergreen State voters to reject the measure. It was Inslee s third attempt at putting a price on carbon in his state.But Inslee said he s not wedded to a carbon pricing scheme as the central focus of a climate policy. Carbon taxes are gaining favor among Republicans and oil companies. But a new gas tax triggered fiery protests in France and became a rallying cry over the past few months against carbon taxes that don t directly benefit low- and middle-income workers. People have focused on this issue of a carbon tax, but it may not be necessary  to finance renewable energy infrastructure, Inslee said.  We may find other ways to finance this. You look at the Trump tax cuts that were misbegotten and gave all these tax benefits to the upper-income groups, and people weren t worried about the deficit when they did that.  Inslee faces some critics on climate change. In February, 13 young people in Washington, ages seven to 17, sued the state, alleging Inslee and the agencies under his control violated the constitutional rights of a generation by failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions. One plaintiff <U+2015> Jamie Margolin, a 17-year-old activist in Seattle who founded the youth climate group Zero Hour <U+2015> railed against Inslee in a series of tweets last week accusing the governor of fighting  tooth & nail  against the lawsuit, which a state judge tossed in August. Margolin called Inslee  an old corperate [sic] establishment white man who screws over the youth and indigenous folks of his state.  She pointed to the ongoing fight over a massive liquefied natural gas terminal in Tacoma, Washington, which the Puyallup Tribe and leaders from 14 other Northwest tribes pleaded with Inslee to reject. Asked about the accusations on Tuesday, Inslee said the Tacoma facility had already begun permitting and that his administration was  going to follow the law  and allow the process to play out, though he said he requested additional carbon dioxide analyses of the project.  I cannot make statements about eventual permitting until that plays out,  he said. In a follow-up email, Inslee s spokesman reiterated that the project  doesn t have final permitting yet.  Earlier this year, Inslee visited the scorched remains of Paradise, California, a town decimated by the state s deadliest wildfire in history. He said that visit made clear to him that the 2020 election needed to be singularly focused on the crisis at hand.  It looked like Dresden after World War II,  Inslee said.  In my final days, when I look back and ask what I did to deal with climate change, I want to be able to say I did everything I could, including possibly running for president.

But the 10-minute address, carried on every major television network in America, was rife with double-speak, cherry-picked statistics and outright falsehoods.Take a look at some of the biggest lies from the president s speech below. The wall will always be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico. After abandoning his campaign pledge that Mexico would directly pay for a barrier along the southern border, Trump has instead insisted in recent months that the country would do so indirectly through a revised North American Free Trade Agreement. However, both economists and trade experts have said that won t be the case. First, the revised trade deal hasn t been approved by Congress yet, and any economic benefits would simply come from lower tariffs or increased wages for Americans. Those benefits will be dwarfed by the actual cost of the wall, many outside experts say, and it ll be American taxpayers who will ultimately pay for the massive structure if it goes forward. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. More than 90 percent of heroin sold in the United States does come from Mexico, but almost all of it is transported through legal ports of entry. Only a  small percentage of all heroin seized by CBP along the land border was between Ports of Entry,  the Drug Enforcement Administration said in a report last year.Fentanyl, a major narcotic that has led to a spate of drug overdoses, mainly comes into the United States through packages mailed from China and has been difficult for border agents to detect, according to The New York Times.Trump also said illicit drugs cost the U.S. some $500 billion annually, but a surgeon general report in 2015 estimated that toll at around a third of the president s figure, or $193 billion. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. Customs and Border Protection reported in November that a little more than 20,000  family units  were captured at the southern border. But only a small percentage of these family units have been determined to be a ploy in an attempt to sneak over the border, according to an analysis by The Washington Post.The majority of migrant children are accompanied by their parents or other relatives. Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.  The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security. Trump accused Democrats in Congress of holding up the government shutdown by stonewalling negotiations on border security. In fact, Democrats offered to allocate $1.3 billion in the budget for border security, which included building and refurbishing barriers at the border.During a meeting with Trump in December, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) agreed with the president that the country needed border security. They also asked Trump if he would be willing to budge from his $5.7 billion request.In that same meeting, Trump maintained that he would keep the government shutdown going if he didn t get what he wanted, contradicting Tuesday night s address where he solely blamed Democrats for the shutdown. Yes, if we don t get what we want, one way or the other   whether it s through you, through a military, through anything you want to call   I will shut down the government. Absolutely,  Trump said in December.He added:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security.  Sen. Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats,  Trump said.  They changed their mind only after I was elected president. Schumer did previously support a bill that allowed for the construction of a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border, but that fence pales in comparison to the  big, beautiful  30-foot concrete wall that Trump promised his supporters. In 2006, Schumer, along with then-Sens. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and 22 other Democrats, voted for the Secure Fence Act, which authorized a fence to be built along 700 miles of the border and included short vehicle barriers and additional surveillance.Trump s plans for his border wall vary over time and are vague, but here s what we do know: According to a 2017 executive order, it would be an  impassable physical barrier,  which Trump first proclaimed would be made of concrete before switching to  steel slats.  He s also said the wall had to be 30 feet or higher.As Trump pointed out himself while campaigning for president in 2015, his border wall would be nothing like a fence.  It s not a fence,  Trump said in a tweet addressed to Jeb Bush.  It s a WALL, and there s a BIG difference!  In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don t act right now. The statistics that Trump uses are mostly accurate, though he frames it in a way to make immigrants crossing the border more dangerous than they actually are. According to ICE s year-end report, the agency arrested 210,876 people with previous criminal convictions and 55,233 people with pending charges <U+2015> but the criminal convictions include such non-violent offenses as DUIs and other traffic violations.The second set of numbers he provides are based on specific charges and convictions. As the Washington Post s Salvador Rizzo pointed out,  In many cases, the people arrested face multiple counts, so that switch [to focusing on charges and convictions] gives a confusing picture.   At the request of Democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. The reality: Democrats don t want a wall. Period. They do, however, want an end to the shutdown. The fact is: We all agree that we need to secure our borders, while honoring our values,  Pelosi said in the Democrats  rebuttal speech.  We can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry; we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation; we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border; and we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.  Make no mistake: Democrats and the president both want stronger border security,  Schumer added.  However, we sharply disagree with the president about the most effective way to do it.

The president did something he doesn t do very often, and I thought he did it, for him, very well, which is to show a softer side, to make a more compassionate argument and to tone down the rhetoric,  Santorum said.He added that what was needed going forward was  the presidential Donald Trump who actually thought through this speech. Navarro, a Republican strategist and another one of the network s commentators, suggested it didn t really matter whether Trump planned out his words. When you have a president who lies consistently and pathologically and then you see him scripted once every blue moon, you don t buy it,  she said.  You don t believe him. You know he is scripted. Further dismissing Trump s remarks, Navarro argued that  the majority of the American people have now come to understand that this is a lying president.  He lied today,  she said.  It s not inaccuracies, it s not facts and alternative facts. It is downright lies to try to make a political point. Trump s speech quickly became the subject of controversy for its series of misleading statements and falsehoods, the first of which occurred in his opening line. According to Washington Post journalist Salvador Rizzo, Trump s assertion of a  security crisis at the southern border  didn t hold water given that the number of attempted illegal border crossings had hit an almost 20-year low.The primetime speech was part of the president s push for more than $5 billion in border wall funding amid a partial government shutdown that has now entered its third week.(h/t RawStory)Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called climate change  the biggest crisis of all  in a fiery rebuke of President Donald Trump s televised address Tuesday night meant to drum up support for funding a U.S.-Mexico border wall to reopen the federal government. Speaking shortly after Trump s prime-time Oval Office speech, Sanders listed the 30 million Americans without health insurance, the millions of senior citizens in  desperate poverty  and the 40 million young Americans  trying to deal with outrageous debt  as issues meriting a White House declaration of a national emergency. But the Vermont senator and likely 2020 presidential candidate said human-caused global warming should top the president s priorities.  The scientific community has made it very clear in telling us that climate change is real and is causing devastating harm to our country and the entire planet,  Sanders said.  They have told us in no uncertain terms that if we do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, our nation and our planet and the planet we will be leaving our kids and grandchildren may well become unhealthy and even uninhabitable in the not-so-distant future.  He added:  Mr. President, we don t need to create artificial crises, we have enough real crises. The clarion call capped off Sanders  roughly nine-minute response and stood in stark contrast to the humdrum address the two top Democrats in Congress gave immediately after Trump s speech. In a response aired on nearly every major network, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused the president of using  the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration  and of  holding hostage critical services for the health, safety and wellbeing of the American people.  They made no mention of climate change.The two Democratic leaders, who were standing soberly side by side, drew mockery for appearing like two proverbial parents expressing disappointment with a misbehaving teen. If that official Democratic response was meant to demonstrate the poise and civility that plays well with the Beltway crowd, Sanders  seemed targeted at average American voters. He opened with a list of people victimized by the three-week shutdown of the federal government, including  the disabled, their children and the elderly  on food stamps, small businesses and farmers owed financial assistance, and would-be homeowners or sellers awaiting the processing of mortgage applications. (He didn t mention, however, that the Trump administration has continued processing oil and gas drilling permits, according to Bloomberg.)Then, Sanders recalled the Senate bill to fund the government that passed unanimously on Dec. 19 and said it was  widely expected  that the next day,  the House would do the same  and  the government would remain open.   Unfortunately, President Trump, who started receiving criticism from an assortment of right-wing ideologues, changed his mind about the agreement,  Sanders said. He then read aloud quotes in which Trump said he is  proud to shut down the government.   In terms of the shutdown, President Trump has made it very clear who was responsible,  Sanders said.In the middle of his speech, Sanders called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) directly, saying,  let s vote to end the shutdown now in a bipartisan way.  It gives me no pleasure to tell you what most of you already know, and that is that President Trump lies all of the time,  Sanders said, his voice rising.  In his remarks tonight and in recent weeks regarding immigration and the wall, he continues to lie. Sanders stopped short of denouncing the president s repeated statements that call the science behind global warming into question. But as he gears up for a second White House bid, the senator is making climate change a central focus of his campaign. In December, he hosted a televised town hall talk on global warming and repeatedly tried to push the policy debate beyond whether or not climate science is real and toward  a political revolution that takes on the fossil fuel billionaires, accelerates our transition to clean energy, and finally puts people before the profits of polluters. In a twist, a right-wing commentator seemingly alluded to Sanders  words on Tuesday. Erick Erickson, a vocal conservative critic of Trump, suggested on Twitter that, if GOP lawmakers cave to the president s border demands,  it is only a matter of time before a progressive President declares climate change a national emergency and uses eminent domain to shutter coal plants, etc.  Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

He repeated his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall money to end the nearly three-week partial shutdown of the federal government, offering the deal as the only solution to a major national security crisis. He put the onus on congressional lawmakers to craft such a plan to reopen more than half a dozen federal agencies that have remained partly shuttered since before Christmas. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?  Trump asked during the address.  For those who refuse to compromise in the name of job security, I would ask, imagine if it were your child, your husband or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken. To every member of Congress, pass a bill that ends this crisis. Trump repeated several mistruths in an attempt to tout the barrier, casting migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. as criminals and listing off a slew of crimes that critics saw as an attempt to generate fear.After the #TrumpAddress, @SenSchumer & I are talking about the facts & how we can end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/hoqAKwoqf9 This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a televised address after Trump s speech.During the address, Trump also tried to pit Americans of color against undocumented immigrants in his quest for public sympathy. All Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest-hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans,  said Trump, who largely won his election by playing to the anxieties of white voters.He also repeated misleading claims that Mexico would indirectly pay for the wall through a revised trade deal, an assertion that has been debunked by leading economists. Trade experts say any benefits from the revamped deal would be dwarfed by the cost of the wall.The president s address, which ran for around 10 minutes, was carried by every major television network in America as well as some cable providers. The media giants had to make quick decisions as to whether they would accommodate Trump, who tweeted his intentions to speak to the country during prime time in a missive just a day earlier.About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the partial shutdown thus far, and many have been required to go to work without pay. There are no signs the shutdown will end anytime soon with the president s latest demands.Leading Democrats demanded they be given equal airtime to counter the president s address, which contained multiple falsehoods and mistruths. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) fired back shortly after Trump ended his speech, saying the president s recent behavior was  full of misinformation and even malice.  The president has chosen fear. We want to start with the facts,  Pelosi said, noting that House Democrats passed legislation to reopen the government on the first day of the new Congress.  The president is rejecting these bipartisan bills which would reopen government   over his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall. Trump had reportedly been working with White House staff to create justification to declare a national emergency to build the wall unilaterally, but made no such announcement on Tuesday. Democratic lawmakers have vowed to challenge the administration if it attempts to do so, and such a move would guarantee the issue would go to federal court.The president plans to travel to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday.This is a developing story.

This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It s also what our professionals at the border want and need,  Trump said, describing the impasse as a  choice between right and wrong, between justice and injustice. But the only thing resembling a crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border isn t an existential threat to national security <U+2015> it s the question of how to handle a historically high number of Central American families and children coming into the country, many of whom are asking for asylum or some other humanitarian relief from deportation. The White House position on the issue is clear: Trump wants to either indefinitely detain the Central American migrants or cast them back to Mexico. But the wall won t achieve either of those aims. Instead, the ploy harkens back to the symbolic solution to a largely fabricated crisis that paved Trump s way to the presidency back in 2016.There was no border crisis when Trump launched his campaign in the summer of 2015, promising to wall off the Southern border. Instead, unauthorized crossings stood at their lowest levels since the 1970s. By the numbers, there s still no crisis <U+2015> the unauthorized population of the United States has remained flat for more than a decade.What has changed in recent years is that more of the migrants who do cross without authorization are Central American asylum seekers <U+2015> often traveling together as families or unaccompanied minors. That trend, which began in the summer of 2014, predates Trump. But since he took office, the number of Central American families crossing has risen to historic highs.In 2010, just 10 percent of all migrants apprehended by Border Patrol were families and unaccompanied children <U+2015> instead, most were single men. As of November 2018, families and unaccompanied children make up 57 percent of those apprehended.The Trump administration has constantly rehauled the immigration enforcement system to scare off the migrant families and children. But none of it <U+2015>  zero tolerance  prosecutions for petty immigration offenses, a six-week experiment with systematic family separation, the mobilization of the National Guard and U.S. military, a court-enjoined policy barring migrants from asking for asylum <U+2015> have stopped them from arriving.That trend isn t particularly surprising. The three countries sending by far the most migrants since 2014 <U+2015> Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras <U+2015> all face extreme poverty and some of the highest homicide rates in the world. And now, Trump s focus on the wall and several policy changes have led to humanitarian problems of his own making.Customs and Border Protection officers are only letting between 30 and 90 people a day through legal ports of entry. As a result of that  metering  policy, thousands of migrants are waiting for weeks or months in shelters near the border, which in some cases are outdoor camps with limited access to clean water or large enclosed facilities where disease can easily spread. With legal ports of entry largely blocked, many migrants find smugglers to take them on dangerous journeys through mountains and deserts to remote Border Patrol stations far away from medical services. The number of parents and children traveling through the El Paso sector, which includes a large swath of the Chihuahuan Desert, has risen by more than 1,500 percent over the past year. The number of border deaths has likewise increased.If they reach the U.S., families and kids traveling by themselves are put in overcrowded Border Patrol stations that are struggling to deal with the influx of migrants. The Washington Post reported that in recent weeks, agents have been bringing dozens of sick migrants to clinics and hospitals. Last month, two children died while in Border Patrol custody. In June, Trump implemented a new sponsor vetting policy that has forced children to languish for up to six months in long-term shelters. (In December, the administration rolled back some of the requirements for its vetting policy.) The number of unaccompanied children detained in government custody is at a record high.Trump won the presidency in 2016 largely by fabricating a border crisis and hawking a massive wall as the solution to the contrived problem. Now, he s upped the ante, by portraying migrant children and families from Latin America as a security threat so grave that the federal government shouldn t reopen without committing to building a symbolic wall to, in theory, keep them out.

However, the president has consistently propagated various lies about the wall, including his sensationalist claim that former presidents support its construction.The CNN host remarked that Trump had built nothing more than a  wall of lies  around the entire issue. There may be no issue where the president and his administration have been more misleading than on the subject of immigration,  he said. Trump s own senior administration officials privately acknowledge that the continued spreading of falsehoods about this issue has created a real problem as the president takes to the mound and prepares to make his pitch,  Tapper later added.Watch Tapper take on Trump s  wall of lies  in the clip below."

The Senate will not waste floor time on show votes, messaging votes, or any other proposals which fail to check those boxes regarding the funding bill,  McConnell said on the floor.Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to override a presidential veto on any legislation. But McConnell did not mention that on Tuesday.The legislative package Democrats blocked Tuesday includes security assistance to Israel and Jordan, sanctions on the Syria regime, and a measure that aims to block boycotts of Israel. Some Democrats have endorsed bills disallowing boycotts, but critics say such measures violate the First Amendment right to free speech.In a 56-44 vote, Democrats denied the package the chamber s required 60-vote threshold to open debate. Four Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the bill: Doug Jones of Alabama, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.McConnell on Tuesday immediately moved to bring up the foreign policy bill again later this week, signaling he had no intention of backing down to the Democrats  demands. His office also issued a press release noting that the Democratic-controlled Senate continued to pass bills amid the 2013 federal government shutdown, which was more severe and affected more workers.It s unclear how long Democrats can remain united in blocking legislation from coming to the floor. Whereas nearly a dozen Democratic senators have pledged to filibuster all unrelated bills <U+2015> following the urging of Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) <U+2015> from coming to the floor, others are reserving judgment on future legislation. I ve made no decision on future votes without knowing what the bills are,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said Tuesday, adding that  there s simply no telling  if Democrats will continue the blockade into the future.A public lands bill that was held over from the last Congress is expected to get a vote next week, for example <U+2015> and it has support from a number of Western Democratic senators.Trump threatened last week to keep the federal government partly closed for  months or even years  if he did not get $5.7 billion for his wall at the southern border. But he is also considering declaring a national emergency with respect to the situation on the border, allowing him to direct the Department of Defense to construct the wall instead.There was little agreement among members of his own party on Capitol Hill if he could or should bypass Congress with an emergency declaration, however. That s not my preferred route. I don t know legally if you could do that,  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters on Tuesday, noting that such an  emergency declaration is likely to be challenged in court.Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), another Trump ally in Congress, agreed. There s a hard way and an easy way to do things. I think that would definitely be the hard way,  Cornyn said.But Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, argued that an emergency declaration would survive legal scrutiny if Trump decides to go down that path. I have read the law. It would not be frivolous if he does it,  Kennedy said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

But the ongoing partial government shutdown <U+2015> which is leaving some of the nation s lowest-paid law enforcement officials working without a paycheck <U+2015> risks creating a new crisis of corruption within the nation s prisons, airports and, ironically, at the border. Federal law enforcement agencies like the Bureau of Prisons, the Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection have long struggled with integrity issues, from smuggling contraband into prisons and stealing from luggage to taking bribes at the border. Forcing employees of these law enforcement agencies <U+2015> which have also struggled with morale issues <U+2015> to work without pay could exacerbate corruption problems, some experts told HuffPost. When unpaid law enforcement employees get desperate, some could become compromised.  As this thing goes on, and as people s financial situations become more dire, it always increases the risk for corruption,  says John Roth, the former inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes TSA and CBP.  It s ironic that you re increasing the risk of corruption at the same time as you re attempting to fortify the border. Roth, who retired in late 2017, told HuffPost he was particularly concerned about border patrol agents going without pay because they often work in isolation and their work gives them a tremendous opportunity to engage in corruption. The screening process for border patrol agents <U+2015> who start out with a base salary of around $40,000 <U+2015> has become lax as CBP s employee population exploded. Like a lot of law enforcement organizations, Customs and Border Patrol has an inadequate internal affairs system that a 2016 watchdog report found leaves it  vulnerable to a corruption scandal that could potentially threaten the security of our nation. While dozens of CBP employees have been prosecuted for corruption in recent years, experts believe the level of corruption within border patrol isn t fully recognized. Much of the border patrol corruption involves moving drugs or human trafficking, the type of problems that Trump has highlighted in his rhetoric about the southern border. The border patrol union, a conservative organization that has boosted Trump and his border wall, is backing Trump and the shutdown. Leaders of the National Border Patrol Council appeared alongside Trump at an unusual event in the White House press room last week, where they offered support for Trump s standoff with Congress over billions in border wall funding.  We are all affected by this shutdown,  union official Art Del Cueto told the White House press corps.  We have skin in the game.  Union President Brandon Judd said it was  not true  that federal employees don t agree with the government shutdown. Union officials didn t respond to requests for comment.Transportation Security Administration, where officers earn a base salary of $37,000 a year, has also been under scrutiny for employee misconduct. The agency, which struggles with morale issues, has seen several prosecutions in recent years involving drug smuggling and theft of passenger property. Hundreds of TSA employees have called in sick during the shutdown, some in hopes of working other jobs that would actually give them a paycheck. Federal prisons <U+2015> which house nearly 152,000 federal inmates, are another point of vulnerability. The average correctional officer starts out making the mid-$40,000 range, and their paychecks are about to stop in the next few days.Aaron McGlothin, a local union president for Mendota federal prison in California, said he s driving for Uber on nights and weekends to make ends meet. Most of his co-workers live paycheck to paycheck, and not being able to afford gas to get to work <U+2015> where they re not getting paid <U+2015> is a real threat. That opens the gate to potential corruption, he says. You always have those few bad apples that you don t know, and now you re getting inmates knowing what s going on,  he said.  This is an opportunity for them to prey on staff, give you $500 bucks or something and say  Get me some cigarettes.   There s a huge morale hit that happens when something like this happens, and the expectation is that you re going to be working for weeks at time without a paycheck,  said Roth, the former DHS inspector general. Rick Heldreth <U+2015> the union president for correctional staff at Hazelton, the federal prison in West Virginia beset with safety issues where Whitey Bulger was recently killed <U+2015> believes that morale hit is directly impacting his staff s ability to properly patrol the prison. In the last week, there have been three attacks on staff, with several minor injuries.Absenteeism plays a major role in those threats, Heldreth says, as the  blue flu  isn t solely a TSA problem.On top of the rising absenteeism <U+2015> McGlothin estimates his prison is at 20 percent <U+2015> and worsening safety issues, the shutdown is distracting correction workers from their normal levels of vigilance, Heldreth argued. The staff is distracted wondering if they ll able to pay their bills, people worry about losing their houses and their cars and afford health care and child care, on top of regular pressures,  he told HuffPost. Heldreth said he was forced to chose not to visit his parents over the Christmas holiday season to save cash. He also said he s been worried for the last few weeks about the potential corruption issue. After all, he s not alone: The government monitors the credit of federal correctional officers to make sure they re not easily compromised. And here it is out for public consumption that we re all in financial difficulty,  Heldreth added.One BOP registered nurse, who emailed HuffPost s tipline and whose husband is also employed by BOP, said that the shutdown had cut off all of their household income.  We have three children, and bills just as everyone else. It is beyond me that my livelihood is held hostage due to someone s temper tantrums,  the BOP employee said.  McGlothin said that BOP employees  opinion on the president <U+2015> and Congress, who they also blame <U+2015> is dropping by the day. I voted for Trump <U+2015> I don t support him right now; I don t support him with this shutdown,  he said.  He s never turned a fucking wrench in his life, he s never used a shovel to work hard labor <U+2015> he s always had everything handed to him on a silver platter.  The hardworking people of the federal government are working without pay and he s still eating lobster. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

We want to ensure states and SNAP recipients that the benefits for February will be provided,  Perdue told reporters.Perdue said that the last government funding bill Congress passed, which expired on Dec. 21, gave him 30 days to issue the following month s benefits, which will amount to nearly $5 billion overall. Perdue didn t make any promises about what would happen in March.President Donald Trump initiated the partial government shutdown last month in an effort to make Congress pay for a border wall that he previously said Mexico would fund. Congress has shown no willingness to play along, and Trump has said the shutdown could go on for  months or even years.  For now we have solved the problem of what to do about February SNAP benefits,  Perdue said Tuesday.  I believe this is ample time for Congress to act. Perdue said the U.S. Department of Agriculture would still have a $3 billion contingency fund that it might be able to use for benefits in March, but he didn t offer any details about the agency s plans for that month.Food assistance, commonly known as food stamps, is one of the federal government s most responsive antipoverty programs. Suspending benefits, which is what would apparently happen if the shutdown continues past March, would have serious economic consequences <U+2015> and create a lot more hunger.Word that the federal shutdown could suspend SNAP benefits has spread through state and local media since last week. Just on Tuesday, local reporters in Hawaii, New Jersey, South Carolina, Utah and several other states filed stories on the shutdown possibly bringing hunger to town.Perdue s plan will be no small administrative feat. The USDA is telling state agencies to suspend their normal operations this week so they can instead prepare to issue February s benefits early. States are responsible for taking federal SNAP funds and loading them onto debit cards for program enrollees to spend on food at grocery stores. The average benefits come to about $123 per month per person.It s good that the government has guaranteed SNAP benefits through February, said Stacy Dean, a nutrition policy expert with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But, she said,  if the shutdown continues we face the same dilemma in March.    Some experts have said there s no reason for USDA to suspend food benefits just because Congress hasn t appropriated funds, arguing that the government ought to treat SNAP as an  entitlement  like Social Security or Medicare. Those programs continue on autopilot even in a government shutdown.Perdue and his spokespeople have not responded to questions about paying SNAP benefits without an appropriation.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

National parks typically close during government shutdowns, but the Trump administration kept them open during this partial shutdown without funding, leaving them sorely understaffed and lacking resources for sanitation and maintenance.About eight rangers are currently on hand to oversee Joshua Tree s sprawling 790,636 acres, Land told The Los Angeles Times. Without comprehensive oversight, the park has fallen victim to irresponsible visitors over the winter holiday. While the vast majority of those who visit Joshua Tree National Park do so in a responsible manner, there have been incidents of new roads being created by motorists and the destruction of Joshua trees in recent days that have precipitated the closure,  Land said.Though Land said in his statement the park would reopen  to limited basic services in the coming days,  he told the Los Angeles Times that the site could remain closed for the duration of the shutdown.President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders have made little headway in recent days in reopening government functions affected by the shutdown. The president continues to demand more than $5 billion for some version of a wall or steel barrier along the southern border.In the meantime, national parks around the country have witnessed streams of visitors <U+2015> sometimes failing to pay entrance fees <U+2015> while overburdened staff have tried to mitigate the public health hazard of over trash and human waste.In some cases, emergency services may have been impacted as well. A visitor at Yosemite National Park <U+2015> where a staff of 800 was shrunken to as low as 50 <U+2015> reportedly fell to his death on Christmas Day. The incident went unreported for a week due to the ongoing government shutdown, according to a National Park Service spokesman."

The share who consider it very serious now stands at 42 percent, up from one-third last week.The shift also means that concerns now surpass the public s worries about last year s brief January shutdown, which was seen as at least somewhat serious by only 64 percent of Americans in HuffPost/YouGov s polling.Twenty-three percent of Americans now say they ve been affected in some way by the current shutdown or that they expect to be, up from 10 percent at the start of the shutdown. For some, that simply means living with the sense that their government isn t working. But other responses were more specific. Several said they d reconsidered visits to national parks or expressed looming concerns about tax season. (The White House has since announced that tax refunds will be paid regardless of the status of the shutdown.)For many federal workers and their families, the shutdown has already had a serious financial impact, forcing some to max out credit cards or borrow money from relatives. My husband works for the government and is currently furloughed,  wrote one woman polled who said she was concerned for her family s  immediate financial future  and that she disapproved of the role both congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump had played in the shutdown.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it. If you re willing to be interviewed, please provide a phone number.Americans are 34 points more likely to disapprove than they are to approve of the way Congress has handled the shutdown. The public also disapproves of the performance of the congressional GOP, specifically (-29), and, by smaller margins, of Trump s performance (-17) and congressional Democrats  actions (-9); they re about split on the performance of their own representatives (+2).The results appear to represent a modest reversion from the change seen in last week s survey, although, as before, it s unclear to what extent the movement reflects a genuine shift in opinion, rather than the kind of fluctuation inherent to tracking surveys.A 51 percent majority of Americans say Trump deserves at least partial responsibility for the shutdown, with 41 percent naming Democrats in Congress, and 35 percent putting at least some responsibility on Republicans in Congress. Those numbers are largely similar to where they stood last week.In contrast with shutdowns from previous years, there s so far been relatively little polling on this one, perhaps in part because its start coincided with Christmas and the new year.An Ipsos/Reuters tracking poll finds that currently about half of Americans mostly blame Trump for the shutdown, with 32 percent naming congressional Democrats and 6 percent congressional Republicans. Another survey from Morning Consult, taken at the beginning of the shutdown, bore similar results, with 43 percent of voters saying Trump was most to blame, 31 percent pointing the finger at Democrats in Congress, and 7 percent naming the congressional GOP.An Economist/YouGov poll taken over New Year s also gave President Trump the plurality of the blame, and found that 40 percent of the public believe Trump should accept the Democrats  current offer of $1.6 billion for border security, with just 24 percent saying Democrats should agree to spend $5 billion for a border wall. Another 19 percent said the two parties should meet somewhere in the middle.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 4-7 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Boot praises Ocasio-Cortez as  down-to-earth and quick-witted,  but criticizes her for caring  more about ideological correctness than factual correctness.  Then he ends with a comparison to Palin that  neither woman will appreciate.

And unlike those employed directly by the government who likely will get back pay for this period, contractors in past shutdowns have not.Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a freshman Democrat from Massachusetts, wants to change that. Pressley introduced legislation on Tuesday to ensure back pay for government contractors <U+2015> from food workers and janitors to security services <U+2015> who depend on federal funds for their wages. Since the shutdown, many have been furloughed or have received  stop work  orders, putting them out of work, and without pay, until the government is running again. Pressley urged congressional leaders in a weekend letter to ensure that  any final funding agreement includes retroactive compensation for the thousands of low-wage government contract service workers that have had their lives put on hold as a result of President Trump s obsession to fund a xenophobic hate wall.  About 2,000 low-wage contract workers are off the job amid the shutdown, Pressley said in her letter. Her bill would ensure back pay specifically for  low-wage workers,  including those in retail, food, custodial or security jobs.  The ongoing government shutdown <U+2015> a crisis created by the Trump Administration in pursuit of a  monument to hate  that will do nothing to make our country safer <U+2015> is threatening the livelihoods of more than 800,000 federal workers, none more so than contract service workers, many of whom work on an hourly basis, for low wages, and currently have no prospect of recouping wages lost as a result of the shutdown,  Pressley said in a statement.  We must ensure that contract services workers, many of whom are living paycheck to paycheck, are able to recover their lost wages,  she added. 800k workers are without pay as the shutdown drags on. 2,000 of those workers who make up the backbone of our government in food service & janitorial services won t qualify for backpay when the gov reopens. Today I wrote to leadership because we need to fix this: @SEIU @32BJSEIU pic.twitter.com/ytZ5vx7iShPressley s legislation was co-sponsored by Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) and about 10 other Democrats. While the legislation is likely to garner support in the Democratic-controlled House, its chances of passing the GOP-led Senate are less certain. President Donald Trump is not budging on his demand for $5 billion to fund his promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, while Democrats, who control the House, are opposed. Trump on Friday said the shutdown could go on for  months or even years,  and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday it was likely to  drag on a lot longer.  We do have a little bit in savings to help out, but we kind of live paycheck to paycheck,  47-year-old Misty Carrothers, a paralegal on a government contract with the Department of Justice, told HuffPost late last month. She has been out of work during the shutdown.  My last paycheck covers the first-of-the-month bills, which are the big ones: rent and car insurance,  she said.  But then you have credit cards that come in the middle of the month, and my health insurance may or may not be fully covered on my next paycheck.  It s just like, when is this going to end?

But a new analysis has delivered a blow to that defense, concluding that the nation s greenhouse gas emissions rose sharply in 2018.Emissions in the country jumped 3.4 percent last year, the second largest annual increase in more than two decades, according to a preliminary estimate by the economic research company Rhodium Group. The analysis comes on the heels of two gut-wrenching climate reports, one by the United Nations and another authored by scientists from more than a dozen federal agencies in the U.S., that warn the world is running out of time to stave off catastrophic, and potentially irreversible, climate change. The Trump administration continues to dismiss and downplay the crisis.  I don t believe it,  President Donald Trump, who has a long history of climate change denial, said of his own administration s report. He added that  we re the cleanest we ve ever been.  Between 2005 and 2017, CO2 emissions in the U.S. fell by about 14 percent. Administration officials have touted these declines to explain their push to boost fossil fuels, as well as to defend the president s decision last year to withdraw the U.S. from the historic Paris accord on combating climate change.At a Dec. 11 briefing on the Environmental Protection Agency s proposal to gut an Obama-era clean water rule, acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler credited Trump s leadership for a 2.7 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from 2016 and 2017.  We are moving forward, but we are not moving forward in a detrimental impact to our economy as what the Paris climate accord would have called for,  Wheeler said.  We are reducing our CO2 emissions faster than most other developed countries. We have our own plan. We re moving forward. We re addressing the issue.  Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who resigned Jan. 2 under a cloud of ethics scandals, told the National Petroleum Council last month that the administration s  regulatory philosophy  is to partner with the fossil fuel sector, which he said was at  the leading edge of technology.  The U.S. has  lead the charge  in cutting emissions of CO2 and methane, a potent greenhouse gas, he added. We re doing the right thing,  Zinke said.  But it s a narrative that s very difficult to get across.  Zinke repeated this defense in a parting interview last month with Fox News  Bret Baier.  Everyone else is up,  he said, referring to other countries  overall emissions.  We re going down while we have our record-breaking oil and gas production. But as Rhodium Group s new analysis makes clear, that was not the case in 2018. The emissions uptick <U+2015> the largest since the economic bounce back from the recession that ended in mid-2009 <U+2015> comes despite a record number of coal-fired power plants going offline, replaced largely by the use of natural gas.Along with an 1.9 percent spike in power sector emissions, increases occurred in the transportation, industry and buildings sectors, according to Rhodium. Contributing to the overall increase were the growing U.S. economy, a cold start to the year that required additional energy for heating, and the  limited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies,  the analysis found. The U.S. was already off track in meeting its Paris Agreement targets,  it stated.  The gap is even wider headed into 2019. Responding to Rhodium s analysis, May Boeve, executive director of climate advocacy group 350.org, stressed that the Trump administration energy and environmental policies come with consequences. With a new Congress in session, we demand they heed these warnings (about climate change) and step up to act at the scale of the crisis,  she said in a statement.The administration has aggressively rolled back environmental and climate regulations, including President Barack Obama s Clean Power Plan, a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. At Interior, Zinke overturned an Obama-era moratorium on new coal leases on federal land, scrapped a hydraulic fracturing rule meant to better protect public health and curtailed a rule limiting the amount of methane that can be released from oil and gas operations on federal and Native American lands. Even amid the current partial government shutdown, the administration has prioritized fossil fuels. The Interior Department, one of the main agencies affected by the shutdown. is still issuing permits for oil companies, according to Bloomberg. And the agency is continuing its push to open Alaska s fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, holding public meetings as part of its ongoing environmental review process, Alaska Public Media reported.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

President Donald Trump has said the shutdown could continue for months or a year. The people who get food benefits will go hungry if this happens. The late 20th century expansion of the food stamp program helped eradicate starvation in the U.S. But Professor David Super, an expert on administrative and welfare law at Georgetown University Law School, argues that the conventional wisdom misreads the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program s underlying statute. Super points to the text of the Food and Nutrition Act, which indicates more than once that anyone who is poor enough to qualify for benefits is supposed to get them.  Assistance under this program shall be furnished to all eligible households who make application for such participation,  the law says. While it may seem obvious that people should get benefits for which they re eligible, the wording is significant. It echoes the  entitlement  language in the Social Security Act that preserves health and retirement benefits for seniors even if the federal government is partially shuttered. Super is not alone in his analysis.  We have long agreed with some legal experts that SNAP s authorizing law requires SNAP benefits continue during a shutdown,  Dottie Rosenbaum, a senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in an email. The CBPP is an influential liberal think tank. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, did not respond to requests for comment. The agency has been mostly silent about what will happen to food assistance during a prolonged shutdown, except for a late December press release that only indicated it had funds for January s benefits. It s not clear what would happen in February if the government remains closed. If the USDA reversed itself and said benefits would continue despite a prolonged shutdown, it would be in good company. The Internal Revenue Service had said it would collect tax revenue but not issue refunds <U+2015> until Monday, when officials said the agency would dish out refunds after all.  If the shutdown continues and USDA determines it does not have the authority to extend SNAP in the absence of congressional action, many low-income households would be at risk of serious hunger and hardship,  Rosenbaum wrote in a blog post, adding that food banks would see dramatic increases in needy families.Ending SNAP would not only cause material hardship for the program s beneficiaries <U+2015> most of whom are very young, elderly or disabled <U+2015> it would also rattle the economy. Joe Brusuelas, an economist with the accounting firm RSM, estimated a full year without SNAP benefits would reduce gross domestic product by as much as 1 percent. (For comparison, most analyses of the new Republican tax law said it would boost GDP by less than 1 percent in its early years.) A spokesman for House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) declined to say whether the chairman agreed that food aid could continue to operate despite the shutdown.It s not just the entitlement language that should protect SNAP benefits. Though lawmakers have appropriated money for SNAP annually, Super argues they have also amended the statute over the years to make SNAP less contingent on appropriations.   The conventional wisdom, that SNAP must terminate benefits absent an appropriation, was correct under the statute as it once existed,  Super said in an email.  But, as often happens, the conventional wisdom failed to update as Congress repeatedly amended the statute. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

But Trump is  holding it up  and causing thousands of workers to go without pay for with his  vanity project,  the border wall, Harris said. It s an emergency of his own creation,  she told host George Stephanopoulos.There was a bipartisan effort out of the House and Senate to fund the government, and the president is holding it up because of his vanity wall project, all at the expense of taxpayers and hundreds of thousands of workers.

He told reporters on Sunday that he might declare a national emergency to secure money for his border wall.Harris said there is no question there will be litigation if he does. If he declares an emergency, I think we will see the checks and balances kick in, in particular through the courts,  she said, emphasizing the power held within the branches of government outside the president s office.On Monday night, Harris called for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to allow a vote on bills to reopen the government. The longest government shutdown was in 1995-1996 and lasted 21 days.We re on day 17. Enough. The House passed two bills to reopen the government. McConnell must bring them to the floor so we can get federal employees back to work.Some federal workers are struggling to pay the bills as they await their paychecks, as she noted.

All four major news networks plan to air the event live from the Oval Office, and millions of Americans are expected to watch.But Trump, who campaigned with a promise to build a  big, beautiful wall  along the U.S.-Mexico border (and to get Mexico to pay for it), has long turned to mistruths and outright lies in an effort to get the structure funded.Here are some of the biggest falsehoods the president is likely to tell on Tuesday.Trump has regularly claimed that Democrats are the  party of crime  and want  open borders  with Mexico, both blatantly false statements. Leading Democrats have argued for years now that a wall along the southern border would be wasteful and ineffective, instead supporting legislation that would increase border security efforts.In June, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) pointed out that in 2013, long before Trump was elected, every Senate Democrat supported a $40 billion funding effort to step up protection of the border, a proposal that would have provided funding to hire thousands of border agents and hundreds of miles of fencing.Dozens of lawmakers have also supported legislation to give young undocumented immigrants who have spent their lives in America, known as Dreamers, a pathway to citizenship. About 800,000 federal employees have been affected by the shutdown thus far. Many have been furloughed, but thousands, including airport security workers, have been forced to go to work without pay while the stalemate continues.Trump claimed last week that  maybe most of those people ... are the biggest fan of what we re doing  and that he really believed  a lot of them want to see border security.  But he s made such assertions without any evidence, and as HuffPost s Amanda Terkel notes, polls have found most Americans do not support the wall or funding for it.All four living former presidents have thrown cold water on Trump s claim that some of his predecessors  told me that we should have  built the wall.Former President Jimmy Carter said he didn t support Trump on the issue. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush told Politico they hadn t spoken with the White House. Former President Barack Obama has spoken against the wall publicly and hasn t interacted with Trump since leaving office in 2017, aside from a small encounter at former President George H.W. Bush s funeral last month. Trump s campaign assertion that the Mexican government would pay for his wall quickly fell away after he assumed office. But the president has continued to promise that America s southern neighbor would do so through the revised North American Free Trade Agreement that would pay for the structure  many, many times over. Outside economists and trade experts told HuffPost s S.V. Date, however, that any trade benefits won t be anywhere near the billions of dollars necessary to construct the barrier. What it really is is American consumers paying higher prices for stuff,  Monica de Bolle, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told HuffPost last week.  So it s the American consumer who s paying for the wall, if you want to look at it that way. Members of the Trump administration have been cherry-picking statistics in thinly veiled attempts to paint migrants attempting to seek asylum in the U.S. as terrorists or gang members. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Friday that 3,000  special interest aliens  had been apprehended trying to enter the country from the southern border, but that designation applies to anyone who simply comes from a country that has ever produced a terrorist, according to Fox News  Chris Wallace.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to peddle a similarly false statistic in an interview with Wallace on Sunday, saying 4,000 suspected or known terrorists had come into the country illegally while implying that they had passed through the southern border. But Wallace said that was a mistruth, and in fact those people had been taken into custody at airports.Studies show that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens, and states with more undocumented people have less crime than states with fewer.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Federal workers and their families are doing whatever they can to save a few dollars and eke by as the partial government shutdown continues with no imminent end in sight.

I m disabled,  said Smith, whose husband is a furloughed federal worker.  I can t get my medications right now, because, what are we going to do? Make sure you have your groceries or make sure you have your medication. It s going to put me in a flare, and we know, but what can we do? She and her husband had some savings, but they exhausted a chunk of that money recently when they had to pay veterinary bills after an unexpected emergency with their dog. Do you know how embarrassing it is to go to your kid and say,  Hey, I have to borrow the house payment?   Smith said.  We had to go to our son. He s being supportive as much as he can, but he has an infant in his house. We shouldn t be borrowing money from our kids.  The government shutdown that began Dec. 22 has left 380,000 federal workers furloughed and another 420,000 working without pay. (Roughly three-quarters of government functions have already been funded by Congress and are not affected by the impasse.) President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders have made little headway in recent days as Trump continues to demand more than $5 billion for a wall <U+2015> or perhaps a steel barrier of some kind <U+2015> along the southern border. Meanwhile, federal employees and contractors are reckoning with the possibility that the shutdown will drag on for months, leaving them no steady income to pay mounting bills. Federal workers have received back pay after previous shutdowns, but only retroactively through an act of Congress after the government has reopened.The shutdown is already the second-longest on record. Trump has said that it could last for  years  if Democrats don t agree to his demands <U+2015> a warning that s rattled feds with dwindling bank accounts.Nathaniel Shenton, a federal worker based in Maryland, said he received his last paycheck just before the New Year. He said he had enough savings put away to support his wife and two children for roughly one pay period without a check. But if the shutdown stretches into the latter half of January, he isn t sure how he ll cover his mortgage, car payments and the groceries. The real thing is if we miss two paychecks. If we miss two, I m pretty screwed, to be honest,  said Shenton, who is classified as  essential  and has continued to work during the shutdown.  We just don t know when it s going to end. There s no indication, no sign that there s any kind of headway being made. Shenton said he plans on talking to his mortgage lender about deferring a payment, and hopes to get an interest-free loan through his bank, Navy Federal Credit Union. For now, he and his wife have stopped driving anywhere unless necessary to save gas money, and have resolved to cut out the pricier organic foods for their 5-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son.   We re not millionaires,  he said of the typical federal worker.  It s incredibly stressful and it can be really damaging for us. Arash, a federal employee who is still working during the shutdown, has cut out entertainment costs in his life, like going to dinner with friends, Netflix and Hulu. He was lucky enough to get extensions on his two credit cards, but now he s looking at taking out another credit card that offers zero percent interest for the first year, just so he can have an extra line of money.  I think I make a decent salary, but that doesn t mean I don t live paycheck to paycheck,  said Arash, who asked to be identified by only his first name.  My extended family relies on me financially as well. ... There s a lot of financial anxiety that goes into it because there s just no clear end goal. There doesn t seem to be any progress. Daniel Moragne, a federal contractor in Louisiana who isn t even sure if he ll get back pay, is, at the age of 67, wondering if he ll lose his apartment if the federal government doesn t get its act together.While the Office of Personnel Management put out sample letters for federal workers to use to ask for leniency with their rent or other payments to creditors, for people like Moragne, it s not that simple. He pays his rent online, and he doesn t even have a way to personally contact his landlord. Therefore, he can t ask for leniency or explain that it s not his fault that the government can t get its act together.  If I can t pay my rent, they will probably move to evict me, and I d be without a place to stay. ... I might be able to stay with my brother who lives here in town. He s fairly close. But that s not a given,  he said.  I don t know. ... I just wish they d do their job. HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

The nation s airspace system is a complex transportation network that involves government and industry partnerships to function properly, and the disruptions being caused by the shutdown are threatening the safe operations of this network,  stated the letter sent last Wednesday by Joe DePete, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, on behalf of union members.The letter has surfaced just as passengers are reporting growing lines at airports and as Transportation Security Administration officers are reportedly calling in sick to work at paying jobs. Forbes reported Monday that some checkpoint waits at New York s La Guardia Airport and Sea-Tac Airport in Washington state were as long as 90 minutes. The shutdown is also affecting staffing levels in air traffic control towers, according to Forbes.DePete urged Trump in his letter to  take the necessary steps to immediately end the shutdown of government agencies that is adversely affecting the safety, security and efficiency of our national airspace system. The union president noted the importance of the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Department in safe flying.  When any of their responsibilities are placed on pause due to a shutdown there are safety, security and efficiency gaps that immediately emerge,  DePete wrote.The partial shutdown affects some 800,000 federal workers, but about half of those are considered essential workers   including agents of TSA, which is part of DHS. They are expected to perform their jobs without pay during the shutdown. That has driven some TSA workers to use sick time to work elsewhere to pay the bills, according to the union.TSA officials have conceded that the number of TSA workers on the job was down, but said Friday that the reduction hadn t yet affected passenger checkpoint wait times. That appears to be changing as air travel begins to pick up again after the traditional slow time after the winter holidays.This TSA line at SeaTac is out of this world. I ve NEVER been in a line this long before.DePete also noted in his letter that fewer Federal Aviation Administration safety inspectors are working    fewer than are needed in order to ensure the air traffic control infrastructure is performing at its peak levels. The shutdown also impacts aircraft manufacturing oversight activities that have either stopped or are  significantly reduced,  DePete wrote.  These safety and oversight inspections will potentially allow for the introduction of safety issues that put passengers and airline crews at risk. The shutdown began after Trump refused to sign any legislation that doesn t include $5.7 billion for his wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The shutdown is now in its third week.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the pilots union letter.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Some cable networks, including CNN and MSNBC, which cater to smaller audiences, said they plan to air the speech as well. I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border. Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. Eastern.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, also said Trump would travel to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday.Shortly after the network confirmations, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a joint statement calling for Democrats to be given  equal airtime  to address the country. Now that the television networks have decided to air the President s address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime,  the pair said.The major networks <U+2015> ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC <U+2015> all committed on Tuesday to airing the Democrats  response, to be delivered by Pelosi and Schumer.The networks  decision is likely to be a costly one, as advertising spots in prime-time hours can cost millions of dollars in total. The New York Times notes that such addresses have grown increasingly rare and are usually reserved for moments of significant national importance, like President Barack Obama s announcement of the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011. Some requests have been denied, with addresses aired on a tape delay, including a 2014 Obama speech on immigration. Some questioned why major networks wouldn t use tape delay for Trump s address in order to counter his persistent falsehoods about the border. CBS, the first network to announce it would air the speech, didn t immediately respond to an inquiry about its plans.The address comes in the midst of an ongoing partial government shutdown, during which Trump and Senate Republicans have refused to pass funding measures that don t include more than $5.6 billion for the wall. The shutdown has stretched into its third week, with no end in sight.The president has continued to tout his border wall, even as his definition of it has changed. Last weekend, he said he would be happy to build a steel barrier on the border rather than one made out of concrete, saying such a structure would  look beautiful and it s actually strong.  The White House has also released  Game of Thrones ñstyle posters featuring a mock-up of the wall with Trump s image hovering above it.Trump has also lied about support for the structure, falsely claiming that some of his predecessors had told him they supported a border fence.

He has said that he will not allow a vote on the spending bills because they would not receive a signature from President Donald Trump, who is demanding that Democrats agree to fund construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who represents a state with a large number of federal employees, urged Senate Democrats to adopt the strategy in a tweet over the weekend. Since then, it has been endorsed by several progressive groups and nearly a dozen of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate.Senate Democrats should block consideration of any bills unrelated to opening the government until Sen. Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans allow a vote on the bipartisan bills the House passed to open the government. Mitch, don t delay. Let s vote!He will need nearly all Democrats on board, however, in order to prevent Republicans from clearing the chamber s 60-vote threshold to bring a measure to the floor.The first test will come Tuesday afternoon, when the Senate is scheduled to vote on a motion to proceed to open debate on a Republican Middle East policy package that includes Syria sanctions and a measure that aims to block boycotts of Israel. The latter has been endorsed by some Democrats, but critics say it violates the First Amendment right to free speech.A senior Senate Democratic aide said Monday that Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) would join the opposition to taking up the foreign policy legislation, known as S.1, before the Senate votes on the House-passed spending bills. Senate Republicans should instead bring to the floor the House-passed bills to reopen the government,  the aide said Monday.Schumer is a prominent ally of Israel in the Senate, and he has backed similar measures that would have made it a felony for Americans to support the international boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), an author of the anti-boycott bill, argued that the shutdown is not really the reason Democrats are coming out against the foreign policy package.  A huge argument broke out at Senate Dem meeting last week over BDS. A significant # of Senate Democrats now support #BDS & Dem leaders want to avoid a floor vote that reveals that,  Rubio tweeted Monday. But Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who serves with Rubio on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, disputed that characterization in a tweet of his own. You know it isn t true that  a significant # of Senate Dems support BDS . Really dangerous to play politics w support for Israel,  Murphy tweeted.It s unclear whether Democrats can remain united in blocking all legislation from coming to the floor. A public lands bill that was held over from the last Congress is expected to get a vote next week, for example <U+2015> and it has support from a number of Western Democratic senators.For now, though, the tactic seems to be Democrats  best hand before Trump s national address and trip to the border later this week. Senate Republicans should not treat this legislative work period like it s a time to catch up on miscellaneous items. People are suffering, let s vote to fix it,  Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) tweeted on Monday.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) railed against Democrats for not caving to President Donald Trump s demands for border wall funding, asserting that the GOP wouldn t back down.During an appearance Sunday on CBS News   Face the Nation,  the senator told host Margaret Brennan that his weekend conversation with the president had made clear that the wall was non-negotiable.Graham proceeded to vent his frustration with Democrats as talks to reopen the government continue to stall. We re having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ICE, not support ICE,  he said.  We re having to negotiate with people who see the Border Patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers, and we re negotiating with people who will give us one dollar for the wall, even though it s immoral, and accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racist. The senator added that cooperation was unlikely under Congress  current leadership and vowed not to give in. As long as the radical left is in charge, we re never going to get anywhere,  Graham said.  The president will compromise but he will not capitulate. So that s where we re at. Graham insisted that an agreement on a spending bill to get the government up and running again was nearly impossible, but Brennan reminded him of the thousands of federal workers who are either furloughed or punching the clock without pay. With that in mind, with them in mind, why can t you reopen the government while you argue about the things you just laid out?  she wondered.Graham argued it couldn t yet be done. Why would you negotiate with somebody who calls you a racist if you want a wall?  he shot back.  Who gives you a dollar for a wall when the Democratic Party supported 25 billion dollars in the past? We re not going to negotiate with people who see the world this way.  Although Democrats have rejected Trump s call for some $5 billion to shore up the barrier between the U.S. and Mexico, the president continues to ask, threatening to keep the government shut down for years if needed.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) had a blunt assessment after President Donald Trump doubled down on his threat to declare a national emergency in order to build his border wall: Trump  doesn t have the power. Before leaving for Camp David on Sunday, the president told reporters that he was considering using emergency powers to build a wall on the southern border, the funding for which Congress has refused to provide. The government has been partially shut down over this impasse.Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House intelligence committee, told CNN s Jake Tapper that not only is that rhetoric  really threatening,  but suggested that the president can t even do that. If Harry Truman couldn t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this president doesn t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion-dollar wall on the border,  Schiff said on Tapper s  State of the Union  Sunday.  So that s a nonstarter.  Truman had cited a national emergency during the Korean War to take control of the steel industry in 1952, but the U.S. Supreme Court struck down his executive order.Trump s government shutdown has hinged on his demand for more than $5 billion in wall funding, but neither the president nor the newly empowered Democrats in the House of Representatives seem to be budging.Trump first floated the national emergency idea during a press conference Friday, but whether he can actually do so is a gray area, legal experts told NBC News.  He can declare some kind of national emergency, but what it would allow him to do legally is a totally different question,  George Washington University professor and presidential power expert Matt Dallek told the outlet.Harvard Law School professor Mark Tushnet told NBC that Trump may actually be able to get his wall by turning to certain unused Defense Department funds that Congress doles out yearly with no specific intention. My instinct is to say that if he declares a national emergency and uses this pot of unappropriated money for the wall, he s on very solid legal ground,  Tushnet said. GOP and Democratic leaders have met multiple times to negotiate an end to the government shutdown, which went into effect Dec. 21, but acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says little progress has been made.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

[Democrats] don t like concrete, so we ll give them steel. Steel is fine. Steel is actually more expensive than concrete, but it will look beautiful and it s actually strong. It s actually stronger,  Trump said at Camp David.A two-page letter that the Office of Management and Budget sent congressional leaders on Sunday still asked for $5.7 billion for the wall, but this time described it as a 234-mile  steel barrier  along the southern U.S. border, reported The Washington Post, which obtained a copy of the letter. The letter also requested  an additional $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs  and aid unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the border, according to the Post.The president s statement came as the partial government shutdown dragged into its third week over his demand for more than $5 billion to build a border wall he repeatedly promised Mexico would pay for. Democrats have opposed funding a wall they have called  immoral  and impractical <U+2015> but the wall s material has not been their sticking point.A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D) did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the president s statement.President Trump says he wants a steel border wall, and a reporter asks why Democrats would support that. Trump:  They don t like concrete, so we ll give them steel. Steel is fine. Steel is actually more expensive than concrete, but it will look beautiful  pic.twitter.com/46F5OBtuYTAsked earlier Sunday whether he found a wall made out of steel more acceptable, Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) flatly said  no. The incoming chair of the House Armed Services Committee argued in an interview on ABC s  This Week  that building additional barriers along the border would not actually enhance border security.   There is no evidence whatsoever that that s necessary, and yet he is willing to shut down the government and stop paying Border Patrol agents, and, in many cases, you know, stop all the efforts that we have made to enhance border security over a campaign promise,  Smith said.The shutdown has affected a range of government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department. An estimated 800,000 federal employees throughout the country have either been furloughed and are going without a salary or, if deemed essential, are working without getting paid.Vice President Mike Pence held meetings with Democratic congressional aides over the weekend at the White House, but the two sides appear dug-in with no deal in sight. Administration officials have said they won t accept anything less than the $5.7 billion in wall funding they originally requested. Trump further said Sunday he was considering whether to bypass Congress and build the wall by declaring a national emergency <U+2015> which would constitute an unprecedented use of executive powers. Some advisers close to the president are reportedly pushing him to do so if negotiations on the Hill drag on, a move that would put the Defense Department in charge of building the wall. We re looking at a national emergency because we have a national emergency,  Trump told reporters on Sunday, per a pool report.Still, such an action would likely face an immediate legal challenge from congressional Democrats. I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, Where is the emergency? You have to establish that in order to do this,  Smith said on  This Week.  But beyond that, this would be a terrible use of Department of Defense dollars. The president spends most of his time talking about how we re not spending enough on national security. Now he wants to take $20 billion out of the defense budget to build a wall, which by the way is not going to improve our border security,  he added.This story has been updated with information about the letter from the Office of Management and Budget.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But Fox News  Chris Wallace wasn t having it.Sanders had a heated exchange with the host of  Fox News Sunday  as she discussed President Donald Trump s threat to continue the partial government shutdown if his demand for $5 billion to fund a U.S.-Mexico border wall isn t met by Democrats. Let s talk about the wall,  Wallace said.  The president talks about terrorists potentially coming across the border. He then showed a clip of Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen stating Friday that  over 3,000 special interest aliens  trying to enter the U.S. from the southern border had been stopped by Border Patrol agents. But special interest aliens are just people who have come from countries that have ever produced a terrorist, they re not terrorists themselves,  Wallace said. He also cited State Department reports that found  no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from Mexico. Sanders responded,  We know that roughly nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border. Wallace, ready to pounce, interrupted Sanders with a blistering fact-check. Wait wait,  cause I know the statistic,  he said.  I didn t know if you were going to use it, but I studied up on this. Do you know where those 4,000 people come or where they re captured? Airports. The exchange begins below around the 5:35 mark: Not always but certainly a large number,  Sanders said as Wallace continued to hammer his point. The state department says there hasn t been any terrorists found coming across the southern border from Mexico,  he added.Sanders, seemingly ignoring the facts laid out before her, said terrorists enter the U.S.  by air, it s by land, it s by sea  and that the southern border is the country s  most vulnerable point of entry.  But they re not coming across the southern border, Sarah,  Wallace persisted.  They re coming and they re being stopped at airports. Sanders continued to dance around the facts, saying that terrorists are  coming a number of ways.  I m not disagreeing with you that they re coming through airports,  she told Wallace.  I m saying that they come by air by land and by sea, and the more and more that our border becomes vulnerable and the less and less that we spend time and money protecting it, the more that we re going to have an influx, not just of terrorists, but of human traffickers, drug inflow and people who are coming here to do American citizens harm. Trump last month claimed the government had stopped terrorists from entering the U.S. from Mexico, but Reuters reported that no evidence backed up the president s assertion, according to four government sources. People are pouring into our country, including terrorists,  Trump had said.  We have terrorists. We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time. Ten. These are very serious people. Studies show undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens. In fact, states with more undocumented immigrants have lower crime rates than states with fewer of them.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

Mr. President, can you relate to the pain of federal workers who can t pay their bills?  a reporter asked Trump outside the White House on Sunday. I can relate,  the president responded.  And I m sure that the people that are toward the receiving end will make adjustments, they always do. And they ll make adjustments. People understand exactly what s going on.  Many of those people that won t be receiving a paycheck, many of those people agree 100 percent with what I m doing,  he added, without evidence.My question to the president,  Can you relate to the pain of federal workers who can t pay their bills?  Pres. Trump: I can relate... . Watch: pic.twitter.com/WJCBHZQ15xThough these workers will likely receive back pay after the government reopens, some are struggling to pay rent or buy groceries. What s more, government contractors may never see retroactive pay. Most of us live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford to be unpaid and still go to work for long. It is not fair,  a Transportation Security Administration official told HuffPost.Pay scheduled to go out next Friday will be delayed if an agreement is not reached by midnight on Tuesday, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday.The president has threatened to continue the standoff for  months or even years  if Democrats don t agree to include $5 billion for his long-promised U.S.-Mexico border wall in a spending bill to fund government agencies impacted by the shutdown. Democrats have steadfastly rejected Trump s demand to fund the border wall, which he has vowed Mexico would pay to build since the 2016 campaign.Trump s claim that he can  relate  to financially strapped federal workers may be hard to swallow by some. Though he has claimed he didn t inherit his wealth, a New York Times investigation in October revealed he benefited greatly from his father s real estate fortune. By age 3, he was earning $200,000 a year in today s dollars from his father s empire. He was a millionaire by age 8. In his 40s and 50s, he was receiving more than $5 million a year,  the Times wrote. The president s net worth is an estimated $3.1 billion, Forbes reported in October.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

It was a really strange meeting,  Mulvaney said on NBC s  Meet The Press.   The discussion immediately turned to a bunch of technical ... requests that the Democrats were asking for the first time ever in these negotiations. So I think this is going to drag on a lot longer. President Donald Trump has said he will veto any spending bill to fund the government agencies affected by the shutdown if the legislation does not include $5 billion toward his long-promised wall along the U.S. southern border. Democrats, who now control the House of Representatives, steadfastly oppose the wall.Trump, who as a presidential candidate had insisted Mexico would pay for the wall, said Friday that he would continue the shutdown, already one of the longest in U.S. history, for  months or even years  if his funding demand for the structure isn t met. Despite his campaign promise to build a concrete wall, Trump has recently said he would be open to constructing a  fence  or  artistically designed steel slats  instead. Call it a wall, call it a fence,  Mulvaney said Sunday.  [Trump] says as long as it s effective, he doesn t care what you call it.

The fight to have the measure included in a spending bill has lawmakers so divided that their work came to a screeching halt last month. However, Hannity doesn t think it s time for Washington to get back to work just yet. My humble advice is the shutdown, as much as an inconvenience some people that work for the government and I hope they get their back pay, it needs to continue straight through the State of the Union and maybe beyond,  he said. The State of the Union, the president, he can take his case directly to you, we the people. And while the president should support back pay for those furloughed employees, make no mistake <U+2015> no matter what the president does, he must hold firm on this border wall funding from Congress. The remark is significant given that Hannity s comments have influenced Trump in the past, as he is seen as an informal adviser to the president.Last August, USA Today reported that Trump weighed shutting down the government over border security before the midterm elections, citing Hannity s advice along with that of right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh. You know who thinks it should be before? Rush Limbaugh thinks it should be before the election. You know who else? Sean Hannity. A lot of them,  he said at a Pennsylvania rally that month.Wielding his influence, Hannity warned Friday that any sign of the GOP backing down on its fight for the money would be devastating. If they capitulate, the Republicans, the political damage frankly is incalculable,  he said.The shutdown has now officially become the third longest in the nation s history, but there appears to be no end in sight.On Saturday afternoon, Trump tweeted there was  not much headway made  in talks to reopen the government. Another meeting is set for Sunday."

Security operations at airports have not been impacted by a non-existent sick out,  department spokesperson Tyler Houlton tweeted regarding the story.  CNN has the cell numbers of multiple @TSA public affairs professionals, but rather than validate statistics, they grossly misrepresented them.

Some have to stay home because they can t afford childcare.TSA spokesman Michael Bilello said traveler  wait times remain well within TSA standards,  but admitted that could change if TSA agent absences increase.And that will happen if the shutdown continues, a union official from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport told CNN.

More than 38 million Americans receive monthly food benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is often known as food stamps and is arguably the federal government s most important anti-poverty program. If Trump keeps the government shut down through February, benefits could stop. The U.S. Department of Agriculture runs the program and is one of the federal agencies that shut down last month as part of Trump s strategy to force Congress to pay for a giant wall on the Mexican border. It s just one of dozens of programs <U+2015> including tax credit refunds for the working poor <U+2015> that will be disrupted if the shutdown continues. The USDA has said only that it has enough leftover money to pay for January s benefits. Its reserve fund amounts to less than the total projected cost of February s benefits. After February, it s possible there would be nothing. Other food programs that serve seniors, mothers and children could also be affected. Spokespeople for the USDA did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday.President Trump said Friday that the shutdown, which is already two weeks old, could go on for months or even a year. Since he has already taken credit for the shutdown, and since his border security demand is so vague <U+2015> does he want a wall, or a fence? <U+2015> it s hard to see how the situation could change unless Trump caves.A shutdown lasting many months or a year would be a massive policy experiment. Yanking food benefits from millions of people would probably result in a lot more hunger. Outright starvation hasn t been a public health problem in the U.S. since the food stamp program expanded in the 1960s and 1970s <U+2015> what happens if food stamps suddenly disappear? There is a far more robust network of food banks than in the 1960s, but there s no way charity could make up the difference between a huge national program and no program at all.The Trump administration has kept relatively quiet about the threat to food assistance. When a funding lapse approached in 2015, the Obama administration s USDA warned lawmakers that there wasn t enough money for the following month s benefits. The present situation is slightly different than 2015 since the agency seems to have a larger funding reserve this time around. But a USDA employee who is not authorized to speak publicly told HuffPost some within the agency suspected current leadership didn t want to talk about the possible negative effect on SNAP because doing so would highlight the shutdown s harm to struggling Americans instead of furloughed government employees. Trump has vilified federal workers and claimed they re all Democrats.One option to prevent the benefit cutoff would be for the USDA to adopt a new legal interpretation and say that SNAP recipients are entitled to benefits even if Congress hasn t appropriated annual funds for the program, since SNAP has been authorized for the next five years by the farm bill.There s no doubt that even a partial reduction in benefits in February would have a big effect on individual beneficiaries and the economy. When Democrats cut SNAP benefit amounts by about 13 percent in 2013, to pay for improvements to the National School Lunch Program, the impact reverberated through both low-income households and corporate boardrooms.The way SNAP works is the government distributes food benefits on debit cards that program enrollees then redeem for food items at grocery stores <U+2015> meaning retailers benefit substantially from the program, which costs more than $60 billion annually. When the benefit cut occurred in 2013, chains like Walmart and Target cut their earnings forecasts. Dollar General stockholders have claimed in a lawsuit the firm had failed to notify them how badly business would be harmed by other SNAP reductions. Local media has been covering the shutdown s possible threat to food assistance since last week. More than a million low-income Georgians could lose their benefits in February, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported Thursday. An official with Alabama s food aid program told a local TV station they expected more guidance from the USDA at the end of the month. Arizona food banks are worried about a surge in demand if the government shutdown continues into February. The possibility of lost food assistance caught the White House by surprise, the Washington Post reported Friday. Administration spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Republicans overwhelmingly voted to keep the government open,  Biden told CNN on Friday.  Then Rush Limbaugh and the conservative blonde woman says he s losing his base, and so he s changed his mind. Rush Limbaugh is a conservative radio host, and the  conservative blonde woman  was likely a reference to Ann Coulter, who called Trump  gutless  for not building a border wall just two days before he ordered a partial shutdown.The shutdown, which began Dec. 22, has now gone on for more than two weeks because lawmakers have not given in to the president s demand to give him $5 billion in taxpayer money to construct a useless wall across the U.S.-Mexico border. On Thursday, Trump doubled down on the shutdown, saying it could last for months or even years if he doesn t get what he wants.Biden s comments echo that of Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who also pointed to Limbaugh and Coulter as key motivators in getting Trump to call for the shutdown. We re dealing with someone who is dishonest,  Ryan said of president on MSNBC Wednesday.  You could make a deal in a room with a handshake and by the time he s out of the room the deal s over, he s in front of the camera. And let s just put this all in perspective. The main problem here is he s worried about the investigation that s breathing down his neck right now. So his only goal is to appeal to Ann Coulter, Laura Ingraham and Rush Limbaugh.

According to Washington Post reporter Josh Dawsey, Trump dropped that particular term during his meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Friday, drawing  puzzlement  from his audience. Trump acknowledged afterward in his press conference at the White House that he does not like the term  government shutdown,  as no one blamed for one would.  I don t call it a shutdown,  Trump said, before offering a less-than-concise alternative:  I call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and the safety of our country. Anyone with the slightest understanding of the impasse in Washington knows that what s going on is not a strike. A strike is a work stoppage initiated by workers. But in this case, some 380,000 federal employees are furloughed and another 420,000 are working without pay because Congress and the White House have not funded their agencies. In labor parlance, what s happening is more like the polar opposite of a strike: a lockout. That s a work stoppage initiated by management, in which workers are denied access to their jobs. Like a strike, a lockout usually happens during a labor dispute, in an effort to gain leverage. There was no workplace dispute that led to the shutdown. Rather, lawmakers and the White House simply failed to carry out their responsibilities and appropriate funding for roughly a quarter of government functions. But to government employees, the effect is the same: Workers who are willing to clock in are denied paychecks and many are barred from even venturing onto the job site, as a result of decisions made by management. Sure, it s a lockout,  Jacque Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 700,000 government workers, told HuffPost.  That s what it is. The shutdown began on Dec. 22, when funding lapsed for several federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Interior Department. Workers whose duties are considered  essential,  such as law enforcement, have continued to work. Any pay those workers get would have to come retroactively, through an act of Congress, after the government reopens. The same goes for the hundreds of thousands of workers who are furloughed and not working. Those workers are not even supposed to check their emails during the shutdown.Trump has threatened that the shutdown may go on for months or even years. If it stretches into Monday <U+2015> and there is no sign of an imminent breakthrough <U+2015> it will become the second-longest government shutdown ever. And if the shutdown lasts into mid-January, it will set a new record, regardless of what Trump wants to call it.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

In your year-long tenure, you have testified before the Committee only once,  he added.  Another appearance is overdue. Nielsen has been given until Jan. 18 to gather and submit the requested materials.After Nielsen s Friday presentation to Congress, McClatchy reported that lawmakers were taken aback by her remarks.According to an individual familiar with the meeting who spoke to the outlet, Nielsen told Trump, presidential adviser Jared Kushner and senior congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle that 17,000 criminals and more than 3,000 terrorists were apprehended in 2018 along the southern border.While she was reportedly attempting to convince Democrats to back a full border wall, they took issue with her statements three minutes after she began speaking, the source told McClatchy.The government shutdown has passed the two-week mark as Trump continues to refuse to sign any funding package that doesn t include more than $5 billion for his border wall.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

And while Trump is characterizing the barrier as a non-negotiable tenet of border security, immigrant experts told HuffPost it s an ineffective solution that will endanger migrant families.Advocates say the wall could force people to take dangerous journeys to cross the border or threaten parents and children s health by making them languish in unsanitary shelters near ports of entry. Experts are especially concerned about the well-being of migrant kids after a boy and a girl recently died in Border Patrol custody. Fortifying the border is just going to lead to more deaths,  said Elissa Steglich, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin who teaches a clinic for immigrant families.  [It s] giving business to sophisticated smugglers who are going to be taking migrants through more perilous and life-threatening circumstances. The number of migrant families being apprehended at the border reached record-high levels of more than 25,000 last month <U+2015> a number that s risen by more than 13 percent since 2013.Experts say Trump s wall, which the Department Of Homeland Security estimated would amount to more than 330 miles of fencing, won t deter families from trying to cross the border even as it makes their journeys more dangerous. You can t deter away a refugee flow,  said Jennifer Podkul, the director of policy for Kids in Need of Defense.  If someone thinks they are not going to live if they stay in their country of origin, they will go and try to find safety somewhere else. In the  90s, the government built fences in border cities such as San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas, which forced immigrants to make more perilous journeys through the mountains and desert. The number of migrants who died trying to reach the U.S. has skyrocketed and the bodies of nearly 3,000 migrants have been found in southern Arizona since 2000, according to the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner.The number of families apprehended by Border Patrol while traveling through the El Paso sector, which includes a part of the Chihuahuan Desert, has risen by more than 1,500 percent over the past year because of policies that dissuade immigrants from using legal ports of entry and an increased military presence at the border. Advocates worry a border wall will only exacerbate the problem and lead to more health issues for children traveling through remote regions that lack access to medical services.In December, 7-year-old Jackelin Caal Maquin traveled from Guatemala through the New Mexico desert with her father before dying from dehydration and shock in Border Patrol custody. After turning themselves in to Border Patrol agents, Caal and her father traveled three hours by bus to the nearest Border Patrol station in Lordsburg, New Mexico. Jackelin was later transported by helicopter to a children s hospital after having seizures. The U.S. government has made a strategic decision to force people to only cross in areas where death is more likely,  said David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity.  [A wall] will create more deaths in the desert and more people suffering on their way here. Immigration experts say a border wall will also drive migrant families to use smugglers to navigate precarious border crossing routes. Some smugglers are involved in human trafficking or the drug trade, putting children in extremely dangerous situations. Steglich s child clients have told her stories of being forced into prostitution, made to carry drugs across the border or being locked in hotel rooms for weeks. Anytime you make it more difficult to cross, you empower cartel and smugglers and organized criminals who control the crossing points and the border,  said Bier.  Experts also worry that a wall will cause further backlogs at legal ports of entry, where some migrants have been waiting for months to cross the border due to the Trump administration s crackdown on asylum-seekers. As a result, thousands of immigrants who arrived in Tijuana, Mexico, with a migrant caravan last month are languishing in sometimes unsanitary shelters for their turn to legally cross the border. Others have tried to enter the U.S. between ports of entry, which can be especially dangerous for children. Last month, two Guatemalan teens injured themselves after climbing the border wall separating Arizona from Mexico and falling 18 feet. Other migrants, including children, have been tear-gassed or hit with rubber bullets while trying to cross the border illegally. Immigration experts say the money Trump is requesting to build a wall would be better spent on more Border Patrol agents to process migrants, a more efficient immigration court system and technology to detect drugs and weapons at the border. Steglich says that in addition to forcing people into physically dangerous situations, the wall enforces a dangerous mentality that migrants should be treated like criminals instead of humans. If you are looking at a migrant as a national security threat, you re going to be more callous,  she said.  You re not going to be as attentive to the humanitarian needs of a mother or child before you. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

There was everything in there except for a moat with alligators lapping at immigrants  rear ends,  Lemon said.  Oh my gosh. C mon y all. Can we be real? Trump wrote about the concrete idea on Twitter as recently as the end of December.An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!Aside from the matter of building materials, Lemon also ripped Trump s demands that Congress approve money to pay for the wall, an issue which sent the government into a partial shutdown more than two weeks ago as it left lawmakers divided in the House and the Senate.Earlier in the day, the president claimed he could declare a national emergency to get his wall, a point disputed by Lemon and others.<U+2033>The fact is, there is no national emergency at our southern border,  Lemon said.  This is simply another attempt by this president to get his way by doing an end run around Congress to get his precious wall, the wall he is willing to shut down the federal government for, the wall he has been talking about for years. In a fact check of Trump s claim, NBC News spoke with experts in presidential power and legal matters who argued that while an emergency could be called, the amount of money he would be able to access at that point remains unclear and congressional approval for the the spending would likely still be required."

Numbers will  get worse as this drags on,  said union official Mac Johnson.Sick time  call-outs have increased,  TSA spokesman Jim Gregory told The Washington Post. But so far they re having  minimal impact,  he said.  To date the [screening] wait times remain within TSA standards,  which is a maximum of 30 minutes in a regular checkpoint queue.That could change quickly if more workers call in sick. Post-holiday traffic at airports now is low, which could be mitigating a shortage of workers.One TSA official told CNN that the absences were part of a  blue flu  action by upset employees. But union representatives said workers have to seek other jobs so they can pay rent, mortgages and child care costs.  While Congress and Mr. Trump get to stay home, enjoy their personal time with their families, and still get paid, we have to struggle and suffer,  a TSA officer who s a single mom told HuffPost in an email early this week. Most of us live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford to be unpaid and still go to work for long. It is not fair,  she added.The shutdown not only impacts hundreds of thousands of workers, but the TSA situation could eventually snarl airport screenings and impact passenger safety as remaining agents are forced to take on more work.Many TSA officers are continuing to show up for work   but must also do other jobs to pay bills. That also takes a toll.I ve been with the TSA for over six years now and I love my job! I ve met wonderful people and had amazing experiences....all I ask is that I get paid for it.

Previously, the IRS was prohibited from issuing refunds during a shutdown while the majority of employees were on furlough. However, Trump administration lawyers decided it was legally permissible to proceed with processing tax returns. The IRS employees who return to work in order to process these returns will not be paid during the shutdown. Final details are still up in the air, including how many workers will be recalled and when the official tax filing season will begin.PREVIOUSLY: Today we reach the two-week mark of the partial government shutdown, the result of a standoff between Congress and President Donald Trump over funding of a border wall that he originally said Mexico would pay for.In addition to the 420,000 government employees who continue to work without pay, the shutdown has left an estimated 380,000 government workers on furlough, including nearly all Internal Revenue Service employees.So what does that mean for your taxes? As you might have guessed, it s not great news.According to the government s shutdown plan, only 12.5 percent of IRS employees are authorized to work during the current  non-filing season.  The plan also states that processing certain tax refunds and issuing tax refunds are  non-excepted  activities during this time, meaning that the employees responsible for performing those duties will be furloughed during the shutdown. Jay Williams, a West Virginia-based financial adviser who focuses on tax-advantaged investing, noted there are a few exceptions. Specifically, the government will continue processing of returns that are deemed  necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property. Currently, there s no official plan for how tax returns would be handled in the event that the shutdown extends into tax filing season, which begins Jan. 15 <U+2015> an unprecedented situation, according to Fox Business.So what does this mean for the majority of taxpayers expecting a refund?  The government shutdown won t impact the ability to submit a tax return, but it will impact the issuance of refunds,  said Jeff Fosselman, a certified financial planner, certified public accountant and senior wealth adviser at Relative Value Partners.  Refunds don t start getting issued until mid-January, so depending on how long the shutdown lasts, this may or may not impact early filers. Williams predicts that if shutdown lasts past Jan. 15, the potential delay would be one and a half days for every one day of continued shutdown.  Past February 1, that delay could balloon to an extra two days per one day of shutdown,  he said.And if the shutdown rolls into March <U+2015> Trump threatened Friday to continue for  months or even years  <U+2015> there s really no telling what could happen.  Playing catch-up could be a nightmare for the IRS and consumers,  Williams said, noting that the issue would disproportionately affect Americans in lower-income brackets who count on refunds to pay down debt, save money or simply stay afloat.Here s the real kicker: Though Uncle Sam could indefinitely dole out IOUs to tax filers awaiting refunds, those who owe taxes will be expected to pony up by the usual deadlines, regardless of whether or not the government is shut down. There s no language in the IRS plan for a shutdown that calls for payments to be withheld or delayed,  Williams said.  Filing deadlines most certainly still apply, and the IRS takes postmarks very seriously. Even so, if you have any questions or concerns about how to approach filing your taxes, Williams said you should talk them over with a tax professional.Money, Home and Living Reporter, HuffPost"

We will be making billions and billions of dollars a year more money. And that is paying for the wall. Many, many times over,  Trump said in another rambling, hourlong news conference filled with such falsehoods. What we save on that just with Mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year, two years, or three years. So I view that as, absolutely, Mexico is paying for the wall,  he claimed.The White House has not provided any economic analysis to back up Trump s claims, despite weeks of queries from HuffPost.Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revised NAFTA <U+2015> which Trump has rebranded as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement <U+2015> will not bring into the U.S. Treasury anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall. Even more important: What extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by Americans, not Mexico. It s not true,  said Monica de Bolle, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, of Trump s claim.  What it really is is American consumers paying higher prices for stuff. So it s the American consumer who s paying for the wall, if you want to look at it that way. It s just total crazyland, and it s only going to get worse. Trump s untrue claim about the trade agreement was accompanied by the announcement that he  may  declare a national emergency and bypass Congress to build the wall.Trump also confirmed that he told congressional leaders that the two-week-old government shutdown could last months or even more than a year if Congress doesn t give him what he wants. I did say that. Absolutely I said that,  he told reporters in a chilly Rose Garden not long after a two-hour meeting with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the minority leaders from both chambers.But he said that if negotiations do not produce the $5.6 billion in border wall funding he is demanding, he can simply spend money on his own.  We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely,  he said.  No, we can do it. I haven t done it. I may do it. I may do it. But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. Were Trump actually to make such a declaration, though, it would almost certainly draw immediate legal challenges and, in all likelihood, court orders blocking him. The president s authority in this area is intended for wars and genuine national emergencies,  said Evan Hollander, a spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee s Democratic members.  Asserting this authority to build a wasteful wall is legally dubious and would likely invite a court challenge. Vermont Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy, the vice chairman of the Senate version of that committee, said there was no actual emergency for Trump to declare. There is no national emergency on the southern border. Between 2000 and 2018, border apprehensions fell sharply from roughly 1.6 million in fiscal year 2000 to approximately 400,000 in fiscal year 2018 <U+2015> that s a 75 percent drop,  Leahy said in a statement.  The president stealing resources from the Defense Department for the construction of a wasteful border wall, at taxpayer expense, to defend against the president s imaginary invasion would make our country less safe and the men and women of our military less safe. Friday s was the second meeting between Trump and the Republican and Democratic congressional leadership this week, but the first since Pelosi formally became speaker with the start of the new Congress. Democrats won 40 seats in the November midterm elections, giving them control of that chamber.Both Trump and Democratic lawmakers said both sides would have staff negotiate through the weekend. Trump said his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Vice President Mike Pence would lead his team.About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money two weeks ago, at midnight on Dec. 21, after Trump reneged on his commitment to sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the Senate on a unanimous vote. Trump changed his mind after Fox News and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money.Trump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would force Mexico to pay for it. But since taking office, Trump has never asked Mexico for payment even a single time. Instead, he began threatening to shut down the government early last year unless Congress gave him billions of dollars for it <U+2015> even though the structure of what he wants is unclear.During the campaign, he promised a  great, great  wall made of reinforced concrete that extended so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath. In recent months, he has said the wall could just be steel slats <U+2015> which would be the  bollard fencing  that was developed during President Barack Obama s administration.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Many of those people, maybe most of those people, that really have not been <U+2015> and will not be getting their money in at this moment <U+2015> those people, in many cases, are the biggest fan of what we re doing,  Trump told reporters during a press conference. When another reporter asked Trump about the safety net for federal workers <U+2015> many of whom are either furloughed or having to work without pay <U+2015> Trump again claimed that these people are backing his position to keep the government shut down until Democrats agree to give him $5.6 billion for his border wall.  I really believe a lot of them want to see border security,  he said. Trump has made unsubstantiated claims about support for his wall throughout the shutdown to deflect from the real financial consequences that individuals caught up in this fight are facing.Polls find that most Americans do not support the wall or funding for it. While some federal workers may back the president s stance, there s no evidence that most of them do.Here are some responses HuffPost received from self-identified federal workers:  I am a furloughed fed and I do NOT want a god damned fence. I want to go back to work serving the public and getting a paycheck.  <U+2015> federal worker  I m really pissed to not be working, but I will be even more pissed if the Dems cave and allow this tantrum to work.  <U+2015> federal worker in Washington, D.C. Neither me, nor any of my coworkers want any of this wall or this fight. We want a paycheck.  <U+2015> employee at the Federal Aviation Administration The health of the nation is endangered by Trump s tantrum to get his wall.  <U+2015> federal workerThe American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union with more than 700,000 members, has also taken issue with Trump s claim.  They are eager to get back to work,  AFGE President Jeffrey David Cox Sr. said in a statement earlier on in the shutdown.  They unequivocally oppose using shutdowns as a means of resolving policy disputes. This is not about a wall, this is about 800,000 real people with real families and real bills to pay. AFGE has also sued the government over the shutdown, saying it s illegal to make people work without pay. Employees who are considered  essential  to the functioning of the government <U+2015> such as air traffic controllers and people who work in law enforcement <U+2015> continue to work during the shutdown but will not get paid until after it s over. Congress will have to pass legislation authorizing back pay for both furloughed employees and those who worked during the shutdown. Trump has said he would support it. Since about three-quarters of the government s funding has already been appropriated by Congress, only certain agencies are closed for the shutdown. An estimated 420,000 federal employees are working without pay, and another 380,000 have been furloughed.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

The incident remains under investigation, which is taking longer than usual because of the shutdown,  Andrew MuÒoz, a public affairs officer for the National Park Service, told Outside Magazine Thursday.  A news release wasn t issued because of the shutdown. We aren t releasing more details. NPS representatives did not respond to HuffPost s requests for comment. (The NPS has said media lines would also be impacted by the shutdown.)MuÒoz told Outside Magazine s Wes Siler that dispatchers at the Yosemite National Park Emergency Communications Center received a 911 call on the afternoon of Dec. 25  regarding a male park visitor with a head injury above Nevada Fall.  Rangers were on scene in less than an hour and the visitor was removed from the water,  MuÒoz said.  Medical attention was provided to the visitor, but he died from his injuries. The visitor was not in a closed area. Though national parks have closed during previous government shutdowns, Yosemite is one of numerous sites that remain open but are sorely understaffed right now while parts of the government are shut down. The NPS typically employs around 800 staff at Yosemite during the winter season, but one ranger at the park told Outside Magazine on Thursday that only about 50 employees were working at the park after the shutdown went into effect at the end of December.MuÒoz did not comment on whether a lack of staffing impacted how quickly rangers reached the man who fell.But CNN reported on Friday that understaffing at national parks would likely impact things like maintenance and cleaning, as well as emergency services. For most parks, there will be no National Park Service-provided visitor services, such as restrooms, trash collection, facilities or road maintenance,  Jeremy Barnum, an NPS spokesman, told the outlet.One hiker at Big Bend National Park broke his leg in a fall and was assisted by other visitors before being intercepted by a park ranger. I can only imagine what someone else might be going through right now who needs a service that they can t get,  he told CNN.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

And I can do it if I want,  he told reporters gathered in the White House Rose Garden. We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. A dispute over funding for the massive infrastructure project Trump first proposed on the campaign trail led to the partial government shutdown that began two weeks ago.As a portion of federal workers continue to go without paychecks and a new Congress convened this week, Democrats and Republicans have yet to come to an agreement over the Trump administration s border security demands. Trump has said that he is willing to wait  as long as it takes  to obtain funds for the wall, which became one of his central campaign promises. A Friday meeting to discuss the shutdown was characterized differently by each side. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called it a  contentious  discussion, but Trump claimed it had been  productive.  His administration has asked for $5.6 billion for the project.Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, ABC News reported Friday that the president has discussed using funds from the Department of Defense, among several other options, as an alternative to making a deal. The Washington Post s Robert Costa said an unnamed former Trump adviser told the paper that the president was  willing to send the Army Corps of Engineers down to the border and start digging  if he does not get what he wants.Lawyers from the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon are meeting to discuss the legality of using executive power, NBC News reported Friday. Exactly how the wall might materialize, though, has become nearly as uncertain as its financing. While Trump originally described a solid concrete structure, he has since indicated the barrier could take the form of a steel slatted fence.This story has been updated with information about meetings related to the shutdown.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

The pay freeze lapsed last month after lawmakers failed to reach a consensus on spending bills for multiple federal agencies. Unless legislators take action by Saturday, the Post reported, the freeze is likely to expire and government executives like Pence could begin receiving raises that would have accumulated due to annual cost-of-living adjustments.The raises may be an intended outcome of the shutdown, as Republicans in November were attempting to tie a pay increase for civilian federal employees to a lift on the pay freeze for top government executives. President Donald Trump told lawmakers in August he wanted to scrap the annual pay raise for civilian federal employees, arguing the nation s budget couldn t finance it.Federal workers were poised to receive a 2.1 percent pay increase in January, along with an annual  locality pay increase.  We must maintain efforts to put our Nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases,  Trump wrote in a letter to House and Senate leaders.Trump in late December went forward on the pay freeze for federal workers, while the government shutdown was in effect.With the pay cap lifted, Cabinet secretaries could be eligible for an annual salary bump from $199,700 to $210,700, the Post reported. Salaries for deputy secretaries could jump from $179,700 to $189,600. Pence s salary could rise from $230,700 to $243,500.The raises could cost $300 million in taxpayer money over the course of 10 years, the Senior Executives Association told the Post.Roughly 400,000 federal workers have been furloughed since parts of the government shut down last month. Another 400,000 have been forced to work without pay. Democrats quickly passed legislation to reopen the closed government agencies after taking back control of the House on Thursday. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) vowed to block the bill, and Trump said he would veto it.Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House committee responsible for drafting annual spending bills, said it was  outrageous  that top Trump administration officials could take home raises while other federal employees go without pay. At a time when 800,000 federal employees aren t getting paid, it is absolutely outrageous that the Trump administration would even consider taking advantage of the shutdown to dole out huge raises to the Vice President and its political appointees,  Lowey said in a comment to HuffPost.Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), whose attempt to maintain the pay freeze for top government executives was voted down by House Republicans in June, condemned the potential raises. Donald Trump has a long history of shortchanging workers,  McCollum said in a comment to HuffPost.  While the government is shut down and federal employees are going without pay, he s doling out pay raises to his senior political appointees. I find this outrageous. The president must rescind this action, or Congress must work to prohibit it. The White House did not immediately offer comment on the potential raises. The government s Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget also did not respond to requests for comment.Trump said during remarks in the White House Rose Garden on Friday he was considering not granting the raises to cabinet members.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that the administration was  aware of the issue  and was  exploring options to prevent this from being implemented while some federal workers are furloughed. Jacqueline Simon, the policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, said no federal workers of any rank should be subjected to pay caps. We think it is a good thing salaries for top executives and political appointees will no longer be frozen, but we would expect the administration to abide by the  officers eat last  principle and make sure that rank and file federal employees receive a pay adjustment first,  Simon said in a emailed comment to HuffPost.She added:  If pay freezes are wrong for those at the top, then surely they are wrong for those on the front lines, and we urge the President to make sure that everybody gets an adjustment so they can keep up with the cost of living. This has been updated to include comment from McCollum and Sanders.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated that Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) is the ranking Democrat on the House committee responsible for drafting annual spending bills. In fact, she chairs the committee.

Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) spoke to reporters following a meeting with Trump at the White House, which they characterized as  contentious,  signaling that negotiations over the shutdown are not likely to end soon. But during remarks in the White House Rose Garden, Trump boasted that the meeting was  productive.  Absolutely, I said that,  Trump told reporters, when asked if he made the threat. But he reiterated that the meeting was  productive,  and said that  I hope [the shutdown] doesn t go on even beyond a few more days. Trump claimed that  we re all on the same path in terms of wanting to get government open,  before announcing that he has convened a group slated to meet  over the weekend to determine what we re going to do about the border. The president also offered tepid endorsements for a number of potential ideas that could potentially end the shutdown.For one, Trump toyed with supporting the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program. He also suggested he could be flexible on what the physical wall structure would be <U+2015> allowing for steel slats instead of a concrete barrier. Both ideas are concessions Democrats could potentially get behind, if they trusted Trump.It s just that trusting Trump to hold up his end of a bargain is a gigantic leap of faith for Democrats.In his Rose Garden press conference alone, Trump lied multiple times <U+2015> about his past support for a concrete wall, about who is paying for the wall (surprise: it s U.S. taxpayers!), and about the status of a U.S-Mexico trade deal that hasn t passed Congress.If Trump did back DACA, it would still be a sell to Democrats in Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other leaders have said that deal is no longer on the table, after Trump rejected it last year. It would take a substantial amount of trust that Trump wouldn t just change his mind and somehow find a way out of DACA, perhaps by offering a new executive order to override the legislation.And even if Trump stood by the immigration program that allows children brought to the United States illegally to stay and obtain work permits, many Republicans inside and outside of Congress would work to undo the legislation in the future.At the same time, the Democratic position that Trump and Republicans must completely cave and fund the government without any concessions doesn t seem realistic either.The partial government shutdown has lasted 14 days as Trump continues to insist on the $5 billion he wants to build his long-promised border wall. Roughly 800,000 federal workers are going without paychecks during the standoff.When asked Friday why he would not just reopen the government and negotiate over the border wall later, Trump said,  We won t be opening until it s solved. Trump later suggested he could declare a  national emergency  to circumvent Congress to fund the wall.Asked if there were plans to help federal workers who have not gotten paid because of the shutdown, Trump claimed without evidence that they  are the biggest fan of what we are doing,  and said that  the safety net is having a strong border.

Most shelters pay their staff, rent and expenses out of pocket, and are repaid with federal funds at the end of each month, Kim Gandy, the president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence explained.The amount of time a shelter can continue operating without federal funds depends on its cash reserves, access to credit lines, and other sources of funding, such as state grants and private donors. A lot of shelters operate on the edge,  she said.  If there is nobody home in the government to send out reimbursement checks, some programs won t be able to pay next month s rent. On an average day, over 40,000 victims of domestic violence seek refuge in shelters across the nation. An additional 31,000 receive services, including counseling, legal advocacy and children s support groups. Domestic violence programs are funded by a number of federal programs. Not all of them are impacted by the shutdown. But two of the major sources of funding <U+2015> the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and the Victims of Crime Act Fund <U+2015> are administered through the Department of Justice. The DOJ is now partially closed due to the shutdown.Another source of funding comes from the Department of Housing and Urban Development; most of its staff are furloughed. Lisalyn R. Jacobs, an expert in sexual and domestic violence, noted that many domestic violence programs survive paycheck to paycheck, much like many of the clients they serve.In Arkansas, for example, 32 domestic violence shelters serve all 75 counties. Beth Goodrich, the executive direction of the Arkansas Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said a number of those shelters can last only a few weeks before they need to begin laying off staff or even closing up temporarily.Goodrich said she has been fielding phone calls from shelter staff across the state who are anxious about the government shutdown. Many of our shelters are at capacity right now,  she said. The biggest concern, she added, was where to send the shelter residents if they had to close or lay off staff. That s a question I don t have an answer for,  Goodrich said.  Where are these people going to go? According to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 4 women in the U.S. will experience severe physical violence by an intimate partner in her lifetime. An estimated three women a day are killed by their boyfriends, husbands and exes.If the public wants to help ease the current pressure on shelters, they can donate items such as food, diapers and gas cards to their local shelters, Goodrich added.Mariah Stidham Wineski, executive director of the Louisiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said shelters in her state <U+2015> which rely heavily on federal funds to operate <U+2015> knew what to expect with the shutdown after weathering past ones.  We did our best to prepare for this, but the longer the shutdown goes on, the more precarious our position becomes,  she said. Wineski was hopeful the shutdown would end soon.  Until then we will do our best to juggle money and make it work,  she said. Shelters, which generally provide 24-hour emergency housing, need sufficient staffing around the clock, both for safety reasons and to support their clients, who come with myriad and complex needs. As well as providing a place to stay, domestic violence programs may offer counseling, child care, help finding transitional housing and legal assistance. I always like to think of our programs as essential services,  said Tonia Thomas, team coordinator for the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence.  I wish more people would think that too.  VAWA, landmark legislation that funds programs for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, also expired when the government shut down on Dec. 22. Advocates believe services will still be funded by Congress until the act is renewed. That s what happened the last time VAWA expired in 2011. However, getting VAWA renewed is a huge priority in 2019.Cindy Southworth, executive vice president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, said she was on Capitol Hill on Thursday to greet new members of Congress and impress on them the importance of reopening the government for victims of abuse. I explained to them we needed their help to end the government shutdown immediately,  she said.  But in addition, I told them we have a vital task ahead of us: to reauthorize a robust and survivor-centered Violence Against Women Act that protects all victims.

We are another layer of safety,  safety inspector Troy Tomey, 52, told the Miami Herald as he protested with other furloughed workers outside Miami International Airport on Thursday.  We re the last check of the box. Taking us out of it, mistakes can happen. On the day of the shutdown, union leaders with the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists warned that Congress would need to act fast to get inspectors back to work. Furloughing this critical workforce during the busy holiday travel season is neither in the best interest of the nation s economy nor the oversight of the U.S. aviation system,  the union said in a statement at the time. Union leaders at the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) are encouraging its members to call their representatives in Congress to ask for an end to the shutdown.This unacceptable government #shutdown is negatively affecting the National Airspace System. Call your U.S. Representative and both Senators to tell them it needs to end now! Complete the form at this link or call 844-336-1123.https://t.co/ipUKemXqpT pic.twitter.com/gZoeZ3fhJx Even though air traffic controllers and traffic management coordinators remain on the job, dedicated to the safety of every flight, they don t know when they ll receive their next paycheck and that adds more stress to an already stressful profession,  the NATCA said in a statement.  This shutdown and the resulting furloughs are rapidly eliminating the layers of redundancy and safety on which the NATCA is built.  The union also said hiring and training delays have worsened among the crisis. This staffing crisis is negatively affecting the National Airspace System, and the shutdown almost certainly will make a bad situation worse,  NATCA President Paul Rinaldi said in a statement.  Even before the shutdown, controllers have needed to work longer and harder to make up for the staffing shortfall. Overtime in the form of six-day weeks and 10-hour days is common at many of the nation s busiest and most short-staffed facilities including radar facilities in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, and Dallas. And none of the controllers forced to work during this shutdown will see pay for their hard work to keep travelers safe until the shutdown ends. This shutdown must end now. Trump s desperation for a border wall will be further hampered after Democrats took control of the House on Thursday. They have vowed not to give him any money for his wall.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

Ronil Singh was allegedly shot to death by an undocumented immigrant from Mexico during a traffic stop on Dec. 26. Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson partially blamed the killing on California s newly enacted sanctuary law, and President Donald Trump used the incident to bolster his demand for a border wall. Meanwhile, Pelosi, the newly elected House speaker, defended a holiday trip she took to Hawaii during the ongoing government shutdown over Trump s line-in-the-sand demand for $5 billion to build the barrier. Over this past weekend, we lost a police officer,  Hannity began on his show Thursday in a clip provided by Media Matters.  His name was Officer Singh. This guy was in California. And the sheriff of that county was on this show last night saying the sanctuary policies played a big part in what happened, because the murderer was involved in the criminal justice system and was never deported.  But Speaker Pelosi, while the president was in the White House waiting to negotiate, you were thousands of miles away, lapping it up, life of luxury, playing politics with border security. Americans died over the course of that weekend, Americans, an American hero police officer with a 5-month-old son is no longer on this earth providing for his child.

The bill is a sweeping combination of election, campaign finance and ethics reforms designed to make voting easier, curb the power of big donors and reduce conflicts of interest in all three branches of government.The For the People Act was the first major legislative action for Democrats after they voted to end the partial government shutdown initiated by President Donald Trump, a measure he is expected to veto.The package of reforms was put together in a collaborative process initiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in 2011 and overseen by Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) since 2017. The party ran in the 2018 midterm elections on a promise to enact these reforms. We carried a message of reform, of fighting corruption, of cleaning up Washington,  Sarbanes said in introducing the bill on Friday.  We made a promise to the American people. The new members who ve come made that promise and made it clear they wanted this to be the first order of business. [This bill] is delivering on that promise. The reforms in the For the People Act would restore the right to vote to millions of disenfranchised Americans and make it dramatically easier for people to vote while also creating a first-of-its-kind public financing system for House elections. It would also require presidential candidates to disclose 10 years of their tax returns.The bill shortly will go to three committees <U+2015> administration, judiciary and oversight <U+2015> for hearings. Democrats hope to pass it through the full House in February.It will then go to the Senate, where a companion bill will be introduced soon. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a hard-line opponent of campaign finance and election reforms, promised that the bill will not get a vote. The American people will know that this is an option that the House has given the Senate of the United States and the president of the United States,  Pelosi said on Friday.Here is what is in the Democrats  big reform bill: (Read the full text here.)The bill includes a requirement that all states automatically register voters who submit paperwork to a state government agency (unless the person opts out), provide same-day voter registration, allow 15 days of early voting with sites located near public transportation, use nonpartisan redistricting commissions to draw new congressional maps, enable online voter registration, count provisional ballots from eligible voters filed at the wrong polling place and use paper ballots in addition to electronic voting systems.It would also ban post-release felon disenfranchisement. This means that about 5 million Americans <U+2015> a disproportionate number of whom are African-American <U+2015> would regain their voting rights once their sentence is completed. The bill would, however, still allow states to disenfranchise felons during their imprisonment.States would be banned from engaging in voter caging, a process in which election officials purge voter rolls by sending out non-forwardable mail and then removing anyone whose mail is returned to sender. It would not be permissible for states to remove someone from the voter rolls for failing to vote in a previous election. The use of interstate cross-checks to purge voter rolls would also be limited under the legislation.Election Day would become a federal holiday for 2 million-plus federal workers, and non-government employers would be encouraged to give the day off to private-sector employees, too. Colleges and universities would be designated as voter registration agencies. Absentee ballots would no longer require postage. And the bill would also increase funding to help states update and secure election infrastructure and to the Election Assistance Commission to oversee these updates, with mandated reports on its progress. The Department of Homeland Security would be ordered to deem election systems as critical infrastructure.Additionally, the bill contains declarations and findings on important issues that Democrats aim to advance in separate legislation. These include findings about the importance of fixing the Voting Rights Act to comply with the Supreme Court s 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision, which gutted a key section of the historic legislation. Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.) will introduce this legislation, which will move on a separate track through the committees. The bill also asserts support for statehood for the District of Columbia, protects Native American voting rights and the right to vote in U.S territories.Sarbanes built his reputation as a democracy reform advocate through his work crafting and advocating for legislation to create a system of public financing for congressional elections. The legislative language from his previously introduced bills is the centerpiece of the For the People Act s campaign finance reform section.The bill creates a public financing system for House elections that provides $6 in public funds for every $1 in funds raised from donations up to $200. Participants in this voluntary public financing system would also be prevented from raising money from large donors. The bill also creates a small-donor matching system for presidential elections. A separate bill covering Senate elections will be introduced by Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.).This small-donor-backed public financing system is based on numerous programs adopted around the country, most notably in New York City. The idea is to create an alternative to the funding from big donors and political action committees that currently dominates politics by making it feasible for more candidates to run on small-donor contributions alone.The bill also includes the Disclose Act, which mandates that nonprofits and other groups not currently bound by law to reveal donor information must disclose those sources when they contribute to election campaigns. The package s Honest Ads Act requires the disclosure of digital political ads on tech platforms.The Federal Election Commission would be reconfigured from six members to five to prevent deadlocks on important issues. The agency s civil penalty would be made permanent to prevent future legislative battles over its authority. Coordination between super PACs and candidates would be defined in the legislation and banned. Presidential inauguration committees would be required to disclose expenditures and be banned from spending money on anything not related to the actual inauguration. Previously enacted bans on the Securities and Exchange Commission, the executive branch and the Internal Revenue Service from requiring donor disclosure from corporations, nonprofits and government contractors would be repealed.Like the election reform section, the campaign finance reform piece of the bill contains findings on issues Democrats would like to address in separate legislation. This includes a declaration that the Constitution should be amended to overturn not just the Supreme Court s 2010 Citizens United decision that empowered corporations, unions and the rich to spend unlimited sums on elections, but also the 1976 Buckley v. Valeo decision that banned Congress from limiting election spending altogether. Additionally, the bill states an intent to ban anonymous shell companies from funding campaigns to prevent the potential for secret foreign money to seep into elections.Every presidential candidate would be required to disclose 10 years worth of tax returns under the bill. The president and the vice president would be required to conduct themselves as though the executive branch s conflict of interest regulations apply to them. Presidential appointees would be required to recuse themselves from any decision in which a party is either the president, the president s spouse or any entity in which the president or their spouse has an interest. The president and vice president would be banned from contracting with the U.S. government <U+2015> a provision that would prevent Trump from leasing the Old Post Office Building that houses his D.C. hotel.The Office of Government Ethics would get new enforcement powers. Ethics waivers issued by OGE must be publicly disclosed. OGE must also come up with regulations to govern potential conflicts of interest that arise from the political contributions appointees previously made and received. Presidents-elect would be required to come up with ethics plans to govern their transitions.The bill also features new lobbyist and revolving door reforms to reduce government corruption. Lobbyist registration is extended to anyone  counseling in support of lobbying contacts.  This means ex-lawmakers acting as  consultants  for lobbyists would finally have to register as lobbyists. Federal contracting officers would be banned from accepting any compensation from a contractor that they awarded a contract to for two years after leaving office. Senior federal officials would be banned from contacting their former agency to influence employees for two years after their service ends. Foreign agents would be required to disclose anything of value given to an officeholder. And corporations would be prohibited from making incentive payments to anyone entering government service.Supreme Court justices would be required to develop a code of ethics to govern conflicts of interest and recusals. Members of Congress would be banned from using taxpayer funds to settle employment discrimination cases. Lawmakers would be banned from serving on corporate boards and from using their position to help the financial interests of themselves or their immediate families.Democrats see passage of the For the People Act as necessary to keep the promise that they made in the 2018 election to voters to fix democracy and root out corruption in Washington.The new House Democratic class that pushed the party into power in the 2018 election ran on a message of reform. More than 100 Democratic candidates, many of whom now sit in Congress, sent a letter to the House in October demanding the first order of business be the passage of campaign finance and electoral reforms. This package is really a great place for us to start in keeping all of the promises we made on the campaign trail,  freshman Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) said. The overall message is one that I hope will show voters that Democrats and many Republican allies who join us in this effort are trying to restore faith in the democratic process and in our government,  freshman Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) added.This article has been updated to include Sarbanes  comments.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The arrangement raises the appearance of special federal treatment for a private business owned by President Donald Trump. The National Park Service is one of the agencies that s not funded during the partial shutdown. Once funding was cut off, access to the clock tower at the top of the landmark   as well as exhibits the inside   were closed to the public, including to guests of Trump s hotel. A sign posted by the National Parks Service said the  clock tower will be closed until further notice,  adding:  Sorry for any inconvenience.  A link to more information about the tower on the National Park Service website indicates the site won t be updated during the shutdown and  may not reflect current conditions. The National Park Service s site at the Old Post Office, where the President has his hotel, will be reopening this weekend despite the ongoing government shutdown. Raises all manner of conflict of interest questions. https://t.co/6cJ1In1na6But according to Energy and Environment News, the General Services Administration (GSA) will reopen the tower on Friday.  The referenced facility remains open as the funds needed to operate the Old Post Office tower are not associated with the current fiscal year s appropriations bill,  GSA told The Hill in a statement. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.) called the funding sleight of hand a  disgrace. The Trump admin is using your tax dollars to keep an @NPS site at his luxury hotel open while the rest of Americans are wading through garbage and locked gates. The corruption and disgrace of this govt are without bottom. https://t.co/bq7IzsGURuThe historic 270-foot tower and hotel   once the headquarters of the U.S. Post Office   is owned by the GSA. In 2013, the agency leased the property for 60 years to the Trump Organization. That agreement noted that the property could not be leased to an  elected official of the Government of the United States,  but the GSA determined the deal was in  full compliance  because Trump had agreed not to accept direct payments from the hotel.According to the lease, Trump Hotels must preserve public access to the tower and maintain the entire Post Office site. For the avoidance of doubt, the Clock Tower Space is part of the Premises ... for which Tenant is responsible,  the lease states.The website for the Trump International Hotel touts the  Clock Tower observation deck with panoramic views of the capital city  as one of the  hotel highlights. The hotel is at the center of an emoluments case against the president. The emoluments clause of the Constitution bars federal officials from accepting gifts or benefits from foreign officials or governments. The case, filed by the attorneys general of Maryland and Washington, D.C., accuses Trump of skirting the prohibition with the hotel where they contend foreign leaders can curry favor with the president via pricey bookings and parties.A spokesman for the Department of the Interior told E&E that the parks service was attempting to keep  iconic areas  open during the shutdown, but that did not include the tower   until the GSA stepped in. This story has been updated to include a working link for the NPS page on the clock tower.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

The president has made it very clear: No wall, no deal,  Pence told Fox News personality Tucker Carlson.  We re here to make a deal, but it s a deal that s going to result in achieving real gains on border security, and you have no border security without a wall. We will have no deal without a wall. The partial government shutdown, which began shortly before Christmas, is stretching into its third week with no end in sight. House Democrats under the leadership of newly elected Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), passed legislation meant to reopen closed agencies, but those efforts have already been deemed dead on arrival by Republican leaders. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) has said he would block any bill without first obtaining President Donald Trump s approval, and Trump has refused to back down from his demand that a government spending bill include the $5.6 billion for the wall.Pence on Thursday repeatedly said the White House was willing to negotiate with the Democrats to sort out some kind of compromise, although he said there would be no deal without funding for some sort of barrier along the Mexico border. We really are prepared to negotiate, we re prepared to talk, we re prepared to listen,  the vice president said.  I want the American people to know that this is a real crisis at our border, and we made progress last year. Congressional leaders from both parties are expected to meet with Trump at the White House again on Friday.Some GOP senators began to break with their party on Thursday, however, and urged McConnell to consider compromising on legislation even if Trump didn t get immediate funding for border security. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) told The Hill that the chamber should pass a continuing resolution, a stop-gap funding measure, to  get the government back open.  We can pass legislation that has the appropriations number in it while we continue to get more, but we should continue to do our jobs and get the government open,  he told the outlet.Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) also said Thursday she would support a proposal to separate homeland security funding from other funding bills in order to reopen most of the government agencies that have been affected.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But polls contradict him. The people of our country want it,  Trump declared at a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room Thursday to plead for the wall (see the video above at 2:20). I have never had so much support as I have in the last week over my stance for border security ... or, frankly, the wall or the barrier. I have never had anything like it in terms of calls coming in, in terms of people writing in and tweeting. I ve never had this much support,  he added. Trump was apparently referring to personal calls he has received. Neither the White House switchboard nor the call-in phone line to leave recorded comments is functioning because of the government shutdown.  We apologize, but due to the lapse in federal funding, we are unable to take your call,  a recorded message on the switchboard states.But no poll has found that a majority of Americans support the wall or funding for the wall, or see it as a priority.A Quinnipiac poll of 1,147 voters reached on landlines or cell phones from Dec. 12-17 found that 54 percent of respondents opposed the wall and 43 percent supported it. A Harvard CAPS/Harris online survey of 1,407 registered voters conducted Dec. 24-26  found that 56 percent of those surveyed did not support a wall, while 44 percent did.Just 35 percent of those surveyed supported including money for the wall in a federal spending bill, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll of 2,440 adults conducted online Dec. 21-25.More than two-thirds of Americans don t think the wall should be a priority, according to a poll of 1,075 adults by NPR, PBS News Hour and Marist. That poll was conducted Nov. 28-Dec. 4 using live telephone interviews to reach both landlines and cell phones. Regardless of Americans  opinions about the wall, they re not happy with how the government shutdown is being handled by either Congress or Trump. Just 18 percent of Americans polled say they approve of how Congress has handled the shutdown, with 60 percent disapproving, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds. As for Trump, 38 percent approve of how he s handling it, and 49 percent disapprove, according to the poll.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

But those efforts to end the shutdown are going nowhere fast, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowing to block the bill and President Donald Trump saying he would veto it.The partial government shutdown is about to hit its two-week anniversary, and even with Democrats now controlling one chamber of Congress, there s no sign of any deal.Democrats are more determined than ever not to give Trump a single dollar for his border wall, and Trump hasn t moved off his full request of $5.6 billion for construction of some kind of physical barrier. (There s an ongoing semantics battle over  border security,   steel slats,   fencing,  and a  wall  that could ultimately be key to ending the shutdown.)There s also the possibility that lawmakers return to an old deal, trading wall money for an extension of the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program. Sean Hannity, a close confidant of the president, floated that idea on his TV show Thursday night, but Democrats have also said they now wouldn t accept that deal, partly because they don t trust Trump to hold up his end of the bargain.A DACA deal still could be the way out of the shutdown, if Democrats decided to trust Trump. Democratic and Republican congressional leaders are set to attend another White House meeting with Trump on Friday. If past meetings are any indication, however, everyone will walk away from the meeting firmer in their resolve not to give an inch.On Thursday, House Democrats passed two bills that would end the shutdown: a roughly month-long extension for the Department of Homeland Security that would allow both sides to continue negotiating on a wall, and another larger bill that would fund all shuttered agencies until October. The short-term bill for DHS passed the House 239-192, with five Republicans breaking ranks to join all Democrats in support of the bill.The House also passed a bill to reopen the handful of other unfunded agencies. That bill passed 241-190, with seven Republicans joining Democrats to vote yes.The Republican defections <U+2015> contrasted with Democratic unity <U+2015> are the first signs of the GOP cracking under the pressure of the shutdown.Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who s up for re-election in 2020 in his increasingly blue state, also said Thursday that he supports passing a continuing resolution to reopen the government.But aside from a few Republicans, the GOP is digging in. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) <U+2015> a member who speaks with Trump on a regular basis <U+2015> told HuffPost on Thursday that the shutdown wouldn t end until Democrats approved wall money.  I mean, there s a wall between Tijuana and San Diego, right? If it s so bad or immoral as they say, you d think they d be willing to tear them down,  Jordan said.Jordan is unlikely to vote for any proposal that doesn t include Trump s full request, but one of the byproducts of Democrats taking back the House is that Jordan s vote is irrelevant. As Democrats proved Thursday night, they have the votes to reopen the government. They just need the Senate to act and the president to sign it <U+2015> two things that remain unlikely.McConnell once again vowed Thursday not to bring up the House-passed legislation, calling the bills that passed the Senate unanimously two weeks ago a  waste of time.  He says he won t allow a vote on anything  that does not have a real chance of passing this chamber and getting a presidential signature. Leaving aside whether a bill that passed unanimously two weeks ago doesn t have a real chance of passing, the House and Senate could always override Trump s veto, but that would require a significant number of Republicans to break ranks <U+2015> more than two dozen in the Senate and around 50 in the House.Politically, that s a tall order for the GOP, a party that seems to value fealty to Trump above all else. But the realities of the shutdown are just starting to hit. There are roughly 400,000 federal workers who have been furloughed, and another 400,000 who are simply working without pay. If the shutdown stretches on for another week <U+2015> looking more likely by the day <U+2015> it will be the longest government shutdown in history, over a $5 billion dispute in a $4.4 trillion budget.For Democrats, however, the wall has become much more than a line item. It s almost a representation of Trump s entire legacy, all of his policies and empty promises. Democrats don t want to give in to Trump on that, particularly after his negotiating style has been to just demand that Democrats give him what he wants. We re not doing the wall,  Pelosi told reporters Thursday night.  Does anybody have any doubt? We re not doing the wall. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Instead of throttling legislation that is popular with the general public but makes Trump and Republicans look bad, she will pass it, and dare the Senate and Trump to oppose it. I don t think the president or his team fully appreciate how miserable having a House Democratic majority will be,  said one Republican consultant on condition of anonymity. A former White House official said Trump s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had told the president that a Pelosi speakership would actually be good for him. He s only now realizing that Javanka misled him,  the official said, also on condition of anonymity and using a nickname for the couple.Trump made a surprise visit to the White House briefing room Thursday afternoon to congratulate Pelosi and to predict he would work well with her.  I think it s actually going to work out. I think it will be a little bit different than what a lot of people are thinking,  Trump said.Ramesh Ponnuru, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, remained unpersuaded. He said that Trump s White House seems to understand the threat posed by Democrats  new ability to investigate using congressional hearings and subpoenas, but  it seems like they haven t given much thought to the legislative headaches  Pelosi could cause.If Trump demands legislation important to him, Pelosi and Democrats could counter it with something they want.If Trump pushes restrictions on immigration, as he has in the past, House Democrats could pass the comprehensive immigration bill that cleared the Senate in 2013, which includes a path to citizenship for those who entered this country illegally.If Trump insists on funding for his border wall, Democrats could agree to pass it on the condition that the bill also include protection for special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation of Trump. Or a requirement that all presidential candidates produce 10 years of tax returns. Or both.Democrats could also bring to the floor and pass proposals that are popular generally but that traditionally have been opposed by Republicans   and thereby force House Republicans to take a public stand on them. Just increasing the minimum wage is an issue that s popular and that splits Trump s coalition,  Ponnuru said.The new Democratic House majority will likely not have much effect on Trump s own legislative agenda, primarily because he has not had much of one.While Trump likes to boast about the tax cut bill, legislation rolling back regulations and his appointment of a record number of conservative appeals court judges, in reality, all of those likely would have happened with any Republican president working with a Republican Congress. The uniquely  Trumpian  elements of his agenda   such as cutting back on legal immigration or backing out of trade agreements   have not received much support at all from congressional Republican leaders in either chamber. He didn t need or want much. He didn t ask in a serious way for much. And he didn t get much,  Ponnuru said.In any event, Republicans  bigger concern now is the legislation originating in Pelosi s House. Raising the minimum wage, protecting Mueller, requiring tax returns of presidential candidates and offering a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, particularly those brought into the country as children, are all popular among the general public but have been blocked by Republican House leaders in the past.When those or similar bills pass the House, the only thing stopping them from passing Congress could well be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. All eyes should be on Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell understands the implications of House Democratic control even though the White House doesn t,  said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida.  McConnell s full-time role is going to be preventing legislation from getting to the president. It s a role he has already started playing. When Pelosi announced that the first legislation to pass under her leadership would be bills ending the partial government shutdown   bills that had already won strong Republican support in the Senate last year   McConnell quickly responded that he would not bring them to the floor because Trump would not sign them.In an interview with CNN, McConnell said he was waiting for Trump to come to an agreement with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, since he needs seven Democratic votes to pass legislation.  So, I haven t been sidelined,  McConnell said.  It s just that there s no particular role for me when you have this setup. Jolly said he is not sure that explanation will pass the straight-face test with bills that clearly have enough bipartisan support to pass McConnell s chamber.  There will be a moment when the votes are there in the Senate, and McConnell doesn t let it pass,  he said.Stan Collender, who for decades worked on Capitol Hill as a budget committee staffer, said that dynamic could be a dangerous one for Trump.  Looks like McConnell is willing to take the bullet for Trump so far,  Collender said.  If and when that changes, this will become a real shit show for the White House. That will be the real loss of the Trump base. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Cory Gardner (Colo.) became the first senator in his party to call for an end to the partial government shutdown, even if President Donald Trump doesn t get funding for his border wall. I think we should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open,  Gardner told The Hill in an article published Thursday.  The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today. As the new Congress begins, it s critical that both sides come together to find a bipartisan solution to fund the remaining parts of the government.The shutdown began last month and is now in its 13th day with no end in sight. Newly-elected Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) plans to push through legislation to reopen the government now that Democrats control the House, but Republicans who control the Senate said they won t consider the measure because it doesn t include Trump s demands for $5.6 billion in funding for his wall.The president has remained steadfast in his demands, telling Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) in a meeting Wednesday that he would not back down.  I would look foolish if I did that,  Trump reportedly said, according to The New York Times, saying he was elected because of his promise to build a border wall.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) suggested this week the shutdown could last for weeks more, saying he won t consider any bill that doesn t already have the president s approval. As I said for the last few weeks, the Senate will be glad to vote on a measure that the House passes that the president will sign,  McConnell said.  But we re not going to vote on anything else. Gardner told The Hill that if Congress passes legislation to reopen the government, it will force Democrats to explain why they won t fund Trump s border wall, a signature campaign pledge that remains popular with his core supporters.Gardner is up for re-election in Colorado in 2020 and is considered particularly vulnerable after Democrat Hillary Clinton carried the state by about 5 points in the last presidential election. We can pass legislation that has the appropriations number in it while we continue to get more but we should continue to do our jobs and get the government open,  he told The Hill.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). And President Donald Trump may find that his playbook for dealing with women   a classic sexist mixture of paternalism, leering and straight-up name-calling and misogyny, sprinkled with the occasional nondisclosure agreement   isn t going to work against this unprecedented female offense. The female forces aligned against Trump involve more than Pelosi, who on Thursday officially became the most powerful female politician in the country (again). He ll have to contend with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) the new chair of the House Financial Services Committee. She said that looking at Trump s finances will be on the to-do list.

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) to provide a steady stream of criticism, well. He s going to have powerful, competent women coming at him in all directions,  said Jennifer Lawless, a politics professor at the University of Virginia.Trump s go-to strategy of name-calling and ad hominem attacks is not going to work against this onslaught, she said. Calling these women weak, suggesting he can ruin their careers   all strategies he s done with men he doesn t respect   will be an instant reminder of the president s sexism.  If he wants to avoid daily reminders of the  Access Hollywood  tape, then he can t deal with these powerful female adversaries the same way he s accustomed to dealing with powerful male adversaries,  Lawless said.Of course, Trump has had to face off with powerful women before, but typically these were one-offs. In the race against Hillary Clinton, already the subject of a good portion of the country s hatred, he was able to tap the misogynist well. He was successful in demeaning Warren by calling her Pocahontas. His strategy with Angela Merkel? Ignore. At one event, Trump notably avoided making eye contact.The difference this time is he s outnumbered. And that s crucial. Having more women in power makes a real difference when it comes to battling sexism   that s true in the boardroom, where it s generally recognized that you need at least three female directors in order to have truly meaningful diversify. And it s true in politics, too. Alone, one woman can do a little to combat sexism, but together, a diverse group can break through insidious stereotypes and take on men like Trump   who ve spent their careers ignoring women. Pelosi gets this. Have you ever been to a meeting when you re at the table, and a woman makes a suggestion, and then they go to the next person, and then two persons later a man makes the same suggestion, the other gentleman at the table say,  That s a great idea ?  Pelosi asked CNN s Dana Bash recently.The whole listening to women thing will hopefully be less of a problem now that there are so many women in Congress, Pelosi told The New York Times. The 78-year-old congresswoman has been training her whole life for this moment   beginning her career in Congress as only one of 23 women in the House, wrangling power away from a bunch of men who weren t exactly itching to mentor her.She isn t here to coddle the president, as the women in his orbit tend to do. Indeed, one of the only high-ranking women in the Trump administration calls the President  dad. And Pelosi won t be cowed by his insults.  I know how to take a punch,  she told Bash.  I put on a suit of armor, eat nails for breakfast. We got a taste of how she handles Trump at the end of last year, when she swooped into the Oval Office for a meeting that was supposed to be a photo op and turned into a Democratic public relations coup when she and Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) got Trump to take credit for the government shutdown that is currently in its 12th day.At the meeting, available in its entirety on C-SPAN, she dismantled Trump who tried his best to only talk to the men in the room (another tactic he s used with powerful women).Pelosi chided him at one point by saying,  don t characterize the strength that I bring.  Those words are now immortalized on a T-shirt in her office, the Times reported. Her armor that day was a red Max Mara coat that became instantly iconic. Today, she got more than a coat <U+2015> she took up the gavel. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

In remarks just after her election, Pelosi said she was particularly proud to be speaker of the House for the 116th Congress, which marks the 100th year of women having the right to vote,  and that we all have the ability and the privilege to serve with over 100 women members of Congress, the largest number in history. Pelosi s path back to House speaker wasn t easy. Part of the reason Republicans were able to win back the House majority in 2010 was through a  Fire Pelosi  campaign that made her toxic in some Republican-leaning districts, and Republicans have run on a similar playbook for every election since, including in 2018.A number of freshman Democrats made promises during the campaign to not support Pelosi if they were elected to Congress, and 10 stood by that vow, voting either  present  or for someone else.But Pelosi was able to quell a revolt from about a dozen and a half Democrats who were already in Congress. She was able to frame the opposition as misogynist. (Her supporters started the hashtag #FiveWhiteGuys to describe the opposition, even though it wasn t only white men opposing her and there were more than five.)She picked off individual members through small promises. (She got the vote of Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio by promising to bring back a subcommittee on elections and make her the chairwoman, and she got Rep. Brian Higgins of New York simply by publishing a statement supporting his Medicare buy-in idea.)And she swung a large chunk of detractors through a deal where she stated her support of term limits for leadership roles and committee chairmen. (The deal set up Pelosi to not only serve this term as speaker but to serve next term as speaker if Democrats hold onto the House.)It was a classic demonstration of her skill as a legislator. She outworked her opponents. She wore them down, made it uncomfortable to oppose her, and then offered a carrot for their support. And by giving the smallest concession, Pelosi actually solidified her future position. If she serves the next two terms as the No. 1 Democrat in the House, she will have spent 20 years in that position and practically assured through rule changes that no one else could ever do the same.Pelosi takes the speakership from Republican Paul Ryan, who exited the building entirely in deciding not to run for re-election, during a partial government shutdown. The fitting end to Ryan s speakership is a political gift to Pelosi, as Democrats are able to unify around her opposition to President Donald Trump and his border wall. The first order of business for Democrats is to pass legislation reopening those closed agencies.Pelosi has already shown her mettle with Trump during this shutdown. She has been resolute that Democrats won t approve any money for Trump s border wall, and she s positioned Democrats to hammer the president and Senate Republicans for their refusal to take up a bill that passed the Senate unanimously weeks before.During an Oval Office meeting with Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), she and Schumer were able to goad Trump into taking the blame for a shutdown <U+2015> a sound bite that continues to haunt Trump as the shutdown stretches into its second week.As House Democrats address legislation to end the shutdown, they are also set to take up unifying anti-corruption legislation before facing any of the real fault lines in their caucus. Democrats don t plan to immediately demand Trump s tax returns, as they could in the Ways and Means Committee. They don t have any plans to impeach the president, though some members plan to offer articles of impeachment on Day One. And they won t be taking up contentious health care legislation any time soon. Pelosi was able to head off a small revolt on the rules package. Some progressive members didn t want  pay as you go  rules enacted in Congress, for hope of passing a Medicare-for-all bill, but the rules package is expected to easily be adopted later Thursday.Pelosi, the only woman to ever serve as speaker, takes the gavel after serving eight years as minority leader, with four years as speaker before that and another four years <U+2015> from 2003 to 2007 <U+2015> as the minority leader previously. She s been in Congress since 1987.This story has been updated with more details from the vote and after the vote.HuffPost s  Her Stories  newsletter brings you even more reporting from around the world on the important issues affecting women.

Instead of Atlantic City casinos shutting down, the federal government is shut down. Instead of Trump running from bankers over his bills, Trump s running from Mexico and trying to pass on that bill to the American taxpayer,  Melber said, before invoking the R&B classic:We all know someone like this. A scrub who runs up the tab, then when the bill comes, all of a sudden they re acting dumb. BeyoncÈ diagnosed that type of person in the classic  Bills, Bills, Bills  by Destiny s Child.

Just 18 percent of Americans polled say they approve of how Congress has handled the shutdown, with 60 percent disapproving. Also in the negative are congressional Republicans (25 percent approve of how they ve handled it, 58 percent disapprove); congressional Democrats (33 percent approve, 51 percent disapprove); President Donald Trump (38 percent approve, 49 percent disapprove); and respondents  own congressional representatives (33 percent approve, 41 percent disapprove).For all but Trump, there s been a downward movement in ratings since a poll from the start of the shutdown, although in some cases, the change is modest enough to make it unclear whether it reflects a genuine shift in opinion or the kind of fluctuation inherent to surveys.Another metric also shows little change: Sixty-two percent of Americans now say the partial shutdown is at least somewhat serious, and one-third that it s a very serious problem. At the beginning of the shutdown, 61 percent considered it at least somewhat serious, and 29 percent said it was very serious. A 51 percent majority of Americans now say Trump deserves at least some responsibility for the shutdown, with 44 percent saying Democrats in Congress bear some responsibility, and 36 percent saying that Republicans in Congress do.The HuffPost/YouGov poll didn t ask whom Americans consider most responsible. But a Reuters/Ipsos survey conducted just before Christmas found that 47 percent of Americans considered Trump most blame-worthy, with 33 percent laying the bulk of responsibility on congressional Democrats and 7 percent pinning it on congressional Republicans. Another survey from Morning Consult bore similar results, with 43 percent of voters saying Trump was most to blame, 31 percent pointing the finger at Democrats in Congress, and 7 percent naming the congressional GOP.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 28-30 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

On Wednesday, the Democratic leaders emerged from the White House after 90 minutes, unified on not giving in to Trump. They are now feeling the heat,  Schumer said.Pelosi, who is expected to return to the House speakership Thursday afternoon after eight years as minority leader, intends as her first action to pass spending bills that won Republican support last year to reopen the closed agencies. We re asking the president to open the government,  she told reporters on the White House driveway.  We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do that? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though, said he will not take up legislation that Trump has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue.About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight Dec. 21 after Trump reneged on his commitment to a sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the Senate on a unanimous vote. Trump changed his mind after Fox News and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money.Trump is now insisting that Congress appropriate $5.7 billion for that project, while Democrats want a short-term spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security and full-year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately.In the meantime, about 800,000 federal employees <U+2015> about half furloughed, half deemed  essential  and required to work anyway <U+2015> face real problems with their household finances. Many will miss their first paycheck on Jan. 11 unless Trump signs a spending bill before then. Employees would have to dip into their savings or borrow money to pay their bills, as there is no government program to help them.Trump, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top Democratic and Republican congressional leaders.When asked how long the shutdown would last, the president replied,  As long as it takes,  calling his wall, a signature campaign promise, a matter of  national security. Trump s comments came at what was billed as the first Cabinet meeting of 2019. Instead, Trump spent the first hour and a half of it complaining about a variety of issues, such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis  performance and the late Sen. John McCain s vote against Trump s repeal of Obamacare, as well as offering his musings on such things as the utility of wheels and his desire for Russia to invade Afghanistan again.Trump s remarks were riddled with falsehoods on everything from trade to the number of illegal immigrants in the country to the way NATO works.The White House did not respond to HuffPost queries about whether Trump understood that what he was saying was false and, if he did, why he was doing so anyway.Trump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would get Mexico to pay for it. But since taking office, Trump has never asked Mexico for payment. Instead, he began threatening to shut down the government early last year unless Congress gave him billions of dollars to build it <U+2015> even though the type of structure he wants remains unclear.During the campaign, he promised a  great, great  wall made of reinforced concrete that would rise 30 feet or more and extend so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath. In recent months, he has at times said the wall could just be steel slats, which would be like the  bollard fencing  developed during President Barack Obama s administration.In a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump claimed, falsely, that Mexico was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway.Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback!Despite numerous requests over several weeks, the White House has not provided any economic analysis to back up Trump s claims. Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has rebranded the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, will not bring in to the U.S. Treasury anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall. More important, what extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by people in the U.S., not Mexico.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) revealed he would support President Donald Trump s proposed border wall one day after publishing an opinion piece in The Washington Post critiquing nearly everything about the current administration. I would vote for the border wall,  Romney, former Republican presidential candidate, told CNN s Jake Tapper in a Wednesday afternoon interview. We should have a wall on the southern border,  the former governor of Massachusetts added.While he considers the government shutdown <U+2015> which has gone on for nearly two weeks <U+2015> an  unfortunate  situation, Romney did not directly criticize it. Trump has pledged to continue the shutdown for  as long as it takes  to secure federal funding for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, which would come with a multibillion-dollar price tag, even though the president has previously said that Mexico would pay for it.The senator-elect appears willing to fall in line with Trump over his most divisive campaign promise, even though he believes the president is causing  dismay around the world  and tension in America, as he wrote for The Post in the piece published Tuesday morning. It is well known that Donald Trump was not my choice for the Republican presidential nomination. After he became the nominee, I hoped his campaign would refrain from resentment and name-calling. It did not,  Romney wrote.  His conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office. The senator-elect lamented the recent departures of former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.He also pledged to  speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions,  he wrote.The wall has been criticized as a symbol of racism that would not effectively stop people without documents from crossing the border.For the op-ed, Romney earned a rebuttal from Trump, who floated a comparison to outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a frequent Trump critic who nonetheless largely voted in line with the president s policies. I won big, and he didn t,  the president wrote, appearing to reference Romney s failed 2012 campaign.  Be a TEAM player & WIN!  Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

It is time to end this unnecessary shutdown and put the federal government fully back to work serving the American people,  incoming Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said in a statement.But House passage of the bill is unlikely to change much. Even though the Senate unanimously passed a clean continuing resolution at the end of December <U+2015> a stopgap spending bill extending operations without border wall money <U+2015> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has vowed not to bring up another bill in this new Congress until there s agreement from Trump.House Democrats will be able to argue that McConnell and Trump are standing in the way of paychecks for an estimated 800,000 federal workers <U+2015> more than half of whom are simply working without pay. Typically, Congress approves back pay for those furloughed workers, but government contractors will likely get nothing.As Washington <U+2015> and the rest of the United States <U+2015> comes back from its holiday break, pressure to end the shutdown may grow. Americans already blame Trump more for the shutdown than Democrats, by a margin of 47 percent to 33 percent. And if the shutdown stretches on so long that Americans start feeling the effects <U+2015> like delayed tax refunds because of a shuttered IRS, or missed flights because of TSA workers striking <U+2015> Trump and other Republicans may start getting desperate.Trump said Wednesday that it could be a  long time  before the closed government agencies are reopened.The president vows to keep the shutdown going as long as Democrats don t give him money for his border wall, but he s shown no willingness to negotiate on the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program, and Democrats have shown little willingness to give Trump even one dollar. The distance between the two sides seems to be growing, as Trump reneged on a deal Vice President Mike Pence offered last week that would have delivered $2.5 billion for the wall, instead of the $5.6 billion Trump wants. Trump said Wednesday that he wouldn t accept just $2.5 billion.Trump met with Democratic leaders on Wednesday at the White House, but there was once again no real movement.Instead of cutting a hasty deal, Democrats seem more satisfied to demonstrate that it s Trump and Republicans standing in the way of a funded government. Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who represents many federal employees in northern Virginia, said he was confident Democrats could wait the president out. I don t know what leverage he has that he can exercise,  Connolly told HuffPost on Wednesday.  They started off with $5.5 billion or else. And we re now down to anything with a 2. In the spending bills Democrats plan to pass on Thursday, the February date for DHS funding would serve to continue negotiations. Some Republicans in the House may end up voting for the bill, and there s a possibility that if the shutdown drags on for long enough, Senate Republicans could pass the bill and both chambers could override Trump s veto.Democrats initially planned to make their first legislation in the majority a package of anti-corruption, campaign finance and democracy reform bills. That will now be the second item on their agenda, after funding the government, though they are still calling the anti-corruption package  H.R. 1  and plan to pass that bill later on Thursday.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been left without pay for nearly two weeks.During Wednesday s  Fox & Friends,  co-host Brian Kilmeade lamented the continued closure of national parks and museums caused by the partial government shutdown as it headed into its 12th day.But Earhardt suggested the shutdown is a small price to pay because President Donald Trump just wants Americans to be safe. It is an inconvenience, yes,  Earhardt told her co-hosts.  But the president is saying,  Most [immigrants] are good people, but there are some bad apples in the group.  She continued,  And even though it is an inconvenience, he s saying that your safety and your security as an American <U+2015> he said you deserve to be able to go to sleep at night and not have to worry about being killed by an illegal immigrant. And we ve seen that happen. Studies show undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens. In fact, states with more undocumented immigrants have lower crime rates than states with fewer of them.Ainsley Earhardt: The government shutdown is  an inconvenience,  but  you deserve to be able to go to sleep at night and not have to worry about being killed by an illegal immigrant.  pic.twitter.com/BiYK6tCiw8Though Earhardt can apparently carry on as usual during the shutdown, many of her viewers may not be so lucky. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have been furloughed or continue to work without pay if the government deems their job essential. Though federal employees will receive retroactive pay after Congress and Trump reach an agreement on a spending bill, government contractors will likely never get back pay.In any case, retroactive pay won t prevent some federal workers from missing rent or mortgage payments during a prolonged shutdown. Most of us live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford to be unpaid and still go to work for long. It is not fair,  a Transportation Security Administration employee told HuffPost.Without staffing, national parks like Yosemite in California and Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado are being overwhelmed with trash and vandalism. On Wednesday, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., announced it had run out of funding to keep the National Zoo and its museums open. The latest shutdown, one of three in 2018, has some federal workers worrying this could become the new norm. All we want to do is go to work, protect the American people, and bring home a paycheck to provide for our families. What are we supposed to do without a paycheck? I don t want another job, it is my honor to do what I do. #ShutdownStoriesMy insurance premium is $600 per month & my sons Insulin & pump supplies are an additional $600 per quarter.

The notice will address  electronic filing and database systems, filing deadlines, regulatory and application fee payments, transaction shot clocks, and more,  the FCC said.The government has been partially closed since Dec. 22 over President Donald Trump s demand that border wall funding be included in any spending bill passed by Congress. Democrats, who take control of the House on Thursday, have promised to pass spending legislation that would allow the government to reopen without wall funding."

The partial government shutdown began on Dec. 22. Money for Trump s pet project, a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, has been the sticking point in passing budgets for several government departments.The briefing is scheduled for 3 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday, the day before Democrats are to assume control of the House and end the Republican monopoly on government.The exact agenda was not immediately clear, according to a person with knowledge of the briefing who was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the top incoming House Republicans   Kevin McCarthy of California and Steve Scalise of Louisiana   planned to attend, aides said. The departing House speaker, Paul Ryan, was not expected.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to become speaker on Thursday, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer planned to attend. Pelosi said Tuesday that Democrats would take action to  end the Trump shutdown  by passing legislation Thursday to reopen government. We are giving the Republicans the opportunity to take yes for an answer,  she wrote in a letter to colleagues.  Senate Republicans have already supported this legislation, and if they reject it now, they will be fully complicit in chaos and destruction of the president s third shutdown of his term. The White House invitation came Tuesday after House Democrats released their plan to re-open the government without approving money for a border wall   unveiling two bills to fund shuttered government agencies and put hundreds of thousands of federal workers back on the job. They planned to pass them as soon as the new Congress convenes Thursday.Responding to the Democratic plan, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders late Tuesday night called it a  non-starter  and said it won t re-open the government  because it fails to secure the border and puts the needs of other countries above the needs of our own citizens. Trump spent the weekend saying Democrats should return to Washington to negotiate, firing off Twitter taunts. After aides suggested there would not necessarily be a traditional wall as Trump had described since his presidential campaign, Trump stated that he really still wanted to build a border wall.On Tuesday morning, after tweeting a New Year s message to  EVERYONE INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA,  Trump tweeted:  The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security. But he seemed to shift tactics later in the day, appealing to Pelosi.  Border Security and the Wall  thing  and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let s make a deal?  he tweeted.Whether the Republican-led Senate would consider the Democratic bills   or if Trump would sign either into law   was unclear. McConnell spokesman Donald Stewart said Senate Republicans would not take action without Trump s backing. It s simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won t sign,  Stewart said.Even if only symbolic, the passage of the bills in the House would put fresh pressure on the president. At the same time, administration officials said Trump was in no rush for a resolution to the impasse.Trump believes he has public opinion on his side and, at very least, his base of supporters behind him, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.The Democratic package to end the shutdown would include one bill to temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels   with $1.3 billion for border security, far less than the $5 billion Trump has said he wants for the wall   through Feb. 8 as talks continued.It would also include another measure to fund the departments of Agriculture, Interior, Housing and Urban Development and others closed by the partial shutdown. It would provide money through the remainder of the fiscal year, to Sept. 30.___Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

It s so heartbreaking. There is more trash and human waste and disregard for the rules than I ve seen in my four years living here,  Dakota Snider, 24, who works in California s Yosemite National Park, told The Associated Press.  It s a free-for-all. Some visitors were seen dumping bags of garbage from their cars at Yosemite. Two campgrounds and a redwood grove were closed because of  human waste issues and lack of staffing,  a park statement said. People were using the spots as open-air bathrooms after overused restrooms were closed, the Los Angeles Times reported. With restrooms closed, some visitors are opting to deposit their waste in natural areas adjacent to high traffic areas, which creates a health hazard for other visitors,  National Parks Service spokesman Andrew Munoz told the Times. The Trump administration initially kept most of the parks open, but there are only skeleton staffs during the shutdown to make certain visitors follow the rules from no littering to no hunting. At the same time, the number of visitors surged because there s no one to collect admission fees.Now areas and entire parks are being closed because of garbage, human waste   and snow. Arches and Canyonlands in Utah and other areas have been closed because there s no money for plowing. Utah had been paying to staff up all five of its national parks but will continue to staff only Zion in the new year, AP reported.Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado has locked its restrooms and trash bins  due to human waste issues, wildlife concerns and overall public health,  a notice on the park website said. Officials also closed the main roadways, which are covered with snow.A National Park Service notice posted at the top of each park s website now warns that even updates won t be available because of lack of staffing.John Garder, senior budget director of the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association, called the situation a  nightmare scenario  that could impact visitor safety   and significantly damage natural resources.So everybody keep in mind that 1) there are 417 National Park sites 2) 95% of the excrement will not be cleaned up 3) 5% will be cleaned up with a shovel and a bucket and 4) right now Forest Service gates are being ripped out of the ground and trees are being cut over for fun.At Joshua Tree in Southern California local residents and business people were stepping up to do what they could to keep restrooms clean and functioning, and hauling out trash, AP reported. Private park tour companies were doing similar work in Yellowstone.New York state is continuing to fund operations at the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, both federal sites, The Wall Street Journal reported."

Then, in the next tweet 11 minutes later, he attacked the Democrats for what he predicted will be their decision to allocate  NOTHING to border security, namely the Wall. MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL through the many billions of dollars a year that the U.S.A. is saving through the new Trade Deal, the USMCA, that will replace the horrendous NAFTA Trade Deal, which has so badly hurt our Country. Mexico & Canada will also thrive - good for all!The Democrats will probably submit a Bill, being cute as always, which gives everything away but gives NOTHING to Border Security, namely the Wall. You see, without the Wall there can be no Border Security - the Tech  stuff  is just, by comparison, meaningless bells & whistles...He followed up with a head-scratcher about  some things  that  NEVER get better and NEVER change,  adding,  You have Walls and you have Wheels. ...Remember this. Throughout the ages some things NEVER get better and NEVER change. You have Walls and you have Wheels. It was ALWAYS that way and it will ALWAYS be that way! Please explain to the Democrats that there can NEVER be a replacement for a good old fashioned WALL!Trump is now claiming that  savings  from an updated NAFTA agreement with Mexico will pay for the wall, but how that would work remains a mystery.Trump s contradictions and flip-flops are complicating any compromise that would end the partial shutdown of the government, which began Dec. 22.Outgoing chief of staff John Kelly told the Los Angeles Times in an interview last week that the idea of a concrete wall was dropped by the administration early in 2018 for a fence or another kind of barrier.  To be honest, it s not a wall,  Kelly said. Trump spoke of  beautiful steel slats,  rather than a wall, in mid-December. On the night Trump refused to sign a spending measure without funds for a wall, triggering the shutdown, he posted a video calling for a  wall or a slat fence or whatever you want to call it.  On Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C) said that the wall is simply a  metaphor  for border security, which would involve a  barrier where it makes sense. But Trump doubled down on his campaign-promised concrete wall on Monday, saying the idea of an  all-concrete wall  has  never been abandoned. An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound. I agree, totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing, slightly larger version!As for funding, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) made a point recently about that:THEN:Who is going to pay for the wall? Mexico. Mexico. Mexico.NOW:Who is going to pay for the wall? American taxpayers.And if I don t get $5 billion from them, I m going to shut down the government.President @realDonaldTrump, no temper tantrum is going to get you the wall. pic.twitter.com/pK7pXcYwzkMexico will pay for the wall - 100%!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYouhttps://t.co/pSFuPZz0xPDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Instead, he canceled his 16-day golfing vacation and spent the final day of 2018 at the White House, posting angry tweets about Democrats, who are refusing to agree to spend billions of taxpayer dollars for a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. I m in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall,  Trump wrote.What else Trump did at the White House on Monday, apart from watching television, is not readily apparent. The White House press office stopped disseminating his public schedule two weeks ago and did not respond to HuffPost queries about Trump s activities.Since the shutdown, Trump has been blaming Democrats. Nevertheless, it was the president himself who brought about the partial government shutdown by reneging on his agreement to sign a short-term spending bill to fund the quarter of the federal government that wasn t covered by earlier bills he had already signed into law.Trump reversed course after Fox News and radio talk show hosts ridiculed him for caving on his campaign promise to build a border wall. Trump insisted the new spending plan include $5 billion for the wall   even though he had promised hundreds of times during his campaign that his  great, great  wall would not cost Americans anything because he would force Mexico to pay for it.That left some 800,000 federal government employees in paycheck limbo. About half were furloughed when funding for their agencies ran out at midnight Dec. 21; the other half were deemed  essential  and forced to work anyway. None will receive another paycheck until Trump has signed a bill resuming funding.When that might take place is unclear. Trump has vowed he will not accept any measure that does not include billions for his wall   although the precise nature of that wall is now unknown   while Democrats say they are not interested in spending U.S. taxpayer money on a project Trump had promised he would make Mexico finance.Republicans still control both the House and Senate, but Trump has focused his attacks on Democrats. Because Republicans only have 51 seats in the Senate, they need at least nine Democratic senators to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to pass legislation in that chamber.The Democrats  position only gets stronger on Thursday, when California Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi is set to become the next speaker after her party picked up 40 seats and control of the House in the November midterm elections.Her plan is to pass a spending package of bills that already cleared the Senate appropriations committee to provide full-year funding for most of the affected agencies, and also a two-month extension for the Department of Homeland Security. The idea of a short-term extension for all of the unfunded agencies was considered so uncontroversial that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell brought it to the floor for a voice vote, where it passed unanimously on Dec. 19.Those votes of approval from Senate Republicans, though, will carry no weight with McConnell now, a top aide said Monday.  It s simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won t sign,  said Don Stewart.Should McConnell refuse to take up those bills after the Democratic House passes them, that will prove he is merely a rubber stamp for Trump and his whims, Democrats said. Then they are complicit with President Trump in continuing the Trump shutdown and in holding the health and safety of the American people and workers  paychecks hostage over the wall,  Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The union said withholding the pay of workers who continue to clock in during the shutdown runs afoul of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Great Depression-era law establishing a minimum wage and overtime pay. This is not an acceptable way for any employer, let alone the U.S. government, to treat its employees,  Heidi Burakiewicz, a lawyer representing the workers, said in a statement.  These employees still need to pay childcare expenses, buy gas, and incur other expenses to go to work every day and yet, they are not getting paid. It is a blatant violation. Some 380,000 federal employees have been furloughed during the shutdown, meaning they are out of a job until lawmakers reach a funding agreement. But another 420,000 are continuing to work in  essential  capacities such as in law enforcement, but are not being paid.After previous shutdowns, Congress has passed legislation to retroactively pay furloughed employees and those who worked through the closures. But in the meantime, all those workers have bills to pay. Those who don t have deep enough savings will face some hard choices if the shutdown continues to grind on.AFGE previously sued the government under the same claims after the 2013 shutdown, which lasted 16 days. A judge later ruled that around 25,000 workers were owed double pay due to damages.Unlike that earlier shutdown, the ongoing one affects only about one-quarter of federal functions, as Congress has already appropriated money for the rest. One of the main agencies hit by this shutdown is the Department of Homeland Security. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include transportation security officers, border patrol agents and correctional officers, among others who are continuing to work. J. David Cox, the president of AFGE, said in a statement that such workers  deserve the decency of knowing when their next paycheck is coming.  Cox added that the intent of the lawsuit was  to force the government and the administration to make all federal employees whole. The shutdown began on Dec. 22, after President Donald Trump demanded more than $5 billion for a wall along the southern U.S. border, which he originally said Mexico was going to pay for. Democrats take over as the new House majority on Thursday, giving the party a stronger hand in the standoff. Democratic lawmakers said they will unveil a plan to reopen the government immediately, although House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the incoming speaker, has said the party will not acquiesce to Trump s demand for the wall money.

Although Trump has said that federal workers want him to hold out in shutdown negotiations until he gets his way, the TSA employees who talked with HuffPost had a very different message. While Congress and Mr. Trump get to stay home, enjoy their personal time with their families, and still get paid, we have to struggle and suffer,  a Transportation Security Officer told HuffPost in an email. The officer, a single mother, now worries how she ll take care of her kids if the shutdown drags on. Most of us live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford to be unpaid and still go to work for long. It is not fair,  she said.A prolonged shutdown could mean missed rent or mortgage payments, no gas money to get to airports and pressure to look for a new job or take on extra work, TSA employees said. The fact this is the third shutdown in under a year adds to the frustration. Several workers criticized the government for playing politics with people s lives. To say morale is low is an understatement. People on both sides of the political argument are infuriated at this,  another TSA officer said.  We feel completely and utterly unappreciated. For some employees, the treatment of the TSA reinforced the feeling that the agency is the  bastard stepchild  of the federal government. TSA employees, for instance, are not part of the same General Schedule salary system as other federal workers that gives clearly defined grades of pay and steps for advancement <U+2015> annual pay for TSA officers starts at around $25,000 to $30,000 a year. Several employees brought up the possibility that a long shutdown would lead to departures, either out of necessity or from growing discontent at the job.   The turnover rate of employees is very high in this agency and for good reason, as it is easy to lose our sense of purpose when we are being shit on from all sides,  one officer said. Other employees worried that they d face backlash from management if they called out of work during the shutdown, even if it was because they couldn t afford the transportation costs of getting to and from the airport. I know that may sound unreasonable but with our management it s very predictable,  a TSA officer said about facing disciplinary action if workers took time off.Federal employees are expected to receive back pay once the government reopens, but with no fixed date and bills to pay in the meantime it is little comfort for workers who are currently on the job without compensation. The shutdown, which is now in its 10th day, is almost certain to stretch into the new year. The White House and top Democrats are at an impasse over Trump s demand for money to build his border wall with Mexico <U+2015> one of his best known campaign promises, which he claimed Mexico would pay for. Neither side appears ready to compromise, and the Democrats are set to take control of the House when Congress reconvenes this week.The effects of the shutdown will become increasingly apparent if no deal is reached. Major tourist attractions and cultural institutions such as the Smithsonian and National Zoo will stop running this week, while many national parks are closed. But if empty museums and service stations are the most visible signs of the shutdown, workers say they re the ones who are facing the worst of the crisis. There s very little attention on the people affected,  said one TSA employee.  Yeah, offices are closed, parks are closed, but there s a bunch of us, a bunch of people.

What Donald Trump and the Republicans want to do is waste $5 billion in taxpayer money on an ineffective, medieval border wall that is a 5th-century solution to a 21st-century problem,  Jeffries said. Yes, we need comprehensive immigration reform. Yes, we need to enhance border security,  he added.  But we are not willing to pay $2.5 billion or $5 billion in wasting taxpayer dollars on a ransom note because Donald Trump decided that he was going to shut down the government and hold the American people hostage.

It was ultimately made possible by Congress, which never passed a pay hike before the end of the year. The GOP-controlled Senate had signed off on a bipartisan 1.9 percent increase, but the GOP-controlled House left it unaddressed.If Trump had done nothing, the federal pay formula would have enacted an automatic 2.1 percent pay increase. But the inaction by Congress gave him an opening to make the increase zero through executive order.It s likely that the House will agree to a pay raise after Democrats take over as the majority on Jan. 3. Federal employee unions will press for any raise to be retroactive to the first of the year if an increase gets passed.Groups representing federal employees said Trump s freeze comes as added insult to the shutdown. Roughly one-fourth of the federal government is not funded at the moment, as the president demands $5 billion in federal funds for a wall along the southern border that he used to say Mexico was going to pay for.Roughly 420,000 federal employees are working without pay, and another 380,000 have been furloughed and are temporarily out of a job. Although lawmakers have typically approved backpay retroactively after previous shutdowns, there is no guarantee a divided Congress would do so this time.NARFE, a group representing current and retired federal workers, said the implementation of the pay freeze is another sign of Trump s  disdain  for government employees. Refusing to provide a nominal raise for our nation s hardworking federal employees amid a partial government shutdown shows clear contempt for those who carry out public service,  Ken Thomas, the group s president, said in a statement.Tony Reardon, the president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal workers, said Trump was  pouring salt into the wound  while workers go without paychecks. As HuffPost reported Thursday, the partial shutdown is just the latest chapter in Trump s long-running battle with civil servants who do the government s work. In addition to the pay freeze, his administration has also tried to peel back collective bargaining rights and increase workers  pension contributions. Many workers and their representatives bristle at middle-class government employees being lumped in with the  swamp  that Trump said needs draining. It s almost as if we have an administration that is at war with its own workforce,  one union official told HuffPost earlier this week.  It s been an ongoing assault.  Trump has warned that the shutdown could drag on  for a very long time<U+2033> if he doesn t get the wall money he wants. Democrats have said they will produce a bill to reopen the government as soon as they take over the House next week, but so far they have shown few signs of acquiescing to the president s demands.Members of the military are not subject to the pay freeze.

Trump s reaction came four days after an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy with the flu died in government custody after surrendering to immigration authorities at the border with his father. He was the second child to die in government custody this month, following 7-year-old Jakelin Caal from Guatemala, who died on Dec. 8. Prior to the deaths, no child had died in Customs and Border Patrol custody for more than a decade, according to CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan. Over the past two years, the Trump administration has strived to crack down on asylum-seekers at the border. Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. They can t,  Trump wrote Saturday afternoon.He added:  If we had a Wall, they wouldn t even try! Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. They can t. If we had a Wall, they wouldn t even try! The two........children in question were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol. The father of the young girl said it was not their fault, he hadn t given her water in days. Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard & getting so little credit!Trump also falsely claimed that the deceased 7-year-old s father  said it was not their fault,  referring to immigration authorities. While the U.S. Department of Homeland Security says the father told them he had not been able to give his daughter food or water for  days,  the family has called for an  objective and thorough investigation  into the incident. The father also said the girl was healthy before arriving in the U.S.The president s comments are in line with his administration s prior statements denying any culpability for children who die in U.S. custody. Does the administration take responsibility for a parent taking a child on a trek through Mexico to get to this country? No,  White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said earlier this month. Trump echoed that sentiment on Saturday, claiming that his proposed border wall would deter migrants from impoverished Central American countries from seeking asylum in the U.S.However, most of the people living in the U.S. illegally do so by simply overstaying legally obtained visas, the Center for Migration studies reported last year. The massive infrastructure project s would-be effectiveness is debated.Trump has not yet backed down from his fight to secure funding for the wall, which led to a partial government shutdown that started last week and will almost certainly extend into the new year.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the day Trump made his statements as Sunday.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) is leaving Congress in the coming days, but he isn t yet crossing a presidential run off his list of possibilities. In a CNN interview Friday, the politico initially beat around the bush when prompted by the network s Jim Acosta to say whether he d launch a 2020 campaign. You know, there are others that seem more willing than I am,  Flake said.  I ve been doing this for 18 years now. It s nice to look forward to a little break, but somebody does need to challenge the president. That s when Acosta doubled down on his question, pushing the senator to offer more of an answer on his future plans. Like I said, I haven t ruled it out,  Flake said.  I m a long way from there, but somebody needs to and I think that the country needs to be reminded of what it means to be conservative, certainly on the Republican side, and what it means to be decent as well, because we need a lot more of that in our politics. While Flake has parted with President Donald Trump over his rhetoric and behavior, he s maintained a staunchly conservative voting record, and appears to be in search of a candidate who will restore tradition to the GOP.Calling for civility in Washington, Flake said  both parties need to be rational and sane and try to govern rather than simply put forward the politics of resentment and anger. If the right can t work out its image issues, Flake warned, the party could be  on its way out  without the realization that it needs to expand its appeal beyond its base.  Flake, who has had an openly tumultuous relationship with Trump, criticized him for blaming Democrats for the federal government shutdown, which has now entered its eighth day as Congress remains in a standoff over a spending bill including money to build a border wall. Anytime you stand and say  I own the shutdown,  then you own it,  he told Acosta, adding,  Shutdown 101  tells you  shift the blame if you can.  And when the president immediately said,  I ll take the blame,  then he s got it.  Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve!Revisiting footage of Trump s Dec. 11 vow to take responsibility for a shutdown, Lemon reminded viewers that  the president owns  it  and the blame is all his,  despite his current argument that Democrats are at fault. While it s possible the government may not be fully operating again until January when the House flips to Democratic control, Lemon warned that s when the GOP  really should be worried  since the left will gain  control of all the powerful committees that have been toothless under Republicans.  The anchor pointed to new job postings from Democrats seeking staff from investigators to lawyers who may be tasked with looking into the president as part of a Congressional inquiry.

The Secret Service often uses tents for security checks and safe spots for VIPs.A Grimes employee told Quartz:  We are providing tents for the Mar-a-Lago New Year s Eve party, yes.  We are paying for security for the Mar-a-Lago New Year s Eve party during the Trump shutdown. Secret Service can continue providing essential security during a lapse of appropriations, but it s Trump who decides that govt officials need to be at his for-profit event. Shameless! https://t.co/gGDkpL3A5XThe Secret Service also paid $41,000 on Dec. 19 to BSE Performance for  Generators and light towers rental for MAL.  But it wasn t clear if this expenditure was just for the party. Trump gave up his planned Christmas holiday at Mar-a-Lago and stayed at the White House because of the government shutdown. Mick Mulvaney, soon to be the president s acting chief of staff, said Friday on  Fox & Friends  that Trump had  canceled his plans for New Year s  at Mar-a-Lago. However, there s still time for the president to change his mind. But Trump must weigh pleasing his dues-paying golf club members against the  optics  of a lush fete as federal workers are furloughed or work without pay. The Secret Service is among the agencies whose funding ran out at midnight Dec. 21.Last year, the Secret Service spent over $26,000 to rent lights, generators, tables and tents for the New Year s party at Mar-a-Lago, according to Newsweek. Non-members of the resort are paying $1,000 to attend this year s party at Mar-a-Lago, and members are paying $650. The fee to join the club jumped from $100,000 to $200,000 after Trump became president.Quartz reported last month that the Secret Service has spent a total of about $400,000 for golf cart rentals to guard the president as he golfs.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

So it came up with some suggestions and aids   including a sample letter in which employees offer to do chores in exchange for rent. Otherwise,  consult with your personal attorney  for legal advice, the office urged, presumably about possible credit problems. The tone-deaf move was skewered on social media.The OPM advice was sent Thursday in a tweet that included three  sample letters  employees could send to landlords, mortgage companies and other creditors explaining why they might be having a difficult time paying their bills just now   and offering to stretch out payments over time.In the letter intended for landlords, workers offer to trade handyman chores   including  painting and carpentry work    in exchange for some of the rent owed.  I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments,  stated the sample letter sent by OPM.After that advice was bashed on social media, the landlord letter vanished from the OPM s three sample letters initially attached to its tweet and downloaded by Mother Jones magazine.Feds, here are sample letters you may use as a guide when working with your creditors during this furlough.  If you need legal advice please consult with your personal attorney. https://t.co/t6h6OzALsSThat, however, did not stop the scorn that was heaped on the OPM for suggesting workers who can t pay their rent could somehow afford a  personal attorney. One Twitter comment encouraged Congress and President Donald Trump to do their job so about 800,000 federal workers could do theirs   and get paid. Congress will continue to be paid throughout the shutdown.Trump has refused to sign a temporary spending measure until it includes billions of dollars for his border wall.For the uninitiated, it may help to know that  consult with your personal attorney  is Washington-speak for  Merry Christmas, ya filthy animal  and  sample letter  is what they used to call a Trump University diploma   oh, and the Trump-appointed Director of OPM lasted 7 months. https://t.co/0OSzRLRQTeFor those who think no federal workers live paycheck-to-paycheck, the US Office of Personnel Management has sent furloughed federal workers sample letters to use with their creditors and landlords when they can t make payments because they are not getting paid.

For any normal president, travel to Mar-a-Lago would be completely out of the question,  said Norm Eisen, who was a White House ethics lawyer under President Barack Obama and is now chairman of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.  But then, any normal president would not be operating a for-profit resort to benefit himself, selling memberships at that resort to those with special interests before his White House and then squeezing extra money out of those people for a New Year s Eve party. Whether Trump winds up going to Florida is not known and perhaps   given his track record   not knowable until the party is underway. First lady Melania Trump flew to Palm Beach via Air Force jet Thursday, and his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, both White House advisers, were spotted there earlier in the week.Donald Trump s incoming chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told Fox News on Friday morning that the president would remain in Washington.  He s canceled his plans for Christmas. Now he s canceled his plans for New Year s,  Mulvaney said.At the same time, though, Mulvaney and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the shutdown is continuing into its second week only because House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi would endanger her expected return to the speakership if she cut a deal with Trump before that election on Jan. 3. Nancy Pelosi is only looking to protect her speakership, and not protect our borders,  Sanders told CBS News.That coordinated messaging could be laying the groundwork for Trump s eventual travel to Mar-a-Lago in time to attend his party, with the rationale that he can just as effectively wait for Pelosi to become speaker in Florida as he can in Washington. We shouldn t be amazed by anything,  said Eisen, whose group is suing to get access to Mar-a-Lago s visitor logs.  One thing we have learned from Trump is that he defies the conventional wisdom even when it s completely self-destructive. Pelosi s office, meanwhile, ridiculed the White House s attempt to blame her.  Democrats are united against the president s immoral, ineffective and expensive wall   the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for,  said Pelosi aide Drew Hammill.  Democrats have made it clear that, given that the president has changed his position so many times, we would not consider any offers from the White House that the president has not publicly endorsed. While we await the president s public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One.  The U.S. Secret Service is among the agencies whose funding ran out at midnight Dec. 21. About a quarter of the federal government is in that category, affecting some 800,000 employees in all   half of whom were furloughed, while the other half, deemed essential, must work anyway. Neither group will see another paycheck until Trump has signed legislation that resumes funding.Those without enough savings on hand will be forced to borrow to pay the bills in the meantime. Trump s Office of Personnel Management, in fact, issued some pointers to employees facing trouble, such as performing maintenance chores  in exchange for partial rent payments. Trump promised during his campaign that he would remove himself from his family business if he was elected, but reneged on that before he took office. He continues to personally profit from the hotels and golf courses he owns, including ones he frequents in Bedminster, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C.Mar-a-Lago, his bayfront resort in Palm Beach, doubled its initiation fee from $100,000 to $200,000 after his election. Annual dues will rise about $1,000 next year, to $16,000, according to a report in The Palm Beach Post.Tickets to his members-and-guests-only New Year s Eve party have also gotten much pricier. In 2016 they were $525 each for members and $575 for their guests. Those prices jumped to $600 and $750 last year, and $650 and $1,000 for Monday night s party. And those amounts do not include a mandatory 20 percent gratuity and 7 percent sales tax.The Secret Service has already spent $54,020 renting tents for use at the party, according to a report in Quartz. They are typically used as shelters where agents can screen guests before they enter the grounds.At a similar party at the resort early in Trump s presidency, a guest photographed and posted to social media the aide who accompanies Trump and carries codes for nuclear war plans as well as a dinner table meeting of Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the time North Korea had just test-fired a missile.The White House later claimed that no classified information was discussed at the meeting.Trump s White House had indicated he would sign a short-term spending bill to keep the government open through Feb. 8. But he changed his mind after Fox News and talk radio hosts criticized him for caving on his campaign promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.In reality, Trump had claimed many hundreds of times that he would force Mexico to pay for such a wall, but he abandoned that part of the promise almost immediately upon taking office. He persuaded House leaders last week to insert $5.7 billion in unspecified border security money into the short-term spending extension that the Senate had already passed unanimously. But not even a majority of the Senate voted for the revised version of that bill, let alone the 60 it would need for passage.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) told  Fox & Friends  on Friday that he thinks the government shutdown should continue  until hell freezes over  if funding doesn t come through for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. So, Congressman, how long should the president keep the government closed?  co-host Griff Jenkins asked Gohmert, who is famous for his eyebrow-raising remarks.  Because we keep seeing people losing their lives without [a wall], you do it till hell freezes over,  the lawmaker answered, after noting that only about 25 percent of the federal government is closed. Before the shutdown, 75 percent of the government had already been funded until September 2019. Until hell freezes over,  Gohmert continued.  Because we owe it to our country. He also suggested that a wall would somehow be beneficial to nations south of the U.S. border.  And the best thing we could do compassionately for Mexico and Central America is not give them money that ends up in the hands of drug cartels,  the congressman said.  It s to secure the border so the drugs quit coming and we don t lose 70,000 more lives a year and Mexico becomes the top 10 economy because we get out the corruption. That s compassion. As of Friday, the partial shutdown had lasted for seven days with no immediate end in sight. The government is unlikely to fully reopen before the new Democratic-controlled Congress is sworn in next month. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has been trying to put the blame for the shutdown on the Democrats. We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve!  Trump tweeted on Friday morning.On Thursday, the president went so far as to say that the shutdown wasn t  about the Wall  but  only about the Dems not letting Donald Trump & the Republicans have a win.

The closures would begin on Jan. 2 and continue until lawmakers reach a deal to fund the government.Because the museums have so far remained open, many people assumed the Smithsonian Institution was among the roughly three-quarters of government functions that Congress had already appropriated money for before the partial shutdown began on Dec. 22. But Smithsonian spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas explained that it had been running on last year s funds to get through the week between Christmas and New Year s <U+2015> typically one of the busiest times of the year. The Smithsonian Institution receives its federal dollars through an appropriations bill that also funds the Interior Department, which is among the unfunded agencies. We used prior-year funding, and we can t continue to do that,  St. Thomas said.  I think it was a great service to tourists, but on Jan. 2 and beyond we will be closed  until a deal is reached.A closure of the Smithsonian would be just one way that everyday Americans will feel the effects of the shutdown, even if they don t work for the federal government. The shuttered properties would include the American History Museum, the Air and Space Museum, the African American Museum and the Portrait Gallery, as well as more than a dozen others.  President Donald Trump has said the shutdown will continue until lawmakers agree to provide $5 billion for a wall along the southern border that he originally said Mexico would pay for. House Republicans have said they have no plans to hold a vote before the new year, leaving the shutdown with no end in sight. An agreement that meets Trump s full demands is even less likely after Jan. 3, when Democrats take over as the House majority.The shutdown has left 420,000 federal employees working without pay, and another 380,000 furloughed without a job. It will require an act of Congress to retroactively pay those workers once the government reopens. There is no guarantee that will happen, although it typically has in the past.St. Thomas said roughly two-thirds of the Smithsonian s employees are federal workers; the rest are paid through the Smithsonian trust. If the museums and zoo are forced to close, only certain workers like security and building maintenance personnel will remain on the job.Many workers would be unlucky enough to lose their wages even if Congress approves backpay after the shutdown ends. That s because they work for an outside contractor rather than the federal government. According to St. Thomas, the museum shops are run by the Smithsonian, but cafeteria workers are employed by an outside company called Restaurant Associates.If the 2013 government shutdown is any indication, those workers may end up having to apply for unemployment insurance if the shutdown persists, as any day not working is a day without pay. A company spokesman declined to comment when asked how many Restaurant Associates employees would be affected by a shutdown.Even though the zoo would be closed, St. Thomas said veterinarians and other workers who feed and care for the animals there would still be on duty throughout a shutdown.  The minute there s funding, we open,  she said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story mistakenly indicated the Smithsonian is receives its funding through the Department of Interior. "

To Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats:No Wall Money, No Deal.The South Carolina senator s tweet on Friday comes amid Day 7 of the partial government shutdown due to the problems surrounding the wall s funding.Graham has previously said that the shutdown was a necessary measure in order to convince Democrats to offer more funding for the wall. Previously Democrats were negotiating with the administration over an offer less than the more than $5 billion Trump wants for the project.The White House brought an offer between Trump s $5.7 billion and $1.3 billion to the Democrats over the weekend, leaving Sens. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and Pelosi, the Democratic leaders of Congress, to issue a statement saying it s Trump s fault for  plunging the country into chaos  and  The president wanted the shutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it. Incoming acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told The Associated Press that  there s not a single Democrat talking to the president of the United States about this deal  and pinned specific blame on Pelosi. My gut was that [Schumer] was really interested in doing a deal and coming to some sort of compromise. But the more we re hearing this week is that it s Nancy Pelosi who s preventing that from happening,  said Mulvaney. Graham previously lambasted Schumer and how he feels the Democrats are to blame for the shutdown last week in a Fox News with Jeanine Pirro, where he accused them of waging  a silly, petty fight.

If you say,  Who gets fired?  it always has to be the top,  Trump said on an episode of  Fox & Friends  that aired in September 2013. I mean, problems start from the top and they have to get solved from the top. The president s the leader. He s to get everyone in a room and he s got to lead,  Trump said in the clip.Lemon aired the clip on Thursday night and deadpanned,  Starts from the top. If anyone should get fired, the president. Hm.  Donald Trump suggesting that President Barack Obama should have been fired for a government shutdown. Priceless,  Lemon added before the end of the segment.As we continue into Day 7 of the government s partial shutdown with no end in sight, arguments over who will fund Trump s desired border wall between the United States and Mexico continue.The impasse comes from a spending bill with $5.7 billion tacked on for Trump s border wall that passed in the House, but is unlikely to pass in the Senate, which is adjourned until Monday. Sixty votes are needed for the bill to pass, and there are only 51 Republicans. Trump blames the Democrats, who oppose the money for the wall, for the shutdown, claiming:  It s really the Democrat shutdown. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement on Thursday that Trump and his team  stayed in Washington over Christmas hoping to negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border, protect American communities, and re-open the government. The Democrats decided to go home. Additionally, the shutdown has left hundreds of thousands of federal employees without pay (and many still working) during the holiday season. As if that wasn t bad enough, many of those workers, who are contractors, won t even see retroactive pay.Lemon addressing the irony of Trump calling for Obama to be fired during a 2013 shutdown when all he can do is blame the Democrats during his own has been something of a trend for the CNN host this month.Last week, Lemon aired old footage Trump bragging about his vast knowledge of campaign finance. I think nobody knows more about campaign finance than I do because I m the biggest contributor,  Trump said to then-late-night TV host Larry King in the clip from 1999.Lemon quipped that despite Trump claiming he  knows plenty about campaign finance,  there s  always a tape or a tweet for everything,  a nod to the legal issues Trump s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, is embroiled in.Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to numerous criminal charges   including violating campaign finance laws, which he says was done at Trump s request.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told federal employees in a Thursday email that the agency would begin shutdown procedures, including steps for furloughed employees, if negotiations over the spending bill remained at a standstill by the end of Friday. In the event an appropriation is not passed by midnight Friday, December 28th, EPA will initiate orderly shutdown procedures,  Wheeler wrote in the email obtained by The Hill and Bloomberg Environment. The EPA did not immediately return HuffPost s request for comment.Employees who receive notification of their furlough status will need to update their voicemail and emails with out-of-office messages and will be barred from any work-related travel, according to Wheeler.EPA begins preparing for an extended shutdown. The agency initially had enough money to stay funded until tomorrow at midnight. pic.twitter.com/cb5cImkwpGWhile the government officially shut down on Dec. 21, the EPA was able to continue operating because it had saved enough federal funds to carry over into the following week. Wheeler s latest message to employees indicates that those funds are now running out. More than 700 EPA employees who are considered essential will be forced to work without pay during the shutdown, while the remaining  non-essential  workers, who number over 13,000, will be furloughed, according to the agency s shutdown contingency plan. According to the EPA s plan, senior officials have to determine what work must continue during the shutdown or risk an imminent threat to public health, human safety or property. The shutdown could potentially affect the EPA s efforts to clean Superfund sites, where hazardous waste is contaminating land. In the contingency plan, signed last week, the agency announced that it would evaluate 800 contaminated Superfund sites to determine which ones pose the worst public health threats should a shutdown halt cleanup efforts.Also affected are inspections for drinking water systems, hazardous waste management sites and chemical facilities, along with pesticide reviews. In total, about 400,000 federal employees are expected to be affected by the partial government shutdown.On Thursday, the House and Senate reconvened briefly and adjourned with few lawmakers in attendance. With no vote on the spending bill scheduled, the government shutdown is likely to extend into January, when Democrats take control of the House. "

Erwin, whose union represents 110,000 federal workers, particularly took issue with Trump s tweet on Thursday saying that more Democrats than Republicans were not getting paid during the shutdown.Funding for nine federal departments and several agencies with hundreds of thousands of workers expired at midnight Friday, and those employees will not be paid until more funding is allocated. It s ridiculous,  Erwin said in an interview on CNN.  It d be funny if it wasn t really funny at all. We know the political makeup of federal employees. They are split evenly down political lines ... equal Republicans and Democrats and a significant number of independents as well. He added that  any notion that you can slice and dice and furlough the Democrats and not the Republicans is just preposterous and comical. It just shows that he doesn t understand the federal workforce very well or he wouldn t say things like that. Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs, Human Trafficking,Gang Members & Criminals from coming into our Country. Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?Erwin said 85 percent of federal employees work outside the Washington area, across the nation  in every community.  He also noted that close to a third of federal workers are military veterans and that the federal government is the largest employer of veterans. So he s out there saying he s proud to shut the government down. These are the people he s hurting. It s just unbelievable the things that he s saying right now,  said Erwin.  These workers are really hurt. Their pay has been shut off, and they don t know how long it s going to last. It s unclear when the shutdown will end. Trump has vowed not to sign any temporary spending measure that doesn t include billions of dollars for his border wall.Check out Erwin s interview in the clip above.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But another group of workers has also been hit hard and, unlike federal workers, may never see retroactive pay: government contractors.  Many government contractors <U+2015> from food workers and janitors to security services and computer software developers <U+2015> depend on federal funds for their wages. Since the shutdown, some have seen their jobs furloughed or have received  stop work orders,  meaning they re out of work until the government is up and running again. And while federal employees, who may or may not have to work during the shutdown, will likely later get back pay for this period, government contractors in all likelihood will not.  Starting yesterday, I was expected to go back to work, but, of course, I couldn t,  said 47-year-old Misty Carrothers, a paralegal on a government contract with the Department of Justice. Her last day of work was Friday, due to the shutdown, which started that midnight.  My last paycheck covers the first-of-the-month bills, which are the big ones: rent and car insurance. But then you have credit cards that come in the middle of the month, and my health insurance may or may not be fully covered on my next paycheck,  she said, noting that her husband is a student who works only part time.  It s just like, when is this going to end?  Other contractors took to Twitter to share their struggles under the hashtag #ShutdownStories, recounting their concerns about being out of work over the holidays and how they ll get by.Yes, please!  As a govt contractor, I will get NO PAY for any days that this shutdown goes on.  I am a single mom in panic mode.  Picking up extra shifts at my 2nd job but it won t pay the rent!  #ShutdownStoriesI am a federal contractor. I get no back pay so im losing 100% of my wages. I m the sole provider and we have toddler and a baby. I often work long hrs that I don t bill b/c I believe in the mission. Can t begin to express the anger and frustration... Xmas ruined!#ShutdownStories#ShutdownStories There are so many Government Contractors that are not getting paid and unlike Federal employees we do not get retro pay when the shutdown is over... That income is just gone forever.@ABCPolitics @CBSNews @NBCPolitics @CNNPolitics How many Federal CONTRACTORS are out of work? I m sitting @ home since the shutdown & the news only mentions Federal workers, what about us? Don t we count? #ShutdownStoriesUnder this shutdown, some government agencies, such as the Department of Defense, have not been affected, as they were previously funded, but many agencies are. Federal employees considered  non-essential  at affected departments have been furloughed, while  essential  ones <U+2015> including thousands of workers at the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and members of the Coast Guard <U+2015> are required to work without pay until the shutdown ends.  In previous government shutdowns, federal employee salaries were suspended, but lawmakers later proposed that they get paid retroactively, even if they weren t working. But that hasn t applied to government contractors in the past, according to Susan Moser, a partner at the Cherry Bekaert accounting firm, which has clients who work under government contracts. You hear a lot in the paper about the government employees, and I m sympathetic to their uncertainty, but if history is any indicator, they do get paid, even if they didn t work <U+2015> but that s usually not the case with government contractors,  Moser said.  They are disproportionately affected. You don t hear a lot about these professionals who help make the government run. No one knows when the government will be up and running again. As of Thursday, President Donald Trump did not appear to be budging on his demands for funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and House members were reportedly told not to expect further votes this week, meaning the shutdown will likely stretch into next week and possibly the new year. Fear is probably the common denominator,  said Luke Chung, president of software company FMS Inc., which had a government contract with Amtrak. He said his employees  wages will not be disrupted because the contract is small and didn t require a dedicated staff team.  Business owners who have staff are making the decision: Do we pay people or not, even though we won t get paid by the government?  Chung said.  Either you force people to take vacation, or you pay them, to be a good company <U+2015> but depending how long it drags on, one may not have a choice.  Carrothers said she plans to apply for unemployment in the interim, but that will provide only 55 percent of her paycheck. Meanwhile, her husband has been debating whether to add full-time work to his class load.  We do have a little bit in savings to help out, but we kind of live paycheck to paycheck,  Carrothers added.  I don t expect lights to be turned off, but it s still like, really? The decades-long Democrat said her frustration was mostly directed  at the president, honestly <U+2015> he s the one calling the shots.

The spacecraft, which zipped by Jupiter in 2007 and Pluto in 2015, is now making its way toward 2014 MU69 <U+2015> a mysterious chunk of rock and ice in an almost entirely unexplored region of space.The object is nicknamed Ultima Thule    most distant  in Latin combined with the ancient Greeks  name for the world s northernmost place. The New Horizons mission team said the nickname refers to  a place beyond the known world.  Ultima Thule is roughly the size of New York City and orbits the sun once every 297 years, according to National Geographic.But it s Ultima Thule s location that makes it interesting to scientists. The object resides 1 billion miles beyond Pluto, in the Kuiper Belt. This region stretches around the sun and is home to millions of icy bodies. Scientists believe these bodies are leftovers from the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago and have remained largely unchanged since then.  It s the oldest relic of the solar system we ve ever studied,  New Horizons team member Marc Buie told National Geographic.Alan Stern, the NASA mission s principal investigator, said in a Facebook Live video that scientists aren t sure what to expect from Ultima Thule.  When we fly past Ultima, we re going to have a chance to see the way things were back at the beginning,  he said.  It s completely unknown and unexplored.  New Horizons launched into space in January 2006. Four years ago, astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to pinpoint Kuiper Belt objects within the spacecraft s reach and settled on Ultima Thule.New Horizons is hurtling through space at 31,500 miles per hour (more than eight miles a second) to reach the object. As it passes Ultima Thule, it will take hundreds of photographs and other measurements to collect more information about the celestial body. The team hopes to map the object s surface, figure out its temperature and determine if it has an atmosphere, moons or rings.According to a schedule released by the New Horizons team, the spacecraft will fly by Ultima Thule at 12:33 a.m. Eastern time on Jan. 1. It will travel within 2,200 miles of the body, less than one-third the distance of its closest approach to Pluto.There s still some uncertainty, though; New Horizons  images could come back blurred if Ultima Thule is rotating rapidly, National Geographic reports. And there s also a chance that the spacecraft s camera could miss it completely. We might get it, and we might not,  Stern said on Facebook Live.  And if we get it, it s going to be spectacular.  The New Horizons team will be counting down to the spacecraft s closest approach to Ultima Thule early on New Year s Day. Some results from the encounter will be shared in the following days, but it will take the spacecraft until 2020 to send all the data from the encounter back to Earth. Michael Buckley, the New Horizons team s media spokesperson, told HuffPost that the partial government shutdown that started Saturday will have no effect on the project s mission or science operations. In case the shutdown remains in effect on Jan. 1, the team has partnered with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory to provide live coverage of the flyby.Coverage will be streamed on the laboratory s YouTube channel and the New Horizons mission website.

Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border,  Trump wrote on the sixth day of the partial shuttering of about 25 percent of the federal government over his fight to fund a border wall. It was the first day that would have been a normal workday for most affected employees. Democrat s say they don t want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed), and they don t want ICE,  he wrote later.  They don t have much to campaign on, do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity! Trump has not spoken to the Democratic leader in either chamber of Congress in recent days. Discussions have continued at the staff level, but Democrats said the problem remains that Trump himself does not seem to know what exactly he wants. He does not appear to have a clear endgame in sight,  one senior Democratic aide said on condition of anonymity.Trump s White House had indicated he would sign a short-term spending bill to keep the government open through Feb. 8, but then Trump changed his mind after TV and radio hosts criticized him for caving on his campaign promise to build a wall along the Mexican border.Actually, Trump had claimed he would force Mexico to pay for such a wall, but he abandoned that part of the promise almost immediately upon taking office. He persuaded House leaders to insert $5.7 billion in unspecified border security money into the short-term spending extension that the Senate had already passed unanimously. But not even a majority of the Senate voted for the revised version of that bill last week, let alone the 60 votes it would need for passage.Both the House and Senate held brief procedural sessions Thursday, but almost no lawmakers were in town. Similar procedural sessions were set for Monday, New Year s Eve, but the most likely scenario seemed to be that the whole issue would be put off until Jan. 3, when the new Congress is seated with Democrats taking control of the House.Nine Cabinet agencies, including the departments of homeland security, justice, state and interior, ran out of funding at midnight Dec. 21, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees uncertain if they would get scheduled paychecks in mid-January.In a Dec. 11 Oval Office meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Trump said he would be  proud to shut down the government for border security  if Democrats refused to agree to billions of additional dollars for his wall. Ever since that point, though, Trump has reversed tactics and is blaming Democrats <U+2015> even taking that message to U.S. troops in Iraq. You re fighting for borders in other countries, and they don t want to fight <U+2015> the Democrats <U+2015> for the border of our country. It doesn t make a lot of sense,  Trump told service members Wednesday at Al-Asad Air Base on his first visit to a combat zone since taking office. The president turned his first visit to our troops into another cringe-worthy Donald Trump reality show special,  said Drew Hammill, a Pelosi aide.  With the House majority, Democrats will act swiftly to end the Trump shutdown and will fight for a strategic, robust national security policy, including strong and smart border security, and strong support for our service members and veterans. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump has already sacrificed to reach a deal to end the shutdown but that Democrats are uninterested.  The president and his team stayed in Washington over Christmas hoping to negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border, protect American communities and reopen the government,  Sanders said.  The president does not want the government to remain shut down, but he will not sign a proposal that does not first prioritize our county s safety and security. Trump had originally planned to fly down to his resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Dec. 21 after signing the short-term extension. The ongoing shutdown, though, could make it politically difficult for Trump to salvage even a portion of his planned 16-day golfing vacation.Among the agencies whose employees are either working as  essential  or have been furloughed is the Secret Service. If Trump chooses to go to Mar-a-Lago and his nearby golf course in West Palm Beach, he will create the public relations disaster the White House had hoped to avoid: Trump playing golf while the Secret Service protecting him don t know if they ll get their next paycheck.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?  the president taunted, reiterating his demand for billions of dollars in funding for a wall along the southern border.Anyone surprised to see the president drag the voting preferences of furloughed workers into this fight hasn t been paying much attention to Trump s relationship with those who do the government s work. He has been provoking federal workers since pretty much the day he assumed office <U+2015> whether it s threatening a pay freeze, trying to strip away job protections or equating civil servants with a bloated and corrupt  swamp. To those who advocate for federal employees, the shutdown is part of a larger pattern with the White House.  It s almost as if we have an administration that is at war with its own workforce,  said Jacque Simon, policy director at the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing 700,000 government workers.  It s been an ongoing assault on the economic interests of federal employees. Trump has warned that the government may be shut down  for a very long time  if Democrats don t sign off on $5 billion for a wall the president used to say Mexico would pay for. Trump hasn t found enough votes in Congress to break the stalemate, even though Republicans still control both the House and Senate. Democrats  hand will be stronger on Jan. 3, when they take over as the House majority.Roughly three quarters of the government s funding has already been appropriated by Congress, leaving only certain agencies closed for the shutdown. An estimated 420,000 federal employees are working without pay, and another 380,000 have been furloughed, meaning they are out of work for the duration. It would require an act of Congress to retroactively pay both groups of workers once the government reopens, as lawmakers have typically done in the past.But backpay is no guarantee with a divided Congress. Meanwhile, depending on how long the shutdown lasts, workers without sufficient savings may be forced to take out short-term loans, search for part-time jobs or apply for unemployment insurance to tide them over until work resumes. (Many federal contractors, who are not direct employees of the government, will never recoup the wages they missed due to agencies shuttering temporarily.)Simon said some of the union s members who were slated to be furloughed were called into work the day after Christmas in order to help wind down agency functions for the shutdown.  With this administration, nothing is orderly. They certainly are making it up as they go,  she said.If Trump seems cavalier about the disruption, perhaps it s because sticking it to federal workers has been central to his politics.In his State of the Union address this year, Trump said he wanted to try to make it easier for federal agencies to fire employees, a move some ethics watchdogs said would politicize agency work. His administration later made good on the threat, issuing a batch of executive orders aimed at peeling back job protections for civil servants and weakening federal employee unions. In a major setback for Trump, a judge blocked those orders in August, ruling that the president cannot  eviscerate the right to bargain collectively  by federal workers.Days after that ruling, Trump announced in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) that he wanted to cancel a scheduled 2.1 percent pay raise for the federal workforce in fiscal year 2019. The president said he wanted to implement an  alternative  pay plan <U+2015> zero percent <U+2015> to keep the country on a  fiscally sustainable course. Trump cannot unilaterally block the raise without cooperation from Congress, and he later suggested he was reconsidering his position. But so far, lawmakers have not approved a pay hike for 2019. The administration has also floated the idea of paring back federal workers  retirement benefits. The White House s budget blueprint for 2018 proposed increasing employees  pension contributions and changing the formula to reduce retirees  annuity payments, among other cost-cutting measures. Those plans appear to be on hold for the time being. For all the proposed cuts to raises and benefits, Tony Reardon, the president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said he s bothered just as much by the  dismissive and disrespectful  stance he believes the White House holds toward federal workers. Even on the campaign trail, Trump called for abolishing entire federal agencies, declaring there was  tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse<U+2033> in the ranks of the federal government. Even coming into power this administration talked about emptying the  swamp,  as though frontline federal employees are somehow representative [of that],  said Reardon, whose union represents 150,000 workers in different agencies.He noted that federal employees tend to earn middle-class wages and are scattered all over the country, with the overwhelming majority living outside the Washington area.

Don t let this go unnoticed: the Violence Against Women Act, which helps survivors of domestic abuse and sexual assault, expired with the government shutdown,  Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) tweeted on Sunday, adding,  It s deeply concerning.  Actor and Me Too activist Alyssa Milano added her disappointment, tweeting:  What kind of country allows its Violence Against Women Act to expire? The landmark legislation, which protects domestic violence and sexual assault survivors, was set to expire on Sept. 30 and later on Dec. 7, but was given short-term extensions each time. Prior to the shutdown, both the House and Senate passed budget agreements that would cover the costs of VAWA programs through Feb. 8, 2019.The shutdown, however, which is affecting over 800,000 federal workers, forced VAWA to expire because the law s programs are funded under the Justice Department. The legislation s expiration does not affect all of its programs  operations, according to The Washington Post. Grants already awarded before the shutdown will not be affected, but future payments for anti-domestic and anti-sexual violence programs funded by VAWA will be cut off until the legislation is reauthorized.  The Violence Against Women Act <U+2015> which supports critical programs to help victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, and stalking <U+2015> expired at midnight. We could have funded it, but @realDonaldTrump would rather shut down the government for a wall that doesn t make us any safer,  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted on Saturday. The government shutdown has continued due to a larger budget debate about President Donald Trump s desired U.S.-Mexico border wall, which he campaigned on. Trump has recently asked for a $5 billion budget to build a concrete wall running along the southern border, but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) continue to balk at a number that high.VAWA, the first federal legislation to recognize and address domestic violence as a serious crime, was created with the help of then-Sen. Joe Biden (D) and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994. The legislation was reauthorized in 2000, 2005 and 2013 with bipartisan support.  VAWA has always been, and must always be, a bipartisan commitment to improve access to safety and justice, to prevent future violence, and to uphold the dignity and autonomy of all victims and survivors,  the National Task Force To End Sexual And Domestic Violence said in a statement published at the beginning of October, after the first short-term budget extension was awarded. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCDAV), 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men will experience intimate partner violence within their lifetime. One in 3 women and 1 in 6 men will be victims of sexual violence in their lifetime in the United States, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC). In September, 46 House Republicans sent a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), urging leadership to reauthorize VAWA before it was set to expire on Sept. 30. Pelosi also wrote a letter to Ryan criticizing his and other House Republicans  inaction on the legislation. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

From shopping aisles to online carts, consumer confidence translated into holiday cheer for retail,  Steve Sadove, a MasterCard senior advisor, said in a statement.  By combining the right inventory with the right mix of online versus in-store, many retailers were able to give consumers what they wanted via the right shopping channels. U.S. retail s 2018 holiday season growth is the highest in 6 years https://t.co/Kzhx0hgJpH pic.twitter.com/drZvOpqqtwThe holiday sales spurt was unevenly distributed across different sectors in the industry. Apparel and home improvement saw significant growth (about 8 percent and 9 percent respectively), MasterCard said. And online shopping enjoyed a huge boost, growing 19 percent compared to 2017.E-commerce giant Amazon was a clear winner in the online space. The company took 81 percent of internet sales between Dec. 1 and Dec. 19 against other big-box retailers, CNBC reported citing Edison Trends data. Amazon announced on Wednesday that it had a  record-breaking  holiday season. The company didn t reveal revenue numbers or sales figures but said it had shipped more than 1 billion items for free in the United States with its Prime service over the holiday season and had sold millions of Amazon devices like the Echo and Fire TV Stick 4K.According to MasterCard, department stores experienced an overall decline of about 1.3 percent in holiday sales from 2017. Electronics and appliances also saw a sales dip of about 0.7 percent. While it was a very strong holiday season overall for retailers, some analysts warned that the retail surge may stall in 2019 as concerns continue to brew on Wall Street over a potentially slowing economy. Rising costs due to tariffs and other factors could also weigh down retailers, Neil Saunders of research firm GlobalData Retail told the Los Angeles Times this week.  The main question now is, can retailers keep this performance going as we move into 2019?  Saunders said.  Investors are very nervous about the prospects, which is why retail stocks have taken a bit of a beating. "

Our system has been pushed to a breaking point by those who seek open borders,  Nielsen said.  Smugglers, traffickers, and their own parents put these minors at risk by embarking on the dangerous and arduous journey north. Nielsen called on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as  partners in Mexico,  to investigate  an uptick in sick children crossing our borders.   She also requested that the U.S. Coast Guard medical corps assess CBP s medical programs to find areas of improvement, and she asked the Department of Defense for more medical professionals. Under Nielsen s orders, all immigrant children in CBP s custody will now receive  a more thorough hands-on assessment at the earliest possible time post-apprehension <U+2015> whether or not the accompanying adult has asked for one. During her trip to the border, Nielsen is scheduled to monitor medical screening procedures for detainees and observe the conditions at Border Patrol stations.Nielsen s requests come amid a government shutdown that has forced some Border Patrol agents and an estimated 44,000 active duty Coast Guard members to work without pay over the holiday week, the Los Angeles Times reported.According to recent reports, CBP has seen a surge of detained immigrants who are sick. Senior administration officials told The Washington Post that  dozens  of immigrants have been taken to hospitals near the border with flu-like symptoms. This crisis is exacerbated by the increase in persons who are entering our custody suffering from severe respiratory illnesses or exhibit some other illness upon apprehension,  Nielsen said Wednesday.  Given the remote locations of their illegal crossing and the lack of resources, it is even more difficult for our personnel to be first responders. Nielsen s announcement was issued more than a day after Alonzo, who had been detained with his father since Dec. 18, died while in CBP custody. Alonzo is the second immigrant child to die while in detention this month. Two weeks earlier, Jakelin Caal, a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who survived a 2,000-mile journey to the U.S., died less than 48 hours after being detained by CBP at the border, along with 163 others. Caal died of shock and dehydration, according to The Washington Post.At the time, Nielsen blamed Caal s family for the 7-year-old s death, insisting that the migrant group shouldn t have tried to enter the U.S. You know, this is just a very sad example of the dangers of this journey,  Nielsen said on  Fox & Friends  on Dec. 14.  This family chose to cross illegally. While Nielsen prepares for her border trip, House Democrats are vowing to investigate Caal s and Alonzo s deaths. In a statement Wednesday, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) urged the Department of Homeland Security to provide Congress with  information the public deserves to know and to take action to prevent such tragedies from recurring. Nielsen suggested Wednesday that the recent deaths of the two detained immigrant children were rare, pointing out that the last child to die while in custody occurred  more than a decade  ago.  To put this in perspective, there were six migrant deaths in CBP custody during FY 2018 <U+2015> none whom were children,  Nielsen said.  It is now clear that migrants, particularly children, are increasingly facing medical challenges and harboring illness caused by their long and dangerous journey,  she added.But Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) challenged Nielsen s claim that no other migrant children have died in custody in the last decade. In a tweet, Castro called on Nielsen to appear in front of Congress and say under oath that none of the six migrants who died this year under CBP custody were children.Calling on @SecNielsen to tell Congress, under oath, that six migrant deaths occurred this fiscal year in @CBP custody, and that none were children. In just two weeks, we heard the tragedies of #JakelinCaal & #FelipeAlonzoGomez, both under 10 years old. https://t.co/IgG3Hr4ePU"

He also questioned a 7-year-old s belief in Santa Claus on Christmas Eve.No wonder some Twitter users suspected that  doing the right thing for the troops  was far down on Trump s list of reasons to make the trip to Iraq.After 3 days of terrible press he needed a huge distraction & this was it! Hope someone asked him why he committed fraud to dodge the draft while he was there! #CadetBoneSpurs #TrumpResignPresident Trump guilted into visiting troops in the field after seeing every other respected world leader do it on Christmas.   --fixed it for you.Took him almost two years to do what is expected of himY0ou mean he went all that way for a photo opportunity. He only went because of the negative press he was receiving for being the first @POTUS in almost 20 years to NOT visit troops at #ChristmasOthers suspected ulterior motives behind the visit.It s the only way he can be in palm beach for New YearsATTENTION JOURNALISTS:If Trump is secretly en route to visit troops, ask if he will be returning to DC or FL. The trip will be cover to get to Mar-a-Lago NYE party where tickets were sold guaranteeing access to the president.

Democrats in Congress, however, fare substantially less badly than their GOP equivalents <U+2015> a shift from the shutdown this January, after which the ratings were more evenly distributed.Americans disapprove of the handling of the shutdown by Congress as a whole (by a 33-point margin), congressional Republicans (29 points), President Trump (14 points) and congressional Democrats (9 points). Members of Congress fare better with their constituents: Americans are split 35/37 in approving or disapproving of their own representatives  performance.Pundits often seem to envision public opinions in the wake of shutdowns as a zero-sum game, in which the public assigns blame to one side and absolves the other. Survey questions asked about such battles often lend themselves to such frames as well.But the reality of how Americans think about the shutdowns isn t necessarily so clear-cut. Partisans tend to heap condemnation on their opponents, but aren t necessarily ecstatic about their own side s decisions. Other people, especially if they follow politics only casually, may be more likely to write the whole thing off as Washington dysfunction. (To get a better sense of how people view the shutdown, we also asked survey respondents to explain in their own words what was happening. You can see some of their responses at the end of the article.)Even when shutdowns appear politically damaging, the effects can be short-lived. In 2013, Republicans saw their numbers plunge historically following a shutdown. But within months, the opprobrium wore off, leaving the GOP to go on to a sweeping victory in the following year s midterms.In the newest survey, just under half of Americans say Trump is at least somewhat responsible for the shutdown, with about 39 percent saying congressional Democrats bear at least partial responsibility, and about 30 percent that Republicans in Congress do. (Some of the people polled, before being asked the question, were informed that President Trump had both pronounced himself  proud to shut down the government  and later blamed the impending closure on the Democrats. It didn t appear to have a dramatic effect on the overall results.)Forty-five percent of Americans say Trump should have compromised on the border wall to prevent gridlock, while 35 percent say he was right not to compromise even though it led to a partial shutdown. The other 20 percent aren t sure.A tenth of Americans say they ve been personally affected by the partial shutdown, or that they expect they will be. In many cases, they re taking the definition of  affected  rather lightly ( I have to hear it incessantly on the news ), broadly ( Everything government does will always affect the people ), or hypothetically ( What if I want to go to a [national] park? ).Hundreds of thousands of government workers, however, are furloughed or working without pay, with effects that often ripple beyond their immediate families.  My brother works for the Federal Government and his family and he will be directly affected,  wrote one man who was polled.  We will send them money to help out.  A Democrat, he held Trump and the Republicans responsible for the shutdown, but approved of his own party s response. Several other furloughed workers also described themselves as unhappy with Trump s actions, though not all felt that way. My husband is one of those non-essential employees that eventually gets paid for sitting home,  wrote one Republican woman.  We are punished with the stress of waiting for a paycheck and living out of our savings because they want to play politics with people s livelihoods to work out details of how we spend our tax payer money.  She said the president and both parties in Congress were all at least partially responsible for the shutdown, but believed Trump was right not to compromise. The partial shutdown hasn t gone unnoticed by the broader public either, despite the holiday weekend. Most Americans say they re following the news at least as closely as usual, and nearly 60 percent say they ve been paying at least some attention to the shutdown.Sixty-one percent consider the partial shutdown to be at least a serious problem, similar to the share who said the same of the shutdown this January. Just 29 percent, however, consider it very serious.In order to get a better sense of how different Americans across the country are following and reacting to the news, we also asked survey respondents to briefly describe what was happening with the partial shutdown. A small sampling of the responses are below, sorted by 2016 presidential vote. Some answers have been edited lightly for length or clarity, -  Both parties of our government can not come to an agreement on the proposed wall that President Trump wants to build, or should I say where that funding should come from. -  Colonel Bonespurs, the bloated orange pimple in our White House, wants to waste billions of our tax money and the Republicans won t oppose his stupidity but the Democrats will. So he won t sign what s necessary to keep the government operating until he gets the wall-money to flush down the toilet. -  Some departments of the government will be sending people home or people will be working for free <U+2015> this money will hopefully be restored to them at a later time.  -  According to the meeting between Trump, Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said that he would shut down the government and it would be on him but today he s blaming the Democrats. He knows he s not going to get a wall built on the southern border, and now he says it s a  beautiful fence  instead of a wall. What we need is border protection which doesn t necessarily mean a wall....If I had my way both the House, Senate and the President should be locked in a room and nobody gets to go home until SOMETHING is passed! -  After Trump decided to sign a CR approved by the Senate, talking right wing heads convinced him to not sign the CR. -  Democrats and Republicans are not agreeing on stuff. -  I haven t been following the event. I wasn t even aware it is happening. -  Biggest issue: border security. Democrats want no wall, and are stalling until they control the House in January. Republicans want to get a budget with a wall passed now, for the same reason. -  A bunch of unnecessary government workers got sent home because the Democrats don t care about our security and want to flood the country with illegals that they want to turn into Democrat voters. -  It was triggered by Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter broadcasting their comments saying Trump was weak, and Trump had to prove otherwise. -  Senate Republicans do not have the 60 votes necessary to pass the spending bill passed in the House of Representatives that aligns with Trump s vision for border security by constructing a wall or barrier. Democrats refuse to compromise to secure our southern border and Trump refuses to cave in to Democratic demands. Typical Washington gridlock! -  I really don t know. I don t care right now. It is Christmas time and Im not going to let liberals and Democrats bring it down for me so I tend to ignore it lately. -  Politics as usual. The Dems and GOP can t agree that the sky is blue. -  Due to the inability for both parties in Congress to reach an agreement on the budget for the following months (due to the budget for the border wall being attached to said bill), Congress adjourned with no budget for the country approved. -  I think that it s very unnecessary to shut the government down because of a wall.  -  Democrats are playing politics for a measly (relative to our budget) $5 billion. They don t want any type of wall because Trump will get re-elected. The government shutdown is solely on them. And who cares if the government shuts down?? It should STAY shut down. -  President Trump has shut down the government because he can t get funding for a pet project. -  From what I know, they can t agree on something and if they don t make a decision soon, the government will shut down until they can. I might have my facts wrong, too. I don t remember what it was they couldn t agree on.  -  Girl, I don t know. I just deliver pizzas.

The other branches receive their money through Department of Defense appropriations, which were signed into law in September.With the DHS funding lapsed, roughly 44,000 active-duty Coast Guard members will be working without paychecks until Congress and the White House reach a deal to reopen the government and provide back pay. Another 6,000 Coast Guard employees are being furloughed, according to DHS guidance. That means they won t be working and any pay for the shutdown period would have to come retroactively, through an act of Congress.A Coast Guard spokesman said active-duty members are usually paid on the first and 15th of each month. If the shutdown persists through Friday, they would not receive their scheduled Jan. 1 paychecks.As HuffPost reported last week, members of President Donald Trump s Secret Service contingent are also DHS employees and will be working without pay during the shutdown.Trump said he is prepared to carry out a  very long  shutdown to secure $5 billion in funding for a wall on the U.S. southern border that he had insisted Mexico was supposed to pay for. Although Republicans still control both the House and Senate, they don t have enough votes for a deal on wall funding without Democrats. Trump will have an even harder time rounding up votes for his wall when the new Congress takes office next week, with Democrats taking over as the House majority on Jan. 3.An estimated 420,000 federal employees are working without pay, and roughly 380,000 have been furloughed as a quarter of the government remains closed. After previous shutdowns, Congress has passed laws to pay furloughed workers for the time they missed, and it s likely lawmakers would do the same after this one.  As HuffPost previously detailed, government shutdowns are quite expensive, forcing agencies to develop contingency plans and throwing hundreds of thousands of government employees off their normal work. The work stoppages also can damage consumer confidence in the overall economy and take a bite out of the nation s gross domestic product.Many workers who are guaranteed backpay when the government reopens still must worry about how they ll cover their bills in the meantime. A woman describing herself as the wife of an active-duty Coast Guard member said on Twitter that she fears not being able to cover the family s rent. She was one of many using the #ShutdownStories hashtag:My husband is active duty Coast Guard. Everyone thinks the military is getting paid during the shutdown, but the Coast Guard is facing no pay on the 1st due to being DHS and not DoD. We live in NYC, pay over $2K/month in rent, have a toddler and one on the way.#ShutdownStoriesTrump wished Coast Guard members and others in the military a happy holiday during a call in front of reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday.  It s a disgrace what s happening in our country, but other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas,  the president said. The Navy Federal Credit Union said it would be offering interest-free loans to eligible members who don t receive their paychecks on the first of the month. A Navy Federal spokesman said Coast Guard members who have direct deposit through the credit union can register for the loans up to three days after their normal payday.Workers who pay the biggest price in a shutdown tend to be those who are not federal employees but work under federal contracts, such as janitors and those employed by concessions that operate at federal buildings. These workers generally have no way of recouping back pay for time they missed while the government was closed.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

CBP said in a statement late Tuesday that an agent first noticed the boy had a cough and  glossy eyes  at about 9 a.m. Monday. He was eventually hospitalized twice and died just before midnight, the agency said. CBP earlier said that the boy died just after midnight.CBP said in the statement it needs the help of other government agencies to provide health care. The agency  is considering options for surge medical assistance  from the Coast Guard and may request help from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.A CBP spokesman could not immediately answer how many children are currently in the agency s custody. But with border crossings surging, CBP processes thousands of children   both alone and with their parents   every month.Immigration advocates and human rights groups sharply criticized CBP in the wake of Felipe s death. The body of 7-year-old Jakelin Caal, who died earlier this month, was returned this week to her village in Guatemala for burial.Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said the Trump administration s  policies of cruelty toward migrants and asylum-seekers at the border must cease immediately before any more children are harmed. The White House referred questions about the latest case to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, CBP s parent agency. CBP officers and the Border Patrol remain on the job despite the shutdown.CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in a statement that the child s death was a  tragic loss.  The agency said it has notified the DHS inspector general.CBP issued a timeline of what it said happened before Felipe s death.Felipe was taken with his father to a hospital in Alamogordo, New Mexico, where he was diagnosed with a common cold, according to the timeline.The boy was released just before 3 p.m., about 90 minutes after he had been found to have a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 Celsius), CBP said. He was prescribed amoxicillin and ibuprofen, and taken with his father to a holding facility at a highway checkpoint.At about 7 p.m., agents helped clean up the boy s vomit. CBP said the father  declined further medical assistance  then.But at about 10 p.m., the boy  appeared lethargic and nauseous again,  the agency said, and agents decided to have taken to the hospital. The boy died at 11:48 p.m. Monday, the agency said.The hospital, the Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center, declined to comment, citing privacy regulations.Felipe and his father were detained by CBP for about a week, an unusually long time that the agency did not fully explain Tuesday.CBP typically detains immigrants for no more than a few days when they cross the border before either releasing them or turning them over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for longer-term detention.Agency guidelines say immigrants generally shouldn t be detained for more than 72 hours in CBP holding facilities, which are usually smaller and have fewer services than ICE detention centers.CBP said it apprehended Felipe and his father on Dec. 18 about 3 miles away from an official port of entry, the Paso del Norte bridge connecting El Paso and Juarez, Mexico. They were held at a processing center for almost two days, then taken to the El Paso Border Patrol station on Thursday.CBP said it moved them to Alamogordo, New Mexico, at about 1 a.m. Sunday  because of capacity levels at the El Paso station.  Alamogordo is about 90 miles (145 kilometers) from El Paso.The agency didn t say why it held Felipe and his father for so long, but said its officers repeatedly conducted welfare checks on them.Oscar Padilla, the Guatemalan consul in Phoenix, said he was told by the boy s father in a telephone interview that the two had been traveling from their home in NentÛn, a village about 280 miles (450 kilometers) from Guatemala City. They were planning to go to Johnson City, Tennessee.CBP promised  an independent and thorough review of the circumstances,  and the Guatemalan foreign ministry called for an investigation  in accordance with due process. Democratic members of Congress and immigration advocates sharply criticized CBP s handling of Jakelin Caal s death and questioned whether border agents could have prevented it by spotting symptoms of distress or calling for an evacuation by air ambulance sooner.CBP has said that it took several hours to transport Jakelin and her father from a remote Border Patrol facility to a larger station, where her temperature was measured at 105.7 degrees Fahrenheit (40.9 degrees Celsius). Emergency medical technicians had to revive her twice. She was ultimately flown to an El Paso hospital, where she died the next day.Xochitl Torres Small, a Democrat who will represent the district starting in January, called for a thorough and transparent investigation into the children s deaths and more medical resources along the border. This is inexcusable,  Torres Small said in a statement Tuesday.  Instead of immediately acting to keep children and all of us safe along our border, this administration forced a government shutdown over a wall. "

The Food Nutrition and Consumer Services office deals not only with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), but also the Child Nutrition Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).While SNAP benefits will remain available in January and Child Nutrition programs will continue into February, the future of WIC is uncertain as the shutdown lingers on. The USDA suggested that states turn to local resources if needed.In a statement Friday just before the government s partial closure, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue attempted to ease concerns, noting the agency would try its best to keep to business as usual. There may be a lapse in funding for the federal government, but that will not relieve USDA of its responsibilities for safeguarding life and property through the critical services we provide,  Perdue said.  Our employees work hard every day to benefit our customers and the farmers, ranchers, foresters, and producers who depend on our programs. During a shutdown, we will leverage our existing resources as best we can to continue to provide the top-notch service people expect. The agency echoed Perdue s message on Twitter hours after the shutdown kicked in.During a lapse in government funding, we will be providing as many of our core services as we can using existing resources. We re keeping up our duty to  Do Right and Feed Everyone,  as @SecretarySonny says. More info here: https://t.co/jAI9UJDhlgKey USDA services that won t be cut include its inspections of poultry, meat and eggs and its monitoring of imports and exports for pests.So far, there s no end to the shutdown in sight as President Donald Trump continues battling for a spending bill with border wall funding, which has been stymied by the House despite passing the Senate. It is becoming increasingly possible the government might not reopen until January when Democrats gain control of the House.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

He conceded that the Department of Homeland Security  can t actually spend money from Mexico; we have to get it from the Treasury.

They understand what s happening. They want border security,  Trump told reporters Tuesday morning (watch the video above).  Many of those workers have said to me and communicated,  Stay out until you get the funding for the wall.  These federal workers want the wall. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have stopped working since nine federal departments and dozens of agencies shut down Saturday after Trump refused to sign a spending bill that didn t include money for his border wall.Many responding to Trump s claim were skeptical about the existence of his border-supporting  federal workers.  Former New York U.S. attorney Preet Bharara joked on Twitter that the people Trump was referring to were the same 114-year-old parents of Korean War vets he claimed last summer that he had talked to before meeting with Kim Jong Un. Trump said then that  thousands and thousands  of parents of vets from the Korean War that ended 65 years ago had reached out to him to press for the return of remains.I understand that many of these federal workers POTUS says are happily furloughed for the wall are the 114 year-old parents of Korean War veterans who also regularly talk to Donald Trump. https://t.co/2YXcTCzrJdThat got the ball rolling.

AND as emergency response officials, they have to work with no assurance next paycheck will arrive in time to pay rent. <U+0001F61E><U+0001F92C>Some responding to Bharara s comment referred to the Twitter hashtag  shutdown stories  revealing the financial crunch facing federal workers, like these:My husband is active duty Coast Guard.

The toy trains were not whirring. Even the nearby bathrooms were locked.The national Christmas tree, symbol of a country s seasonal cheer, instead stood as an icon of a government in paralysis, as the partial shutdown stretched into the holiday with an array of federal services frozen, some 800,000 public servants either idled or about to be and the disruption to the broader public bound to grow when the quiet spell ends later this week.Already facilities at many national parks were shuttered, if the parks were accessible at all, and thousands of federal buildings were to remain closed when the work week resumed unless President Donald Trump and members of Congress quickly break through a budget impasse that the White House said could drag on into 2019.Under cloudy skies in a brisk wind on the third day of the shutdown, the capital put on little holiday wonder for visitors like Greg Forcherio of Columbia, Maryland, a government contractor with no office to work in after the holidays as long as federal buildings stayed closed. He, his wife and their toddler on Monday came to see the giant, glittering spruce tree brought from Colorado to serve as the national Christmas tree, normally a focal point for Washington holiday visitors.But a locked chain-link fence blocked access to the site and the nearby White House visitor s center and its bathrooms were closed, with a hand-scrawled sign directing visitors to portable toilets, which also were chained shut.  Kind of annoying when you ve got young children,  Forcherio said.Access to the site was restored later Monday and finally, as night fell on Christmas Eve, the lights returned. The government had announced a day earlier that it would be sealed off because of the shutdown and because repairs had slowed after an episode of vandalism on the tree before the weekend. It reopened with money from the National Park Foundation, a charity. A labor organization representing U.S. Treasury employees said Monday that federal workers around the country were cutting back on spending and changing holiday plans with family because of the shutdown. Just in case anyone still thinks a partial shutdown over a holiday weekend is harmless, think again,  Tony Reardon of the National Treasury Employees Union said in a statement.  Your friends and neighbors around the country who work for the federal government are already showing signs of financial stress. In the mountain town of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, Taylor Futch said the shutdown has already put extra stress on her family, whose sole income comes from her husband, a wildlife biologist who works with black bears for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. With two young daughters, the couple is facing an $800 land payment due at the beginning of January as well as a mortgage, car payment and the usual bills. We re trying to gather up a couple things just in case I need to start selling stuff on Facebook or eBay,  she said.  If his paycheck doesn t get here on Friday, we may not have enough for the mortgage. Federal workers at the agencies affected by the gap in appropriations go unpaid as long as the shutdown lasts. They were expected to get retroactive pay once the impasse was broken.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some still accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operating with money from states or charitable groups and others locked off. Arizona and Utah officials implemented plans to keep open Grand Canyon, Zion, Arches, Bryce Canyon and Zion national parks and provide services such as public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Concession operations such as lodges remained open, and Utah s money for parks in that state included visitor centers.Among sites closed outright: in the southwest alone, Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified National Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Of the roughly 800,000 federal employees facing deferred pay, more than half were deemed essential, such as U.S. Secret Service agents and Transportation Security Administration airport agent. About 380,000 were to be furloughed.Legislation ensuring that workers receive back pay was expected to clear Congress.The immediate impact was blunted by the timing of the shutdown   spanning a weekend and now Christmas Eve and Christmas, both federal holiday days. But there was little chance to solve anything before Thursday at the earliest, when the House and Senate return to work.Trump stayed at the White House, canceling plans to spend the holidays in Florida, and kept up a torrent of tweets on Monday about his critics and his insistence on money for a border wall, the issue at the heart of the budget dispute.Not far from those quarters, Terri Lyons, visiting from Rockville, Maryland, with her 27-year-old daughter as they do every Christmas, found the lights off at one of her favorite monuments, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, when she visited Sunday night. A single guide tried to show tourists around in the darkness.But people were drawn to the illuminated Lincoln Memorial, she said.  It was the only one with lights. On Monday morning, standing at the fence surrounding the tree, Lyons listened to the foreign tourists around her and said she felt embarrassed.  I feel for the people trying to visit from outside of the country, what they think of us,  she said.___Associated Press writer Kimberlee Kruesi in Nashville, Tennessee, and Paul Davenport in Phoenix contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

This is my fifth shutdown,  Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) told CNN Monday.  I m beyond frustrated. LBJ said sometimes you just have to hunker down like a jackass in a hail storm and just take it. That s about where we are. Footage from Reuters captured the same day showed Roberts explaining the partisan divide, warning that it will take time for Congress to come together and cut a deal. The paradox is that most people on the other side have voted for some degree of border security and the wall or the fence or the barrier, whatever you want to call it, before, but now since it s become a political issue, you know both ways, nobody s giving in,  he said.  But they will. We ll get past this. The government stomped on the brakes at midnight Saturday after Congress failed to reach an agreement on a spending bill. Fueling the turmoil is President Donald Trump s demand that the package include $5 billion for a southern border wall, although there s already a partial barrier in place.The measure passed the GOP-led House but was struck down in the Senate.

It does appear that this administration is terminal,  he said in his Christmas Eve broadcast Monday.  This administration will not survive. Hosting a panel to discuss Washington s whirlwind news cycle, the cable host pointed to a recent Washington Post op-ed by columnist Philip Rucker, who declared Trump had become unhinged and that efforts to curb his behavior were futile.Within the editorial, retired four-star Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey says,  This is a rogue presidency. Agreeing with McCaffrey s assessment, Scarborough asked historian Jon Meacham where the country goes from here. This is a rogue president and the question is at this point, what in the world can Congress do, should Congress do?  he wondered.While Meacham emphasized that lawmakers have a responsibility to act, he added,  I also think it s up to all of us because far too often what we see in Washington is enabled by the fact that Washington is more often a mirror of who we are than it is a molder of who we are. Calling upon the public to get tough on the president rather than looking the other way, Meacham said it was time citizens recognized that things were changing, and not for the better. There are still a remarkable number of Americans who are willing to give the president a pass on these things that ... have shaken the basic institutions in a, if not unprecedented, in a scary way.

Actually, the wall is not a wall at all, but instead  artistically designed steel slats  that may or may not look like a drawing of a spiky-topped fence that he sent out Friday.All these interpretations of his progress on his signature campaign promise, of course, have come from Trump himself, and all in the span of a few months   laying the groundwork for his Christmas government shutdown that on Monday saw Trump fold in even more chaos in a series of confusing tweets. The Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security. The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand. The reporting has been inaccurate on the point. The problem is, without the Wall, much of the rest of Dollars are wasted!  he wrote at 12:10 p.m.It was unclear from the context what Trump meant by  Shutdown money    shutdowns cost the federal government money, not save it   and White House officials did not respond to HuffPost queries on the matter.Within minutes, though, he wrote,  I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy! His other tweets Monday roiled stock markets and perhaps the nation s allies, but on the issue of the border wall, he seemed to be tweeting primarily to soothe himself. House members were not present at all, and the Senate held a brief procedural floor session that did not include any business. It s Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and expected next House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) wrote in a joint statement.  The stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve   after he just fired the secretary of Defense. This month, Democratic and Republican congressional leaders alike were given assurances that Trump s demands for American taxpayer money to build his wall would be postponed until after Pelosi takes control of the House in January. The Senate on Dec. 19 passed a short-term spending plan to fund the quarter of the government not already taken care of by earlier spending bills. The Senate proposal was so uncontroversial that it passed unanimously on a voice vote, with the House set to pass it on the floor the next day, Dec. 20, and Trump planning to fly down to Florida to start a 16-day golfing vacation on Dec. 21.That plan, though, was torn up after his favorite Fox News hosts starting attacking him on the evening of Dec. 19 for abandoning his promise to build a border wall   a critique that was joined by radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh the following afternoon.Trump dragged lame-duck House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to the White House to explain that he would not sign the Senate-passed spending plan, which allocated $1.6 billion for border security, including $1.3 billion to build and refurbish barriers, and instead was demanding billions of dollars more.Where that leaves the shutdown remains unclear. The House added $5.7 billion for border security but with no guidance as to how it would be spent. A 2018 spending bill   which the Senate-passed extension would continue   includes language prohibiting Trump from building any sort of structure not already in use by 2017. That would preclude the new designs that Trump toured prototypes of last year.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sent his members home on Saturday and said they need not return before Thursday afternoon at the earliest. White House officials and their congressional allies by Sunday settled on the message that no resolution was possible until after Pelosi becomes speaker because liberal Democrats would not support her in the Jan. 3 House leadership election if she compromised with Trump before then.Trump, meanwhile, has gone from insisting that a wall had to be made of concrete and 30 feet tall and could not be a fence    It s not a fence, Jeb, it s a WALL, and there s a BIG difference!  he chided GOP rival Jeb Bush in 2015   to taking credit for the  bollard fence  designed and first implemented under President Barack Obama and just calling that a wall. In fact, Trump s newfound praise for  steel slats  appears to be endorsing the exact fence design that he previously ridiculed.In their statement Monday, Schumer and Pelosi teed off on Trump for reversing course without offering any clarity on what he wanted.  Instead of bringing certainty into people s lives, he s continuing the Trump Shutdown just to please right-wing radio and TV hosts,  they wrote.  Meanwhile, different people from the same White House are saying different things about what the president would accept or not accept to end his Trump Shutdown, making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment. One GOP consultant close to Trump said his response to the Fox and Limbaugh criticism was smart, given their influence among his hard-core supporters. Polling and focus groups conducted by a pro-Trump group, in fact, indicated that the wall remains a core issue for them, the consultant said on condition of anonymity. Trump voters identify all his accomplishments with the wall,  the consultant said, adding that caving without a fight would have been a disaster. Trump s shutdown over the issue is supported by his most loyal backers, the consultant said.  I think it s going to help him. A former top White House official, though, said the time for Trump to move forward with his wall was a year ago, and that believing a wall would be supported by a Democratic House without giving up major concessions on immigration that his base would hate is a fantasy. The shutdown ends with no wall,  the former official predicted, also on condition of anonymity.  That ship sailed. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Democrats have ardently rejected Trump s demands for $5 billion to build the wall, and anticipate more leverage once they take the House majority in January.Even some top Republicans have become exasperated at Trump s behavior. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the retiring Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, accused the president over the weekend of manufacturing the  juvenile  showdown so he  can look like he s fighting  to please his core supporters.Trump shot back at  Little Bob Corker,  his derisive nickname for the senator,  on Monday, as well as Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy in charge of defeating the Islamic State in the Middle East who announced he s quitting over Trump s abrupt decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria. Both men, Trump tweeted, were responsible for President Barack Obama s  horrific  Iran nuclear deal that he terminated earlier this year.And, as television news continued to focus on the extraordinary resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who also quit in protest of Trump s Syria pullout, Trump sought to reassert his worldview that allies are taking unfair advantage of the U.S. and its taxpayers. General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO, and it is being fixed!  Trump tweeted on Monday, repeating his claim that the U.S. is  subsidizing  the militaries of other nations by remaining in Syria.But what appeared to spook Wall Street most was Trump s continuing tirade against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom the president reportedly considered ousting over fed policy raising interest rates. After Trump bizarrely complained the Federal Reserve doesn t  have a feel  for the markets and  is like a powerful golfer who can t score because he has no touch  <U+2015> major indexes dove more than 2 percent in the worst Christmas Eve trading day ever, extending the worst plunge since the 2008 financial crisis.The tech-heavy NASDAQ lost more than 5 percent, continuing a nosedive of more than 20 percent since its Aug. 29 peak. The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don t have a feel for the Market, they don t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can t score because he has no touch - he can t putt!Trump s Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, may have actually contributed to the mayhem. Mnuchin over the weekend announced he had called CEOs of major U.S. banks from his vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and assured them the markets had  ample liquidity available for lending to consumer, business markets, and all other market operations. The unusual calls left the CEOs  totally baffled,  according to CNN, and Mnuchin s perplexing statement injected a fresh dose of uncertainty into jumpy markets, The New York Times observed.  It s Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a joint statement on Monday.  The stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve ñ after he just fired the Secretary of Defense. The Democratic leaders added that Trump is beholden to  right-wing radio and TV hosts  on the issue of the wall, and that  different people from the same White House are saying different things about what the president would accept or not,  making it impossible to negotiate.  The president wanted the shutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it,  the Democratic leaders said.  As long as the president is guided by the House Freedom Caucus, it s hard to see how he can come up with a solution that can pass both the House and Senate and end his Trump Shutdown. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), meanwhile, had a more pithy response to Trump s grievances on Twitter.Hey republicans your guy is having a moment let us know if you come up w a plan to fix.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

During the federal government shutdown, the White House Visitor Center and National Christmas Tree site will be closed,  the National Park Service wrote on its website.  Restroom facilities will be closed. The tree, a massive Colorado blue spruce, was damaged Friday when a man in  emotional distress  tried to climb it, a park service spokesperson told The Hill. The shutdown has  complicated  repairs that would allow for the lights to be turned back on.There was a flicker of hope that might happen. The National Park Foundation, a charity that supports the park service, was providing materials and labor to get the lights working, a park service spokeswoman told WTOP. The lights flickered on and off Sunday as workers assessed the damage.The darkened tree, located on the Ellipse near the White House, adds a grinch-like note to the standoff between President Donald Trump and Congress over his demand for a $5 billion border wall. Trump s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, warned the shutdown could stretch into January.President Calvin Coolidge began the National Christmas Tree tradition in 1923, when he lit a tree with 2,500 bulbs in red, white and blue, according to the park service.Ninety-five years later, the prospects appear dim that the tree will be relighted in time for Christmas.

With other countries pleading for sanity and institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization warning of severe consequences if trade sanctions get out of hand, talk of a looming recession is growing,  he said.  Yet the president seems determined to make matters worse   and to hell with the economic consequences. Bloomberg pointed to last week s stock market plunge as another sign that  Trump s recklessly emotional and senselessly chaotic approach to the job  has a real impact. At the halfway mark of this terrible presidency, one has to wonder how much more the country can take,  he added.The only solution, Bloomberg said, was for the GOP to stand up to Trump. Unless something changes   unless, in particular, Republicans in Congress start showing some spine   two more years might be enough to test whether we can sustain Trump s model of bad government. This past week, we got a glimpse of what the beginning of the collapse may look like   and what it may ultimately cost us.

Turner then slammed the president for what she felt was his failure to align his words with his actions, adding,  This is not helpful for the country at all. The shutdown kicked in at midnight Saturday when Congress was unable to compromise on a spending package. Trump and other Republicans demanded that the measure include $5 billion for a barrier along the southern border, even though one already exists. The bill passed the House, but stalled in the Senate, reflecting serious partisanship.As the certain members of the GOP dig in their heels on the measure, hundreds of thousands of government employees are either being furloughed or working without pay.

Bob Corker (R-Tenn), Twitter users were thrown a delicious bone   the hashtag  Alert The Daycare Staff  that Corker flagged for Trump.The dig refers to the notion that Trump needs mature supervision on the job. Corker first referred to the White House as an  adult daycare center  late last year after Trump attacked him in a fusillade of tweets.It s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.A source told CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta just days after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis tendered his resignation that the president was furious by news coverage of the event because it resurrected the  adult daycare  idea for the president. Mattis was considered one of the  adults in the room  at the White House, Acosta noted.Now Twitter s on board with the idea, thanks to the hashtag Corker included when he fired off a message to Trump making fun of the president s story that Mexico will pay for his border wall.

You and I know know that it cannot work exactly like that,  incoming White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney acknowledged in an interview Sunday with host Jonathan Karl on ABC s  This Week. Mulvaney tried to make a case that a better trade agreement with Mexico could put more money in Americans  pockets that might be used to pay for the wall, whose total cost has been placed at anywhere from $21.6 billion to as high as $70 billion. American workers are going to do better, the government is going to do better, and you could make the argument that Mexico is paying for it in that fashion,  he said.  But none of that is Mexico paying for the wall,  Karl pressed. Technically, you and I both know that it cannot work exactly like that,  Mulvaney acknowledged.  The Department of Homeland Security can t actually spend money from Mexico. We have to get it from the Treasury. Mick Mulvaney: We re in a  good place  on getting wall built and having Mexico  participate  in border security.@jonkarl:  But none of that is Mexico paying for the wall Mulvaney:  Technically, you and I both know that it cannot work exactly like that  https://t.co/JcfRJsTBm9 pic.twitter.com/A3fnJYsi3yA senior White House official told reporters in an official background call Saturday that Mexico would pay for the wall.  Our administration continues to believe  that Mexico will pay for the wall, the official reportedly said.Trump has repeatedly declared that Mexico will pay for the wall, though he has conceded that Mexico might reimburse the U.S. for the wall rather than fund it up front.Trump declared at a rally in May that Mexico is  going to pay for the wall and they re going to enjoy it, okay? Americans are currently suffering from a partial government shutdown because the president refuses to sign a temporary spending measure that does not include billions   in U.S. taxpayer funds   for his wall.  Mexico was going to pay for this wall from day one,  Karl reminded Mulvaney on Saturday.  The day he announced he was running for president [Trump said]  I will build a great on our southern border. I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.  Mark his words. Now, the president has forced a government shutdown because he s insisting that American taxpayers pay for that wall. What gives?  Trump earlier this month tweeted a similar Mulvaney message that  savings  from the new NAFTA deal with Mexico will pay for the wall. Well, Mr. President, if you say Mexico is going to pay for the wall through NAFTA, which it certainly won t, I guess we don t have to,  Senate Minority Leader Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) quipped after the tweet.  Let s fund the government  instead, he said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

In a statement posted to Twitter on Sunday, Mnuchin said that each of the CEOs  confirmed they have ample liquidity for lending to consumer, business markets and all other market operations. Today I convened individual calls with the CEOs of the nation s six largest banks. See attached statement. pic.twitter.com/YzuSamMyeTMick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump s incoming acting chief of staff, on Sunday predicted the shutdown could continue into 2019. Mnuchin said during the shutdown, the Treasury  will have critical employees to maintain its core operations.  We continue to see strong economic growth in the U.S. economy with robust activity from consumers and business,  Mnuchin said.  With the government shutdown, Treasury will have critical employees to maintain its core operations at Fiscal Services, IRS, and other critical functions within the department. The treasury secretary spent some of his weekend attempting to reassure financial markets, particularly after reports surfaced that Trump was considering ousting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. (1/2) I have spoken with the President @realDonaldTrump and he said  I totally disagree with Fed policy. I think the increasing of interest rates and the shrinking of the Fed portfolio is an absolute terrible thing to do at this time,...(2/2) especially in light of my major trade negotiations which are ongoing, but I never suggested firing Chairman Jay Powell, nor do I believe I have the right to do so. Despite his best efforts, Twitter users aren t buying Mnuchin s assurances that everything is fine.  Nothing to worry about folks! Just a routine call from a beach in Mexico on Christmas weekend with the heads of every major bank after a week of market instability. Everything is fine! Yes, nothing inspires confidence like a panicky press release to detail a panicky round of phone calls to assure your boss that nothing s wrong.

But it can t due to America s partial government shutdown, which began Saturday after President Donald Trump refused to sign legislation that didn t include funding for his southern border wall.The USGS website is dormant as of Sunday, except for a notice at the top.  Due to a lapse in appropriations, the majority of USGS websites may not be up to date and may not reflect current conditions,  the note reads.  Websites displaying real-time data, such as Earthquake and Water and information needed for public health and safety will be updated with limited support. According to the government shutdown contingency plan, the USGS will retain just 75 of its estimated 8,032 employees, or 0.9 percent. The USGS will suspend the majority of its activities with the exception of those functions to protect life and property,  the plan states. The document also claims that 450 employees will be  on call  for natural disasters, but it s unclear if that process has been enacted, as the USGS website says the agency is not  able to respond to inquiries until appropriations are enacted. While scientific experts in Indonesia lead the way in analyzing the data, seismologists and volcanologists on Twitter stress how important agencies like the USGS are in providing valuable scientific data to the public.  This is problematic for journalists like myself, but also it s a shame they can t help out by providing any commentary or advice to the general public too,  volcanologist Robin George Andrews told HuffPost.The USGS is just one of many science-based government agencies affected by the shutdown. This government shutdown not only  slows scientific progress,  scientists point out, it also endangers lives.What @kaseyaderhold said.  The shutdown is maddening and unnecessary and and it slows scientific progress.  But seismic data are still being collected and distributed, and scientists are still engaged in hazards monitoring and response. https://t.co/eyH7aLsluqIf you re laughing at scientists who specialize in natural disasters being upset at the #TrumpShutdown endangering lives, you re a jerk. People just died in a #tsunami likely due to a #volcano erupting, & there is no guarantee the US won t be next on the natural disaster list.Officials say that since there was no detectable quake prior to the tsunami, there was no way to know it was coming.Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the head of public relations at Indonesia s National Disaster Mitigation Agency, told CNN that a  multi-hazard early warning system  is needed. We used to know that a tsunami happens after an earthquake. There was no quake last night,  Nugroho said.  That is why there was no warning. Indonesians have barely had a chance to catch their breath since their last natural disaster, suffering a magnitude 7.5 earthquake and ensuing tsunami back in September. More than 2,100 people died during that disaster."

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) accused President Donald Trump of manufacturing a government shutdown to please his core supporters, after promising to construct a wall on the southern U.S. border that Mexico would pay for.  This is a made-up fight so the president can look like he s fighting, but even if he wins, our borders are going to be insecure,  Corker, who is retiring at the end of the year, said Sunday in an interview on CNN s  State of the Union.  It s juvenile. The whole thing is juvenile,  he added.The federal government partially shut down on Friday, forcing hundreds of thousands of federal workers off the job. Most essential government agencies, including the FBI, the Border Patrol and the Coast Guard, will remain open.Talks to fully fund the government have broken down amid Trump s demand for $5 billion to begin construction of the wall. While a spending proposal including unpaid-for money for the wall passed the GOP-led House, its progress has stalled in the Senate, where Democrats have ardently rejected Trump s demands. It s very possible that this shutdown will go beyond the 28th [of December] and into the new Congress,  Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Sunday on ABC s  This Week. Mulvaney, who is set to take on the role of acting White House chief of staff next year, added that Vice President Mike Pence gave Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer a counteroffer in a meeting on Capitol Hill on Saturday below the $5 billion figure and that the  the ball is in their court. The Senate initially passed a bill that would have funded the government until February and did not include money designated for construction of the wall. Any senator could have objected to the measure <U+2015> but none did. Republicans, including Pence, even told reporters afterward they had confidence that the president would sign it into law and avert a shutdown. Critical coverage by conservative radio talk show hosts Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter appeared to have pushed Trump toward favoring a veto, however. Coulter warned at one point that Trump s administration could become a  joke presidency who scammed the American people  if he wasn t able to get the wall built and said she wouldn t vote for him in 2020 if he didn t. During a hallway interview on Capitol Hill, a perplexed Corker, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, lamented that Trump is being controlled by the opinions of talk-radio hosts, equating their influence over the last 24 hours to  tyranny.  We have two talk radio hosts who influenced the president,  Corker told CNN.  That s tyranny, isn t it? Reacting to that interview on Sunday, Trump tweeted that the senator decided to retire because he refused to endorse Corker s re-election bid. A top aide to Corker denied that claim last year, however. The aide said the president initially asked the senator to reconsider his decision to retire and that Trump even offered his endorsement.Corker shot back with a tweet of his own on Sunday, alluding to a comment he made in October 2017 calling the White House  an adult day care center.

Al Sharpton that those punching the clock without a paycheck would receive little sympathy from the public. I may sound like the Grinch saying it, but look, the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., did not suffer as the rest of America did in the last 10 years with the Obama recession,  she argued.But Sharpton wasn t buying it.  We re talking about a shutdown,  he said, attempting to steer the strategist away from criticism of President Donald Trump s predecessor and back to the matter at hand.  We re talking about men and women sitting at the dinner table on Christmas Day not knowing when they re going to see their next paycheck, and you re calling them paper pushers and bureaucrats, so they don t matter. Kerns shot back:  I didn t say they don t matter. I m saying they have a different job security and pay scale than the rest of the American people have felt over the last eight to 10 years. Jen Kerns says that American people don t really care about the workers who may be impacted by the government shutdown. #PoliticsNation pic.twitter.com/VDebvb6gyWDoubling down on her remarks via Twitter, Kerns wrote,  It s true!

Ryan Costello (R-Pa.), whose term expires next month, aired his aggravation not only with the commander in chief on whom he pinned the blame, but also with his own party. In the land of common sense <U+2015> we re not in it right now, and the shutdown is because the president wanted a shutdown,  Costello said.  I don t know why he wanted a shutdown. If it s over the border wall, then this past summer, he should have pushed the compromised immigration bill that if he d pushed, we would have been able to send it over to the Senate. The proposal to which Costello referred was rejected by the House last June, but would have forked over a whopping $25 billion for the president s border wall, five times his current asking price. The demands of Trump and other Republicans for border wall money have now led to a stark divide in Congress over the passage of a spending bill, triggering the shutdown.On Friday, Costello tweeted that it was  toddler logic  to think the impasse would cause those on the left to change their minds.If and when the gvt shuts down, there s no pressure on Dems. Then Dems control the House on Jan 3. Then Dems have more leverage. The notion that a shutdown creates more pressure on Dems is toddler logic. https://t.co/4veTNOF9XwCostello predicted the turmoil wouldn t end until he was out of office, suggesting Democrats would hold out until they assume control of the House in January.Still, the congressman maintained frustration with his side of the aisle.<U+2033>This honestly is really, really simple stuff. Really simple,  he said.  But for some reason, there s a couple people out there that I think are just missing the boat, and one of them is the president. While Costello had no reservations calling out the GOP, certain of his colleagues continue to stand by the president, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Sen.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) promised he wouldn t budge on demands for border wall money.In a Fox News interview Saturday evening with Jeanine Pirro, the lawmaker called out Democrats for the division, accusing them of waging  a silly, petty fight  on the spending bill, and assuring Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) he was in for a war. Senator Schumer, we re not going to abandon the wall,  Graham vowed.  We re going to build a wall, and to all those Americans who want us to abandon the wall and open up the border, that s what this fight s about. The GOP senator then pointed to the Central American migrant caravan, which formed earlier this year looking to arrive in the U.S., as evidence of the need for a southern border crackdown. On that, Graham refused to settle.<U+2033>Senator Schumer, what does it take for you to realize that we need more money for a broken border?  he asked.  And this is about them hating Trump so much, wanting him to lose, they can t understand that America needs to win, and we re not going to give in. I m a pretty reasonable guy, but we re not going to give in on this. Graham s tough talk comes just roughly 24 hours after he appeared on the network Friday, praising President Donald Trump s push for border money and encouraging him to  dig in  further.While a spending proposal including money for the wall passed the GOP-led House, its progress stalled in the Senate, where Democrats have ardently rejected Trump s demands.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Earlier Friday, Trump blamed Democrats for holding up legislation that would include money needed for his border wall and threatened a  very long  shutdown. The Democrats, whose votes we need in the Senate, will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED,  Trump tweeted.  If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don t want Open Borders and Crime! During government shutdowns, thousands of federal employees are forced to work without being paid immediately <U+2015> from federal law enforcement officers and firefighters to TSA agents working during the busy holiday weekend.But while the so-called furloughed federal employees are not paid during the shutdown, they typically receive paychecks for their work retroactively.Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive, isn t the only lawmaker to call for a stop to congressional salaries amid the shutdown.Sen.

The Senate adjourned Saturday afternoon with no solution and no plans to reconvene until Thursday. The shutdown was triggered after Trump switched positions and decided not to sign any temporary government funding bills unless they contained some $5 billion for his border wall.Twitter wags were less than sympathetic about Trump forgoing one of his multiple golf trips to address a mess of his making.

At least that s what he said on Fox News   when he was talking about Barack Obama in 2013.Trump revealed his views when he was asked on  Fox & Friends  about a pending government shutdown which occurred over a funding battle in October that year. Boardroom here,  said host Elisabeth Hasselbeck, referring to Trump s reality TV show  The Apprentice,  in which he summarily fired people.  Who s getting fired? Who s going to bear the brunt of the responsibility if indeed there is a government shutdown?  she asked Trump, who had called in to the program. If you say who gets fired it always has to be the top,  Trump responded.   Problems start from the top and they have to get solved from the top. And the president s the leader. He s got to get everyone in a room and he s gotta lead. But he doesn t do that,  Trump added, referring to Obama.  And that s why you have this horrible situation going on in Washington. It s a very, very bad thing and it s very embarrassing worldwide. He also noted that when people look back on a shutdown in history, they re  going to be talking about ... who the president was at that time. They re not going to be talking about who was the head of the House, the head of the Senate, who s running things in Washington. Several federal departments and agencies were shut down Friday at midnight as funding lapsed after Trump switched his position on signing a temporary funding bill and refused instead to support any measure that didn t include some $5 billion for his border wall. The House and Senate have adjourned for the holidays and members likely will not be meeting in anyone s office until at least Thursday.Trump, who had said earlier this month that he would be  proud  to shut down the government for  border security  is now calling it a  Democrat shutdown. The Democrats now own the shutdown!Listen to Trump s views about a president s responsibility for a shutdown in the clip above.He also told Larry King in a 2013 interview that the U.S. was  being scoffed at and laughed at  because of the shutdown.  It s a mess,  he said. See that video right here:Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) has warned President Donald Trump that the only way  he s going to get his wall is if Mexico funds it. Trump forced a partial government shutdown at midnight Friday over his insistence that the border wall be paid for by American taxpayers.Lieu described the shutdown <U+2015> the third during Trump s presidency <U+2015> as a  failure of Republican leadership.  Democrats are certainly happy to talk about border security, but we re not going to build this stupid vanity wall of Donald Trump s with U.S. taxpayer dollars,  he told MSNBC s Alex Witt.  Democrats and Republicans both support border security, and Donald Trump s No. 1 campaign promise was not the wall, it was that Mexico would fund the wall. The prominent House Judiciary Committee Democrat added that Trump s U.S.-Mexico border wall would be a waste of taxpayer money for  inefficient, wasteful technology.   Making America great again doesn t mean using 19th century technology,  he said, referring to Trump s campaign promise.  This is like building a big moat around America. We don t do things like that anymore. Watch Lieu s interview in the clip below:Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Senators will be notified when a vote is scheduled. And in the meantime, the discussions, and the negotiations, continue,  McConnell said, just hours after Trump held a White House lunch that didn t include any Democrats with whom McConnell has repeatedly said Trump must negotiate.Instead, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) took to the Senate floor, where he said the shutdown was caused by exactly one person: Trump.  President Trump has been on a destructive, two-week temper tantrum, demanding that the American taxpayer pony up for an expensive and ineffective border wall that the president promised Mexico would pay for,  Schumer said.Trump has made zero overtures to the Mexican government since the start of his presidency to get that country to pay for the wall, according to a top official in Mexico City.A senior Trump administration official, who spoke to reporters Saturday on condition of anonymity, claimed Trump is still looking for ways to get Mexico to pay. We re going to put to the future questions about how and when Mexico will pay for it. Our administration continues to believe that they will,  the Trump official said.  But this debate is about ensuring that we have the appropriations that are needed to get the wall built. We re not going to be in a situation where we re going to wait on negotiations with Mexico to be able to move out in constructing the wall. McConnell could recall senators to the Capitol to vote on a possible deal before Thursday. Alternatively, the House could pass a short-term spending bill already approved by the Senate and send it to Trump for his signature.In the absence of either of those scenarios, nine Cabinet agencies <U+2015> including the Department of Homeland Security and its Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents <U+2015> and a total of some half-million federal employees will remain in paycheck limbo through at least the Christmas holiday.The Senate spending bill extension that passed by a unanimous voice vote on Wednesday continued last year s appropriation level of $1.6 billion for border security enhancements, of which $1.3 billion was for repair and replacement of existing barrier fence.Trump had been expected to sign that bill without much fuss <U+2015> until Thursday morning, after Trump watched his favorite Fox News hosts attack him for not building the border wall he had promised.The House, which had planned to approve the Senate-passed spending bill and then adjourn for the year, instead added $5.7 billion in unspecified border security money for Trump s wall <U+2015> a proposal that does not have even 50 votes in the Senate, let alone the 60 it would need to pass.Spending authority for the affected departments and agencies expired at midnight Friday.The shutdown will have little effect through the weekend and even on Monday, Christmas Eve, and Tuesday, Christmas Day, which are both federal holidays this year. But nonessential employees at the affected departments will be furloughed starting Wednesday, while employees considered essential <U+2015> including Trump s Secret Service detail and many tens of thousands of workers in the Border Patrol, ICE and the Coast Guard <U+2015> will be required to work without pay until the shutdown ends.Building a wall along the southern border and forcing Mexico to pay for it was Trump s signature campaign promise, delivered for the first time in his Trump Tower speech announcing his candidacy. He repeated it hundreds of times between June 2015, and Nov. 8, 2016, when he won the presidency.The  forcing Mexico to pay  part, though, was quietly dropped almost immediately upon taking office. In a phone call with Mexico s president at the time, Trump told Enrique PeÒa Nieto that he understood that Mexico would not pay for the wall but asked him not to say that publicly so Trump would not lose standing with his base.In recent months, Trump has been conflating the  great, great wall  made of reinforced concrete that he had promised during his campaign with a  bollard fence  design of steel posts that was adopted and started during President Barack Obama s administration.Of late, Trump has suggested describing his promised wall as  artistically designed steel slats  so that Democrats won t object to it as vociferously.Trump postponed the start of what was to have been a 16-day golfing vacation at his private resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday and remained in Washington instead. It is unclear whether he will stay at the White House until he signs a new spending bill or fly down to Mar-a-Lago in the coming days regardless.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) was clearly irked, feeling the timing was pretty inconvenient. This is an emergency meeting that we re having here and I ve seen some surreal things around this place, but this is really something,  McGovern said.  Vital parts of our government are about to shut down in just a few hours, and the Republicans have called an emergency meeting on cheese. Venting his frustration with Republicans in the room, McGovern wondered whether his colleagues had thought about how the meeting would look to the public, which would soon be faced with the third shutdown of the year.  I mean, has anybody considered how ridiculous this is or how bad the optics are as the American people are watching what s going on here?  he asked.  By all means, if you think the most important thing we have to discuss right now is cheese, I ll let you have at it. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) eventually jumped in to defend the meeting, calling the cheese bill  important to small business,  then eventually segueing into the issue of funding for the southern border wall, the key matter that prompted the shutdown. We are being overrun on our southern border,  Sessions declared.That s when McGovern piped up, appearing confused, asking,  There s no wall in this bill, right?  It is important,  Sessions argued back, clarifying that he was  not talking about the wall of cheese.  Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) castigated President Donald Trump on Saturday for the federal government shutdown that kicked in at the stroke of midnight.In a joint statement released overnight, both lawmakers pointed their fingers at the commander in chief for what they dubbed  the Trump Government Shutdown.  Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House,  they said.  But instead of honoring his responsibility to the American people, President Trump threw a temper tantrum and convinced House Republicans to push our nation into a destructive Trump Shutdown in the middle of the holiday season. President Trump has said more than 25 times that he wanted a shutdown and now he has gotten what he wanted. Both argued that their party has made numerous attempts to avert the crisis, which was prompted in part by Trump s demands for $5 billion in funding for the southern border wall, despite the fact that a partial barrier already exists. While a spending bill including that measure passed the GOP-led House, it was inevitably dead on arrival in the Senate.The problem, Schumer and Pelosi contended, was Trump s unrealistic and unreasonable plans for a wall. Democrats have offered Republicans multiple proposals to keep the government open, including one that already passed the Senate unanimously, and all of which include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security ñ not the president s ineffective and expensive wall. In the event that the government is not up and running soon, the lawmakers vowed to  swiftly pass legislation to re-open  it in January once the House flips to a Democratic majority. Correction: A previous version of this article mistakenly referred to Rep. Nancy Pelosi as a senator. She is a member of the House of Representatives.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is backing President Donald Trump s fight for border wall money, even though it has brought the government to a screeching halt.In a Fox News appearance Friday night less than an hour before the shutdown officially began, Graham praised the commander in chief s commitment to push for $5 billion for the barrier. Anyone who disagreed, he claimed, was missing the point. When you make a promise to the American people, you should keep it,  Graham said.  The one thing I like about President Trump <U+2015> he s trying his best to keep his promise. He promised to build a wall, and he s going to fight hard to keep that promise. After the caravan, if you don t see the need for more border security, you re blind. The GOP senator bashed Democrats for refusing to give in to Trump s demands, accusing them of acting  like children  and encouraging the president to get tough. I think Democrats hate Trump so much they want him to lose even though it would be good for the country to work with him on border security, and if he doesn t break them now, it s going to be a terrible 2019,  Graham said.  So, Mr. President, dig in. Graham didn t appear to be bothered by the government shutdown, suggesting it was a necessary measure to persuade resistant Democrats to give more than their standing offer of $1.6 billion to the wall, which already partly exists along the southern border. I stand with the president,  Graham declared.  I m glad he picked this fight. If we do not stand up now to make sure we get more money for the wall, we ll never get any more next year. The key to Trump getting what he wants, the senator said, is making clear  that the border needs to be why the money I m asking for can be well spent,  noting his confidence that  the president will win this fight.

Who will he blame now that it s shitting the bed? THE DEMOCRATS!Last week King got explicit with his recommendation of what Trump should do with his proposed border wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, which he has so far failed to secure funding for:Fuck your wall. Split that 5 billion between at-risk children who don t have lunches and vets who can t get proper medical and psychological treatment. Fuck your vanity project. Do something good for once."

How can we get anything done if the left and right can t even agree on what to call the damn barrier?  Cuomo asked, frustrated by the hyper-partisanship that has enveloped Washington.The cable host then begged lawmakers to re-open the government quickly, telling them to  do your damn jobs,  repeatedly emphasizing what he saw as a marked difference between  left, right and reasonable. Slamming Trump for focusing on a wall, Cuomo noted that a partial barrier already exists, while lamenting that the government was tied up over what he believes is small potatoes. It s not even over a critical issue,  he said.  The wall is not border security. The real solution, Cuomo added, was collaboration. The only way you get safe is if both sides work together and make reasonable change to the system,  he said.Though his criticism was bipartisan, Cuomo ultimately pinned the blame on Trump, arguing that he was the reason for Congress  inability to function.

Many of them fully expected Hillary Clinton to become president. Instead, they found themselves with every politico s dream: one-party control of the three branches of government.  We are going to hit the ground running,  House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) declared, saying Donald Trump  earned a mandate  to push his agenda forward as president. We would like to see the country go in a different direction and intend to work with him to change the course for America,  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declared. Two years later, the Republican dream is left in shambles. And voters were clearly not impressed with what the GOP Congress accomplished with its one-party rule. In January, Democrats will take control of the House.At midnight, the federal government partially shut down for the third time during Trump s presidency after Republicans failed in their most basic duty as lawmakers: funding government operations.  We re right in the middle of a sort of meltdown on the part of the Republicans,  said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Thursday. Pelosi is expected to become speaker in the new Congress. Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), however, argued that this turmoil was normal.  I ve been in the state legislature for 14 years, six of those as speaker. I ve been here for 20 years,  he told reporters Thursday.  I ve never seen it not end this way. The last week of a legislative session is ugly. Always is. But it s not always this ugly. When then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) retired in 2015, he cleaned up the place. He pushed through a two-year spending deal and a two-year raise in the federal borrowing limit, theoretically allowing Congress to get other things done so they wouldn t have to waste time lurching from crisis to crisis. And the messiness wasn t restricted to this past week. Former Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.), who left Congress in 2017 and recently gave up his party affiliation, said the Republican Party s unified control of government was  defined by remarkably damaging wins and complete capitulation of separation of powers. Since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, Republicans made repealing it their rallying cry. Up until the 2018 campaign, it was their central political message. But the ACA turned out to be far more popular than they anticipated and repealing it was far harder than expected as well <U+2015> despite controlling both chambers of Congress. Trump and his Republican allies continue to weaken the law, but there was no all-out repeal as promised. Congress  biggest legislative accomplishment was passing the new tax law, but it fell far short of what was promised. There were deep, permanent cuts for corporations, and a more modest cut for individuals that expires at the end of 2025. The tax bill was not as popular as Republicans expected, and they largely abandoned it as a campaign message. The tax law also contributed to a complete abandonment of the GOP s stated concern about fiscal responsibility. When Barack Obama was president, Republicans hammered him on the national debt.  America Can t Afford Obama s Legacy Of A Skyrocketing National Debt  read a typical document on the Republican National Committee s website in 2017. When the national debt was at $15 trillion in 2012, Ryan warned of the  red tidal wave of debt  that would mean the  end of the American dream  in as little as two or three years. But it s 2018, and the national debt has grown to $21 trillion under the GOP s watch. The federal government s budget office projects the GOP s tax law will add more than $1.8 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years. So much for fiscal austerity.One bright spot for Republicans is the criminal justice reform bill that passed on a strong bipartisan basis this month. The bill is designed to help nonviolent federal offenders make an easier return to society after they ve served most of their sentences. It also trimmed a handful of mandatory minimum sentences, such as for crack cocaine, that helped explode the federal prison population over the past three decades. Most Republicans probably wouldn t have supported such a bill without cover from a president like Trump, who does  tough on crime  politics like it s still the 1980s. That same macho impulse, however, is what led to the government shutdown, with Trump insisting Congress appropriate billions of dollars for a giant wall to keep  bad guys  from crossing the southern U.S. border. It s such a ridiculous idea that Republicans in Congress try to pretend the president s talking broadly about  border security  and not a physical barrier made out of concrete or steel.Ryan and McConnell could have sent the president a clean funding bill and dared him to veto it <U+2015> instead, they played along with his demand and made a show of holding votes, even though it was clear Democrats wouldn t go along. And while Senate Republicans did push through two conservative Supreme Court nominees, they largely overlooked or dismissed sexual misconduct allegations against one: Brett Kavanaugh, who was rushed ahead for confirmation without the usual vetting. But most notably, the Republican majority will be remembered for what it didn t do: It didn t stand up to Trump.  Congress spent two years behaving as a political committee of the president, not a branch of government empowered with independence by the Constitution,  Jolly said.Congress never passed legislation protecting Robert Mueller s special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign. Ryan frequently dismissed Trump s concerning rhetoric and actions <U+2015> like attacking fellow Republicans or outright lying <U+2015> calling it  noise  or  trolling. It s a fitting finale to this two-year period that in the end, the government is literally not even open.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Whether it results in anything close to the billions he had demanded for wall construction is unclear <U+2015> and may well be beside the point.Also unclear is how long the shutdown will last. Trump s allies in the House added $5.7 billion in wall construction money onto a spending bill that had already cleared the Senate. That additional money remains a non-starter in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to pass controversial legislation and where there are only 51 Republicans.Trump, meanwhile, has already begun blaming Democrats for forcing the shutdown, even though he himself caused it by changing his mind at the last minute and insisting that the short-term spending bill moving through Congress include an unspecified amount of money for his wall. It s up to the Democrats. So it s really the Democrat shutdown,  the president said Friday during an unrelated bill signing ceremony at the White House.Just 10 days earlier, though, in that same Oval Office, Trump had bragged to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that he would be happy to take the responsibility for a shutdown. I ll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,  Trump said.  I will be the one to shut it down. I m not going to blame you for it. Three-quarters of the federal government has already been funded through next September under spending bills that Trump signed previously. But a handful of major agencies received only temporary funding because of the president s earlier insistence that Congress start building his border wall, which Democrats refused to go along with.The last of those funding extensions expired at midnight Friday. Both Trump and his White House had signaled during the first part of the week that he would accept another extension, this time through Feb. 8. By that point, Pelosi will have been sworn in as the new speaker, since the Democratic Party picked up 40 House seats in the midterm elections.Some Trump allies believe that he will have an easier time negotiating a longer-term deal with her, offering to agree to some Democratic priorities in return for his wall. Other observers think that he has always preferred to attack Democrats over the lack of a wall than to actually build one, so that a Pelosi speakership will wind up being useful to him politically.All those calculations changed Thursday morning, though, following a night and a morning of harsh criticism from Fox News hosts and radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. Trump announced that he would reject any short-term spending bill that did not offer more money for border security, although he did not specify an amount.Building a wall along the southern border and forcing Mexico to pay for it was Trump s singular campaign promise, uttered for the first time in his Trump Tower speech announcing his candidacy. He repeated it hundreds of times between June 2015 and Nov. 8, 2016, when he won the presidency.The  forcing Mexico to pay  part, though, was quietly dropped almost immediately upon his taking office. In a phone call with Enrique PeÒa Nieto, Mexico s president at the time, Trump said that he understood Mexico would not pay for the wall but asked PeÒa Nieto not to say that publicly so Trump would not lose standing among his base.In recent months, Trump has been conflating the  great, great wall  made of reinforced concrete that he promised during his campaign with a  bollard fence  design of steel posts that was adopted and started during President Barack Obama s administration.Of late, he has suggested describing his wall as  artistically designed steel slats  so Democrats won t object to it as vociferously.The shutdown will have little effect through the weekend and even on Monday, Christmas Eve, and Tuesday, Christmas Day, which are both federal holidays. But non-essential employees at the affected departments will be furloughed starting Wednesday, while employees considered essential <U+2015> including Trump s Secret Service detail and many tens of thousands of workers in the Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Coast Guard <U+2015> will be required to work without pay until the shutdown ends.Trump postponed the start of what was to have been a 16-day golfing vacation at his private resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday and remained in Washington instead. It is unclear whether he will stay at the White House until he signs a new spending bill or fly down to Mar-a-Lago in the coming days regardless.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

It s very dangerous out there. Drugs are pouring in, human trafficking, so many different problems, including gangs like MS-13. We don t want  em in the United States. We don t want  em in our country,  Trump said in a video he shared on Twitter.The  only thing that s going to stop that is great border security with a wall or a slat fence or whatever you want to call it,  Trump added.  But we need a great barrier. Trump issued his message hours after both the House and Senate adjourned, having failed to reach any compromise on a spending measure that included funds he has demanded for his wall. The president s threatened partial government shutdown is set to begin at midnight. Trump praised the House for passing a measure supporting more than $5 billion for his wall on Thursday. Now it s up to the Senate, and it s really up to the Democrats because we need their votes,  he noted in the video.  We re going to have a shutdown. There s nothing we can do about that ... Call it a Democrat shutdown, call it whatever you want. He concluded:  Let s get out, let s work together, let s be bipartisan and let s get it done. The shutdown hopefully will not last long.

The order, which makes no mention of climate change, comes on the heels of another devastating and deadly wildfire season in California. Trump has blamed the state s infernos on everything from a lack of raking to a nonexistent water shortage resulting from  bad environmental laws.  And the administration has used the disasters to push partisan policy, connecting devastating California wildfires to a longstanding fight between farmers and environmentalists over water resources. For decades, dense trees and undergrowth have amassed in these lands, fueling catastrophic wildfires,  Trump s order reads.  These conditions, along with insect infestation, invasive species, disease, and drought, have weakened our forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands, and have placed communities and homes at risk of damage from catastrophic wildfires. The order directs the Interior Department and the Department of Agriculture to identify ways to reduce  regulatory barriers  to better manage forests and get rid of hazardous fuels. It calls for  treating  4.25 million federal acres   an area larger than Connecticut   to cut fuel loads. And it allows for a total 4.4 billion board feet of timber to be harvested from Forest Service- and Interior-managed lands in 2019 (board feet is a unit of measurement for the volume of lumber).That would be a significant increase over the combined 3.2 billion board feet removed from those agencies  lands in 2017, the Sacramento Bee reports.   Active management of vegetation is needed to treat these dangerous conditions on Federal lands but is often delayed due to challenges associated with regulatory analysis and current consultation requirements,  the order states. The order also calls for addressing invasive species and working to mitigate flooding and erosion risks that result from wildland fires. And it requires the agencies  secretaries to  identify salvage and log recovery options from lands damaged by fire during the 2017 and 2018 fire seasons, insects, or disease  by no later than March 31, 2019.While the order lists a number of forest threats made worse by climate change <U+2015> drought, disease, insect infestations, invasive species <U+2015> it ignores climate change as a whole. That comes as little surprise, given the misinformation and climate change denialism that the administration rolled out in response to the fires in August. I ve heard the climate change argument back and forth. This has nothing to do with climate change,  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told KCRA-TV in Sacramento during a trip to assess damage from the Carr fire.  This has to do with active forest management. Zinke, who is resigning at the end of the year amid numerous federal investigations into his conduct and policy changes, has gone so far as to blame the blazes on  environmental terrorists  who he claims are standing in the way of forest management. He echoed that sentiment in an interview that aired Friday on Fox News.  Those who want to wrap [public lands] up in bubble wrap are fully content with watching our forests burn down,  he said. The Carr fire this summer <U+2015> then the sixth most destructive on record in California <U+2015> burned more than 200,000 acres, destroyed 1,600 structures and killed seven people, including three firefighters. November s Camp fire <U+2015> the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California s history <U+2015> engulfed more than 153,000 acres, killing at least 85 people and destroying nearly 14,000 homes.Scientific research has shown that climate change is contributing to the extreme fires raging across the West. It is true that the accumulation of fuel is a factor that contributes to increased fire activity; however, a 2016 study found that human-caused climate change had doubled the amount of land that burned in Western forests over a 30-year period by significantly drying out vegetation.Denise Boggs, director of Conservation Congress, a forest and wildlife advocacy group in California, told the Sacramento Bee that Trump s executive order won t work. All the fire ecologists are saying the same thing: You can t log your way out of this situation,  Boggs told the paper.  Logging in the back country is just a gift to the timber industry. "

Nine departments and several agencies with hundreds of thousands of workers began grinding to a halt following a legislative impasse after President Donald Trump threatened to close down part of the government if he didn t get funds for his border wall.The shutdown was assured when both the House and Senate adjourned Friday without reaching any compromise. Government funding for the departments and agencies lapsed at midnight.  We are hopeful that this lapse in appropriations will be of short duration,  White House budget chief and incoming chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said in a memo to government executives. Employees should report to work when scheduled to  undertake orderly shutdown activities,  he added, The Associated Press reported.Legislators scrambled throughout the day Friday to work out an arrangement to avoid a shutdown.There was chatter around Capitol Hill that Vice President Mike Pence was close to brokering a last-minute deal with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), but nothing materialized. House members could return from recess at noon Saturday. But the House doesn t intend to vote on anything else until there is action in the Senate. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told members he didn t expect any House votes on Saturday. He also said he d give lawmakers  ample  warning before there was a vote. We re totally prepared for a very long shutdown,  Trump threatened Friday, blaming the lapse in appropriations on the unwillingness of Democrats to pass $5.7 billion in funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.  This is our only chance that we ll ever have ... to get great border security.  Shortly before the House adjourned at 7 p.m., Trump tweeted that he was still awaiting a spending decision and that he had canceled his planned holiday departure to Mar-a-Lago.Some of the many Bills that I am signing in the Oval Office right now. Cancelled my trip on Air Force One to Florida while we wait to see if the Democrats will help us to protect America s Southern Border! pic.twitter.com/ws6LYhKcKlTrump has refused to sign any spending bill that doesn t include funding for his wall. But such legislation would be doomed in the Senate, where Republicans wouldn t be able to secure the required 60 votes <U+2015> or potentially even 50 votes.The Senate spent hours Friday holding a vote open, hoping that more GOP senators would come back to D.C. and agree to consider a bill passed by the House that contained money for a border wall. Eventually, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) switched his vote and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) voted yes to tie the vote at 47-47. Pence then broke the tie, allowing the Senate to proceed to the House-passed bill.But Corker and Flake said they supported the motion with the understanding that the next thing the Senate votes on would not be the House legislation with wall money.  There is no path forward for the House bill,  Flake flatly declared.Instead, the Senate intends to continue negotiating and not hold a vote on anything else until there is an agreement between Republicans, Democrats, the House, the Senate and the White House.McCarthy said the House wouldn t be back until the Senate had acted in some way, meaning Republicans don t plan on folding and passing the clean continuing resolution that passed the Senate unanimously earlier this week.Republicans are now holding out for something <U+2015> even if it s a face-saving deal.Even if lawmakers do strike a compromise <U+2015> such as giving Trump the original $1.6 billion for border security (but not a wall), which Democrats had offered weeks ago <U+2015> it s unlikely House conservatives would go for it. That means Trump may have to sign a bill without the support of a majority of the House GOP conference.It s also unclear at this point if House Democrats would support such a compromise <U+2015> an even more pressing question since they might be expected to supply the majority of the votes to pass a deal.At this point, there doesn t appear to be any easy agreement in the immediate offing. The weekend is starting and federal workers have Monday and Tuesday off for Christmas holidays, but a shutdown could extend past Tuesday.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has so far refused a vote on the clean continuing resolution, but he could likely get that bill to the president s desk if he allowed one.That bill, which would continue current spending on the remaining unfunded agencies through Feb. 8, does not include wall money, and Trump has said he won t sign it. But as the political and practical effects of a shutdown become real <U+2015> furloughed workers, missed paychecks for government employees and contractors <U+2015> it s still possible for Trump to punt again on this fight.It s also possible this shutdown could last indefinitely.Trump hasn t shown much willingness to cave since he indicated to House leaders that he wouldn t sign a bill without border wall funding, and he s been emboldened by a successful House vote to add $5.7 billion in funding for the wall.The shutdown will affect about 25 percent of government agencies, including Homeland Security, Justice, Transportation, Interior, Agriculture and State. It will stop the pay of around 800,000 government employees and contractors.Most of the government has already secured funding through the year, with the Pentagon, Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services all getting their funding through an earlier appropriations bill this year. Their operations   along with the legislative branch s   won t be impacted. Others, such as the federal courts, have secured temporary funding to keep them open for several weeks in the event of a shutdown. But for the federal workers affected by this shutdown, this could be a painful lapse in appropriations. Those workers won t receive a paycheck until there s a deal.This is a developing story.

If we don t get what we want, one way or the other, whether it s through you, through military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government,  Trump said during a televised Oval Office meeting with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). I am proud to shut down the government for border security.   I will take the mantle,  Trump said.  I will be the one to shut it down. The government is set to partially shut down at the end of Friday unless Congress and the president act. But Trump has suggested he ll keep his promise to force a shutdown. He announced on Thursday that he would not sign a budget extension the Senate passed to keep the government funded until February.Rep. Susan Collins (R-Maine) expressed frustration at the president when reporters told her about Trump s decision. Did he just say that?  she asked on Thursday.  Are you ruining my life? Schumer tweeted Friday pointing out Trump s said he would be the one to shut down the government. The senator said the president was throwing a  temper tantrum. You own the shutdown your own words, @realDonaldTrump. The Senate UNANIMOUSLY passed a bipartisan solution to avoid a shutdown. Then you threw another temper tantrum and convinced the House to ignore that compromise. #TrumpShutdown pic.twitter.com/h4R7Qk6E1iTrump has repeatedly gleefully called for a government shutdown when he hasn t gotten his way.But a shutdown over a border wall would hurt those working along the border, along with many other government workers. In the event of a government shutdown, Border Patrol agents would likely be among those working without pay.That could be the case for an extended period, Trump said Friday.  If the Dems vote no,  Trump tweeted,  there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

The wall, which Trump has repeatedly promised, still has not been started as Washington braces for a government shutdown over the president s demand for taxpayer funding. If we can fund a large portion of this wall, it will jumpstart things and will be less money Trump has to secure from our politicians,  Kolfage wrote on the GoFundMe page for the wall campaign.More than 180,000 people had donated a staggering $12 million as of Friday morning. Kolfage is still eons away from his $1 billion goal, and it s unclear what will happen to the money. As USA Today noted, private citizens need congressional approval before they can donate money directly to the Department of Homeland Security.Kolfage told HuffPost he had  several options on the table,  including donating the money to an unspecified charity that he said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) recommended. He also said he didn t know how long he would keep the fundraiser open, but that it wouldn t be indefinite. We don t know [what comes next], we re just playing it by ear,  he said.  We re waiting to see what happens with the wall itself.  Kolfage said he has discussed the fundraiser with someone in the White House  inner circle,  but he declined to say who. Unlike other fundraising websites, GoFundMe doesn t automatically return donations if a goal isn t reached. Kolfage said the charity website wouldn t allow him to choose a higher target than $1 billion, which is only 20 percent of the funding Trump has requested from Congress for the wall.And what if Congress does end up paying for the wall? Kolfage said he would try to return the donations but claimed he has already gotten pushback from participants who don t want to see their money returned. The American people want the wall,  he said.Meanwhile, a number of opposing fundraising efforts have popped up in response to the wall campaign, including one for ladders and another to build an escalator. A statement on Kolfage s GoFundMe page insists the fundraiser is not a scam because  [p]eople who try to scam you will not be upfront with their information. However, Kolfage failed to disclose that he once ran a series of Facebook pages that were shut down in a crackdown on spam. According to NBC News, the Facebook pages sent users to affiliate websites, using conspiracy theories and racist content to drive traffic.Kolfage told The Guardian at the time that the Facebook crackdown was  a complete shock.  He then created a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for a legal effort to revive the pages.  Facebook shut down my primary source of income by deleting my pages,  he wrote, claiming he was working with a  major law firm. Kolfage told NBC News he didn t disclose the Facebook controversy on the wall website because  my personal issues have nothing to do with building the wall. Kolfage, who is a triple amputee, also made waves in 2015 over his opposition to a rainbow flag seen at an Arizona Air Force base. He called the flag <U+2015> an apparent gay pride symbol <U+2015> a  perversion of Old Glory  in an article for the Blaze.In other articles for the conservative site, Kolfage attacked a prominent imam for speaking Arabic at a Veterans Day event and claimed without evidence that a former adviser to then-President Barack Obama was sympathetic to terrorists.This article has been updated to include comments from Kolfage and some of his history of controversy.

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) marveled at the chaos on Capitol Hill on Thursday as President Donald Trump suddenly refused to sign a temporary spending bill passed by the Senate and threatened   again   to shut down the government. Y all have fun,  Corker told journalists, apparently relieved to be heading home for the holidays.  I might not see y all again for a while. I m getting ready to drive to Chattanooga. The House voted in a scramble Thursday night to pass a measure that would provide more than $5 billion for Trump s promised border wall, reported USA Today. But the measure has little chance of passing the Senate in a planned vote Friday. And scores of lawmakers have already left town for the holidays.On the House floor, leaders scrambling to see if they can pass $5 billion in wall funding as Republicans say they want President Trump to tweet before they say  yes.   That s what the fuck serving in Congress has come to,  one GOP member of Congress tells me.Corker said there was no real leadership to help move out of the legislative morass.  I think they re just sorta swirling around,  he told reporters.When asked if he would return for an upcoming vote, Corker said:  I doubt it.  Asked what would happen next, Corker responded:  Who knows? Does the person sitting beside [the president] at the White House know? Corker compared Trump s change of heart in signing a temporary spending bill to his  precipitous  decision Wednesday to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, which the senator warned will have a far more significant long-term impact.He laughed again as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) walked by and told reporters:  I think we need to follow through  with funding for the wall.Corker quipped:  You can t make this stuff up.

This week, as the federal government faces a possible shutdown over Trump s insistence on more funding for border security, the wall of his campaign trail appears to be nowhere in sight.Here s a brief look at Trump s evolution in talking about that wall:Trump s vow that he would  build the wall  was unequivocal throughout his campaign and reiterated in one way or another in almost every rally, speech and interview.The promise went more or less along the lines of this comment to CNN in July 2015: I will build the wall and Mexico s going to pay for it and they will be happy to pay for it. Because Mexico is making so much money from the United States that that s going to be peanuts. And all these other characters say,  Oh, they won t pay, they won t pay.  They don t know the first thing about how to negotiate. Trust me, Mexico will pay for it. In the days following Trump s presidential win, the wall proposal developed some holes. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was one of Trump s earliest and most prominent supporters leading up to the election, admitted shortly afterward that the whole business about Mexico paying for the structure was little more than a  great campaign device.  And Trump told CBS just days after his victory that he would be open to the idea of a fence.  Would you accept a fence?  the president-elect was asked by  60 Minutes  correspondent Lesley Stahl. For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,  Trump responded.  I m very good at this. It s called construction. Stahl continued to press him, asking,  So part wall, part fence?  Yeah, it could be,  he said.  It could be some fencing. By May 2017, Trump was boasting that his administration was already beginning construction on the wall and that a government funding deal recently reached by Congress included a  down payment on the border wall.  (It didn t.)Then-budget director Mick Mulvaney clarified that the administration would be erecting a 20-foot-tall steel fence to replace existing portions of chain-link fencing along the border.Throughout the first half of 2018, Trump and administration officials were firmly declaring that construction on the wall had begun. It s not  build that wall  anymore. It s  continue building that wall,   the president said at a July rally in South Carolina.  Because we re building it! What he might have been referring to was what Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen described in April as more like upgrades on the existing barrier along portions of the southern border.  To us, it s all new wall,  Nielsen said at a White House briefing.  If there was a wall before that needs to be replaced, it s being replaced by a new wall. This is Trump s border wall. The truth is that not a single mile of new barrier has been constructed along the Mexican border during Trump s presidency. As HuffPost s S.V. Date wrote earlier this month:  There were 654 miles of physical barrier on the day Trump was inaugurated president, and there are 654 miles today. As of December, the president was going with  artistically designed steel slats  to describe his still-promised wall.Trump addressed the possible government shutdown over border security issues ahead of signing the farm bill on Thursday afternoon. He reiterated some of his main talking points on the need for a border wall, but with his newly phrased caveat. At this moment there is a debate over funding border security and the wall <U+2015> also called, so that I give them a bit of an out,  steel slats,   the president said.  We don t use the word  wall  necessarily. TRUMP on govt shutdown:  At this moment there is a debate over funding border security and the wall -- also called, so that I give them a little bit of an out,  steel slats.  We don t use the word  wall  necessarily, but it has to be something special to do the job.  pic.twitter.com/n1uKFFa4UURudy Giuliani, one of Trump s personal attorneys, also suggested on Thursday that the  wall  could be more of a metaphor for increased border security, which could actually take a number of different forms. He suggested using advanced technology to detect and capture undocumented immigrants instead. I don t see the magic in a wall, as long as there s some form of improved barrier that picks up penetration,  Giuliani told CNBC.  I could build a wall for him with long-range cameras and security. He needs something. I think he d compromise if he got most of what he wanted. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Or will he find some way to claim he has  won  on the issue and fly south on schedule?Or will he truly defy expectations by rejecting a temporary spending bill and going to Palm Beach anyway amid a partial government shutdown?Americans will find out, one way or another, in this season s finale of the Donald Trump presidency Friday.On Thursday, Trump brought shutdown fever to a boil with a tweet threatening a veto of a two-month spending package   before appearing to talk himself down at a bill signing, where he said he wanted money for  border security  and a physical barrier but not making specific demands about either. I ve made my position very clear. Any measure that funds the government must include border security. Has to,  Trump said in prepared remarks he delivered just before he signed this year s farm bill into law. He added that money must also be there for some type of barrier.  We ll see what we can do. Hopefully, that will all come together. Notably, though, Trump did not name a dollar figure for what he would need to sign the bill. Nor did he state what project or projects would have to be funded.The spending bill extension passed by the Senate late Wednesday continues funding at a $1.6 billion annual rate for refurbishing and upgrading the existing fence on about one-third of the U.S.-Mexico border   thus meeting both of Trump s stated requirements.Whether that s enough for Trump s hard-core base is unclear.North Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Meadows, a close Trump ally, said the word from residents in his district was  get it done  and that  we build it.  What I heard very loudly and very clearly from my constituents is they don t want us to just give up on this particular issue, and so it s important that we fight on their behalf,  he said.Trump earlier in the day wrote on Twitter that the Senate-passed bill was not good enough.  When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership. Would be done by end of year (NOW),  Trump wrote.  It didn t happen! We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good! Hours later, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Meadows and fellow Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) met with Trump at the White House, after which Ryan said Trump made it clear he would not sign what the Senate passed. The president informed us that he will not sign the bill that came up from the Senate last evening because of his legitimate concerns for border security,  Ryan said afterward.That, though, was not long before Trump seemed to soften his demands at the farm bill signing.If Thursday s spending bill crisis seemed familiar, that s because it was a repeat of an episode from earlier in the year, when Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill to keep the entire government funded through the end of the budget year in September.Trump s budget director held a press briefing the day before the scheduled signing and assured reporters that Trump would sign the measure, even though it had no money for the border wall.But that night and the following morning, Trump s readiness to approve a spending package that was that big but did not include even a single dollar to build the wall that he had promised was hammered on by Fox News hosts. Trump responded with a tweet suggesting he would veto the package. Congressional Republicans scrambled to talk Trump out of that threat.Trump wound up signing the bill, claiming he was doing so because of all the money it contained for the military, and vowed not to sign another one if it did not include wall money.But he has since approved two more funding bills for the Department of Homeland Security that did not contain money for the border wall. The first was in September, at the urging of congressional Republicans who warned that a shutdown so close to the November midterms would hurt them. The second was two weeks ago, because of the death and subsequent state funeral of former President George H.W. Bush.And Thursday s heightened, then lowered shutdown tensions follow a week of such oscillations. Last week Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) and the likely next House speaker, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), that he would be  proud  to shoulder the responsibility for a partial shutdown.Since then, though, the White House sent signals that Trump was seeking to avoid a shutdown. First, it said that a compromise number between the $1.6 billion that Democrats support and the $5 billion that Trump wants would be acceptable. And White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Tuesday that Trump would be able to find money for his wall from other sources.Critical coverage on Fox and by radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh in the past two days appeared to have yet again pushed Trump toward favoring a veto. Limbaugh on Thursday told his listeners that Trump had, during the program, assured him that he would veto a bill that did not pay for his wall.Trump promised many hundreds of times during his campaign that American taxpayers would not have to pay anything for his 30-foot-tall, concrete  great wall  because he would force Mexico to pay for it. But nearly two years into his presidency, Trump has yet to publicly broach the subject even a single time with that country s leaders.The make-Mexico-pay part was quietly dropped almost immediately upon taking office. In a phone call with Mexico s president at the time, according to leaked transcripts published by the Washington Post, Trump told Enrique PeÒa Nieto that he understood that Mexico would not pay for the wall but asked him not to say that publicly so Trump would not lose standing among his base.About three-quarters of the federal workforce would be unaffected by a partial shutdown, as their agencies were funded through September 2019 in earlier spending bills. A partial shutdown that would start at midnight Friday would affect the departments of Homeland Security, State, the Treasury and the Interior. Many of the affected employees would be deemed essential and be forced to work anyway. None would be paid during the shutdown and would have to get by on savings or short-term loans.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) to head a revived U.S. House panel on climate change, all but ending a dramatic monthlong effort to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal.Castor s appointment came as a surprise to proponents of a Green New Deal. The move also kicked off a controversy as the six-term congresswoman dismissed calls to bar members who accept money from fossil fuel companies from serving on the committee, arguing it would violate free speech rights. Despite weeks of protests demanding House Democrats focus efforts next year on drafting a Green New Deal, the sort of sweeping economic policy that scientists say matches the scale of the climate crisis, Castor told E&E News the plan was  not going to be our sole focus. She then suggested that barring members who have accepted donations from the oil, gas and coal industries from serving on the committee could be unconstitutional.  I don t think you can do that under the First Amendment, really,  she said.That reasoning echoed arguments Exxon Mobil Corp. made in court as recently as this year to defend its funding of right-wing think tanks that deliberately produced misinformation about climate science to stymie government action on global warming. Soon after the remarks were published, Castor walked back the statement in an interview with HuffPost, calling it an  inartful answer. But she said she did not know whether, as chairperson, she could bar members on the committee from serving if they accepted fossil fuel donations.  Maybe that s a discussion we need to have in the caucus,  Castor said. It s a stunning upset, essentially returning Democrats to the original plan leaders laid out before the protests began in November. The announcement comes as a loss for Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Her meteoric rise and devoted base made it seem as if she were poised to win the burgeoning cadre of leftist Democrats a beachhead in a select committee that, even with limited capacity, would have demonstrated tangible power in Washington. But, if it s defeat, it s bittersweet. The campaign, seemingly quixotic at first, shifted the stagnant climate policy debate not just to the left but, for the first time, in the direction of policies that could make a dent in surging global emissions and curb soaring income inequality. Coupled with back-to-back United Nations and federal reports that showed climate change already rapidly worsening, the effort established a new litmus test for lawmakers, breaking the binary of whether or not a politicians  believes  in the science of human-caused warming. The movement gained stunning support in just a few weeks. A poll released Monday found 81 percent of registered voters supported the policies outlined under the Green New Deal resolution <U+2015> including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of self-described conservative Republicans. Last Friday, more than 300 state and local officials voiced support for a Green New Deal in an open letter.  We don t have time to sit on our hands as our planet burns,  Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday in a tweet.  For young people, climate change is bigger than election or re-election. It s life or death. It s unclear whether Ocasio-Cortez will even get a seat on the select committee. Asked if she accepted money from fossil fuel companies, Castor said,  I cannot think of a contribution from an oil company or fossil fuel company, but I cannot say without going back and with a fine-toothed comb that there wasn t something in the past. According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, Castor accepted more than $73,000 from the energy and natural resources sector over her 12-year tenure in Congress, including $60,000 from corporate political action committees. The League of Conservation Voters gave Castor an 86 percent score last year on its ranking, which is based on her voting record. She had a 93 percent lifetime score. She said she would consider taking the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge, a vow overseen by a handful of progressive groups including proponents of a Green New Deal. Asked what the decision hinged on, Castor said,  I don t know.  We re at year-end with a possible shutdown and I think the important thing is looking at folks for the committee who are ready to serve,  she said. The restoration of the select committee on climate change puts an end to a month-long effort to replace it with a panel focused specifically on crafting a Green New Deal, an umbrella term for a suite of policies that would include shifting the United States to 100 percent renewable energy over the next decade and guaranteeing high-wage, federally backed jobs to workers in outmoded industries.The proposal stormed into mainstream political debate over the past month after protesters from the progressive groups Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats held sit-ins in Pelosi s office. The demonstrations came in response to what they saw as plans for a tepid response to the climate crisis when the party takes control of the House next month.Ocasio-Cortez, a left-wing firebrand with a powerful online following, joined the protests and proposed swapping Pelosi s plan to restore the climate select committee with a plan for a panel devoted to the Green New Deal. For a few weeks, it seemed likely to happen. More than 40 incoming or sitting House Democrats pledged to support the resolution, and nearly half a dozen senators announced their support for the effort, including at least three likely 2020 presidential contenders. But the proposal ruffled feathers in Washington. Incoming chairmen of committees that traditionally oversee energy and environmental policy complained that a Green New Deal select committee would strip them of legislative power. And Beltway veterans privately expressed frustration that a cadre of insurgent freshmen, some of whom toppled long-time allies in primaries, were using their grassroots popularity to call shots.Democratic leaders responded in kind, declining to contact activists or Ocasio-Cortez before announcing plans to ignore the resolution and restore the previous climate select committee instead. Representatives from Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats confirmed they were not told of the decision until they read about it on E&E News. Castor said she  chatted with Rep.-elect Ocasio-Cortez, but not specifically on this.  In a statement, Sunrise Movement said a select committee  that makes a plan for implementing a Green New Deal is an opportunity for Democrats in the House.   Without a mandate to create a plan and a requirement that its members don t take fossil fuel money, we are deeply concerned that this committee will be just another of the many committees we ve seen failing our generation our entire lives,  Varshini Prakash, the Sunrise Movement s co-founder, said in a statement.Later Thursday evening, Sunrise political director Evan Weber said the group would continue the fight.  Nancy Pelosi has the power to determine whether or not the Select Committee for a Green New Deal lives or dies,  Weber said.  Sunrise Movement s position is and will continue to be that it s not over until she makes it clear that it s over.  But, earlier this week, Democratic leaders announced that a Green New Deal select committee would lack subpoena power, seemingly sounding the death knell for the resolution. Castor said the select committee she agreed to chair would likely have subpoena power, but not legislative power. She said she did not know yet which individuals or companies she would use that power to investigate.   I honestly thought the Democratic Party leaders would see this opportunity,  said Waleed Shahid, the communications director for Justice Democrats, a left-wing group championing the Green New Deal proposal.  It s infuriating to see a fellow Democrat basically parrot the talking points of the Koch Brothers when it comes to the very common-sense idea that any politician who accepts donations from the fossil-fuel corporations should not be allowed to legislate on climate change.  But Castor s appointment won praise from establishment environmental groups.  Rep. Kathy Castor is an outstanding choice to help lead the House s renewed focus on climate change,  John Bowman, senior director for federal affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement.  As a longtime environmental champion, few are better suited to help shine a bright light on the threats Americans face from the climate crisis and advance the solutions we urgently need. This article has been updated with a statement from the Sunrise Movement that it plans to continue to fight for a select committee.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The president has threatened a government shutdown unless lawmakers approve $5 billion in wall funding, and has tweeted that the U.S. military will build the wall. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said there are  other ways  to secure the $5 billion Trump is seeking.Going against her fellow panelists, Kennedy said she found herself in the rare position of agreeing with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who opposes wall funding. That s not the way the government works,  Kennedy said.  You can t just take $1 billion from this program, $1 billion from over here, and then put it toward your pet project. If this were the Obama administration and President Obama had done that with Solyndra, and taken money from the defense budget for a solar panel company, we would all be up in arms. (Solyndra, which benefited from the government s 2009 economic stimulus before going bankrupt, was a favorite conservative talking point during the Obama years.)Kennedy went on to say that the Trump administration s proposed wall workaround is  really not OK  and  not how the government should function.

Trump has been shaky on another continuing resolution (CR) without wall money for some time, but he signaled Wednesday that he would probably sign such a bill. By Thursday, he had already changed his mind.The White House suggested earlier in the day that the president was unhappy with the legislation and had begun blaming Republican leaders for  caving  on funding for his plans for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership,  Trump tweeted Thursday morning.  Would be done by end of year (NOW). It didn t happen! We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good! White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended Trump and reaffirmed the president s position.  At this moment, the president does not want to go further without border security. Paul Ryan says Trump  won t sign this bill,  referring to a Senate-passed stop-gap spending bill to avoid a shutdown by Friday. Shutdown now appears far more likely. Trump had signaled to Hill earlier he would signTrump may still end up signing the CR, but it appears now that House Republicans will first try to pass a funding bill that includes wall money. That may also still be tough. If the legislation to keep some agencies open past Friday does include wall funding, it s unlikely that a single Democrat will vote for the bill. That would leave Republicans on their own to pass the measure <U+2015> and a healthy number of GOP absences makes that difficult.There s also the question of how many Republicans would vote against wall funding on policy concerns. There are at least a few House Republicans who have previously indicated they re opposed to paying for the wall, and conservatives who generally oppose funding bills on spending concerns have indicated they would only support a CR if it included wall money and asylum policy changes.Conservatives may already be backing off those policy riders. Freedom Caucus member Scott Perry (R-Pa.) told HuffPost Thursday afternoon that he could potentially see conservatives backing off those earlier demands in the interest of trying to get the wall. But Republicans could shortly find themselves in the same position later Thursday, unable to pass CR with wall funding on their own, and with a president who s signaling opposition to any other bill.Republicans could always pass the clean CR that the Senate passed by unanimous consent Wednesday night, but they would be doing so over the objections of the president and likely more than half of the GOP conference.Trump would then be in the awkward position of vetoing the legislation, or simply pocketing it and letting the clock run out on this Congress <U+2015> all while some government agencies are closed down over the holidays and workers aren t receiving their paychecks.Democrats, meanwhile, are sitting by watching Republicans squirm.Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) slammed her GOP colleagues Thursday morning for being in the midst of a party  meltdown,  and she once again indicated wall funding was a  non-starter.  They have a lot of people who are missing, who are absent here, so they never did have the votes for their wall,  Pelosi said.  But they now don t even have a full complement of members here. If the government does shut down, thousands of federal workers will be sent home without pay beginning Saturday. The partial shutdown would affect about 25 percent of federal workers, but key functions of the government will remain open, including the military.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

He d been caught in a trap <U+2015> lured into an auditorium by the promise of a speech about fiscal responsibility. Instead, President Barack Obama was lecturing the crowd about why it would be wrong to balance the budget by impoverishing old people. Obama didn t mention Ryan s name, but in Ryan s mind, the president might as well have addressed the speech to him. Everybody could see Ryan, just sitting there in the front row of an auditorium at George Washington University. One of his colleagues leaned over and asked if they should leave. No, Ryan said. They should stay; they were being watched. He had noticed a photographer with a camera mounted on a unipod, its long lens pointed straight at him. He sat rigidly in his chair. It had all been a setup. To Ryan, Obama s breach of decorum in April 2011 <U+2015> in which he lightly criticized Ryan s budget while calling for entitlement reform himself <U+2015> was Exhibit A in the case against Obama. According to Ryan, it meant Obama was unwilling to work across party lines to solve policy problems. It was an affront to fiscal responsibility and the Beltway Norms. A stunning contrast between the two men <U+2015> one a partisan politician and the other a serious policy wonk. His false attacks were offensive, even by the low standards for discourse and civility in Washington, D.C.,  Ryan recalled in his 2014 book, in which he devoted eight pages to the incident.The story has been retold in at least three books, with Ryan denouncing Obama s  demagoguery  each time.In retrospect, of course, in light of the current president s constant depredations <U+2015> against civility, against the discourse, even against Ryan himself <U+2015> Obama s speech was the political equivalent of using the wrong fork at a dinner party. The idea that the speech amounted to some great offense, by the standard Ryan has set not even six years later, is patently absurd. Whereas Obama didn t even mention Ryan by name in the infamous speech, President Donald Trump has repeatedly insulted Ryan directly, calling the House speaker  weak and ineffective  and a  Boy Scout  and saying he  knows nothing,  though Trump has more recently said he has come to appreciate Ryan  like a fine wine. (Reminder: Trump doesn t drink.) While Ryan made a habit of bashing Obama <U+2015> his reaction to Obama s last State of the Union address was to say Obama  degrades the presidency  because Obama warned against then-candidate Trump s divisive rhetoric <U+2015> he has famously stood by Trump, greeting the president s near-daily embarrassments with cheery unawareness. Even when Ryan couldn t avoid Trump s scandals, he continued to praise Trump as  thoughtful,   refreshing  and  exquisite. It s all part of the fiction that Ryan chooses to live in <U+2015> a fiction in which Trump is restoring honor to the presidency and his behavior is to be downplayed, dismissed or outright ignored. And it s that blithe fiction, contrasted with our graphic, Trump-y reality, for which Ryan should be remembered.When Ryan leaves office in January, he will not have balanced the budget or fixed Congress or solved poverty or left our politics smarter or less divided. Instead, during his three-year tenure as speaker, the deficit has nearly doubled. The procedural problems in Congress are more daunting. Poverty isn t much different. And our politics are more partisan, less ideological, than maybe ever before.The version of Paul Ryan that he and his staff tried to project for years <U+2015> the image of a squeaky-clean numbers guy, rolling up his sleeves, solving tough policy problems <U+2015> is a sham. According to a number of polls, many people now recognize him as a monumental partisan, a politician who won a reputation as a wonk because he was able to memorize a few lines from an actuarial table and then promptly ignore his own pledges to balance the budget when he had the chance. Ryan is the man who, perhaps more than anybody else, normalized Trump, who led reluctant Republicans back to Trump, who went along with the president even when he knew he shouldn t and traded his dignity for a tax cut.This week, Ryan and his office released a six-part video series on his decades-long quest to reform the tax code. But he didn t reform our tax code. When all the new guidance is issued, the 40,000-page tax code is likely to be even longer. He simply cut taxes <U+2015> or, at least, he didn t stand in the way. It turned out that cutting taxes by $1.5 trillion wasn t all that hard, as long as  conservatives  were on board with not paying for tax cuts. The grand irony of  tax reform  is that, for all the credit Ryan and his staff try to give him for the bill, the final legislation was closer to the principles that Freedom Caucus leaders like Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) laid out: a corporate rate at 20 percent, a bigger standard deduction and cuts that weren t paid for.Ryan wanted a bill that was at least mostly revenue-neutral (it ended up costing more than a trillion dollars over 10 years), that would allow individuals to fill out their tax returns on a postcard (that didn t happen) and that had a corporate rate closer to 25 percent (it ended up at 21 percent).He almost blew up the tax bill by insisting on a border adjustment tax to offset some of the cuts. It wasn t until he gave up on the BAT <U+2015> a tarifflike tax that would have increased prices on imports and also, theoretically, increased the value of the dollar <U+2015> that tax reform became a reality. And it was the Senate that played the biggest role in shaping the tax bill, with Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) deciding how much debt was acceptable to rack up. In conference, when differences between the two chambers  versions are resolved, legislators took the Senate version on a number of important provisions <U+2015> pass-through income, international regulations, the child tax credit <U+2015> and ditched a bunch of politically perilous, revenue-raising ideas from the House, like ending deductions on medical expenses and student loans.Ryan s signature achievement of tax reform is neither actually his nor actually an achievement. Yes, the economy is doing well. But there was low unemployment and economic growth before the tax cuts. A year after it was enacted, the bill remains unpopular. The stock market has basically run sideways since the GOP s tax bill was enacted <U+2015> the S&P 500 is down on the year <U+2015> and wages for workers have barely grown. The tax cuts were supposed to spur investment and put more money in everyone s pocket. Instead, they prompted a small round of one-time bonuses, a huge number of stock buybacks and deficits that will persist for decades.And yet, in true Ryan form, he seeks out another round of feting, when most politicians would have the self-awareness to quietly exit out the back.It s possible that he will hand over the speaker s gavel to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during a partial government shutdown, because he and other Republicans refuse to level with Trump and tell him he s not getting his border wall. A short-term funding bill, looking more likely by the hour, would be more of the same avoidance. It would be stage one in the grieving process.But denial has been one of Ryan s favorite strategies with Trump. Ryan has been satisfied to try to influence government and the president at the periphery. When Ryan became aware recently that there were more than 10,000 unused work visas, he pushed through legislation making sure Irish nationals would have access to those visas. When Trump said he might try to end birthright citizenship, Ryan suggested such a move would have to come from Congress, which prompted Trump to say that Ryan  knows nothing  about the issue and should be focused on holding the GOP majority <U+2015> something Ryan wasn t able to do. The speaker oversaw the largest Republican losses in 44 years.Ryan never responded to Trump s diss. The direct insults from Trump never seemed to rankle Ryan the same way Obama s indirect slights appeared to bother him.A simple truth of Ryan s career is that he spent every day fighting to help people who didn t need help. It was always about cutting taxes, and as big of a game as he talked on the debt, when he had the chance to do something about entitlements or spending, he cowered from the challenge.As part of his farewell tour, he said in November that his two biggest regrets were failing to tackle immigration reform and not addressing the growing national debt. He also theorized that history would be kind to his speakership and the GOP Congress he ruled over, partly because of the tax cuts that passed under his watch.But there s no evidence that the tax cuts are getting more popular or becoming more effective, and there s no indication that Republicans are getting more serious about debt. To take the issue of debt seriously for a moment <U+2015> something Republicans (and Democrats) don t do <U+2015> we ve incurred enough debt at this point that the interest payments on our $21 trillion hole will ensure that we never see a balanced budget again without massive spending cuts and tax increases.For Ryan, this might not be much of a contradiction. Cutting taxes is core to the Republican mission, while the debt is a political tool used to bash Democrats and to justify welfare cuts. The media and the public just fell for the GOP ruse. History will not be kind to a president who, when it came time to confront our generation s defining challenge, chose to duck and run,  Ryan said of Obama after the president once again criticized the House GOP budget in 2012.But when it was his party controlling Congress and the White House, during a time of economic prosperity, when Washington has traditionally looked to realign the federal budget, Ryan didn t shrink the deficit; he nearly doubled it, through a combination of spending increases and tax cuts. Legislation enacted since Trump took office will add $2.7 trillion to the national debt. The tax cuts and spending bills enacted in fiscal 2018 alone will widen 2019 s deficit by $445 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And the yearly deficit, which was $585 billion in fiscal 2016 <U+2015> the year Ryan took the speakership <U+2015> will be roughly $1 trillion when he leaves office.When Ryan announced his retirement from Congress in April, he cheered the spending increases for the military that Republicans locked into spending agreements. Those Pentagon plus-ups, paired with domestic spending increases to appease Democrats, have ballooned the deficit. In 2011, conservatives in Congress refused to go along with increases to spending or the debt ceiling without a plan to restrain the deficit. What they came up with was the Budget Control Act, which set caps for defense and nondefense spending for the next 10 years. Except lawmakers have refused to live by those caps. Congress has honored the spending limits exactly zero times. The Pentagon particularly seems unwilling to abide by the limits. And Republicans like Ryan cheer on the military budget increases, even as the Pentagon has never completed an audit.Ryan entered the speakership by saying he wanted to pass a new Authorization for Use of Military Force. We ve justified more than three dozen military operations in more than a dozen countries using the overly broad authorization from 2001.  It would be a good sign for American foreign policy to have a new one updating our AUMF,  Ryan said in December 2015.But he spent the next three years blocking a new AUMF, saying he wouldn t allow debate on any bill that would restrict the ability of the military to fight. Just last week, Ryan attached special instructions to a rule for the farm bill that would waive provisions in the War Powers Resolution so he could block debate on a resolution about U.S. support for a war in Yemen <U+2015> a war that has created what the United Nations called  the worst man-made humanitarian crisis of our time.  An estimated 85,000 Yemeni children have died from starvation associated with the war, and an additional 17 million Yemenis are at risk of malnutrition.Ryan s efforts to block debate on war are entirely consistent with his actions as speaker but totally inconsistent with his message as he took the gavel. He said he wanted to return to regular order, that he wanted to allow debate on bills and amendments on the House floor.Instead, there was one open rule during the entirety of his speakership, meaning there was only one bill to which members could offer any amendment they wanted, as long as it pertained to the bill and wasn t written on the fly. He oversaw what may go down as the most closed Congress of all time. And rather than address immigration or entitlement reform or war or guns or children being separated from their parents at the border or a bill protecting Robert Mueller s investigation, Ryan was satisfied to use the House to pass uncontroversial bills renaming post offices or selling federal land to pump up the number of bills the House passed and Trump signed.The Republican calls to read the bill <U+2015> calls that helped propel them to the majority in 2010 <U+2015> have been replaced with Ryan ramming through a 2,232-page bill funding the government 17 hours after leaders released the text. Amazingly, on the same day the House passed that bill, he said he had done  a phenomenal job  restoring regular order.On Wednesday, Ryan took to the Great Hall in the Library of Congress for yet another goodbye speech. It was almost exactly three years since Ryan delivered a speech in that room at the beginning of his speakership. But what was supposed to be a farewell was really more of the same calls he made in the past for reform <U+2015> on debt, on immigration and on poverty.As Vox recently remarked in a headline,  Paul Ryan really wishes the House speaker would fix immigration and the debt.  Ryan is the speaker who didn t seem to realize that he had the power to do things, that he could do more than cut taxes and that achieving results would take more than grandiose speeches echoing hollowly through the Great Hall in the Library of Congress.One particular issue that Ryan simply seemed to give up on was poverty. After the 2012 presidential election, when he was mocked for a soup kitchen photo op in which he seemed to be washing pots and pans that were already clean, Ryan launched himself into what he called a  poverty tour.  He traveled the country visiting nonprofit organizations that sought to rehabilitate poor people with criminal histories or drug problems. He came up with a bunch of proposals that were basically a rebranding of welfare cuts, and he built his case for cutting assistance to the poor on a false claim: that the War on Poverty had failed.That is all consistent with the Ryan we ve all come to know. But one of the reasons he was able to con so many people for so long was that he wasn t incapable of coming up with an interesting idea from time to time. He had elements of self-reflection and regret, like when he said in early 2016 that it was wrong of him to have used the frame  makers and takers. In 2014, instead of simply claiming that government programs that help poor people actually make them worse off <U+2015> and that therefore antipoverty spending should be cut <U+2015> Ryan did something different. He said the government should hire case managers who could work with poor people to create a  customized life plan to provide a structured roadmap out of poverty. Case management was the centerpiece of his proposal to reform the federal government s antipoverty programs into an  opportunity grant.  The proposal and the poverty tour figured prominently in his 2014 book,  The Way Forward,  which is the type of book politicians write when they re thinking about running for president. He portrayed poverty policy as a consistent area of concern during his career, ever since his days working as an aide to Jack Kemp, a former congressman who called himself a  bleeding-heart conservative.  But commentators from both sides thought the idea of a  customized life plan  was weird. And so Ryan backed away.  We re saying this is one of the things we recommend, but give the states the ability to try other ideas,  he told HuffPost in 2014. After he became speaker and Trump became president, Ryan had a chance to make his poverty agenda a reality. Instead, he used his time and political capital trying to take health care from millions of poor people <U+2015> remember, the House GOP health care plan included $834 billion in cuts to Medicaid <U+2015> and then passing a tax cut. He gave up on poverty.He said Wednesday that solving poverty will require  a great rethinking of how we help the most vulnerable among us.  And without a shred of self-awareness or irony, he urged his Republican colleagues to not  let this issue drift from your consciousness.  The sincerity with which Paul Ryan believed in the myth of Paul Ryan was perhaps why it was so effective. During his speech Wednesday, he decried how outrage had become a  brand,  how we all needed to disregard  the noise. But what Ryan deems noise and what he thinks warrants outrage have a distinctly partisan slant. When Trump tweeted that he was considering revoking the security clearances of his political enemies, Ryan said Trump was  just trolling.  When Trump attacks fellow Republicans or when he lies outright or suggests breaking into the Democratic National Committee, that s just to be ignored.  All this stuff you see on a daily basis on Twitter this and Twitter that   forget about it,  Ryan said in October 2017.Except that was not how Ryan treated Obama. Ryan said Obama was the nation s worst president. Ryan relentlessly attacked Obama and took horrible offense during the 2011 speech in which Obama agreed that the nation needed to tackle entitlements.In Bob Woodward s telling,  Ryan felt betrayed. He d expected an olive branch. What he got was the finger. What was the appalling criticism that Obama had made?One of the most egregious insults was that Obama noted Ryan s budget would transfer Medicare to a voucher system.  And if that voucher isn t worth enough to buy the insurance that s available in the open marketplace, well, tough luck   you re on your own,  Obama said.And how did the Congressional Budget Office describe Ryan s budget?  Under the proposal, most elderly people who would be entitled to premium support payments would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system. Obama wasn t wrong, though he would later tell Woodward he thought he made a mistake by embarrassing Ryan. Obama had accurately described what Ryan s proposal would do. Ryan was just upset that the reality of his budget didn t measure up to his inflated self-image, of a man whose ideas transcend politics, of a should-be president delivering speeches at a prestigious university or in the marbled Great Hall of the Library of Congress.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The president has asked every agency to look and see if they have money that they can use for that purpose,  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday.It s unclear how much money that could produce, and whether Trump could legally order it transferred between agencies without permission from Congress.Stan Collender, a longtime former budget staffer on Capitol Hill, said agencies had  very limited  ability to transfer money to each other.  Usually requires at least tacit congressional approval,  he added.  Finding $5 billion will be very hard and have long-term negative implications for Trump with appropriators. About a fourth of the federal government will run out of operating money Friday at midnight. Trump has threatened to allow a shutdown of those agencies <U+2015> which include the departments of Homeland Security, Justice, State and Interior   if Congress fails to include $5 billion to start a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.But with Congress appearing unlikely to approve anything beyond the existing $1.6 billion for border security improvements   but not a border wall   Trump s White House has started to signal that it might be able to get the money in other ways. We ll see what happens. It s too early to say,  Trump said during a Tuesday photo opportunity when he was asked about a possible shutdown.  We need border security. He promised many hundreds of times during his campaign that American taxpayers would not have to pay anything for his 30-foot-tall, concrete  great wall  because he would force Mexico to pay for it. But nearly two years into his presidency, he has yet to broach the subject even a single time with that country s leaders.Asked about that promise during a rare White House press briefing Tuesday, Sanders first claimed   falsely   that money transferred from other agencies did not constitute American taxpayer money. Then she claimed   also falsely <U+2015> that the North American Free Trade Agreement that Trump has rebranded as the United StatesñMexicoñCanada Agreement will effectively make Mexico pay for the wall. We re not asking Americans taxpayers for that. We are looking at existing funding through other agencies right now that we can draw on to do that immediately,  Sanders said. She added, referring to increased tax revenue from the modified trade deal,  We could pay for the wall four times over. ... We re talking about additional revenue that wouldn t have existed without the president getting a new deal. But trade economists say that only one provision of the revised deal would directly increase collections by the U.S. Treasury: a 2.5 percent tariff that would be imposed on cars made in Mexico that did not have at least 75 percent content made in North America. The current threshold is 62.5 percent.That provision would bring in only about $600 million a year   nowhere near enough to pay for a $25 billion wall, even after two decades. More important, that tariff would be paid by those who purchase cars in the United States, not the government of Mexico. Ultimately, who s affected by the tariffs is the American consumer, who will pay more for cars,  said Monica de Bolle of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Funding for a number of agencies will lapse at midnight Friday, and if Republicans can t persuade Trump to give in on the wall <U+2015> at least temporarily <U+2015> there will be a shutdown over Christmas for many nonessential government workers.GOP leaders seem to be preparing to ask Trump to go along with a temporary continuing resolution (CR), perhaps buying them two or three weeks. But Trump has shown a total willingness to accept a shutdown this time around. He made no qualms last week about saying he d accept the blame during a meeting with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and he sent one of his most hard-line advisers <U+2015> Stephen Miller <U+2015> on the Sunday news shows to further suggest that he would not be caving.But the consensus on Capitol Hill is that this eventually ends with Republicans caving, one way or another. We re not winning this fight, and he s the only one who doesn t know it,  one senior GOP aide told HuffPost on Monday.Another senior Republican aide said that, if Trump were smart, he d take a short-term CR and fight the Democrats in January.  Otherwise, we shut it down over Christmas and Democrats are the heroes sending him clean CRs all of January and reminding everyone he shut the government down,  the aide said.And if you were looking for a sense of how likely a shutdown is at this point, this aide added that he had not bought a plane ticket home for Christmas yet.Capitol Hill sources said the White House was divided internally over whether Republicans should just agree to a CR or whether they should shut down government over Democrats not giving Trump border wall funding.Again, no one sees this ending with border wall money. Democrats have even backed off earlier offers to give Trump a sizable amount of funding in exchange for a renewal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program. But there s a real question whether Trump and other Republicans think they need a shutdown to show the GOP base that they re fighting for their campaign pledges and that Democrats are standing in the way.Trump has repeatedly signaled he would shut down the government over a lack of border wall funding, only to reluctantly sign a bill at the last minute when GOP leaders assure him this is the best deal he ll get.Last spring, Trump was ready to shut it down until aides told him he wouldn t be able to go to his Mar-a-Lago golf resort in Florida for the weekend because of bad optics.  Fuck that,  Trump said, according to The Wall Street Journal, before calling a news conference to trash the bill that he had decided to sign.But this time Trump seems like he ll be harder to convince. House Republican leaders had debated passing a funding bill <U+2015> either for the Department of Homeland Security or for all the remaining agencies <U+2015> that included $5 billion for the wall. But they decided it would likely be too tough of a haul with all the GOP members who have decided not to show up for the lame-duck session, and that the bill would just further bring them down a rabbit hole. (For a bill to reach the president s desk, it needs 60 votes in the Senate, and Democrats in that chamber looked ready to block a bill if it got through the House, which was uncertain in the first place.)Instead, Republicans are waiting Trump out a bit more, with the Senate waiting on the House and the House out until Wednesday night, hoping that Trump will have some change of heart as it gets closer to a shutdown.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Such is the nightmare public relations scenario facing the White House less than a week before the Department of Homeland Security and other key government agencies run out of money at midnight Friday while Trump is scheduled to fly that day to his Mar-a-Lago resort for a 16-day vacation.The U.S. Secret Service is among the half-dozen agencies in the quarter-million-employee DHS, which also includes the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration. Other major agencies facing a shutdown include the departments of state, treasury and interior. Many of the affected employees would be deemed essential and be forced to work anyway. None would be paid during the shutdown and would have to get by on savings or short-term loans.Rick Tyler, a former aide to the man who engineered the last extended government shutdown in 2013, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said that Trump will cave in the days to come. The only leverage in shutting down the government is who gets the blame for it. And he s already taken the blame for it,  Tyler said, predicting that Trump will approve whatever Congress gives him.For now, Trump and his key immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, have once again been talking up the possibility of a partial government shutdown to force Congress to appropriate billions of dollars to pay for his long-promised wall along the Mexican border. We re going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall, to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,  Miller said Sunday to CBS News, adding that that would include,  if it comes to it,  a shutdown.Top White House communications adviser Mercedes Schlapp was somewhat less assertive while talking to reporters Monday but insisted that Congress had to come up with more than the $1.6 billion that Democrats have agreed to spend on border security enhancements <U+2015> but not a  wall  <U+2015> to resolve the problem. We don t want to get to the point where we shut down the government,  she said.  But we ve got to find increased spending for border security. But House Republicans appear to lack the votes to pass a bill with the $5 billion in wall funding that Trump is demanding without Democratic help, while Senate Republicans need at least nine Democrats to pass a spending bill.How Trump will react if Democrats do not give him what he wants is unclear.Trump enjoying his favorite pastime at his private club while those sworn to protect his life with their own deal with cash-flow problems in their households would be tough to defend, meaning that Trump likely would cancel or postpone his golf vacation until a new spending bill is approved. Conversely, though, his love of golfing probably makes a shutdown unlikely to begin with. He ll get mad and then sign it and claim the military is going to build the wall, which it won t,  Tyler said.  And then everybody will forget about it. Building a wall along the southern border and forcing Mexico to pay for it was Trump s signature campaign promise, uttered for the first time in his Trump Tower speech announcing his candidacy. He repeated it hundreds of times from June 2015 to Nov. 8, 2016, when he won the presidency.But the  making Mexico pay  part was quietly dropped almost immediately upon taking office. In a phone call with Mexico s president at the time, Trump told Enrique PeÒa Nieto that he understood that Mexico would not pay for the wall but asked him not to say that publicly so Trump would not lose standing among his base.Since that January 2017 conversation, Trump has signed a half-dozen spending bills that cover DHS even though they included no money to build his wall. He appeared to come closest to vetoing one and forcing a shutdown last March, after he watched Fox News evening hosts criticize him for planning to approve a $1.3 trillion spending bill with zero dollars for his wall. He signed it anyway the following morning and said he did so because of all the money it contained for the military.Heading into the summer, Trump again started threatening to shut down the government at the end of the budget year in September if he didn t get his wall money, but then he started backing down as that deadline approached. He began arguing that he would have more leverage after the November midterm elections because of all the additional Republicans who would be elected. We re going to do it immediately after the election,  he said in a Fox News interview conducted from one of his rallies on Sept. 7.  We do it right after the election where, hopefully, frankly, it will be easy because we ll have more Republicans, not less. But Trump and Republicans got clobbered in the November midterms, picking up just two seats in the Senate despite having the most favorable map in decades while losing 40 seats in the House and control of that chamber.Which means that instead of gaining leverage by waiting until after the election, Trump lost a good deal of it <U+2015> an altered dynamic made clear during a meeting last week with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Both told him they were not interested in building the sort of wall he promised and urged Trump not to go forward with the shutdown.Schumer on Sunday repeated that theme during an interview with NBC News.  We should not let a temper tantrum, threats, push us in the direction of doing something that everybody, even our Republican colleagues, know is wrong,  Schumer said.  If the president wants to debate the wall next year, he can . But he shouldn t use innocent workers as hostage for his temper tantrum to sort of throw a bone to his base.

The federal government may be partially shut down later this week if President Donald Trump doesn t get the $5 billion he s demanding from Congress for a wall along the southern U.S. border that he claimed Mexico would pay for.If such a shutdown comes to pass, it will be a costly and stupid one, just like other shutdowns that preceded it.The federal government does not save money when it grinds to a halt and federal workers stop working. In fact, the opposite happens: The government wastes time and resources prepping for the shutdown, and then must catch up on missed work once the government reopens.In the meantime, workers temporarily go without their paychecks, consumer confidence dampens and the gross domestic product takes a small but noticeable hit.In short, shutting down the government is a self-inflicted and self-defeating move, particularly to the side that seizes ownership of the shutdown before it happens.The potential shutdown this week may be less costly than past shutdowns due to its limited scope. A shutdown happens when Congress and the White House can t agree on a deal to fund the federal government. But in this case, Trump and lawmakers have already signed off on funding bills covering roughly three-fourths of the money the government needs to operate.That means only certain agencies would be hit by a shutdown: the departments of transportation, agriculture, housing and urban development, interior, and homeland security, among others. Those agencies are currently running on a short-term funding extension that ends on Friday night.Within those agencies, certain  essential  personnel would continue going about their jobs, to be paid retroactively once the government reopens. But a shutdown would lead to an estimated 380,000 furloughs, including 96 percent of personnel at NASA and 86 percent at the Commerce Department, according to Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Those workers would be out of a job until a deal is reached.Even though the country faces a much smaller shutdown than the last major one, in 2013, plenty of Americans would take notice. For instance, while the national parks would remain open, the workers who clean and care for them would be at home on furlough. (There have already been two brief shutdowns this year, in January and February.)Some hardcore Trump fans might enjoy the idea of sticking it to federal workers, whom the president equates with the  swamp,  while holding out for wall funding. But if past shutdowns are any guide, those workers will ultimately be compensated. Since it isn t fair to punish working-class federal employees for someone else s political gamesmanship, lawmakers have typically passed legislation paying furloughed workers for the time they were off the job after the fact.That means the government ultimately ends up paying for work that Congress and the White House didn t allow to get done. During the 16-day shutdown of 2013, federal workers were furloughed for a combined 6.6 million workdays, according to the White House s Office of Management and Budget. They were retroactively paid an estimated $2 billion.The Government Accountability Office took a close look at the costs of that shutdown, digging into the hard choices individual agencies had to make. In one example, employees who work on clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health were furloughed. That led the agency to stop updating its clinical trials registry, which it said provides  critically important information to patients,  and to eliminate services like library checkouts and pet therapy.Registry updates resumed mid-shutdown <U+2015> after members of Congress complained about it.Merely having to prepare for these scenarios comes at a cost. In the runup to a shutdown, agency officials have to spend their time getting ready to furlough workers and figuring out what programs can better afford to go on hiatus than others. All of that means time and energy are diverted from the agency s basic mission. It is a sunk cost, whether or not a shutdown even happens.Any shutdown can affect the broader economy, as opposed to just the inner workings of federal agencies. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that the 2013 shutdown of a little more than two weeks directly reduced GDP for the fourth quarter of that year by 0.3 percentage points. The bureau attributed that to the lost productivity of federal workers who were furloughed. But some other costs are harder to estimate. Officials interviewed by the GAO said the continued threat of shutdowns tends to hurt employee morale, which makes plenty of sense. Imagine how much work you would get done this week if your boss said the entire office may shut down indefinitely starting Friday evening.HuffPost readers: Will a shutdown affect your job with the federal government?

Nancy Pelosi (D) in action Tuesday? The California congresswoman is known to be a masterful negotiator, and she was in her full glory at an Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Vice President Mike Pence.At the outset, she set Trump back on his heels by naming the possible government shutdown  the Trump shutdown,  and sending him into a kind of tailspin. ( Did you say Trump?  he asked incredulously.)Trump tried every sexist tactic in the book in an attempt to diminish the 78-year-old Pelosi: He repeatedly interrupted her, tried to mansplain to Pelosi <U+2015> who is the former, and likely future, speaker of the House <U+2015> how Congress works, and even talked about her in the third person as if she weren t there.None of it went well for him. It was a clear win for one of the most powerful women in politics, and a lesson in how to win a negotiation with a guy who underestimates women.Read this remarkable exchange, via a transcript from The Washington Post:Trump: Nancy s in a situation where it s not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand, and I fully understand that. We re going to have a good discussion, and we re going to see what happens. But we have to have border security.Pelosi: Mr. President   Mr. President, please don t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory.She was steely calm, while Trump and Schumer traded barbs back and forth and grew agitated. Like here:Trump: Okay, let me ask you this, just   and we re doing this in a very friendly manner. It doesn t help for me to take a vote in the House where I will win easily with the Republicans.Pelosi: You will not win.And Trump sure did lose this round <U+2015> or at least that s the consensus. Pelosi and Schumer got him to say that if the government shuts down, it s Trump s own fault.  I will take the mantle of shutting down, and I m going to shut it down for border security,  he said.Successful negotiators try to put their opponent on the defensive. And, boy did Pelosi do that, said Deborah Kolb, the author of Negotiating at Work: Turn Small Wins Into Big Gains. She saw how he was trying to undermine and demean her and she  turned  it <U+2015> established herself as a worthy negotiating partner,  said Kolb, who is a professor emerita at Simmons University.  Also I think she gets that he is a terrible negotiator, competitive but can t carry it through. Bluffs but then capitulates. Later, to her colleagues, Pelosi reportedly revealed a bit of her strategy. Essentially, she challenged Trump on one of his biggest insecurities <U+2015> his masculinity. I was trying to be the mom,  Pelosi said, according to Politico, but  it goes to show you: You get into a tinkle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you.  It s like a manhood thing with him   as if manhood can be associated with him,  Pelosi reportedly said.  This wall thing.

On Dec. 4 the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted nearly 800 points. On Dec. 7 it rallied nearly 800 points. On Monday it fell 500 points, then recovered, ending the day in positive territory.Analysts and journalists have cited trade, Trump s China deal, Brexit uncertainty, fears of an economic slowdown, a rudderless Fed and much else as the causes of this volatility, which isn t confined to the stock market. Corporate bonds have been jittery for much of this autumn amid a rash of downgrades from credit rating agencies. Recently, commentators have been issuing ominous warnings about a dreaded inverted yield curve among U.S. Treasury bonds. Are You Ready for the Financial Crisis of 2019?  asks one New York Times headline. Will you survive the  $9 trillion corporate debt bomb  identified by CNBC?Everybody needs to calm down. There are legitimate reasons to worry about the course of the economy, but most of the fevered analysis pouring out of the financial press is about as valuable as a trip to your local palm reader. Stock and bond analysts might know a lot about corporate profits and competitive pressures, but they can t predict the future any better than you can. The experts don t know what a final Brexit deal will look like or how long a government shutdown might last, and they can t calculate the eventual economic ramifications of things that might never exist. They don t know what unpleasant secrets are currently being papered over in corporate balance sheets, and they can t predict which supply chains will be disrupted by wars or natural disasters or what new inventions will vault their inventors to glory. The world is an uncertain place.Uncertain but not random. Here s what the investment world does know that is spooking markets. For years now, the Federal Reserve has been signaling that it believes things are going a little too well for American businesses, and it plans to make life a little harder for them. As a central bank, the Fed s job is to ensure both maximum employment and price stability. And while there are a lot of different ways of affecting either one, the Fed functions chiefly by managing interest rates <U+2015> the price and availability of credit. If there is too much credit in the economy, then businesses can borrow too freely, leading to asset bubbles and inflation. If there is too little credit in the economy, then businesses can t get the money they need to operate, and people can t get jobs. Top officials at the Fed generally try to hit a sweet spot where the economy is operating with the maximum number of jobs possible without increasing prices.There are a lot of problems with this economic management model. For one, the Fed doesn t really know how inflation works. For another, the Fed insists on operating with an undemocratic independence from the American political process. It s not really clear why one agency should control interest rates without recourse to taxation and government spending decisions that affect growth, jobs and prices.But for all its oddities, this is still the way the Fed works. By raising interest rates, the Fed is intentionally putting pressure on businesses <U+2015> forcing many to lay off workers or, in some cases, shut down operations entirely. The Fed doesn t do this for fun. Its top officials believe they have to cause a little unemployment in order to keep inflation from getting out of hand, although there is very little data right now indicating that consumer prices are increasing meaningfully. Inflation has been below the Fed s target rate of 2 percent for most of the year. So we know that if the Fed achieves what it hopes to achieve with higher interest rates, then companies will go bankrupt. The firms that are most at risk are generally smaller operations and those already carrying a lot of debt, which can t draw on cash reserves to meet expenses. And there are a lot of companies carrying a lot of debt right now. There is currently more than $9.1 trillion in corporate debt outstanding <U+2015> nearly double the $4.7 trillion level in 2007. Much of this debt has been blown on some pretty irresponsible purchases, stuff like stock buybacks and mergers that did little to change a company s business prospects but offered a quick jolt to share prices. This strain of recklessness infected some very large corporations. GE, for instance, spent $24 billion in 2016 and 2017 buying up its own stock <U+2015> even though the company is also loaded to the gills with debt. In effect, the company was borrowing money and giving it away to shareholders and executives instead of investing in new equipment or research. The result is a pretty unstable company. GE s existing bonds have been plummeting in value as investors worry about the firm s ability to pay them off. The company s management is selling off assets to raise cash quickly <U+2015> never a good sign.Which companies eventually go bust and how many of them bite the dust depends largely on how bad the Fed thinks things need to get in order to keep inflation at bay. With the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent, it s possible to throw millions of people out of work and still have an economy with an unemployment rate below what the Fed has considered normal for much of the past 30 years.But there s a wild card in this financial deck: the banking system. Any bank holding too much souring debt could find itself in serious trouble: When companies go bankrupt, banks don t get paid. After the 2008 financial crisis, the federal government implemented a lot of reforms intended to make American banks safer, and in many ways, they are. They fund their operations with more capital and less debt than they did a decade ago and keep more of their money in safer, readily tradable assets, like Treasury bonds. But top banks are still gigantic and very opaque; it s very difficult to tell what s going on inside them, even for bankers themselves. At Wells Fargo, for instance, top managers  discover  new forms of misconduct every few months. So it s possible that the Fed could screw up. In the process of trying to cause just a little unemployment, the central bank might push interest rates too far, forcing a major corporate debt sell-off that puts the stability of the financial system itself in jeopardy. Most economists currently think that s unlikely. Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen, for instance, said Monday that corporate debt levels are  very high  and compared the quality of a lot of that debt to the toxic subprime mortgage securities from the housing bubble. If a recession hits,  high levels of corporate leverage could prolong the downturn and lead to lots of bankruptcies,  Yellen said. But she emphasized that she doesn t expect bankruptcies at banks. Even though banks have been approving a lot of bad corporate loans, she thinks the banks themselves are protected against severe losses.But the truth is that nobody really knows. And if you believe the Fed, things will probably get worse before they get better.  Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

They thought he d hem and haw, as he has in the past, and then reluctantly sign the omnibus spending bill that s been working its way through Congress all year. Republicans recognize that Democrats have hardly any incentive to give Trump wall funding, and the Democrats have most of the leverage in this fight. If Trump insists on a shutdown over the wall, Democrats can wait him out, pass a continuing resolution (CR) to fund the affected agencies when they take back the House in January, and then dare the GOP-controlled Senate and Trump to object. But with Trump indicating Tuesday that he welcomes a shutdown <U+2015> and would even be happy to take the credit or blame for one <U+2015> Republicans are now reevaluating. During a meeting with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) dared Trump to put up an omnibus spending bill with the $5 billion he wants for a wall on the House floor and see if it could pass. Trump thinks it could. Pelosi is confident it wouldn t, figuring that enough conservatives would balk at the spending increases that GOP leaders would need Democratic votes <U+2015> traditionally a good bet with these end-of-year spending bills, which typically draw the opposition of about 60 Republicans.But GOP leaders are now wondering if there s something to Trump s plan. Could House Republicans pass an overarching spending bill <U+2015> with wall funding <U+2015> with only Republican votes? I think we could do it,  a senior GOP aide told HuffPost on Tuesday.  It would be tight but doable.  The senior aide warned that it would still be  a suicide mission, though, because we either shut down the government or cave and pass a CR into January.   Or we pass an omnibus with nothing much for the wall,  the aide added.House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost on Tuesday that he thought Republicans could pass the spending package if it contained money for a border wall.  Moderates would be more of an issue on wall funding than the HFC,  Meadows predicted.Another Freedom Caucus conservative, Raul Labrador of Idaho, who has voted against a number of spending agreements in the past, said he thought conservatives could get onboard with a spending bill if it had wall funding and closed  asylum loopholes.  That s the position the Freedom Caucus took Monday night, at least,  he said.Republicans seem to believe they could pass the spending bill on their own through a combination of Trump pressure and team spirit. It could be one final diss of Pelosi if the House GOP could come together and prove her wrong, particularly after she seemed to get the better of Trump repeatedly Tuesday. During the White House meeting <U+2015> in front of the press <U+2015> Trump said Pelosi wasn t in a position where she could speak freely about negotiations. Pelosi shot back that Trump shouldn t  characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting. And when Pelosi returned to Capitol Hill, she further skewered the president in a meeting with Democrats.Pelosi said the wall was  like a manhood thing  for the president.  As if manhood could ever be associated with him,  she said, according to an aide in the room.The comments have already been widely reported, and Pelosi almost seems to be goading Trump into a doomed shutdown that he s already taken the blame for. Schumer particularly got Trump to clarify that, if there was a shutdown, it would be Trump s doing <U+2015> a political gift for Democrats.But there s still a good chance Republicans and Democrats come to some small agreement and Congress and the president avoid a shutdown entirely.While it s an interesting thought-experiment whether Republicans could pass an omnibus spending bill with only GOP votes, that bill would still need to pass the Senate and its 60-vote threshold. Even if Republicans could peel off a few centrist Democratic votes, they re unlikely to get enough to muscle it through the Senate and onto the president s desk. And, at some point, Republicans have to face those facts. They ve gone down the path before of pretending they can bend Democrats to their will by shutting down the government.Trying to corral Republicans, many of whom are departing for the holidays and are already missing floor votes, to shut down the government over a wall that Trump had promised Mexico would pay for is a dangerous proposition, one that Republicans would likely lose anyway.But with Trump suddenly vowing to fight, Republicans aren t ready to roll over.According to that same aide in the room, Trump told Pelosi and Schumer that they could go two routes with this meeting:  with a knife or a candy. Pelosi responded,  Exactly. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here s how."

Pelosi and Schumer want the president to accept a set of bipartisan proposals that would allocate about $1.3 billion toward border security measures, such as fencing.If Congress does not reach a deal, a partial government shutdown looms, which would stop funding for some government agencies. Lawmakers had already passed a temporary extension before their original Dec. 7 deadline to give themselves more negotiating time. It s possible that they may pass another temporary extension to keep the government open until the new year.In addition to border wall funding, Trump also ranted on Tuesday about Republican electoral victories and talked over Pelosi during the meeting.Underscoring the theatrics of the meeting, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement that  President Trump was grateful for the opportunity to let the press into the meeting. On Capitol Hill, several Republican and Democratic senators rejected Trump s demand for a shutdown. I disagree with the president very much so on that issue. Government shutdowns are never valuable and should be avoided,  Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters. Nobody wins in a government shutdown,  Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said. No one should be proud of shutting down the government,  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in response to Trump s comments.Some Democrats on Capitol Hill couldn t help but spike the football after watching the nationally televised meeting at the White House. It s a total disaster for Trump,  Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said, speculating that Trump was simply throwing red meat to his political base.  Hopefully, Republicans can change his mind. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), meanwhile, called Trump s performance  a horror show.  It s exactly the way we should not be governing,  he added.Trump elaborated on his comments at a bill signing later Tuesday, and continued to threaten a shutdown. If we have to close down the country over border security, I actually like that,  he said.  Chuck s problem is that when we last closed down, that was his idea, and honestly he got killed. So rather than us debating, I will take it. If we close down the country, I will take it.
