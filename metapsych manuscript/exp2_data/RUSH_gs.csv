RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/11/a-moving-call-from-a-survivor-of-multiple-government-shutdowns/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 11, 2018RUSH: I m not sure how you pronounce your name, in Los Angeles. How do you pronounce your name?CALLER: Palabo.RUSH: Palabo! Great to have you, Palabo. Welcome to the program.CALLER: Hey. I m really happy to be here. Mega unemployment Dittos from California, the only place where they still have unemployment because they have overregulation. Hey, listen, I m calling you as a survivor. I survived the great government shutdown of 1994-95. I survived the 1990 shutdown, the  95 shutdown, the 2013 shutdown, the 2018 shutdown. I survived them all. The government shutdown, there s only a slowdown, a government slowdown of 16% of the government. And it s very survivable.RUSH: You know, this  CALLER:   stop calling it a shutdown and start calling it a slowdown  RUSH: I like the way you re thinking, you know, because 70% of the government has been funded all the way through all of next year. Seventy percent s already paid for. But I love this.  I survived the government shutdown.  That s a great perspective on this because the actual portrayal of a government shutdown is panic and chaos! And some people might not make it. Some people are going to incur such difficulty, such chaos and may suffer real harm. That s the image that goes behind these government shutdowns. You can t get by without your government up and running.The fact that these threatened shutdowns seem to have that kind of political benefit really frosts me. The idea that people can t get by when the government s not open, I mean, what are government working hours anyway? The fact that the government gets shut down so many times during the course of a year, they shut themselves down if there s a couple inches of snow, for crying out loud, and nobody panics then.But you get the Drive-By Media backing up the Democrat Party in one of their political agendas and the government shutdown could mean end of life for certain people, it could mean end of benefits for certain people. Speaking of which, a story here on how we have really curtailed the food stamp rolls. And I m gonna tell you. Here s the headline:  3.5 Million People Drop Off Food Stamps Under Trump. This is the kind of thing that not that long ago would be really heralded, it would be really celebrated, it would be something remarkably good to have happened to people in the country. Three and a half million people no longer needing food stamps would translate into three and a half million people finding work, becoming productive, becoming self-reliant and undertaking daily responsibilities of life and benefiting from citizenship in the United States of America, three and a half million people no longer needing food stamps.It s a shame, it s too bad that we now cannot celebrate things like this. Now we can barely get it mentioned. I mean, in a political sense this is really bad news for the left, so nobody s gonna know about it. They ll do all they can to get power and reverse the trend. They don t want people dropping off food stamps! This is not good news for them. But I m here to tell you, it wasn t that long ago that a headline like this would have made people stand up and cheer, feel great about their country.One of the objectives was to get people off of welfare, to get people off of the government benefits. Your life is much better when you re providing for yourself, when you re not dependent on people you don t even know. Now it s a story that s buried even in my Stack. I have to make a specific point of finding it. But it used to be not that long ago it would have been tremendous celebratory news and a political benefit for whichever administration was in office when it happened.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here is Don in Carrollton, Georgia. Back to the phones we go. Great to have you, sir. Hi.CALLER: Rush, it s an honor. I appreciate the analysis that goes into your program each and every day.RUSH: Well, thank you. I appreciate that, sir.CALLER: Yes, sir. In every high level budget discussion there s always that discussion of where are you gonna get the money to pay for this, but yet Congress, and especially the Democrats, are never asked the question, where are we gonna continue to get the money to pay for each and every illegal that s in the country.RUSH: You know, not only is that true, it s true about everything. We don t have any money. We have a national debt of over $20 trillion. We run an annual budget deficit of multiple hundreds of billions of dollars. We don t have any money. We print money. We borrow money. It s amazed me. In fact, when Obama took office and the first thing he did was announce this gigantic Porkulus spending bill called a stimulus, and it was almost $800 billion and we didn t have $800 billion laying around. There was no way it was gonna stimulate anything because we didn t have the $800 billion without going and getting it from someplace else first.And that someplace else was out there in the economy. So Obama s gonna take $800 billion from the economy and then redistribute it to other places in the economy and is gonna call that a stimulus. Didn t stimulate anything. All it did was basically end up funnel some money to the Democrat National Committee via keeping union people employed during a recession. The vast majority of the stimulus went to unions and places that employ them. But there wasn t any economic stimulus to it.You can t stimulate the economy unless you have money that s not already in it injected into it. And we don t have that. So all of this talk about a government shutdown, not funding the government, the government s so far out of any kind of fiscal sense of balance that it s all academic. And it s gotten to the point where I don t think anybody cares anymore.You know, it used to be that we had to balance budget every year. If we didn t all hell was gonna break loose, and if we didn t get control of the national debt then all hell was gonna break loose, a massive debt that s gonna have to be repaid and some future generation somebody s kids or grandkids are gonna get saddled.I ve been hearing this my whole life, and yet Washington just keeps spending money because they have a printing press. States can t, but the federal government can, and there isn t any discipline at all. We can t spend $5 billion on a wall, but like Don here points out, we can spend half that allowing illegal immigrants into the country and funding their health care and their education and whatever else is needed to make them loyal Democrat voters.And that cost is never mentioned, never calculated because it s considered to be a compassionate expenditure. But five billion   do you realize five billion, what percentage of the federal budget that is? It s a rounding error. It s an asterisk. People say we can t afford it, we don t have it, it s not a proper expenditure. It s just absurd.  "

How are you doing?CALLER: (giggling) I m doing fine. We ve got a heat wave. It s 14 degrees.RUSH: Yeah, that s a thaw out, right? (laughing)CALLER: (giggling) Thanks for taking my call, Rush.RUSH: You bet.CALLER: I had a question. Actually I came off from working out and I turned you on the radio and you were talking about how the government shutdown was being so dramatized. And I agree. And I told your buddy there that I truly admire you and I listen to you and you say pretty much what we are all thinking but maybe don t get the outlet to say. But something that I had a hard time is when you re saying that okay, you know, two paychecks and it really didn t affect anybody. I m one of those people it didn t affect, I ll admit. But at one time in my life it would have affected me.I think sometimes maybe there s a way of relating to the people who are your avid listeners and are Trump supporters who are living paycheck to paycheck. I remember one time when I was, and it was like,  Well, do I pay my car payment or do I put gas in the car on do I pay my insurance?  And I thought,  Well, I guess if I don t pay my insurance, I could drive the car,  and there was a time when two paychecks would have sunk me. And sometimes  And I know the upper echelon and some of this  None of us have a hitch in our giddy-up right now. A lot of us don t. But there are a lot that do, and that just kind of hit me a little funny because it felt a little bit out of touch with a lot of those people who listen to you.RUSH: Ah, there we go. This has come up over the years. I m really glad you called and I m glad you hung on until I was able to get to you.CALLER: (laughing)RUSH: Over the course of the entirety of this program there have been periods of time where I have been accused of being out of touch, been accused of not understanding how difficult life is for people and sounding above it and uncaring about it. It goes in spurts. You misunderstood something. I was talking about  I was lampooning the people who claimed that 400,000 or 800,000 government workers being out of work for two paychecks would bring our economy to a screeching halt.That s what I was mocking, not the people that missed the paychecks. But the idea that 800,000 people in government or anywhere would bring our economy to a screeching halt. It was wrong! They didn t know what they were talking about. Not only did it not matter, we created a record number of new jobs. My comment was about the media and how they re constantly getting things wrong, their economic experts are wrong in their forecasts, and all it was was an effort to rip into Trump, blame Trump for the shutdown.They wanted the economy to come to a screeching halt. They want people to be hurt. They want people in pain so they can go do these hard-luck stories and point it out and blame it on Trump! Well, I sit here in steadfast earnestness to deny them that right. They re not gonna get away with lying about the guy, at least during these three hours of the day. People  I have been exactly in the situation that you described. For five years, I was in that situation at what many people think as the prime of life. Let s see, it was 1979. So I was 28 years old.From 28 to 33, I made $12,000 to $17,000 in five years. I could not afford my house payment and the Mastercard payment in the same two-week period. Mastercard wouldn t move the due date. The mortgage people wouldn t move the due date. I was late on one of them every month, no choice. Grocery stores didn t take credit cards back then, but Qwik Stop convenience stores did. So that s how I managed to get by. I didn t have an expense account. I didn t have any other way of generating income.I was stuck there.I have been fired seven times in my life, or maybe more now. I ve been through all of these economic challenges. One time I was fired and out of work for six months. So I m not a stranger to any of this. But what I m not gonna sit here and permit is for the media to lie about this. And the idea was that virtually every one of these federal workers  After missing one paycheck is when we got the sob stories! After missing one paycheck. And these people were going to get that money back. They were gonna get their back pay.The president assured them and promised them that. So in the end they weren t going to be out anything. They were being used as pawns by the media to attack Trump, which I am not gonna  If they re attacking Trump and lying about it, they re not gonna get away with it here, as far as I m concerned. Look, I try to keep in mind what you ve mentioned all the time. I understand what life is like, and I understand financial pressures, and I understand the decisions that have to be made.I try to constantly keep that in mind as I talk about things here. But what this was, was the media trying to say that these federal workers being  It was a multifaceted lie. It was trying to elevate the importance of federal workers. I don t know about you, but how many of you got a little ? How many times has the media come and cared about the hardships you face in life, yet here come some government workers who are not doing badly! Government pay is not  Have you seen the wealthiest per capita area is Washington, D.C., now! It used to be Maryland!There is more money per capita in Washington, D.C., than anywhere in this country. The people that work there are not hurting as related to some of the other people around the country. Missing a paycheck? The media comes along, exploits that, acting like it s the greatest injustice. (sobbing)  Oh, it s a disservice! How can we do this to people devoting their lives to helping us in the federal government?  It s a crock. It s media BS. That s what I was calling out. I was not in any way attempting to gloss over whatever hardship and suffering might have been experienced by missing a paycheck or two.And if you think I sounded arrogant about that? Well, I m glad I got the chance to correct you on that. Thanks for the call.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: You know, this business of me being out of touch, it comes up, as I said, now and then. The last time it came up, the gasoline price was skyrocketing. And it was a mystery to why. We were going through the usual belief that some wizard behind the curtain somewhere was in charge of the levers that were causing gasoline   I mean, you had people working at Fox News that were saying that this is what s going on, it was the oil companies that were jacking up the prices because they can and blah, blah, blah.And I was speaking very distrustingly of that. I didn t buy that for a second. I don t think there s anybody with that kind of power that could affect the price of gasoline and the variables nationwide. Market forces are the only thing big enough to cause that. So a guy called here and claimed I was out of touch. That I should have been among those, because of the people in my audience, I should have known, the price of gas going up,  It s hurting people and you don t sound like you understand that. And I said,  Sir, you really need to think about this.  I asked him,  Do you know what the price of jet fuel is?  Uh, no.  Well, yeah. Well, I do. I have to buy it for EIB One. What do you think the price of jet fuel is?  Well, I have no idea.  Well, I ll tell you what. It s four times what you re paying for gasoline. So you know what I ve had to do? I ve had to order my pilots to slow down to 475 miles an hour just to be able to fly the thing.  Oh, wow. I had no idea.  So these things affect everybody. (laughing) I did. I told him that. And he understood then that the pain and suffering was everywhere, not just with him.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/02/01/drive-bys-gobsmacked-by-blockbuster-jobs-report/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Feb 1, 2019RUSH: The media today, depending on where you tuned in, was either having orgasms or panic attacks over the economic news. It was a shock. The Drive-By Media cannot believe it. The Drive-By Media thought that the bottom was gonna come out of the economy because of the shutdown. They had all their experts telling them that we were gonna lose jobs, the economy was gonna have zero growth. Remember them reporting all of that crap? And I m sorry to use the term, folks, but it s exactly what mainstream media reports, is crap. That because 800,000 federal workers were out of work for a month, the U.S. economy was gonna come to a screeching halt.Not even close! The U.S. economy grew, created 304,000 jobs versus the 175,000 that were expected. The significant percentage of them were jobs in construction that are paying close to 80 to $90,000 a year. The retail sector was one of the lowest sectors where new jobs are created, and those are, you know, 12 to $14 an hour jobs. It was fabulous everywhere and the shutdown had practically no impact. The stock market s way up on the   it s up because of all this.Let s go to the audio sound bites and listen. It s CNN s Christine Romans. We re starting at the top at number 1. These people were, I mean, they were depressed and despondent today, gobsmacked by these numbers  cause they believed all of their crazy, inside-the-Beltway experts that 800,000 federal workers missing two paychecks was gonna lead to stagnant and zero economic growth. The degree of stupidity that now populates every chair on a set in a news network is breathtaking! It s identical thinking; it is groupthink; there s not one bit of curiosity. And they re all ignorant. Here is Christine Romans after Jim Sciutto says,  The U.S. adding 304,000 jobs in January despite the record-breaking government shutdown. This is the 100th consecutive month of job gains. This is a big number. ROMANS: It s a big, strong number. It s a number I think the White House is really gonna like. And it shows you that hundred months, I think, is really important here because this has been a long, steady job market recovery. And you re really finally starting to see the fruits of that in wages as well. Wages up 3.2%. Really important. Overall, these numbers pretty much show you that shutdown did not hurt the overall labor market. We saw hiring across the board. We ve been waiting for wages to come back: 3.2 year-over-year wage growth. Now you ve got three months in a row of 3% plus. For workers, that s a very good sign.RUSH: So next is Poppy Harlow, and she is talking with the chief economics and business correspondent Christine Romans, and they re talking about the January jobs numbers and Trump, and you ll hear Sciutto in there as a third voice, but listen this.HARLOW: The president gets briefed on these the day before.ROMANS: Right.HARLOW: So he would have known about this  ROMANS: Yes!HARLOW:   yesterday! And he was very confident in that interview with the New York Times  SCIUTTO: Yep.HARLOW:   last night. And walking out of the China trade talks. I suppose this really helps the U.S. in the China trade talks. Their economy gets worse; ours gets better.SCIUTTO: Mmmm!ROMANS: This is a strong labor market, and I hope what it means for our viewers is this is the year of a raise. (snickering) Workers for the first time in a long time are getting more for their hours.RUSH: Poppy Harlow, they re upset that Trump knew about this yesterday and that s why he was in a good mood. Poppy Harlow surmising that that s why Trump was so confident meeting with the ChiComs. How dare he. But no matter where you look in the anti-Trump media, there was sadness, shock, dismay, disappointment. They really believed, they really believed and they were hoping for zero economic growth. They were hoping for devastating economic news on the jobs front because, to them, when 800,000 federal workers don t get paid, why, that does mean the economy doesn t churn, doesn t move. Those 800,000 government workers   no offense intended   produce zilch.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let me share with you some of the news headlines that were out in recent days predicting the jobs numbers today. Yesterday in the New York Times, January 31st:  Why This Jobs Report Will be a Mess.  CNN, January 10th:  How the January Jobs Report Could Be Shaped by the Shutdown.  Fox News, January 3rd:  Partial Government Shutdown Could Hurt January Jobs Numbers.  MarketWatch, January 31st:  How the Government Shutdown Had Impact the Jobs Report.  It was all negative news.New York Times, January 28th:  Government Shutdown Will Cost U.S. Economy $11 Billion.  New York Magazine, January 24th:  Trump Officials Just Don t Get Why Shutdown Hurts Economy.  TIME magazine January 23rd,  The Government Shutdown Is Going to Hurt the Wider Economy.  CBS News January 21st,  Shutdown s Damage to Economy Could Exceed $5.7 Billion Cost of Trump s Border Wall.  Barron s, January 16th:  How the Government Shutdown Will Hurt the Economy. Vanity Fair, well-known economics journal, January 26th:  The White House Just Realized the Shutdown Is Hurting the Economy.  Washington Post, January 15th:  The Shutdown Threatens the Promise of Government Jobs and a Way of Life.  PMSNBC January 15th:  White House Now Expects the Shutdown to Hurt the Economy Even More.  Fortune magazine January 11th:  Long-Term Shutdown Will Hurt the Economy.  USA Today January 2nd:  Government Shutdown: How it Could Hurt the Economy. So you see virtually everywhere, including at Fox News, the pessimism was out of control. It was running rampant. The government shutdown. The government shutdown! Because 380,000 furloughed workers did not get two paychecks, this was gonna bring the U.S. economy to a standstill. It was all over the place. The degree of ignorance on economics, the lack of understanding on the part of people who are supposed to know more than the rest of us. Striking.  "

I got an idea for Trump s State of the Union speech next Tuesday. You know what I think he ought to do? I think he ought to call the Democrats out. I think he ought to talk about the infanticide laws that just passed in New York, and make Democrats applaud this stuff in open and in public! He ought to go down the list of everything the Democrats are doing, are proposing. Not saying he agrees with it.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the State of the Union. Your Democrat Party just legalized the killing of babies if they survive an abortion,  and make the New York delegation stand up and applaud that.Make them applaud what they do,  cause that s what they do! They applaud things they like   or make them boo Trump when he says it, or make them get up and walk out. Whatever. The fact is, call the left out on what they re do. You got a national TV audience here watching a very controversial, contested State of the Union after the government shutdown. The media s gonna be driving up audience participation here. They re gonna be promoting this like crazy.The president ought to call these people out on all these wacko ideas   on immigration, open borders, sanctuary cities   and make these Democrats applaud it,  cause that s what happens. They either sit on their hands or applaud. Call  em out! The Drive-By Media s not telling anybody what s going on here!

People who live in New York got up one night and they saw the tops of the buildings lit up in pink and said,  I wonder what that is?

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/28/washington-waits-for-me-to-blast-the-president/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 28, 2019RUSH: Now, the government shutdown and the way it ended on Friday, I think there might be some confusion back on Friday over the weekend about how the shutdown would be ended. You know, Trumps goes out there and says (paraphrasing),  We re gonna end this, gonna reopen the government for three weeks. During the three weeks we re gonna negotiate with the Democrats about a wall, a fence, border security, and if I don t get what I want, then I might do national ñ  by the way, Marco Rubio I think was on Meet the Press over the weekend.Rubio said,  No, no, no, no, we don t want to do a national emergency for a wall. That s a precedent that we don t want to set.  So there is already opposition to the president in his own party. You could get mad at Trump all you want, you can get mad, but why wasn t this done when the Republicans had the House for two years and the Senate for two, why wasn t it done? And you could even ask Trump. Why didn t you push for it?Why didn t you   like when Obama, they had the Democrats and the House and the Senate for two years and they got Obamacare barely, and then the Republicans win the House back from Obama and his first midterms and then Obama starts taking up a bunch of things he knows he s gonna lose because the Republicans won the House, and all the Democrats are saying,  Why didn t you do this  whatever it was  when you had both houses? You can say the same thing about Trump and the Republicans. Why wait  til the Democrats take back the House to make the big push on the wall? And you know there s an answer to this that some people would give. The answer would be because no Republican really wants the wall. They didn t push for the wall when they could have done it, they wait to push for it to satisfy campaign promises when they know it won t pass, when the Democrats are there, so they can get a twofer. No wall but make it look like they really want one, but they just can t overcome that witch, Pelosi. And so now Pelosi becomes the focus of obstacles and evil and all of that.But the Republicans could have done this any time starting in 2017. You could throw Trump in there too. He could have worked as hard on the Republicans to do this, but he had other things he wanted to do. He wanted repeal and replace Obamacare, he wanted trade deals, but he had an agenda that he was working on. The wall was one of his big promises, and I think he knew that there wasn t a whole lot of support for the wall on the Republican side. He wanted to take things up that he thought he could get passed.And then the Democrats win the House and Trump voters start making noise about the wall and, hey, this opportunity s slipping away, so all the Republicans get in gear when they know that the Democrats control the House and it isn t gonna happen! I mean, on paper it isn t gonna happen. So the Republicans get to run around,  We tried. We really tried. We re working hard. We went along with the government shutdown for 35 days  or whatever it was. But they don t get the wall.And you and I know that there are a lot of Republicans that don t want the wall because their donors don t. And the Democrats don t want a wall for all the obvious reasons and maybe some reasons we don t know. I mean, who is the money behind the Democrats on this? We know the Republican money is the Chamber of Commerce, so-called Big Business that wants all that cheap labor, the opportunity for it, but who s the money behind the Democrats and their stance on this? That would be interesting to know. I mean, there s gotta be moneyed interests who want an endless parade.And, by the way, I m not saying that the Democrats do not have their own independent reason for wanting this. They want their perpetual underclass that will constantly be dependent and therefore voting for them. But there are other people that want this flow of people for reasons that have nothing to do with politics. Unless you want to make everything a political issue. But who are the moneyed interests?I mean, the Democrats are not wavering. There s not a single one of them. Some wavered on the shutdown, like eight or 10 members of Congress in the House, Democrats. But for the most part, who s the money behind them? And I ll bet you it s people that we don t know yet. It s more than just your average Democrat climate change donor. There s probably people behind the Democrats money-wise that my guess is we d be stunned if we learned who it was.Anyway, the way it happened, way the shutdown ended, somebody asked if Congress would have to vote on a continuing resolution bill. For the record, back on Friday the continuing resolution measure, without any wall funding   this is the same one that Trump refused to sign about a month ago, that continuing resolution without any wall funding was passed in both houses, House and Senate by unanimous voice votes. Nobody went on the record. Trump Signed it later on Friday.And so Reuters puts out this celebratory news story:  U.S. Congress Votes to End Government Shutdown; No Trump Border Wall Money.  And then TheHill.com has a story:  Trump Doubtful Over Border Deal, Says Another Shutdown  Certainly An Option.  Let s go to audio sound bite number 6. One of the reasons I didn t lead with this today, I gotta be honest with you. The Drive-Bys have been listening with eager anticipation to how I would open this program. The Drive-Bys are salivating. They probably have bets. They re probably making wagers out there on if I will abandon Trump or not, if I will be mad at Trump or not, and when I will do it.So I purposely waited to even bring this up until the second half hour of the program, and this is why. We have a montage from Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and this morning of a bunch of media people claiming that I caused the shutdown and now Trump has to worry about losing me.EAMON JAVERS: (noise) The president has been very concerned about the right wing of the Republican Party, Rush Limbaugh in particular.NOAH ROTHMAN:  like Rush Limbaugh are not abandoning the president over this.CHRIS MATTHEWS: He (crosstalk) listens to Rush Limbaugh!BRIAN STELTER:  Rush Limbaugh on the radio, saying give him time.JOHN HARWOOD: (noise) He does have to worry about what happens on his right wing. Rush Limbaugh ELI STOKOLS:  a nervous reaction to some of the complaints that they heard from the right flank from people like Rush Limbaugh.CHRIS WHIPPLE:  take his orders from Rush Limbaugh.ASAWIN SUEBSAENG: He has the backing of people like Rush Limbaugh.DAVE JACOBSON:   placate Rush Limbaugh.MATT LEWIS:  keeping Rush Limbaugh on board.JULIA MANCHESTER: President Trump really feels very beholden to the Rush Limbaughs.BRIAN GARDNER:  the Rush Limbaughs of the world.JOE SCARBOROUGH:   Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh. Look at the incalculable damage that those two have done.KIRSTEN POWERS: I don t know why he thinks that Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh have more power than he does.RUSH: It s just  (laughing) I go back and forth on whether or not these people actually believe this or whether they are just mouthing political bromides here. That last voice was Kirsten Powers. Now, Kirsten Powers once wrote a book, and the publishers asked if we would interview her for her book. It was about free speech and how the left needs to tone down in some sense. It wasn t a total hit piece on the left, but it was reasoned middle ground here from a leftist commentator. So we interviewed her. I was very nice to her; she was surprised.I talked to her about 45 minutes to an hour and then a bunch of email messages after that, and here it s as though she has never talked to me. It s as though she has no idea who I am.  I don t know why he thinks that Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh have more power than he does.  Does she really think that? I will guarantee you that Donald Trump doesn t think anybody has more power than he does. This is just  It s absurd! And then for Scarborough, who can t even tell people the truth about why he s doing his show from Florida now. (interruption)You didn t know that? Oh, now the  Scarborough s doing his show from his home in Jupiter and making people think that he and Mika are in Washington. So the New York Post caught up to  em and said,  Why are you doing your show in Florida? Why are you fooling people? Why don t you tell people you re in Florida?  Joe says,  Well, we wanted to come to Florida to be closer to our families.  Families? Family here? Scarborough s family in Connecticut. They were from Florida some point.They re down here to escape taxes, but they won t admit it! I don t blame  em for that, but at least when I did it I told everybody why I came down here, among many other reasons. But for some reason they won t, and now he says,  If Rush Limbaugh   Look at the  incalculable damage  that Coulter and I have done? Anyway, so you see, they re waiting and they re hoping that I m gonna just come out today and sock it to Trump and rip into Trump and say,  Trump, I ve had it. Not yet, folks. Not yet, by a long shot.Why would I come out against the president who allows me to make national policy?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: All right, sir. One more sound bite here before we get started on the phones. This is Pencil Neck, Adam  Bug-eyed  Schiff. He was on Stephanopoulos  show yesterday, ABC s This Week. The question:  Are you prepared to support any funding of a wall as part of a broader immigration compromise with the president? SCHIFF: We agreed on conference reports that would set up the funding for border security. The only thing that got in the way was the president was frightened off by Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh. And while we will negotiate among us each other and with the White House, we re not about to negotiate with these conservative pundits. One of our top priorities is passing a bill to make that kind of shutdown impossible in the future.RUSH: (Snort!) So now you re gonna make a shutdown impossible. I have never negotiated with any of these people. I don t know any of these people. I ve never said a word to these people! This is so absurd. This is all part of their ongoing effort to defame and to impugn. They want the brain-dead people that watch the Drive-By Media to actually think that I am behind this shutdown.It s a way of making sure that no additional people ever start listening here, and it s a way to keep this fevered-pitch hatred for conservatives up at a high level. They are engendering hatred here for me and others who have nothing to do with any of this. I m not whining, folks. I m just telling you what s going on. People that do not understand the degree that hatred for us propels the leftist agenda are going to forever be shocked and dismayed as that agenda marches on.Quickly to the phones. Orlando. This is Ed. Great to have you, sir. Welcome to the EIB Network. Hi.CALLER: Dittos, Rush. Rush, I want to check your opinion on something. I m one of the millions who supported Trump, still support Trump. During the shutdown, all of these polls supposedly said all these people who were deserting Trump  I m assuming they were a lot of his supporters. I voted for Trump like I m sure millions did for basically three things: build the wall, put in the judges that ll follow the Constitution, and taxes. Of course, there s some other things. The point I m trying to make is, who are these people who supposedly have gone off the reservation because of the shutdown and no longer support him? Who s gonna build that wall, Rush? Who s gonna appoint these judges? He s our best hope to get this done.RUSH: I get you. I think what you re seeing in those media reports is hope and prayers and  Well, they don t pray. They re hoping that Trump s base is gonna abandon him, and they re assuming that it s happening because that s what would happen on their side. If one of them, one of their leaders had a hard-and-fast agenda item and they betrayed their voters on it, then those people would go berserk. So they think it s gonna happen here.Most Trump voters think like you: There s nowhere else to go here, and the larger enemy is the left, not Trump. The larger enemy is the opposition to America, the opposition to the American founding, the opposition to us   and Trump is it. If you bail on Trump, then you ve got literally nobody stopping this forward march by the left. So I think it s largely  It s imagined. They might read some conservative media people claiming they re leaving Trump or some fringe tweeters and assume that that means Trump voters at large.You know the dirty little secret? Trump s approval numbers among Hispanics is 50%. During the shutdown, it went up 19 points. You know what Nancy Pelosi s are? This is the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. You know what her favorable-unfavorable numbers are? Nancy Pelosi: 28% favorable, 47% unfavorable. Nancy Pelosi, who s being treated as practically the queen of the country. You re being lied to so often in the media, folks, it s hard to keep track of all of it.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Nancy Pelosi, by the way, has explained her shutdown strategy. And just to remind you, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, Pelosi s approval number at 27 or 28%, her disapproval at 48%, I think. And yet if you watch the Drive-By Media, you would think that the nation loves Pelosi. And if you look at the Drive-By polls, you would see 48% of the people have lost faith in leadership, they ve lost faith in the current direction of the country.Now, depending on who they re talking about, I could understand people thinking that. But the one thing the media doesn t know as they continue to blame me for the shutdown and throw my name out there with all these stories about it, and as they write stories on how you, the Trump voters of America, are abandoning him, it is abundantly clear they still to this day do not understand Trump, and they do not understand the people that voted for him or why. They haven t the foggiest idea, or these stories that they re writing about people abandoning Trump would cease.About that, let me make an observation. Let s kind of do a timeline revision of this whole wall business. Let s take the first two years of Trump s term, when the Republicans had the House and Republicans had the Senate. Do you recall   and I could be wrong about this   do you recall a clamor daily, anywhere, on Twitter, on Facebook, anywhere from Trump voters,  Where s the wall? Where s the wall? Where s the wall?  You don t, really. Just an observation.I mean, nobody was hell-bent largely because they trusted Trump on what building the wall meant. They trusted that Trump remained committed to securing the border and not granting amnesty to everybody here already. Whether there was any talk of the wall or not, which is why people were patient. Trump voters were patient.So all during the first two years Trump is trying to repeal and replace Obamacare, he s trying to de-nuke the Norks, he s trying to rearrange trade deals with the ChiComs, he redoes NAFTA, much more fair terms for the United States. He totally revamps American manufacturing, puts more people back to work in this country than, as a percentage, have ever had jobs. He has improved working conditions and employment circumstances for women, for African-Americans and Hispanics, who are all experiencing the lowest unemployment rate ever. Trump pulled us out of the Paris Accords and refused to let the United States get taken again by United Nations world body under a bogus issue of climate change.So the Trump voting public was largely pleased. They were largely satisfied. What they didn t like was this never ending, incessant attempt to destroy Trump, this silent coup being run by Obama s Department of Justice and intelligence community with Robert Mueller doing who knows what. They were livid as they learned the truth and the details about this effort to get rid of Trump and to overturn the election results.And during all of this, Trump voters were largely satisfied with his performance, and he was keeping promises, and he was standing up to all of these people trying to take him out. He was engendering a lot of people very proud of him and they were willing to go to the mat to defend him no matter what. Then here comes the midterm elections and the Democrats win it. But Trump did everything he could to forestall. He went out and did all of those rallies.He s the hardest working guy in Washington on the Republican side of the aisle, either by reality or perception, depending. He s doing all these rallies. And many of the people he went out and rallied for got elected in the Senate and beat incumbent Democrats like in Missouri. So Trump s not taking any days off. He s not sloughing off. He s not phoning it in. He hasn t given his supporters any reason to be unhappy with him.He continues to tweet. He calls out the left and the media for their rancid behavior. He gives his supporters countless reasons to cheer every day, amidst their anger and rage at the left and at the media. Then, despite Trump s efforts, single-handed efforts to win the House, the Democrats win it. And as the Democrats do every December, because we have these ongoing continuing resolutions, the government was about to run out of money. So we needed to sign a continuing resolution to keep the country running.And then it was reported that the president wanted money for the wall in this and the Democrats told him to go pound sand, it wasn t gonna happen. The word leaked that he was gonna sign that. But he wasn t gonna sign it! But the word was, the news was that he was. That got everybody riled up. And now we live in a world where the media says that Trump was on the way to signing it until I spoke up and a bunch of other people spoke up and he changed his mind. He was never going to sign it.That s how the wall has become an issue, not because of Trump s performance. You say,  Well, why didn t they push it when the Republicans had two years unopposed?  There were other things. There were efforts made. The Republican Party, if truth be known, doesn t want a wall. For the first nine months of Trump s administration, the Republican Party thought he was gonna be sent packing! They believed all this Russian garbage!I think if you look back on it, it s stunning what Trump has pulled off here, what he s put up with, what he s triumphed over. And I don t think he s shown any sign of not believing any more in border security, and I don t think his voters think he has betrayed them yet on this. Trump voters don t look at him as the problem, they don t look at him as the enemy, they don t look at him as a traditional politician breaking promises. Just the exact opposite. But the Drive-Bys are just incapable of seeing Trump or you exactly as he and you are.Let s take a brief time-out.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Well, I was gonna go back to the phones, but I m gonna have to delay that  til the next segment. I just got a sound bite here. Just moments ago on CNN the infobabe host, Brianna Keilar, was talking to the White House correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, a guy named Peter Nicholas, who apparently just recently interviewed President Trump. And so Brianna Keilar, the infobabe at CNN, said,  Ann Coulter called him a wimp. Lou Dobbs said the president got rolled on this wall business. How big of a problem does the president see losing those two supporters? NICHOLAS: Ann Coulter s name came up in our interview. And he said, you know, he thinks that she s just upset because he doesn t return her calls. So he didn t seem that worried about it. He mentioned Rush Limbaugh is still supportive. He mentioned Sean Hannity is still supportive. So he thinks that he still has conservatives in his corner.RUSH: Well! There you have it, ladies and gentlemen, the president told reporters everything s cool. I m still with him. The Drive-Bys are not gonna be   well, actually I think they will be happy. I think they ll be able to, in their minds, massage and manipulate that.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/22/when-will-we-learn-how-to-beat-back-leftist-bullies/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 22, 2019RUSH: The White House just announced that the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, will not even have a conversation with President Trump about the government shutdown and any of the proposals to end it. Why is anybody surprised over this? You know, my degree of frustration here is mounting. And it s all rooted in the fact that there are apparently still so many people on our side who do not instinctively understand who the left is, who the media, who the Democrat Party is   what their tactics are, what their objective is   and therefore don t seem to be even engaged in the concept of beating them, of defeating them, of stopping them, of beating them back.Despite all of the evidence over I don t know how many years that have led into decades, we still, apparently, have people that continuing to hold out hope that they re reasonable, that they re honest, that they can be approached as reasonable people, when they can t be. Now, I understand the White House saying Pelosi won t chat. I mean, there s a PR reason for doing this, and I m glad they did. Don t misunderstand. But the idea that anybody expects Pelosi to be reasonable here is absurd.The idea that anybody thinks there s a deal to be made here by being reasonable, by according them respect is absurd. According them respect  We re dealing with a bunch of bullies here! No matter where we go, no matter what we see, we re dealing with a bunch of bullies! I want to ask you to imagine some things along with me, if you will. Imagine if Catholicism and Christianity were treated with the same respect as Islam in the Drive-By Media and in social media. Imagine if  Make America Great Again  hats were treated with the same respect as hijabs.Imagine if threats against conservatives were treated with the same concern as threats against homosexuals. But, no, instead Twitter, which is the cesspool and the sewer that keeps all of this destructive drivel and crap alive and blossoming. Twitter is refusing to delete the numerous calls for violence against the Covington Catholic students. There are countless calls for violence that Twitter will not pull down. They are still there. They re still being posted.Twitter has pulled down the original post that got all of this started, but they will not pull down any of the numerous calls for violence against the Covington Catholic teenagers. The children. Imagine if the left s concern for the children was actually genuine, which, of course, it isn t. Twitter is also refusing to suspend the accounts of those making the threats. Meanwhile, the Covington Catholic High School has had to close today for security reasons, and guess what?Nathan Phillips and the American Indian Movement have canceled their protest at the school. Since there s no kids to harass, I guess the American Indian Movement isn t gonna show up. There s no reason to protest if there aren t any kids to bully and to lie about. The rest of the Drive-By Media are saying they re not sure if the school had to close due to safety concerns or because of the weather. Right.No, no. The media is leaving open the possibility the school is closed today because of weather, not for security concerns, even though the principal of the school wrote a letter to parents saying they were closed because of security concerns. Robert Rowe, the principal. The letter that he sent to the parents reads,  After meeting with local authorities, we have made the decision to cancel school and be closed on Tuesday, January 22, in order to ensure the safety of our students, faculty and staff. All activities on campus will be canceled for the entire day and evening. So the left wins here, lying and making up an entire scenario advanced by the Drive-By Media, knee-jerk agreed to by people who should have known better who are today themselves apologizing for their knee-jerk behavior.  Students, parents, faculty and staff are not to be on campus for any reason,  The principal s letter said.  Please continue to keep the Covington Catholic Community in your prayers. One of the concerns was due to the fact that some Indians had planned to hold a protest at the high school. Their protest has since been moved to outside the diocese of Covington as a safety precaution. Well, they can t,  cause there s no kids to bully, is why. Now, I want you to imagine something else. I want you to imagine if Barack Hussein O had been president and this took place. As bad as it has been, it would have been 10 times worse. Do you know who would be at the White House today?Nathan Phillips, the frail Indian leader banging on his war drum in the face of that teenager, Nathan Phillips, would be at the White House today being honored for courage and bravery and would be held up as a role model for all of America to follow. That s what would be going on today. If Barack Obama were president  And I m mentioning all this as a reminder of why it s so damn fortunate for everybody that Hillary Clinton was not.Because if she was president, the same thing would be happening. Nathan Phillips and maybe even some of the Black Israelites that were really the instigators, maybe they would be at the White House, too, as the heroes, as the people concerned with civil rights and human rights and climate change and whatever the hell else they could throw in the bag. And from the White House we would be getting continued condemnation of the teenagers of Covington High School and Catholicism and white privilege.This is not happening today because Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. I just want you to imagine how much worse it could be, and I want you to keep in mind what the stakes here are.  Hands up, don t shoot.  Anybody remember that? That was a total fraud. Can I remind you of the roots of  hands up, don t shoot ? I don t want people to forget these things. A young black man in Ferguson, Missouri, was supposedly   after robbing a convenience store   walking down the street on a beautiful Saturday afternoon contemplating his first year at college.When all of a sudden, an evil white cop drove up and told him to get out of the street and to get on the sidewalk. And the young man was so engrossed in his future college life that he didn t immediately obey, and so the evil white cop just pulled out a gun and shot the innocent young black student contemplating his first year at college. None of this was true. He had indeed robbed a convenience store. He was stopped by the cops for a host of legitimate reasons and attempted to take the gun away from the cop.That became  hands up, don t shoot.  That became an orchestrated lie and fraud that resulted in who knows how much tumult and chaos throughout Ferguson, Missouri, throughout the St. Louis and the state of Missouri legal system. And it was all made up. And then that led to protests with protesters from Oakland and Baltimore and all over the country showing up, destroying businesses, neighborhoods, threatening people all on the basis of a lie.Even St. Louis Rams football players were running on the field during pregame introductions, showing solidarity with the  hands up, don t shoot  movement. And just like this that happened in Washington on Saturday, it was all made up, it was all a fraud, and guess who was there promoting both of them? The American journalism community, otherwise known as the Drive-By or mainstream media. The mainstream media has gotten so many things wrong just in the past two years that it has become impossible to list them all in a readable article.Glenn Greenwald today, who is no conservative, by the way (he runs a website called The Intercept)   has published a story that prints out to 58 pages.  Beyond BuzzFeed: The 10 Worst, Most Embarrassing U.S. Media Failures on the Trump-Russia Story,  collusion, and then 10 more that are  (dis)honorable mention.  Every one of them has links back to the websites where these hoaxes were run. During all of these mistakes, during all of these errors, during all of these lies   because that s what these stories are. They are abject lies.They are lies knowingly told and reported by the media just as this one is involving the Covington kids. In not one instance has the dean of any journalism school in America condemned the actions of the practitioners of the business or of the art. The deans of Columbia journalism school, Harvard journalism school (if they ve got one), the Missouri University J-school, not a one of them has ever said a thing in condemnation for any of this abject, disastrous journalism. Not one single condemnation. Not one bit of concern from anybody in that business over the damage that they are doing to that business.Not one.And why? Because it isn t journalism. It is activism. It is no longer the media that s the adjunct of the Democrat Party. It s the exact opposite. The Democrat Party is the adjunct of the media. The media are the community organizers. The media are the descendants of Barack Hussein O. The media are the descendants of practitioners of The Rules for Radicals as authored by Saul Alinsky. As such, they re doing a great job. The deans of journalism, in other words the journalism professors and instructors, are probably looking on with gratitude, appreciation, and honor over what has become their industry.It has been totally co-opted by the radical, worldwide left, and they re doing a bang-up job of advancing a fraudulent, lie infested political agenda under the guise of reporting the news. Remember the policeman involved with the Skip Gates situation in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the campus of Harvard. Remember that? Barack Obama called the cop  stupid,  did a dumb thing. They had to have a beer summit in the backyard at the White House. The policeman involved in the Skip Gates situation became a target, thanks to Barack Obama s comments.Obama praised Black Lives Matter organizers at the White House. They became famous for their chants:  Whose streets? Our streets! Pigs in a blanket. Fry  em like bacon. What do we want? Dead cops! When do we want  em? Right now!  All of that applauded and encouraged from the White House. The left is out of control. Their anger knows no bounds. The rhetoric inflames mobs and endangers lives. Jim Geraghty at National Review Online has written and posted an interesting piece about this.I don t have time in this segment to read it all, but let me share with you the opening graph here to give you an idea.  There is no sinister, government-run mass-surveillance system watching our every move. The vast majority of us chose to carry around smartphones with cameras, and some of us chose to livestream so much of what we see, whether it s dramatic or not. Big Brother isn t watching; the mob is   at least when a particular moment is pitched to potential viewers as dramatic and demanding attention. There is no sinister, government-run system for punishing those who say or do controversial or unpopular things. Groups of often-anonymous individuals on social media [i.e. Twitter] take it upon themselves to enact their vision of justice   demanding the identification of anyone seen acting controversially on social media videos, declare them  guilty of hate crimes,  and demanding  action  against them.  The point is we don t have some gigantic eye in the sky run by evil government surveiling all of us.We have a leftist Democrat mob of anonymous jerks and bullies using social media to get people fired to have their businesses destroyed, to have people s reputations lied about and ruined! All with the support and encouragement of Silicon Valley and high-tech leaders, who refuse to clean up the cesspool and the sewers that their businesses have become. There is no state pressure needed to get private institutions to turn against suddenly ostracized individuals. Employers will quickly fire anyone who they deem to be a sufficient public-relations headache. Publishers preemptively warn authors that they will not stand by them if they become  the subject of public disrepute, contempt, complaints or scandals.  In the face of sufficient social-media outrage and negative press coverage, churches and religious schools will publicly promise to contemplate  kicking kids out of school.Just because of the pressure of the mob  Anonymous, lying jerks hiding behind false identities on Twitter and on Facebook and other places. Imagine if there were an actual journalism community exposing this and telling the American people that 90% of what they see on social media is abject untruth. But, of course, that won t happen because all this that s happening on social media is exactly what American leftists led by the American media want to happen.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: There is no-state-run system for collective punishment. There is instead a bunch of idiots, a bunch of bullies, a bunch of lying, anonymous bullies calling for all colleges now to express skepticism about any applicant from Covington Catholic High School. Universities around the country are being pressured not to admit any graduates from Covington High School because it s a birthplace, it s a breeding ground for racism, white privilege, and hatred, and what do they do? What do they do about it?The only way this is gonna  Well, it s not the only way it s gonna end. The important thing is no hostile foreign power had to invade to impose all of this crap on our country. No sinister cabal took control of the reins of our government, although they tried and still are. Nobody tore up the Constitution. Instead, groups of people nobody ever heard of and still don t know who they are and incidentally a bunch of people in pajamas that have zilch power whatsoever have ended up imposing a new system of mob tyranny via social media on the American people.

President Trump today ñ  ha-ha-ha. You re gonna love this. You are going to love this. President Trump today appeared to deny military aircraft to House speaker Nancy Pelosi for an upcoming foreign trip. This in response to her call to the latest State of the Union address amid the government shutdown. In a stinging and curt letter to Pelosi Trump said that her trip has been postponed. He wrote,  Due to the shutdown, I m sorry to inform you your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over. In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I m sure you would agree that postponing this PR event of yours is totally appropriate. I also feel that during this period it d be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown. Obviously, if you d like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative.   That s Trump s letter to Pelosi.See, folks, do you think Romney would ever send a letter like that? (laughing) McCain? Kasich? No way. You know what they would do?  Despite the fact that you have canceled my State of the Union, I want to show the country that we are reasonable people. And if you want to fly to those three places, we will gladly furnish you military aircraft.  And Pelosi would just say they just got suckered into letting me have what I want again. And they think they re gonna be able to buy respect with this but they re just a bunch of idiots and buffoons and they prove it every day.And Trump says, sorry, you have to postpone your trip.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, folks, the Trump letter to Pelosi is legit. It is real. Trump denied her military aircraft to go on her seven-day trip to Brussels and Afghanistan and Egypt. Here s the kicker. She was to leave today. And I think Fox News is covering this near the buses where Pelosi s entourage was supposed to leave and head to the airport.
That letter I read is legit. He s postponing her trip, sure she understands, government shutdown and so forth, she should stay in town to negotiate. There s not a single other Republican with the gonads to even get close to doing this. It s the real thing.  "

In the next week we re gonna pass a threshold with the government shutdown, the partial shutdown, which will trigger what s called a reduction in force review where all these people, the nonessentials that are not going to work, but are still waiting on getting paid, their positions are in jeopardy of never being reinstituted.RUSH: Yeah. I knew this was gonna happen. We had a caller about this yesterday, and I said,  Shhhh. Don t mention this, don t mention it. It s just gonna alert people that this is on the way to happening, and it d be better to keep it a secret.  But this has been blown now. So I may as well go through this. You ve touched on it.The nut of this is, folks, what the caller was wanting to talk about yesterday, I shut him down, Trump can start laying off permanently furloughed workers after 30 days. So if the shutdown goes 30 days, all the furloughed workers, Trump can wave good-bye, see ya, you are done, and it s a law. It s called the reduction in force procedure.And it s an option, to lay off all furloughed government workers after their furlough reaches 30 days. Trump is on day 26, maybe 27 by now. He hasn t signed any bill   wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold it a minute. Somebody help me out. I thought I saw a link earlier today, I didn t print it. Has Trump signed anything or guaranteed back pay to furloughed workers? Well, that may negate this. If he has done that, if he has signed anything that will guarantee back pay for furloughed workers, then I think he has taken off the table the option for reduction in force. I m gonna have to double-check that.I have a story on this from the website Big League Politics. President Trump can save taxpayers more than a billion dollars per week if he lays off the approximately 800,000 nonessential workers who are not getting paid. Now, in deciding who stays and who goes, federal agencies have to take four factors into account: tenure, veteran status, total federal civilian and military service, and performance. Those are the things that can be used to determine whether somebody is going to be laid off after they ve been furloughed.But I think this whole thing becomes inoperative or academic if the president guarantees back pay. Because if he guarantees back pay then by definition, you re not going to let them go. You re not gonna engage in the reduction in force if you re gonna pay them. I need to double-check that, but I know he signed the back pay. I ve had that confirmed. What that means in terms of reduction of force is what I m gonna have to double-check. Jeff, did you have anything else to say about that? I ve got 45 seconds here. If you wanted to weigh in on it any more, feel free.CALLER: Well, because it s a partial government shutdown, it s an administrative action. It s not an emergency action. So I think he can argue since it s administrative that the reduction in force can still take place. If it were an emergency shutdown, it would be different. As far as signing the legislation on the back pay, I wasn t certain that he signed it yet. I knew it passed, but I hadn t got a confirmation on that.RUSH: Yeah. I don t know if he signed it. But I did see that he said that they were gonna get it, that he has assured them there will be back pay. And he did this in the context of asking some of them to come back to work without pay.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here s Jason in Stafford, Virginia. Great to have you on the program. Hi.CALLER: Hey, Rush. Thanks for taking my call.RUSH: You bet, sir.CALLER: So just to lay out a couple things, my entire family s income is based on our government salaries. The shutdown hasn t really affected us yet because, something they don t talk about on the news, is last Friday we still got paid for the 68 hours we worked for the previous pay period. We re gonna start being affected this next pay period, so a week from tomorrow. The thing is we don t want the president to back down, my wife and I. I can t speak for other government employees. We re scared. We re worried. We re thinking about how are we gonna feed our kids, how we gonna pay our bills, we got a letter from OPM for our mortgage, our car payments, and stuff like that. They ll just throw that month on the end. So we re covered there.But even though we re worried, we want what s best for the country. I served in the military for 10 years so I have veterans preference. This whole layoff thing that you guys talked about with the last caller, I m kind of worried about that, but at the end of the day we do not want the president to back down. We want the wall. If he reopens the government before he gets the wall, he ll never get the wall. So keep it going, don t lay anybody off because, you know, we didn t do anything wrong, but fight for the wall. You have to fight for the wall. And I think the president should come out every morning, go outside to where the cameras are and invite Chuck and Nancy to the White House every single morning, invite them to the White House to negotiate. And then every night go back out and say they didn t show up. I think that s all he d need to do to get them to negotiate.RUSH: Not a bad idea.CALLER: But do not back down.RUSH: Let me tell you something. You re in a tough position financially, and yet your political heart is with the president. But, you know, you re right. If he compromises at all on any of this there s never gonna be a wall if he does any kind of compromise because the compromise will not include a wall. They re hell-bent on it for reasons that have nothing to do with the wall or immigration.CALLER: Yeah. But the thing is, what s best for the country? Is it gonna be a hardship on us financially if it lasts until mid-February? Absolutely it will be. And we ll have to pull some strings. But my wife and I are responsible adults who have credit cards that aren t maxed out. And it s not optimal to have to pay back a credit card because of the interest rates, but to be honest, we can feed our family with a credit card, and if that s what we need to do, that s what we need to do because my wife and I   my wife started working for the federal government at 16 and has worked her way up.She s a GS-12, and she s not essential unless there s an emergency. I m not essential, period. Always have been. But we re good. We want the wall. We want what s best for our country because all we ve ever done in our life is serve our country. And a lot of the Border Patrol agents down there say they want the wall. A lot of them served in the military, a lot of them are my former brothers and sisters. Give  em the wall. Give  em what they need to protect themselves, don t back down, and don t let Chuck and Nancy get away with it. They don t want to negotiate, go out every day and blast them by name. And invite any Democrat willing to negotiate, come to the White House. And then every day go back out and say they didn t come. That s not on him. It s on them.RUSH: I ve been in your position but when I was much younger and I didn t have any dependents. It was just me. But I ve been the route where the credit card was the only way to live. I had two major payments that came due in the same 15-day period and I couldn t make both of them. It went on that way for months and I have an idea what you re going through. It s very applaudable. You don t hear from many people like you who put the country first in a situation like this. So it s very humbling to have you say these things.Hang in, I know it s gonna work out, as you do. And the president did sign, by the way. It s official. He has signed a back pay thing, so to whatever extent that that s some comfort, you know that you re gonna be back paid, you and your wife both at some point. I appreciate the call. I m really honored that you are among the people in this audience too.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/17/they-still-think-im-running-the-country/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 17, 2019RUSH: I mentioned earlier, folks, that we are into the fourth week, and it may be   it s still the fourth week, but the days are piling up where I am continually blamed for the ongoing government shutdown. I got a note today from Jeff Lord, who writes at the American Spectator and for NewsBusters, and he used to be up there on CNN. He was a conservative analyst and strategist, pro-Trumpian until CNN got rid of everybody that speaks for Trump.And he sent me a link to a story at TheHill.com today where I m being blamed for this. It s actually Juan Williams. It s a story about Juan Williams having a conversation with Karl Rove in which I m blamed for all this. And I wrote him back, said,  Jeff, do you really believe they think this, or is this just stuff they re regurgitating for their base?  He said,  No, they do, Rush. I ve asked myself. I m convinced that they believe this, like they believe a bunch of other things that nobody can understand. Let s look at today s montage. The Drive-Bys continue to say Trump is a hostage to me.CHARLIE SYKES: Is Rush Limbaugh going to say that I surrendered?JUAN WILLIAMS: Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, they re running this government.CLAIRE MCCASKILL: Rush Limbaugh gave him what for, and he then reversed course.CHRIS MATTHEWS: How does he escape from the Rush Limbaugh death grip?RON KLAIN: Nancy Pelosi did something very smart. She should have gone the rest of the way. She might as well just have invited Rush Limbaugh to deliver the State of the Union address.RUSH: Hey, I could go for that. I would do that. By the way, apparently, the White House is in consultations with Mitch McConnell to see if there s some way that the Senate can invite Trump to do a State of the Union address. Now, the Senate chamber is not big enough, if you re gonna have the entire Congress there. You can only fit everybody in the House chamber. I m not aware of a constitutional provision for the Senate inviting the president up for State of the Union.The State of the Union, as we mentioned yesterday, is a constitutional requirement, and for the most part, it s been a pro forma thing until the age of TV. For the longest time it was submitted in writing, it didn t get a whole lot of attention media-wise because it was like everything else, it was something mandated. And so the executive branch tried to keep as little out of it as they could because of separation of powers.And then the age of television, radio before that, the age of broadcast changed everything. And so the State of the Union became a grand political opportunity, and that s how it s been used. And it s become an opportunity for presidents to promise agenda items, to lay out an agenda with wild promises like   how many presidents in my lifetime, I m trying to think, have stated a national objective and they have challenged Congress to come up with the money to cure cancer? My whole life. Nixon did it. Clinton did it. They ve all done it. There s no cure for cancer.Wild agenda items, promises galore, government largesse here, government largesse there, all of it aimed at the unfortunate, the less fortunate, the hungry and the thirsty. And there s just perfunctory time given to the State of the Union.  I m here to report tonight the state of our union sound.  Yay. And everybody stands up and cheers for a while, and then here comes the laundry list. It used to just be a pro forma thing that didn t have much to it at all because of the executive branch not wishing to give up much to the legislative.Now, the voices in this montage were Juan Williams, Claire McCaskill   do you know she has been hired by PMSNBC? The defeated Senator from Missouri. Chris Matthews was who asked,  How does Trump escape from the Rush Limbaugh death grip?  Ron Klain:  Nancy Pelosi did something very smart. She should have gone the rest of the way. She might as well just have invited Rush Limbaugh to deliver the State of the Union.  And of course there was raucous laughter.Now, we move on to Fox & Friends today, and they played a clip   Hannity played this. I gather that something I opened the program with yesterday has made the rounds of cable news. And it was me suggesting, imploring, advising, guiding, instructing the president to hang in. That it s gonna be tough but he can win this if he can just hang in. It s gonna take a few more weeks but that he can win this. There will be risks involved and it isn t gonna be easy. So that clip has been played for the benefit of other panelists on these shows to react to. And so here is Ainsley Earhardt on Fox & Friends this morning getting the ball rolling there.EARHARDT: Rush Limbaugh had this to say.RUSH ARCHIVE: I m just gonna tell you, folks, if President Trump can hang in there, if he can hang in there and not go wobbly, he can win this. It s gonna be a few more weeks. There are gonna be a lot of risks. There are gonna be a lot of temptations to drop the ball and cave. I don t mean cave. There s gonna be lot of temptation to make a deal. But he can win this if he just hangs in there.RUSH: You notice the proper phrasing in my   they said that Sinatra, the brilliance of Sinatra was his phrasing. Well, I, too, have mastered the art of phrasing in articulated speech. Of course, there isn t any other kind of speech. All speech is articulated. But there is a talent to it in terms of timing and phrasing. Phraseology, the pauses and so forth. You noticed that, I m sure. So up next is Brian Kilmeade reacting. Brian Kilmeade and Steve Doocy then react to my little opinion there.KILMEADE: I would say this. The president can win by still compromising. He s not gonna get everything he wants. It s impossible for every president  DOOCY: He s already compromised.KILMEADE:   to get everything he wants. He wants between   obviously over the 1.3, up to 5.8, maybe give up some DACA pathway to citizenship. There s something else they could do there, but I think doing a deal also shows leadership,  cause right now the polls show he is getting most of the blame, 49% blame him; 33% blame the Democrats.RUSH: Right. So this is what I meant by pressure is going to be intense and it s gonna be tough  cause you re gonna have people, even Trump supporters,  My God, Mr. President, you gotta stop the bleeding. Look at the polling data. Oh, my God, 49% think you re the problem. You gotta bail, you gotta cave, you gotta make some kind of deal.  This is where Kilmeade s coming from. Make a deal, two billion in there, make a deal, give the DACA, DREAMer kids their amnesty, and let s be done with this and then declare victory.That s not how this should end. If it ended that way, you think anybody s gonna be up there praising Trump for presidential leadership and recognizing where he was and the need for compromise. The only way that this is gonna end with Trump being heralded is if Pelosi gets everything she wants and Trump is gonna be hailed as realizing he had a no-win situation. Trump finally woke up from the poisonous influence of Rush Limbaugh and decided that was the wrong way to go. That s how Trump is gonna be heralded as winning this, if he caves and lets it look like Pelosi won.And so any advocacy for something less than $5.8 billion,  Ah, do 1.8, do two billion, and then give the DACA kids their amnesty and then we ll call it a win.  How is that anything Trump wants? Trump s not called for $2 billion, and he s not called ñ well, he has posed DACA amnesty with the DREAMers, but the Democrats rejected that. So how is any of that, in real terms, a win for Trump? How is any of that a win for the country?This is one of these situations where you really have to ask, what is there to compromise on? The Democrats do not want a wall. The Democrats are hell-bent there won t be a wall, and the Democrats are actually moving in the position that we shouldn t even really enforce the border. Some of them are. Where do you compromise with that? Where is the overlap?But it s gonna be tough because people have understandably been so ingrained, the government up and running means all is well. And we re gonna continue with stories of suffering and disease and suicide and car crashes and you know all blamed on the government shutdown. All blamed on Trump. The government shutdown is just as easily the fault of the Democrats, willing to spend four-some-odd trillion dollars, but unwilling to allocate five billion of it. If you ve got $50,000, this is the Democrats with $50,000 unwilling to spend 47 bucks is one way to look at this.Here s Douglas Brinkley, well-known presidential   well, so-called presidential historian. He s just another left-wing hack disguised as an academic. And he was on CNN Tonight with Don Lemon last night. And the question:  Did the Trump administration get played here? You know, whether Trump s working with the Russians. Did Trump get played? Were the Russians actually using Trump and he didn t know it? Is that where this is going, Doug? BRINKLEY: I think there s suspicion now for the first time with, let s call it a gang of ten Republican Senators   Mitt Romney s now joined the Senate. They re worried, is Donald Trump really perhaps an agent of some force for the Kremlin? Is his ties as close to Putin as we thought? And they re looking for cover. Some of them are starting to want to create a senatorial record that isn t just rubber-stamping Donald Trump in fear of the mean tweet or Rush Limbaugh s gonna attack them.RUSH: Wait. How did I end up in that bite? What is this?  The Republican senators are looking for cover. They want to start creating a record that isn t rubber-stamping Trump in fear of the mean tweet or Rush Limbaugh attacking them.  But that s not the main thrust. The main thrust of this is that we re all communists and we re all Russians now. Mitt Romney s joined the Senate, that means Romney s been talking to what s-his-face here, Brinkley.  Is Donald Trump really perhaps an agent of some force to the Kremlin?  Do you realize how insane these people are?They re going crazier and crazier with no evidence, in fact, evidence to the contrary. Now it s being put out there that Trump may actually   it was going back and forth. Trump was an unwitting dupe of the Russians, so stupid, so incompetent, so incapable the Russians were able to use him and didn t even know it. Now he s a Russian agent, now he is a force for the Kremlin. And there s 10 Republican senators that think so. People are literally losing their minds over a totally fabricated, made-up story, allegation, it s mind-boggling.It is literally mind-boggling, especially when you remember that there have been the closest of ties between the Democrat Party and the communist leadership of the old Soviet Union. They were inseparable! Liberalism is a branch of communism. They re both on the same side of the political divide, the Democrats and the communists are on the same side of the political divide! And they all want the same things! And the Soviets, the communists, the Russians have influenced via infiltration American education, American religion! And somehow Trump, out of all of this, Trump is some agent? As I say, mind-boggling.This morning C-SPAN s Washington Journal, Representative Salud Carbajal answered viewer calls and during the segment here s a caller, Barry, from South Carolina and Carbajal or Carbajal, the J is not pronounced. It could be Carbajal, depending on accent. But they re talking about the government shutdown.BARRY: I would like the representative to talk a little bit about the bill that the Senate passed and how it came about that we ended up in the shutdown with the Senate passing it, and going to the House and then Trump, he agreed to it as well, and until Fox got involved and Rush Limbaugh.CARBAJAL: Thank you for asking that question because it allows to give perspective to what transpired. This president agreed with the United States Senate on a bipartisan bill that was put forth and voted on by the United States Senate to keep the government open. The president reneged because he was watching Fox News, who suggested that he not move forward with signing the bill.RUSH: No, no, no, no, no. That s not what happened, Salud, that s not what happened. What happened was that Trump was in the process of signing it and I was on this program warning him not to do it, that he better not do it, he better not, and somebody walked in the office, Salud, and said that Trump already had the D written down on his signature, said,  You better not do it. Limbaugh says it s over if you do it.  And so Trump stopped signing. That s what happened. You people on the left have gotta get your bogus lines of thought straight. Fox News had nothing to do with this one, Salud.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This is Frank up next, Grand Rapids, Minnesota?  Is there a Grand Rapids in Minnesota?CALLER:  There is.RUSH:  Well, it s great to have you from there.  How are you?CALLER:  Good.  It s an honor to talk to you, Rush.  I just wanted to get your thoughts on Donald Trump or anyone else who doesn t have to apologize for listening to the American people and changing his mind.  When s the last time that we had a president that actually listened to the American people and did what they wanted?  And you and your program, you re the nucleus of a bunch of like-minded people that Donald Trump wants to listen to.  And I don t think anybody has to apologize for that.  I think it s an amazing thing that we have in our president. I m proud of it.RUSH:  I agree with you a hundred percent.  In fact, probably even more than that.  The idea that Trump would be listening to this program as though that s somehow illegitimate, the fact that Trump would be listening to people that voted for him, that that s somehow sick.  This is exactly what I m talking about.  Folks, that s what they believe.  I don t know how to tell you, how beside themselves people in Washington are over the simple fact that Trump strives to keep promises.In the world of politics, those are gimmicks.  Nobody means any of that.  And everybody knows.  That s why there are never any news stories on presidents and candidates breaking promises.  It s expected.  It s a gimmick.  Everybody does it.  You re not supposed to actually try to keep them!  Because that would mean the people have some power in things.  And that s not supposed to happen.But the constant attacks on me and this program and you, well, I mean, it s 30 years on that they ve been doing this, and the reason for it is to discredit, in the eyes and minds of people that don t listen.  They have given up on trying to get you to stop listening to me.  They ve figured out they can t do that.  And they ve tried.Just like they ve tried to separate Trump s voters.  So what they re doing now is personal attack, insult, and all this, to damage my credibility and Trump s and everybody else s among people that don t listen so that our audiences won t grow and so that, more importantly than that, that we will not be influential with people who don t listen.  And that s part and parcel of their approach, is to discredit anybody, to delegitimize anybody they are threatened by.  There s no desire for compromise, working together, crossing the aisle and all of that garbage.  It s always been BS, and it s never gonna be anything but.  "

El Chapo, the Sinaloa cartel chieftain  El Chapo paid a $100 million bribe (the latest news story here) to an ex-Mexican president while he was president, and everybody s acting like,  Oh, my God! Oh, my! (Snort!) It happens every day. The Clintons do this kind of stuff every day. It s called lobbying. What s the difference?So El Chapo, who has an interest in illegal drugs, gives a Mexican president $100 million bribe.The Democrats go to Puerto Rico to get their bribes with their lobbyists and with their donors, and they did it in the middle of the government shutdown. No different.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/16/do-a-state-of-the-union-rally-mr-president/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 16, 2019RUSH: I m just gonna tell you, folks, if President Trump can hang in there, if he can hang in there and not go wobbly, he can win this. It s gonna be a few more weeks. There are gonna be a lot of risks. There are gonna be a lot of temptations to drop the ball and cave. I don t mean cave, there s gonna be a lot of temptation to make a deal. But he can win this if he just hangs in there.Greetings, and welcome. Rush Limbaugh and EIB Network. Back at you. Here we are. What is this? Wednesday already. Middle of the week, hump day it is. Our phone number if you want to be on the program, 800-282-2882. Email address, ElRushbo@eibnet.us.So the bug-eyed Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has told Trump no State of the Union. You gotta cancel it. There s a government shutdown. No State of the Union. We re not gonna make the House chamber available to you. The State of the Union is a constitutional requirement, but it never was a big deal until the age of television.States of the Union were usually submitted in writing from the president to the Congress, and they were a bunch of, yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full. Hardly anybody ever saw them. In the TV era they became spectacles, they became shows, and they aren t really even the State of the Union anymore. It s where presidents announce their agenda and promise this and that and the spending to go along with it.But Pelosi has given Trump a great opportunity here, I think. See, you gotta look at this on the positive side. Imagine if there was a State of the Union address during the government shutdown. You know what s gonna happen in there. The Ocasio-Cortez crowd and all of these Democrat freshmen are gonna make a spectacle of the thing.They re gonna be shouting. They re gonna be protesting. They re gonna be trying to shut Trump up. They re gonna be turning their backs. They re gonna be walking in there with signs saying,  Shame, shame, shame, stop the hate,  and all that garbage.Who needs any of that? We don t need that! We don t need our president in the House chamber run by a bunch of radical leftist, hate-filled Democrats. What Trump ought to do is a rally or, better yet, rent out an arena and don t do a rally but do a literal State of the Union address and literally talk about the State of the Union and the Democrats  role in destroying it or damaging it.There s nobody that can do that better than Donald Trump. And in that way, you don t have any Democrats in that crowd unless they try to infiltrate it. I mean, you don t have Democrat members of the House. Who needs this? Trump is disrupting everything else in Washington. Why not the State of the Union? Turn it upside down. Turn it into something it s never been before. Why should he go into a chamber run by lunatics who have an irrational hatred for him and are doing everything they can to overturn the founding of this country? Why subject himself? Well, Mr. Limbaugh, it s a requirement of the Constitution.  Well, if the Speaker of the House does not make the chamber available, then it s not Trump s problem. If Pelosi s not gonna open the doors, if she s not gonna invite the president in, then he can submit whatever he wants to in writing and then go do his own State of the Union address maybe the day before the date, maybe the day after, maybe the same date, I don t know.Do a rally. I promise, I ll tell you what, I ll introduce him. I ll make the deal. I will introduce him at the State of the Union rally. I did it in Cape Girardeau when he was there. It s not a demand. It s not even a request. It s an offer. But I think, folks, it s a golden opportunity. And it would be part and parcel of Trump hanging in.It s gotta be tough. It has to be extremely difficult, because everybody s arrayed against Trump. Now a bunch of economists are coming out and saying,  Hey, the economic hit because of the shutdown is much worse, much worse than we thought. On CNN they re actually telling people to be wary of plane crashes because air traffic controllers are calling in sick and not working, as though the American air traffic control system would knowingly operate at risk of airplanes crashing. But we have Poppy Harlow interviewing some dingbat actually talking about the possibility that there could be rampant plane crashes, planes falling out of the sky because of the government shutdown.We re also getting   and this tells me that the Democrats are focus-grouping things   I have I think it s three, and it may be by now, four stories of Americans having to choose between insulin and the mortgage or insulin and food. But it s insulin and something else. It s not medicine in general. It s insulin. It has to be focus grouped. And the media can t wait to report all of this stuff. So those are my just off-the-cuff thoughts on the State of the Union.I just think it d be a great opportunity for Trump to go around the media, to go around the Democrats, to avoid what would, no question about it, be an attempt to disrupt the whole thing with, by the way, the encouragement of the House leadership. Talk about people being concerned about whether or not protocol is being violated or what have you, that s long out the window now. Democrats have long ago thrown out the idea of protocol behavior, behavioral norms and this kind of thing. So why even subject yourself to it and then to a media that is going to be repeating all of the anti-Trump stuff that would happen inside the House chamber.So go do a speech somewhere and tell the American people what the Democrats are doing. Describe for the American people how the Democrats are abandoning borders and condoning crime and lay it all out for everybody. And for a measly $5 billion, the equivalent of  If you have $50,000, do you have $47? That $47 out of $50,000 is about where $5 billion is in relationship to our national budget every year, the annual budget of four-some-odd trillion. The Democrats are not about to shut down their pipeline for their permanent underclass.They re not about to shut down the border. They don t care about the massive ongoing crime spree. They don t care about drug trafficking. They don t care about accompanying drug-related deaths. They don t care about people with infectious diseases coming in. They don t care about hospitals and schools being overrun. All they care about is undermining is weakening a healthy, prosperous, and stable constitutional republic. Pelosi s request, by the way, I think is a sign of weakness.She doesn t want Trump coming up and making a speech during the shutdown. Why? If Trump s the guy wrong, if Trump s the guy that s barely hanging on, if Trump s the guy that so demonstrably in the minority, why not bring the guy up? Why not open your chambers and say,  Come on, Mr. President! Tell us.  Instead, Pelosi wants to keep the doors to the House chamber shut so that President Trump can t get in there. Rent a football stadium. Rent an arena. Fill it up! Give the State of the Union to people who want to hear it!I, frankly, again do not want to hear   I don t want to see   a bunch of infantile, childlike babies, Millennial Democrat freshmen trying to disrupt this whole thing and making sure that it doesn t happen.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: There are some southwestern United States ranchers, Texas and New Mexico, that are saying they re finding prayer rugs out there. Prayer rugs near the border. That means some militant Islamists are coming across, in addition to whoever we think. And there s a new caravan starting up out there.Now, I want to go back to Pelosi for a second on this State of the Union thing. Because there s a word that she used in her statement. The word is  security,  the magic word, Social Security, food insecurity. She said,  Sadly, given the security concerns ñ  What security concerns? It s the House of Representatives. It s the United States capitol. What security concerns is she referring to here?  Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date. So we can t conduct business as usual because there are security concerns for members of Congress. But when it comes to security concerns for the border, for average Americans, screw that! That s not even a legitimate subject. But we re gonna shut down the State of the Union because of security problems. What would those security problems be? And look. I know it s all just a ruse anyway.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Crazy Bernie s tweet:  The scientists tell us that the future of the planet is endangered by climate change. Meanwhile, because of Trump s government shutdown, about 95% of E.P.A. employees have been furloughed because they are  non-essential.  How insane is that?  he asks. How insane is it that we have a government agency and 95% of the people that work there are nonessential? That s what s insane!And all of these non-insane people have all kinds of unelected power to write regulations that punish and penalize their political opponents! This is why Trump has to keep hanging in. This is why he cannot lose this. He can win this if he can just hang in for a few more weeks. So 95% of EPA employees are furloughed because they re nonessential? Why do we even have  em there in the first place? See Crazy Bernie thinks it s insane to get rid of 95% of the people that work there by calling them nonessential. But they re not there because they are nonessential.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So Nancy Pelosi says that she just wants to cancel the State of the Union during the shutdown, security problems and a number of other things which we highlight in her statement a moment ago. Rick Crawford, Republican, Arkansas:  Hey @SpeakerPelosi,  this is a tweet,  as a former bomb tech who has served on Secret Service details, I know how to sweep a room & make it secure. I ll volunteer to help ensure that the chamber is secure for @realDonaldTrump & the SOTU. I m sure my friend & fellow bomb tech @RepBrianMast can help.Brian Mast is a congressman from here, and so you ve got two former military guys, Secret Service guys offering to sweep the House chamber to make sure there are no bombs in there. Pelosi says (sobbing),  We can t secure the chamber because of the government shutdown! It just wouldn t be safe!  I still say it s a golden opportunity.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/15/fast-food-meal-spurs-outbreak-of-trump-derangement-syndrome/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 15, 2019RUSH: Perhaps the greatest example of Trump derangement syndrome today and what, in a sane world, would be a profoundly embarrassing piece of journalism, which is saying a lot given everything that s happened during the Trump administration. The Washington Post is beside itself. And, if you happen to receive the Washington Post daily email blast that is supposed to tell you what s hot and what s interesting and what s leading the day in Washington Post news coverage, this story is at the top of all the news out there. This story is what the Washington Post apparently is the most proud of today.The headline:  President Trump s Extravagant, $3,000, 300-Sandwich Celebration of Clemson University.  You look at the resources the Washington Post spent analyzing the fast food dinner at the White House that the president personally purchased for the Clemson football team because of the government shutdown. The White House kitchen staff has been furloughed. The Clemson football team, previously invited, Trump could not stand to have them up there with nothing to eat, so they went out to Mickey D s, they went to Burger King, they went to Wendy s, they went to pizza places, they got some fries, $3,000 worth of food college students love!College students eat every day. Trump went out   I think it s fabulous! They had the candelabra. They had every accouterment that you would associate with an eight-course meal except it s all fast food burgers in their original boxes. It was classic, it was classic Trump. The Washington Post is beside itself. The Washington Post thinks this is the greatest affront to civilization and proper comportment and behavior in the White House that there has ever been, so much so that this story is their number-one story.They even had their art department do a graphic of the table setting showing where every Big Mac, every Quarter Pounder, every  What s the burger? The Burger King big deal, whatever it is. They had the Whopper and then Wendy s over there. It s like a real estate person s floor plan for if they re trying to sell a house, is what this thing looks like. They calculate the calories, the orders of french fries, the types of hamburgers that Trump provided   and then they did a fact check!Trump s out there having fun with this, and he s telling people that they had hamburgers stacked  a mile high,  and the Washington Post fact checked that! They fact checked Trump s statements that hamburgers were piled a mile high. I mean, it is a figure of speech! It is a joke! It is a way of expressing yourself to say you had a lotta hamburgers in there. But the Washington Post writes,  FACT CHECK: At two inches each, a thousand burgers would not reach one mile high.  This is the number-one story they have put at the top their email blast.This is the one they want everybody to read. This is the one they re most proud of today. Now, imagine how many resources were put into this. Fact-checkers, arts and graphics people doing a diagram of where every burger was   wherever the Big Macs on the table, wherever the Burger King Whoppers and whatever the Wendy s whatevers were. Imagine if all of those resources had been spent on looking into the corruption at the FBI, or the corruption at the DOJ, or how about the lobbyist-paid trip to Puerto Rico by Democrat members of Congress?I mean, this is just  It is absurd, and it s a great illustration of how they ve lost their minds. And they re not the only ones that are raising hell over this. This serving of fast food burgers at the White House to Clemson football team is being presented as yet another bit of evidence of how uncivilized, how ill-prepared, how unfit Donald Trump is to be president of the United States, that this is just  It s embarrassing; it s appalling.Fast food in the White House with all of the fat and all of the salt and all of the calories and all the heart disease, not to mention all of the damage to climate. It s by one of their prominent reporters, some guy named Bump, Philip Bump.  In an administration overstuffed with bizarre moments and unusual events, Monday night s celebration of the Clemson University Tigers at the White House nonetheless made a mark. The Tigers, who won the national college football championship after not having to play   Ohio State  This guy went to Ohio State, so he s really ripping Clemson. They re not the real national champs  cause they didn t play this guy s team.  The Tigers, who   Now, we don t think he s joking because these people don t have a sense of humor. This is the kind of thing that somebody would say to get a laugh. This guy, these people have no sense of humor. If you re gonna fact check somebody saying,  Yeah, we had hamburgers piled a mile high,  and you bring in a fact-checker and you talk about how many hamburgers you would actually have to have stacked on top of each other to get to a mile?Anyway, they  had the traditional meeting with the president,  the football team did,  enjoying remarks from South Carolina s senators after retiring to the State Dining Room for a meal.  That s what bugs them too. They did all this fast food in the state dining room. You know, you re only supposed to bring out the five-star china, the best of the best. You re not supposed to put poison fast food in there. Who does that? This is another demeaning day at the White House brought to us by Donald Trump.Sarah Sanders with a press secretary statement:  Because the Democrats refuse to negotiate on border security, much of the residence staff at the White House is furloughed   so the president is personally paying for the event to be catered with some of everyone s favorite fast foods.  They go on to analyze it from top to bottom, graphic charts of layout of the food, questioning how much Trump actually spent out of his own pocket. Is it just another Trump administration lie? Who really paid the $3,000 to buy all of this fast food?And they have a picture here of the spread. You probably have seen the photo of the spread on the gigantic table in the state dining room, and there is a sound bite. Let me see. Trump made a joke about this, and the Drive-By Media is  Oh. Oh. Oh. Here it is. Here it is. Grab  Let s see. Grab sound bite Nos. 9 and 10. This is just  It fits perfectly. Up first is the president himself last night after welcoming the Clemson football team to the White House, a portion of his welcoming remarks THE PRESIDENT: So I had a choice. Do we have no food for you,  cause we have a shutdown, or do we give you some little quick salad that the first lady will make along with  along with the second lady? They ll make some salads   and I said,  You guys aren t into salads. CHAMPIONS: (laughing)THE PRESIDENT: Or do I go out? Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, do I go out and send out for about 1,000 hamburgers, Big Macs?TEAM: (laughing) Yeah!THE PRESIDENT: So we actually did it.RUSH: Bill Clinton had Big Macs in the Oval Office; they didn t think a thing about it. They worried that it wasn t healthy for him, but they didn t make a big joke about it. Saturday Night Live did, but not the fact that he was demeaning the Oval Office or anything. Trump happens to like Big Macs. I happen to know on the campaign trail, Trump is flying around on his own Boeing 757. There are number of galleys, meaning kitchens, on a Boeing 757. I understand that practically every trip was McDonald s.He loves McDonald s and other fast food, and he also thinks it s safe. He sends somebody else to buy it. Nobody knows it s for him; therefore, it s not poison. It s a security thing to go out and get fast food. He loves it. So this is something that he enjoyed doing too. But in this sound bite, do you know that there was something? The president said something so offensive that upon hearing it a cable news infobabe nearly lost her cookies. Do you remember the sound bite? It was only a few seconds. Do you know what he might have said that just sent somebody into orbit? (interruption) Right! That the first lady would be making salads!Here we go with Erin Burnett on CNN ERIN BURNETT: How in the world do you not perceive that as sexist  SCOTT JENNINGS: Uh ERIN BURNETT:   to say the assumption that his wife s gonna go make salads for the bunch of football players? (snickering)SCOTT JENNINGS Uh, I  ERIN BURNETT: What is she, like, the cook?SCOTT JENNINGS: I think you   you might be overreading this one.ERIN BURNETT: I m not overreading it! He made a joke that was sexist about women. (stammering) I guess what we re agreeing with is whether it s funny and whether humor is something that s serious. I feel pretty strongly it s a sexist thing to say.RUSH: A sexist thing to say. The first lady could have whipped up some salads and the second lady. They didn t want to leave out Ivanka. She apparently makes great salads. That s why he had to put her name in there. Apparently Ivanka s salads are to die for, so he couldn t leave her out. And here s Erin Burnett (impression),  I don t think it s funny. Comedy isn t supposed to be funny, is it? We re not supposed to laugh at comedy. (sputtering) Well, I m not overreading it. He made a joke. Sexist. We re disagreeing with whether it s funny, whether humorous is serious. It s humor something seer? I don t know. Just really feel strongly it s sexist. Sexist! First lady making salads? What do they do at dinnertime in her house, I wonder?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I ve been informed that I erred in identifying the second lady. I thought that Trump was referring to Ivanka. But I m told the second lady is Mrs. Pence, Karen Pence, the wife of the vice president, Mike Pence. Apparently, she has a great reputation for making salads, which is why this would be on Trump s mind. The fact that it was sexist? See? A woman in the kitchen? First lady, second lady, third lady, bag lady, trailer park lady, it doesn t matter. In the kitchen is sexist. Portraying women in any kind of historically traditional role is sexist.Do you remember the shutdown in  95-96? That was the famous Newt Gingrich-Bill Clinton shutdown and the same circumstances existed, the kitchen staff at the White House was on furlough. Why do you think Monica Lewinsky was in there delivering pizzas and snapping her thong at Bill Clinton? Do you remember the media giving Clinton any grief for having a pizza delivered by an intern whom he was then gonna doink in the nearby bathroom?Do you remember the Drive-Bys, how they tried to cover all that up. But there certainly wasn t any,  Oh, my God. What s happening to the White House? Pizza in the Oval Office.  No, they all would have wished they were invited, particularly the female members of the press corps.  What s Lewinsky got that I don t?  Well, that night a thong or that day, whatever it was. Did you see any of the actual celebration in the White House last night between Trump and the football team from Clemson?&lt;span data-mce-type= bookmark  style= display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;  class= mce_SELRES_start &gt;<U+FEFF>&lt;/span&gt;It was a celebration of winners. It was replete with references to God and excellence, the purpose of team sports: To build character in boys so they can be productive men. It was a total positive. It was a completely uplifting thing. But it was comprised of values that have always been traditional and are now under assault in America. I m sure a lot of parents who may have watched that thing last night might like their kids to end up going to Clemson, based on the nature of that celebration last night.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We went back to the archives. You have to hear this. This is actual from at A&E Network s show called The Clinton Affair. They went back and did a documentary retrospective on it, and during a segment on the 1995 government shutdown, Monica Lewinsky said this about how she met Bill Clinton LEWINSKY: I realized that the top inch or two of my  (laughing) My, uh, underwear had   showing my thong underwear. And I thought,  Well, I ll up the game.  Instead of pulling my trousers up like I would have done in any other instance, I didn t. It was unnoticeable to anybody else in the room, but he noticed. As I passed George Stephanopoulos s office, I kind of looked into the open doorway, and Bill happened to be standing there, and he motioned me in. Unbeknownst to me, I was on the precipice of the rabbit hole.RUSH: So she s delivering a pizza in there during the government shutdown, and she was popping her thong in there. She saw Stephanopoulos. Now, Stephanopoulos  You know, if she s in his office, if Stephanopoulos looks up, he sees her waist. He s a short guy. But she didn t notice that. She noticed only Clinton looking. So she s out there  (I chose  waist  on purpose. This is a family show.) But she s popping her thong and so forth, delivering a pizza. She s all excited here that Bill Clinton noticed her thong, and she made adjustments with her clothing to make sure he noticed even more   and somehow Donald Trump is the biggest reprobate that has ever occupied the Oval Office.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let s get started on the phones. Lake Mary, Florida. This is Paula. It s great to have you. You re the first caller today. Big, big job there. You set the tone for every caller to follow. So make it work.CALLER: All right. Here s what s gonna work, Rush. I was so happy this morning when I saw the report of Donald Trump giving hamburgers and french fries and pizzas and what not to Clemson. It occurred to me that this is why we voted for him. We love him. He s so normal what he s doing. He s honoring this team. But even during a shutdown when the Democrats are off doing their thing in Puerto Rico and with their families, he s honoring a team and doing it with such awesome normalness. And for the press to go, then, and fact check on top of everything else? To me, it screams to the American people,  These elitist, snobby, we re-better-than-you kind of people are gonna criticize him for doing what all of us would do.  (unintelligible)RUSH: It is kind of fascinating. I mean, here you have a bunch of people   the left wing, the Democrats, the Drive-By Media   and for eons they have portrayed themselves as the champions of the little guy. And they have operated on the basis the little guy s getting screwed every day by America, by Republicans.  The little guy has to eat fast food! The little guy has to do this.  The Democrats are out defending it.Now all of a sudden, we have a president who s faced with no staff in the White House. There s no way to actually prep a standard meal for guests arriving like this. So Trump improvises and goes out and gets fast food which every American or the vast majority of Americans have eaten and do eat for all of the obvious reasons. A, it tastes good. B, it s not that expensive. It s convenient, it s fast, whatever. But as you say, I mean, it s real-guy stuff.Here come these elitist Democrats now who used to be champions of this kind of stuff, now acting like it s beneath them and it s beneath the White House   and it s not just the Democrats. The Never Trumper conservatives are piling on. They re also righteously indignant over the quasi-defamation to the White House and presidential standards of decorum that Trump is inflicting on everybody by serving Big Macs. There weren t any left, by the way. They were all consumed. I watched it, and everybody had a good time there last night. But it s just another illustration of the abject phoniness of people who claim to be the watchdogs and the standard-bearers for the little guy.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: For those of you watching on the Dittocam, I want to show you a screenshot from an actual Web page of the Washington Post back on May 19, 2014. And of course this will end up at RushLimbaugh.com as well. This is not a pitch to sell people a subscription to the Rush Limbaugh 24/7 website. You either have or you haven t. You know about it.

President Obama and Cheeseburgers: A Love Story.  And there s also a story from Politico back on September 13th, 2010.  Michelle Obama: I Love French Fries.  Isn t that kind of   ahem! Ahem! Slap myself there for those of you not watching on the Dittocam. That was my bad. Anyway,  Michelle Obama: I love French Fries.  Washington Post, which today has this very snarky, cutting story on Donald Trump for serving hamburgers from McDonald s, Wendy s, and Burger King to the Clemson football team.Let me tell you people something. I know football. I know pregame meals. I know all of this stuff. This is what they long to eat. They have to eat training table fare, which is great food, don t misunderstand. But it s nutritionally balanced by the nutrition experts at the university. When they are away from the training table, this is what they eat. It s what every kid eats! And to be able to have this stuff at the White House with the president, I guarantee you, it s a plus for them. It s not a negative.But here s the Washington Post doing this snarky story on how the president is being sexist by saying he could have had the first lady make salads, but football players don t eat salads. So he s expressing his anti-female characteristics with that comment. And then he was telling people proudly that we had hamburgers stacked a mile high, and the Washington Post fact checked that and said that it would take X-numbers of hundreds of thousands hamburgers to stack them a mile high.So Trump was lying, they said! They reported Trump was lying about how many hamburgers he served. And then they did the requisite damage to the environment and the calories and the cholesterol and all of the rotgut that they usually associate with their contemptuous attitudes on the lives of average, ordinary people. But if you go back to the Washington Post, May 19, 2014,  President Obama and Cheeseburgers: A Love Story. Do you know what the root of this was? Michelle Obama ran the training table. And you know what it was? It was watercress vinaigrette. It was kale. It was berries and nuts and weeds picked from her garden with a bunch of vinegar on it as salad dressing and he got tired of it. Like any other henpecked guy, when he had the chance to break away, what did he do? Burgers and fries. And he had this chain restaurant, Five Guys burgers or something that he loved to go to in Virginia. And the Washington Post tagged along and just thought it was wonderful. President Obama made yet another trip to a burger joint Friday, taking four employees on a Washington construction project to Shake Shack. Obama and Vice President Biden used the appearance to tout something they traveled the country discussing all week: the need to increase investment in America s often crumbling infrastructure, a move that would create jobs ñ  that s all they did! A bunch of symbolism. They didn t do anything to create jobs. They destroyed jobs. They didn t do anything to rebuild infrastructure. They gave it all to unions! But the trip underscored something else.  By the way, the reporter here is a woman, Katie Zezima.  The trip underscored something else: Obama really loves cheeseburgers. Despite the White House s emphasis on healthy eating and Obama s assertion that his favorite food is broccoli ñ  does anybody buy that?  Obama has a habit of taking people out for burgers and fries. Often that person is Biden. Just two guys grabbing some burgers, right? Obama suggested that he might have a burger for his 50th birthday in 2011. See? It s so normal that even their beloved Barack Obama went out and had a burger on his 50th, of all the things he could do, he wanted to have a burger.  A blogger apparently nicknamed named him  President Obeef  because of his well-documented penchant for cheeseburgers. Michelle Obama also sometimes ditches the healthy eating and, like the rest of us, splurges on fast food. And then they have a bunch of pictures of the various burger joints Obama goes to, as though you ought to make note of them and put  em on your map and you should visit them too. Let Donald Trump do essentially the same thing   the only difference is Obama left the White House for his burgers because he had to get away from Michelle to enjoy them. The only difference is while Obama left, Trump hangs around and serves them in the State Dining Room.It s just one of, folks, countless and endless illustrations of the blatant unfairness and the bias, the mean-spiritedness and the hatred harbored by today s Washington political class. Pure and simple. No difference whatsoever.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRichard in Farmington, Minnesota, great to have you, sir. Hi.RUSH: Hi, Mr. Limbaugh.RUSH: Hi.CALLER: It s an honor to be on your show. Mega nimble navigator dittos to you.RUSH: Thank you very much, sir.CALLER: I just wanted to comment on the Clemson situation.RUSH: Yes.CALLER: I just think it s hilarious that these vanguards of the proletariat are going after something that the average person eats at least once a month in the same week that they fly to Puerto Rico for the lobbyist paid trip.RUSH: Well, no. That s a good point. The people who defend the Democrat as having legitimate business in Puerto Rico with lobbyists and donors attack Donald Trump for serving Big Macs and Whoppers and Wendy s to the Clemson football team in the White House during a government shutdown. That s the hypocrisy. This is a media hypocrisy   the Democrats, too, but this is a media hypocrisy that s blatant. Fact-checking Trump on his statement that they had hamburgers piled a mile high. They literally fact checked that. But your point is this is what average, ordinary people do. This is what their families eat frequently and if it s good enough for them, it s good enough for Trump, right?CALLER: Exactly. Yeah, and it s something that I can t remember ever happening at the White House, so these kids have a unique experience that they can tell forever.RUSH: Let me tell you something. It does happen at the White House. I m gonna tell you a little ñ this is no big deal, but my first time at the White House was in 1992. This is when I was invited there by George H. W. Bush to discuss the Perot phenomenon. It was June of 1992. It was a Wednesday or Thursday night and we pulled up and got to the White House and there was this giant tent, and the tent still had signage on it, KC Masterpiece. I said,  What s this?  So I asked him.He said,  Yeah, the guys from Kansas City, Kansas City Masterpiece did a barbecue for the staff here yesterday,  and they still had the tents and stuff up. Now, I was from Kansas City, KC Masterpiece is some of the best barbecue sauce you could have, they had a restaurant and so forth. This is done all the time is the point. You just never hear about it. I mean, there are White House barbecues all the time. Somebody has to do this stuff. There s a lot more of this that goes on than you would know.But with Trump it s never happened before, nobody s ever been this gauche, nobody s ever been this pedestrian, nobody s ever been so sloppy and dirty with the White House as Donald Trump, when this stuff is common! I mean, Monica Lewinsky delivering a pizza in a thong? They do stories on how Barack Obama loved cheeseburgers and what a great guy he was because of it.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We can t even get a list of the Democrats that went to Puerto Rico. We can t even get a list of the donors and the lobbyists who were down there buying influence with  em. Why didn t you hop on that, Washington Post, instead of tracking down something obvious, that a lot of hamburgers were served in the White House yesterday to a football team.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/15/righteous-indignation-over-new-gillette-ad/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 15, 2019RUSH: I am being overwhelmed today with email from people who are beside themselves over this new Gillette commercial aimed at Millennial men. And, by the way, I don t blame you. If you are among the crowd righteously offended and indignant over this, Gillette is obviously being run by Millennials. This is the danger. Millennials grow up and they get management jobs at various corporations, and they become in charge of advertising and marketing, and this is what s happening now.Gillette has a new commercial out. They re trying to sell razor blades. Well, they want to sell the razor first and then they keep getting you to go back for the blades. And they are trying to sell razor blades while urging men to stop being reprobate, toxic, and masculine! And they re claiming that if you use a Gillette razor and blade, you will become less toxic as a masculine guy.So we have to spend some time on that. But perhaps and before we get into that, then the shutdown, the daily Drive-By Media harangue and panic over the government shutdown. I actually think it s a good thing. I actually think it s a blessing in disguise. I actually think it is a golden opportunity if Trump hangs tough here. I think this is one of the greatest opportunities those of us in the limited-government world have ever had. And I will explain that as the program unfolds today.(interruption) Oh, you haven t heard about this Gillette ad? Oh. Well, they re calling it  We Believe: The Best Men Can Be.  And it basically tells men to reexamine themselves in the way they raise boys. The ad goes on to show men getting into fights, standing in front of barbecue grills, probably grilling meat, destroying the planet, and then it shows men verbally harassing women.It s got one stereotype after another of what liberals claim is wrong with being a man. And Gillette incorporates all of that and is warning fathers,  Don t let your kids become this.  In fact, the ad even has a happy ending. We see clean-shaven men   how many Millennials shave? Do you see Millennials with   I mean, seriously, they re such tightwads. I don t think they shave. I can t tell you what tightwads they are. They re cheapskates and they re tightwads to boot. And that is not a broad generalization. It happens to be literally true.  Cause they think anything more expensive than free is too expensive. Not all. But a way, way too large number of them do.Anyway, the happy ending in the ad, we see clean-shaven men finally behaving themselves, not grilling meat, and not ogling women! All because they have chosen to use Gillette razors in order to be the best a man can be.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now let s get to the Gillette ad. Yeah, we re gonna get to the shutdown and all that stuff, but this cultural stuff fascinates me because it really is so big an indication of where we re headed and what we need to do if we want to head some of this off at the pass.Now, Gillette, by the way, is not owned by Gillette anymore. Gillette used to be wholly owned. And their primary competitor was Schick. Gillette headquartered in Boston. Schick I think was in Philadelphia. Procter & Gamble ended up buying Gillette, so it is Procter & Gamble that now runs the marketing and sales for Gillette and their blades and their razors. So it is Procter & Gamble in this ad urging men to shave their toxic masculinity in a new ad for Gillette razors.And, by the way, the ad is targeted at Millennial men. There s a truth about advertising. I mentioned it before. Most advertising is aimed at people in the Millennial age range, 18 to 34 and really, even, the younger side of that. The reason is that once you hit 30, 35, your product choices are pretty much made for the rest of your life. It s why beer advertising is never aimed at people over 25.Once you hit 25 or 30, if you re gonna drink Budweiser, you re gonna drink Budweiser. If you re gonna drink Heineken, you re gonna drink Heineken, there s no sense trying to change your minds. But young formative minds, particularly young wuss guys who are having their masculinity stripped out of them daily, who are being chickified daily, who are being told that they are scourges on the earth simply because of their sexuality, advertising is being aimed at them.And now you have a bunch of Millennials that are in marketing departments and ad agencies. So it s a double whammy. The people putting together the marketing plan, the advertising plan are themselves the same age-group being targeted. And they, of course, are the product of a bunch of ill-education and political correctness that they have been indoctrinated with while at college.And so they really believe that men are bad news as designed; that men in their natural state are predators; that men in their natural state exhibit masculinity that is toxic and dangerous to women and children, and it needs to be erased.So you ve had a bunch of people grow up who ve been taught this and believe this, just like you have a whole bunch of white people that have been raised to believe that they are the scourge of earth and that they and their whiteness have had an unfair privilege and that they themselves have to accept the blame for the suffering they have caused all minorities on earth. And they end up believing it, too, and they end up becoming advertising directors.How do you think an ad ? Remember the Prius ad? I think it was Prius. It was some electric car. The ad basically follows a polar bear from a shrinking glacier to a neighborhood. The polar bear essentially is trying to find the driver of an electric car to give him a hug to thank him for saving all polar bears by not driving something fueled by fossil fuels. Who do you think comes up with that crap? And crap is what it is. Young people who ve been indoctrinated, inculcated with all this political correctness.It s not the way to sell cars.It s the way to virtue shame.It is the way to proclaim your superiority in feelings and experience and so forth, and the same thing is happening here.  Proctor & Gamble is urging men to shave their  toxic masculinity  in a new ad for Gillette razors. The ad shows men fighting, cooking barbecue, and verbally harassing women,  because that s what men do. Fighting and barbecuing? Oh! (Groan!) That s men in their natural state. Oh, that s  When men start hanging around the barbecue and those hot coals and those six-packs and they start talking to each other the way men do?No good s gonna ever come of that!Spare the women and children. Save them, hide them, because men at the barbecue are plotting how to be men. So they leave the barbecue to verbally harass women.  The ad [is] interspersed with news reports about the #MeToo movement. A new ad from P&G razor brand Gillette encourages men to reexamine themselves and the way that they raise young boys. The ad, which is called  We Believe: The Best Men Can Be,  is essentially a two-minute   generalization about the way that men act and think,  in their natural state. The ad depicts men getting into fights, standing in front of barbecue grills, and verbally harassing women. The ad also heavily features news clips discussing the recent #MeToo movement. In a comment to the Wall Street Journal, Pankaj Bhalla, Gillette s brand director, said that the advertisement is a meditation on the changes that men must make in America,  which has everything in the world to do with shaving, right?  This is an important conversation happening, and as a company that encourages men to be their best, we feel compelled to both address it and take action of our own,  Bhalla said.  We are taking a realistic look at what s happening today, and aiming to inspire change by acknowledging that the old saying  Boys Will Be Boys  is not an excuse. We want to hold ourselves to a higher standard, and hope all the men we serve will come along on that journey to find our  best  together.  Selling razor blades.

One Twitter user said,  I am taking action. I m researching every product made by Proctor & Gamble, throwing any I have in the trash, and never buying any of them again until everyone involved in this ad from top to bottom is fired and the company issues a public apology.

The only thing he does behind his wife s back is zip her up, if even that. Not that doing things behind her back is  It s a joke. But they re henpecked   and they are the real men, according to the feminazis of the Washington, New York, Los Angeles current cultural climate.I have an email about this I want to share with you from a listener. We ll do that and we ll get back to your phone calls when we return.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: There s a great tweet out there by an Asian female who is conservative. Her name is Kathy Zhu, Z-h-u. There are fascinating stats in this thing. Toxic Masculinity? 43% of boys are raised by single mothers. 78% of teachers are female. So, close to 50% of boys have 100% feminine influence at home and 80% feminine influence at school. Toxic masculinity isn t the problem. The lack of masculinity is. Precisely. But see, here s the thing. Masculinity is systematically being erased from maleness. It s being erased psychologically, mentally. It s being stigmatized. And so men, young boys are doing whatever they think they have to do to not act masculine. They re doing whatever they think they have to do to demonstrate that they get it. But how can you have toxic masculinity with so much feminine, female influence? Well, you can t. That s her point.So what s actually happening is that masculinity is being drummed out of the Millennial and Gen Y, I think it is, the generation after them, of these cultures. Militant feminism on the march, a bunch of angry women blaming men for their overall unhappiness now taking it out on men at large for their own unhappiness. And they re just gonna end up making everybody miserable, which is a hallmark trait of liberalism.I also got this email. Dear Mr. Limbaugh: Nothing makes me want to buy a product like gender shaming. Let me see if I got this right. Because I m a man it s assumed that I mistreat women and bully for pleasure. Therefore, you have to buy products from companies that lecture me about behavior I never engaged in or even contemplated? A generation of Americans grew up with helicopter parents. Now that they ve reached adulthood, the baton has been passed to companies who hover and lecture and shame. I have a message for this generation. It s time to leave home. It s time to think for yourself. It s time to provide for yourself. It s time to grow up. If words like  toxic masculinity  scare you, if jokes offend you, if social justice warriors intimidate you, if the phrase  Make America Great Again  worries you, if identity politics makes sense to you, if reports of a government shutdown scare you, if you look for advice from those who sell you items used in the bathroom, grow up. You ve been infantilized. You have a long way to go, baby. And if you feel pressured to buy products that shame you, you re being bullied again. Grow up. Infantilized, it s exactly right. A bunch of young boys being turned into babies so that somehow women won t feel nervous. So goes the theory.Back to the phones. John in Atlanta. Glad you called, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hello, Mr. Limbaugh. Thank you for taking my call.RUSH: Yes, sir.CALLER: Well, first of all, I have to thank you for your book series. My 11-year-old loves it. I wanted to give you a call today about my conversation with Procter & Gamble. I left them a message today letting them know that as a white male over 50 living in the South, I am naturally assumed to be a racist. And now I have a company that has decided that because of my sex, I m also toxic. And I don t appreciate that.RUSH: Did you talk to anybody or just leave a message on a machine?CALLER: No, I spoke with a human being on the customer service line.RUSH: What d they say to you? What was their response or reaction to you?CALLER: The young women on the phone said that she had received several calls that were similar and they have formed a group that she reports to to I guess give a report on how many of these phone calls they re having coming in.RUSH: Really? They ve formed a committee?CALLER: Well, she said there s a group that she will take this exact information. And I said I just want you to be very sure that you let your CEO know that prejudging somebody is, by definition, prejudice. So you re gonna call me toxic but you re not gonna identify your own prejudice.RUSH: Well done. Very, very well done. Were you satisfied with the reaction? Did you get any kind of feeling for how this was received or were you just talking to somebody passing your message along?CALLER: Sounded like just another phone call in a series of phone calls that she had probably handled five or six times or maybe a dozen times today already.RUSH: Yeah. You know, it will be interesting to see. Thank you very much. I m glad you were angered about this. I m glad that you were moved to phone them. I m sure a lot of people are trying to find ways to let Procter & Gamble know.  Cause it s insulting. But, see, folks, here s the thing to realize. And I m just gonna share with you the way I think about this. I m not offering a solution to anything here, don t misunderstand. There may be one in what I m gonna say, but it s not my point. You know, I m just into educating people.I really think there still isn t enough overall knowledge on the part of the general public about liberals or progressives or socialists or communists. And there are countless opportunities for that lesson to be taught. This is one of them. This is who they are, and this is what they think.Now, these people, you have to assume some things. Whoever put this campaign together is not trying to hurt the company. This is what s flat-out amazing. The people that put this campaign together   I could be wrong. Maybe this company has some saboteurs in it and this is designed to harm them. Maybe Harry s or the Dollar Shave Club has got some saboteurs in there, I don t know. But in general, I would say that this is a bunch of people who literally think that this is smart, that this is brilliant, that it is innovative and creative, and it is the way to grow the company.And if that s what s going on, how in the world does that happen? How in the world do you have an advertising agency and a marketing department all aligned on a premise that the way to grow the company   and believe me, they re in a big competitive battle with Harry s and the Dollar Shave Club. That s one of the reasons that Gillette was sold. They re in heap big trouble because there are a lot of people selling shavers, razors, blades a lot cheaper than Gillette does. So Gillette s decided to go culturally, politically correct. They ve decided to attach politics to their product. And they think that they are reaching a majority of people. This is what s frightening to me.So I m gonna give  em the benefit of the doubt. They think they re doing the right thing. They think they are doing a very smart, innovative thing by insulting the people who buy their products. And essentially they re saying that they don t want their product bought and used by certain people. And if you re gonna buy and use their product, you better not be toxic masculine and you better not be this and you better not be that.It goes against the grain of every and sales premise that there is. And yet this is people who think they re doing the right thing. I guarantee you these people have been educated to believe that America is a hellhole, that America is a hotbed of racists and bigots and homophobes, anti-women, anti-gay, you know the phrase. And they now occupy these positions of influence and power from one corporate entity to the next, a business, an advertising agency, marketing firms, what have you. And they think they re doing the right thing. They think they re doing something innovative.So these phone calls are coming in. Now, this company is being deluged. Is there nobody in that company, is there nobody at P&G, when this campaign was run by them, that a red flag went up? Is there nobody there that said,  Wait just a minute.  Did everybody, from the executive suite on down, sign off on this? And if so, what does that tell us about what s become of Procter & Gamble and the people that are there in key positions?  Cause I don t care whatever else is going on, the people there generally do want to lead the world in the sale of razors and blades. That s why they are there.The people in the Gillette department division of Procter & Gamble want it to lead the nation. But they re going backwards, they are infuriating at minimum half of their audience, if not more. And not a one of them knew this, or the alternative is, they did know it and thought it was worth the downturn in sales that might result in this to be politically correct and form loyalty with a segment of the customer base that is gonna applaud this and like this.Whatever it is, it s dumb, it s shortsighted, it s ill-educated, and stupid. And there s not one place you can go in marketing or sales where this kind of approach is taught until now. And I maintain to you that this derives from the belief by everybody involved in this that they are reaching and talking to a majority of the thinking people in this country, that they think this is how everybody looks at men, as posing a danger because of toxic masculinity. That women and children are at great risk from men being men.They have a product that they have to sell to men. And they must believe that men are being shamed and accepting the shame and therefore will relate to a company that understands all this and go out and buy their product. It s the most absurd thing. It s another great in a long line of great illustrations of the actual corruption of culture and society, education, and thinking that progressivism or liberalism brings. And this division is being harmed, the Gillette division of P&G is being harmed, perhaps irreparably with this.And it s gonna be fascinating to me to see how they address this, because I am sure they are being inundated. And now after we have dealt with this in the way only we can in the unique way we can, they re probably gonna be inundated even more. Even though I have not asked one person to make one phone call or send one text or email, it s going to happen.And we can be confident that they re being deluged, and it s gonna be fascinating to see how they react to this. And my guess is they re gonna be obstinate and stubborn. And they re gonna take these complaints as a badge of honor, that if certain kinds of Americans get angry at this, then good!  Cause they don t like us anyway to begin with! And they ll be telling themselves,  We don t want you bigots using our product. To hell with you! This is what happens when everything becomes politicized, folks, and they are doing exactly that. The left is corrupting everything by infusing their politics into it and making it the dominant factor in the company s identification.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here is Chris in Mansfield, Ohio. Great to have you. Hi.CALLER: Hey, Rush. How are you doing?RUSH: I m excellent to outstanding, sir   and if I weren t, I wouldn t say.CALLER: This is a real treat. I started listening to you in the eighties from a police cruiser and have been a fan ever since.RUSH: Wow. Thank you. I appreciate that.CALLER: To my point: I m a retired officer, and the reason that we have all these men who do not know how to treat women is because they are being raised by women and not by real men who do cherish women know how to treat them properly.RUSH: Now, wait a minute. I understand what you mean. But there are a lot of people who believe that, for example, men who grow up with sisters have a better understanding of how to treat women because they watch how men treat their sisters. They see what their sisters react to positively and negatively, and therefore they learn more than men who do not have sisters growing up. There are other people that think that a good mom can properly instruct young boys in aspects of women that men cannot possibly understand even after they ve known a woman 50 years. Ha-ha. A little joke. But your theory is interesting, that it takes a real man to instruct young boys about women.CALLER: I have a daughter and I wish that  She s 19. I hope that she finds a real man. I believe that what a real man can impart on a boy as he s growing up is much stronger than what a woman can impart. Even though she knows what the rules are, the man s gonna have a greater influence if he does it right.RUSH: Interesting. You re thinking this from the standpoint of the young man hearing the advice or the words that are coming from a father or an uncle or a male family member is gonna have more influence than, say, from the mother?CALLER: Well, a father. Not necessarily a male influence in the family,  cause fathers have a lot of power over their own sons. What I m saying is that when push comes to shove, the father s gonna put that thought in their heads a little stronger than a mother is going to. He s not likely to just explain it. He s gonna really explain it hard.RUSH: Interesting. Now, you re gonna make me think about this. I didn t have any sisters growing up. But I got advice from both my mom and dad. It s an interesting theory. I m glad that you got that out there. I appreciate the call. Thank you so much, seriously. Have a great rest of the day.  "

Well, Democrats run the teachers union, don t they   and Democrats love  the children,  don t they?You see, LA is the second largest school district in America. The district offered to hire over a thousand more teachers, reduce class size, and give the teachers a 6% raise over the next two years.But that s not enough! The Democrat union wants a bigger raise, and they want it retroactive to 2017. So they re on strike until they win. Screw the parents, screw the children, screw everybody who stands in their way.It s the same message from Democrats in Washington: Screw the federal employees, screw American citizens, screw everybody who stands in their way   and get out of the way and let the illegals have the run of the place.Now, nobody knows how long this  teachers  shutdown  is going to go on. Ask the Democrats. Nobody knows how long the federal government shutdown is going to go on. Ask the Democrats! They re the people holding everybody hostage.  "

You know what? This such a great opportunity. The media s now doing tug-at-your-heartstring stories about the hardships being experienced by people because of the government shutdown. I ll tell you, this is a great teachable moment. We ve always believed in smaller government, reducing the size of government.Listening to the complaints   I saw something on CNN just before the program started. And it was about I think farmers or people that work in agriculture somewhere who may not be able to go on without government subsidies. My initial quote,  Why are they getting government subsidies in the first place? I don t get any government subsidies.  How many of you get a government subsidy to keep doing what you do? Unless you work for Elon Musk, unless you work for stupid solar or wind, what kind of subsidy do you get to survive every day?All these people on the government dole one way or another are now starting to complain and whine and moan about it? I don t expect it to happen, but it s an excellent opportunity for people to find out just how corrupt this government is in terms of how it s buying and leveraging support.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/11/historic-shutdown-is-the-first-in-which-federal-workers-will-miss-a-paycheck/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 11, 2019RUSH: Are you also aware, ladies and gentlemen, that today marks two milestones in government shutdown history? The first milestone is that today s shutdown ties the record for the longest shutdown in American history. We are into three weeks now. And this is the longest   well, it ties the record. We re gonna break it tomorrow. There have been 19 government shutdowns since the late 1970s. Now we ve tied to the record for the longest.The previous record was established during the shutdown under Bill Clinton, which was really the first one the Drive-Bys ever bothered to tell anybody about or report because they saw it as a way to attack Newt Gingrich. The other historic milestone   this may surprise you. The other historic milestone today s shutdown reached, this is the first day in any government shutdown, the first day in all government shutdowns that furloughed federal employees will miss a paycheck.Despite all these shutdowns we ve ever had, despite the big shutdown over the budget battle in 1995, when we were getting stories about how federal employees were gonna miss their turkeys for Thanksgiving and Christmas. And during the school lunch fiasco where Republicans were killing kids by starving them, this is the first paycheck that will be missed by federal workers because of a government shutdown.Now, it might be the first time ever furloughed federal employees missed a paycheck, but the checks went out almost immediately after the Clinton-Gingrich shutdown, and these missed paychecks will be made up. That has already been guaranteed.So if this is the first   I want you to listen to me carefully on this, because historical perspective is crucial going forward. If this is the first shutdown in the history of shutdowns where federal employees have missed a paycheck, then why have the Drive-By Media been reporting about all the hardships that federal workers are facing during all these previous shutdowns when today is the first day, the only day they ve ever missed a paycheck?The Drive-Bys have been shedding tears over missed mortgage payments, children going to bed hungry for three weeks now, but a paycheck hasn t yet been missed until today. There hasn t been any financial hardship until today. There wasn t any financial hardship during any of the previous shutdowns because no federal workers ever missed a paycheck. This is the first time.And something else to notice about this. Every time there has ever been a crisis in the nation   except the War of 1812, when the British burned the White House and the rest of the government. Every time there s a crisis, the Beltway not only has not felt the pain, but they have prospered. This is one of the things that s led to this gigantic disconnect. The people of this country are facing consequences daily because of open borders, but not the people in Washington.During the eight years of Obama when more people were unemployed and the labor force participation rate was at an all-time low and more people than ever were on welfare, the Drive-By Media never, ever talked about it. Never reported it. Never called it to anybody s attention. But when all that was happening   all that economic decline led and brought to us by Obama   none of it was experienced in Washington. In Washington, the unemployment rate was 3%. The per capita income in Washington  Well, what is it?Seven of the wealthiest 10 counties in America are suburban Washington, D.C. So whatever economic hardship is felt by the people   either from open borders and rampant illegal immigration or just economic decline or you name it   it s never experienced by people who live in Washington. It s never experienced by people who work there. Except today! Now for the first time ever   aside from the War of 1812   Washington is actually seeing what it s like to worry about holding your job.Washington is actually worrying and confronted with the prospect of not getting a paycheck.  Washington and federal employees   for the first time in the history of shutdowns   are now feeling the pinch about being laid off or fired or facing some other insecurity.  First time!  And the media is right here.  The New York Times:  Washington s Strong Economy, Financed by Taxpayers, Takes Hit From Shutdown   It was almost lunchtime at a food court downtown and Yonas A. Seyoum, the manager of the Esprinto Cafe, marched over to the cash register and printed out the morning s sales.  It s crazy,  he said, holding up a drooping receipt.  He had done $52.71 of business in five hours, miserable even for January.   Not even enough to pay her,  Mr. Seyoum said, motioning to the cashier, a young woman leaning on the counter and playing gin rummy on her phone.  He added:  It s like a ghost city   totally dead.    So what s happening?  We can have open borders and we can have rampant crime and assaults on innocent people.  We can have the Obama administration with declining economics for everybody; people losing their jobs.It got to the point that Nancy Pelosi was talking about  funemployment ! To cover up unemployment, Pelosi was owl telling people what a great opportunity it was.  Yeah.  Pelosi said two things. (paraphrased)   One was most people don t like their jobs anyway.  This is a godsend.  Now they can spend their free time getting reacquainted with family and friends.   Funemployment.  The second thing:  Since most people didn t like their jobs, this is where you can finally forget that drudgery job you don t like and start painting landscapes that you ve always wanted to paint. Now you can get into arts and crafts that you ve always aspired to but you ve never had time because of that yukko job you had.   It was so bad that the Democrats came up with that as a way of trying to portray unemployment as a great opportunity, as a great thing bought to you by them and Barack Obama.  Now we have the first government shutdown where the first federal worker is gonna miss a paycheck, and the media wringing its hands. (sobbing)  Oh, my God, the suffering! Oh, my God, the insecurity!  Oh, my God, the empty cash register!  Oh, my God! Never do we get stories like this about you or your neighbors in a declining economy except when there s a Republican president.  But during the eight years of Obama, there wasn t any concern for lost paychecks, lost jobs, increased insecurity.  But, man, the media has come out in force in stories of vast and great sympathy and concern for federal employees who   for the first time in the history of shutdowns today   are missing their first paycheck ever. A paycheck which, by the way, has already been guaranteed to be replaced when all this is solved and the government reopens.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here is Diane as we go to Pittsburgh to start today on Open Line Friday. Thank you for calling. It s great to have you here.CALLER: Hey, Rush, happy birthday from Pittsburgh.RUSH: Thank you.CALLER: Well, listen. The reason I m calling is I m disgusted with hearing about the bellyaching about people missing one paycheck. Where were these people, where was the media when we lost our steel industry and men lost their homes and they lost their families, and some of them committed suicide? I heard no compassion.RUSH: No, you didn t, especially when all that was happening during Democrat presidential administrations.CALLER: And why should I be worried about people who have been through a shutdown multiple times  RUSH: Exactly. You know exactly what they re doing. They re trying to get you angry at Trump. They re trying to make it tough to support Trump. They re trying to portray Trump as having no heart and no compassion, that federal employees are on the verge of missing a paycheck. Keep in mind in all government shutdowns in the history of shutdowns, in all shutdowns, this is the first time that federal employees are gonna miss a paycheck. And they ve been guaranteed they will be paid all of their back pay once their jobs reopen.But the hypocrisy is blatant here. Stories are all over the place about missing mortgage payments, possible foreclosure, all of this based on missing one paycheck, and yet having similar concern and sympathy for all the people economically damaged during the Obama administration, you couldn t find it because they didn t and still don t want Obama to look bad. It s no more complicated than that.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: How many people are gonna die, according to Pelosi and Schumer, because of the government shutdown?

The Drive-Bys have a new tack. The Drive-By Media, a new approach here. Now, rather than Trump listening to me, which has been their foolhardy story since before Christmas, just to refresh your memory, in case you ve been away and don t know the history of this, very briefly. Trump was all set to sign a continuing resolution, keep the government open with no money for a wall, no money for border security. That was the news.On this program I heard about this, and I started saying this is a bad thing to do. I can t believe, no, no, no, don t do this. And immediately I got an instant message from somebody in the White House assuring me the story wasn t true, the president wasn t gonna sign it, and he was never gonna sign any legislation that does not have money for the wall in it. And this I reported to you. I said,  I just received a note from a third party from the president assuring me that he s not gonna sign it. The Drive-Bys took that and totally reworked it and made it look like Trump was already signing it. He d maybe even already had written the D of his signature. And then somebody rushed in and said,  Mr. President, Mr. President, Rush Limbaugh says no, don t do it.  And Trump stopped. That s the story they ran with. That s not at all what happened. He was never gonna sign it. I was reporting that he was gonna sign it. He got word to me that the reporting was wrong. So the Drive-Bys then start saying that I am the cause of the government shutdown because I am the real president because Trump is too big a dodo to know what to do without me telling him.I corrected them the next day. I said you guys are getting this totally wrong. They re doing it on purpose. It was a way of diminishing Trump and getting people mad at me. Well, apparently it didn t go the way they intended, because now there s a new tack. They ve decided on a new narrative, and that is that I tricked Trump. That Trump s voters don t really care about the wall, and he s being lied to by people like me. That he s being lied to by people like me, that his voters don t care, that they re perfectly fine with him signing legislation that has no money in it for the wall. Here. We have little montage of the Drive-Bys attempting this new tack.BOB HARDT: He s painted himself into a corner. Rush Limbaugh called him and said,  You can t bend on this.  He has nowhere to go.RACHEL SHABI: The radical right, Rush Limbaugh, suggested to him that he will lose his base over this.CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Rush Limbaugh, who pitchforked him into this situation in the first place.YASMIN VOSSOUGHIAN:   the Rush Limbaugh base he was scared by.MICHAEL STEELE: Rush Limbaugh. That s the voice in his head.NICOLLE WALLACE:  Trump s trepidation of individuals with names like Rush Limbaugh.KATY TUR: Donald Trump s base is not holding him to a wall. The media has been holding Donald Trump to a wall, specifically the right-wing media.CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: The fringe of the Republican Party, the Rush Limbaughs, screech again at the president. Is it legitimate that these people should govern or should the president and Congress govern?RUSH: Oh, don t you just love that, Christiane Amanpour, who thinks it s her job to govern. It is her job to have influence with people in the foreign policy administration and to have daily chats with them and discuss the proprieties of whether or not we should cooperate with the European Union or not. She thinks she has the influence over government policy with her contacts and the people she knows in the swamp, in the establishment.They can t stand it! They think talk radio is the lowest rung on the showbiz ladder, and it just galls them. Everything about the way they think of my success just galls them. So now Trump is even stupider than they thought. Now Trump is being tricked. It s not that Trump is listening to me for his own best interests. Now Trump is being tricked by me into doing things not in his own best interests. The Drive-Bys must be getting frustrated, because they re unable to alter the course of events here so they change these narratives off and on, and this is the latest incarnation of it.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/07/how-one-man-saved-the-nfl-and-is-trying-to-save-america/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 7, 2019RUSH: So Sarah Sanders put out a tweet or a Twitter announcement that the president s gonna go to the border on Thursday.  The New York Times says,  President Trump wants to address the nation about the government shutdown on Tuesday night, and later in the week plans to travel to the southern border as part of his effort to persuade Americans of the need for a border wall   the sticking point in negotiations with Democrats who are eager to reopen shuttered agencies. You know, this whole shutdown thing  Every time we go through one of these or any protracted disagreement like this with the left  You know, I live in the world of constant optimism that more and more are finally gonna wake up, or, if not (maybe that s not the term), they re finally gonna see what the left is really all about.  On this one, we may have a chance.  The latest polling data: 93% of the American people, including 88% of Democrats, think that illegal immigration is a major problem.Now, the Democrat Party is in a very shrinking minority on this, and they all live behind fortified walls.  Nancy Pelosi  They all live in gated estates.  Like last night, the Golden Globes   and, by the way, the ratings bottomed out again. Although, you know, I think Trump is even teaching these people.  I think it s one of the most amazing things. Let s look at the NFL, to explain myself here.  I m gonna go off track for a bit, but I have not lost my place.What did Trump do?  He railed against the political protests in the NFL, as we all well know.  He elevated that issue to a point where the NFL couldn t escape the scrutiny of viewers. They couldn t escape the rage.  The players were kneeling. They were disrespecting the anthem.  Any other president would have not said a word about it!  It would have gone on. It would still be happening. The NFL would be in deep, dire straits right now because it would have continued.They would have been shedding viewers. They would have been shedding attendees at stadiums if this had gone on.  They would be shedding money. They would be losing money left and right,  cause it would have continued had nobody said anything about it.  Because nobody in the league was gonna have the guts to stand up to the players.  They would have been mollified.  Ownership and the commissioner would have done everything they could to strike deals with the players, further alienating fans.What did Trump do?  He continued to call them out   and as Trump continued to call them out, more and more people began to dissociate themselves with the NFL.  And the NFL and the players realized that without a strong customer base, the dominoes fall; financial underpinnings of the league will eventually collapse.  And, if you don t think that s right, if you think I m misreading this, I need to ask you: What happened to the protests?  They re gone, aren t they?  The protests are gone.You know what else is coming back?  The ratings for the NFL are coming back.  As the players stop protesting their own country, as the players stop protesting their own flag, as they stop this incessant bleating about being slaves to a white-owned aristocracy  LeBron James tried it and what happened?  He got shut down and had to apologize.  That s because of Donald Trump.  If Trump hadn t spoken up in the first place   and I knew, by the way, that this comparison to slavery was gonna happen.  I called it two years ago.I thought it d be the media making the charge, not another athlete. I didn t know it d be LeBron James.  But LeBron James basically came along and said the NFL is modern-day slavery.  You ve got a bunch of white owners and an indentured servitude African-American employee base where the average salary is $2.1 million.  Do you know what the average slave was paid?  Anybody know?  There s an average figure.  I can tell you what the average  (interruption) Exactly!  Nothing!  The average slave was paid nothing!Do you know how many days or weeks, hours a day the average slave worked?  However damn many he was told.  He was paid zero for it and didn t hardly get much to eat, just enough to fuel the engine to enable the work to continue.  But there was nothing luxurious about it.  For these guys to come along and claim that the NFL is a modern incarnation of slavery is simply insane ridiculousness.  But here s our old buddy LeBron James doing it.  You notice how quickly that died?  It wouldn t have died if it weren t for Donald Trump.Those protests would have continued, LeBron James would have been hailed as a hero, and the NFL today would be an enterprise in heap big trouble.  Trump called it out the moment it started.  He withstood the avalanche of criticism that happened but eventually the NFL had to realize that their fan base was falling by the wayside. Not supporting the players.  Not supporting the kneeling.  Not supporting the protesting of the flag.  They were just leaving!  And they weren t watching on television.The protests have disappeared; the ratings are back.What am I missing?  I m telling you, Donald Trump is using the same tactics, similar tactics with the wall and in this trade war that we re having with the ChiComs.  What is he doing?  He s elevating the issues to apply pressure because bring focus to the fundamentals.  Now, you might say,  Well, that s all he can do, Rush,  cause he s a simpleton idiot.   No. He is not a simpleton idiot.  He s a man of impeccable common sense who understands the basics of things, who understands the fundamentals.And the fundamentals are that America and our culture cannot continue with open borders like this. It cannot continue to thrive. It cannot continue to be what it is as long as the borders are open and an entire political party in this country is encouraging this attack on our basic culture!  Okay.  So now where are we?  We don t have people supporting open borders, do we?  We don t have people down there (clapping) applauding the illegals and saying,  Come on in! They do it in private.  They do it quietly.  But they re not a majority.  So now we ve gotten to the point where the NFL was hemorrhaging viewers and it was hemorrhaging fans.  The sponsors were hemorrhaging their clientele. And the same thing could be happening here.  When you have a poll that shows 93% of the people think illegal immigration is a big problem, I m sorry, that s not a winning issue for the open-borders crowd.  So now Trump wants to address the nation to talk about this.The Golden Globes last night.  Their ratings are down.  They tried to fix it.  Do you know that there was no politics among the hosts? Not the award winners, but the hosts, Sandra Oh and whoever the other guy was. They purposely abandoned politics in an effort  They had been losing ratings for the past number of years, particularly the last two. All these awards shows have been dumping on Trump, and their ratings have been going south. They ve been saying,  We don t care! We don t do what we do for the ratings. Bull. The networks that carry this crap care.  Everybody in this cares about ratings.  I don t care if they tell you they don t.  The stars may not, I don t know, but the people televising this stuff do or they wouldn t go to such lengths to find proper hosts and this kind of thing.  So the Golden Globes last night, they tried to dial it back   and the bottom still fell out!  Their ratings are still down over what was a record low last year in 2018.That s because people have long memories, and whether or not there was any Trump bashing or America bashing last night, there has been in this previous year, and people don t need to be preached to or want to be preached to by people they perceive to be ignoramuses about matters of great consequence facing the country.  So we ll see what happens with the Epidemic Awards, but the trend here is that Trump is winning on these things   and in the process, he is saving industries, not just with our economic performance.But you can arguably say and you could do it with great credibility that Donald Trump deserves the credit for saving the NFL from what could have been a devastating decline by calling out the very destructive behavior that was being engaged in by players, malcontents or what have you.  Cause if that had continued   you notice the news about football games is about the games again? The news about football games is about the players and the controversies that happen on the field, the officiating.But it s all about stuff that happens on the field now, not what s happening in the anthem period or the pregame. You don t see sports coverage following players to the ghetto as they try to give back because a lot of that doesn t even happen in the first place. No. They re covering the sport. They re covering the game. And, as such, the NFL is coming back.Have you also noticed you can t find Roger Goodell anywhere? I ve seen him twice this season, both of them in little cameo appearances on camera during these playoffs games. And guess who he s sitting with? He s sitting with fans. He s not sitting with the owners in their suite. He s sitting with fans. He s giving out tickets to the Super Bowl, sitting with fans at these games. He was in Chicago.The NFL has done everything they can to get the negatives off of the front and center stage of the NFL, and it wouldn t have happened if it weren t for Trump. The same thing is happening with the ChiComs and this trade stuff. The same thing is happening with the wall. The same thing is happening with illegal immigration. There s one guy showing the way, one guy standing up, one guy educating, one guy informing, one person standing firm in his common-sense beliefs about these things.And what s being demonstrated is commitment. Patience and commitment and fortitude pay off. We don t live in a world where there are instant results despite what people think. It still takes a while for things to happen. There s a lot of people in this country, a lot of minds to shift. Doesn t happen overnight. It s why you ve gotta have intestinal fortitude and guts and once you stake a position publicly you gotta stand with it, you gotta stick with it and promote it and continue, instead of caving.But he s still out there all alone. Can you imagine if he just had some support from the Republican on any number of these things, which has been the lament that we ve had here since Trump was inaugurated back in 2017. So Trump is elevating these issues to apply pressure and bring focus to the fundamentals of each one. Trade tariffs, unfair arrangements and deals that need to be redone, border security. And we know because of the most recent polling data, voters care deeply about border security. Much more so than the Drive-By Media would ever lead anybody to believe. Congress cares deeply about votes. The Democrats care deeply about destroying the traditional, distinct American culture that was established at our founding.The ChiComs, they care deeply about strong revenue streams from American trade. The ChiComs also care deeply about an economy in their own country that can create enough jobs every year to keep those people happy and free from revolting. The communist president of China, his number one job is job creation and make sure that the people that get these new jobs are out in the country and don t storm the cities which are already overcrowded. He needs American trade for this to happen. He needs Apple to continue to be making iPhones, 500,000 people employed at one factory to make iPhones, and they re out in the hinterlands.Trump knows all of this. The ChiCom economy depends on strong revenue streams from American trade. So applying pressure, leverage brings focus to all of these things that heretofore the American establishment, the elites, the leadership, have just figured that it s not possible, we ve gone global and so this idea that America first, America wins, America this is so antiquated and so irrelevant and it s so pedantic we can t even talk about anymore. Here comes a guy talking about it.This is how problems are solved. And isn t that the goal? So Trump now wants a national address tomorrow night according to the New York Times. You know, we have to continue to hear the little Chihuahuas yapping at Trump s ankles, from Mitt Romney and some of these Never Trumpers who just can t get over themselves and this devotion that they claim to have to manners and character and culture. I gotta make a note. I gotta make my comments about this. This whole character business, it s a dichotomy. In fact, it may even be a conundrum.  Cause it is in some ways frustrating. In other ways, it s liberating.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Looky here. Exactly what I was just saying. This is from CNBC:  How Trump s tweet storms to rally support for the government shutdown seem to be working ñ Since first threatening a government shutdown last month in his battle with Congress over border wall funding, President Donald Trump has leaned heavily on Twitter to rally support among his followers. So far, the strategy seems to be working. That, however, doesn t bode well for a quick resolution to the standoff. Wait just a second! If it s working, then why doesn t it bode well for a quick resolution? Hmm? It says here:  As the standoff drags on, Trump has tried to take maximum advantage of the political upheaval to rally support from his followers for his signature 2016 campaign issue. Based on a CNBC review of his wall-related tweets, the effort is paying off. So CNBC is saying that Trump has leaned heavily on Twitter to rally support among his followers, and they are apoplectic because a CNBC review of these tweets show that his effort is paying off and that the strategy is working. And it doesn t bode well for a quick resolution.In other words, CNBC is afraid public support for Trump s position might make him more reluctant to cave for the Democrats. It will strengthen his resolve and he ll hang in there and it means there s a greater chance it s gonna be the Democrats that have to cave. That s why it s bad news. These creeps. I tell you.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Greg in Sioux Falls.  It s great to have you on the EIB Network.  How you doing, sir?CALLER:  Very good, Mr. Limbaugh.  Thank you.  One quick comment first here.  Trump saved the NFL.  They thought he was tearing  em down, but he saved  em.  Now, what else I want to say is this.  I just got off the phone this morning with my two senators from South Dakota, Thune and Rounds, and I made the comment to  em: The Democrats don t like borders.  We know there are all of a sudden barriers and walls around the U.S. Capitol, House, and Senate buildings.  I asked them to put in legislation to take it down. Get rid of those borders.  Let s see what the Democrats in Washington, D.C., think when they re exposed.  Let s let people drive wherever they want to drive around there.RUSH:  What d they say?CALLER: (unintelligible)   talking point to come back.  Well, you know, you don t get to talk to those people.  You don t get to talk to me.RUSH:  I always get through.CALLER: (laughing) There s the differenceñRUSH:  Well, that must be  (laughing)CALLER: (laughing)   between me and Rush Limbaugh.RUSH: No, you have an excellent point here, and it s like  Let me get back to the Golden Globes for a second.  Now, these people tried to tone down, the hosts.  I mean, not the award recipients and the runners-up and all that, but the hosts, Sandra Oh and her flunky, whoever he was.  They tried.  They didn t go political at all. But some of the others couldn t help it and it became a diatribe against guns.  They just went off on guns and little, you know, referrals, references here to climate change.But I ll tell you, I ll bet you that the number of armed security people protecting these stars at the Golden Globes last night would have been enough to stop your average invasion at the border.  I ll bet you there was so much armed security at that place and I ll betcha there were so many barriers that the average hoi polloi couldn t cross and get close to these stars, and then once they left the awards the Beverly Hilton, then they go to wherever the parties   are and you can t just walk in there because there s armed security outside and inside, and they got barriers.You can t even get into the parking lot. And then when they leave the parties and then when it s time to go home, why, they go behind more walls and there s probably more armed security where many of them live. And here they are ripping guns and ripping anybody who wants to engage in similar practices to protect the country at large. It s why they have become a joke, and it s why they are not influential.It wasn t that long ago, folks, that LeBron James coming out and claiming that the NFL ownership is the modern incarnation of slavery  cause of a bunch of white billionaires employing 75% of their workforce African-American indentured slaves, it would have had some legs because the media would have picked it up and run with it, and at least run around and started asking,  Well, what do you think of what LeBron said?  And then they try to get some owners saying some stupid things in response to keep the story alive.But it didn t go anywhere. And it didn t go anywhere because the whole concept of the NFL as a slave enterprise doesn t pass any kind of reality test whatsoever. And so LeBron was reduced to having to apologize. It wasn t that long ago he would have been heralded as a great social scientist.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Dan in Raleigh, North Carolina. Great to have you, sir. Hi.CALLER: Thank you, sir. I ll get right to my point. I want to thank you again for saying that President Trump scrutinized the NFL and didn t let  em get away with it. You, like he, just get through the disinformation and get right to the point. And I m surprised to hear the NFL numbers are up, the viewing numbers. I wanted to get your thoughts on that as well.RUSH: You re surprised the numbers are up?CALLER: Yes.RUSH: Well, why are you surprised they re up?CALLER: Well, you know, I saw people losing faith just as many of the actions that go on, you guys scrutinize the facts, cut through it on so many fronts and get rid of the disinformation, but I wasn t sure  RUSH: Yeah, but you know what happened? The protests stopped, the kneeling stopped, the anti-America, anti-flag, all this politicization stopped. And there was something else that happened: Offense exploded. The Chiefs and the Rams played a game of 51-48 or something.Offense was off the charts. Fans and viewers love offense. It ain t boring. I don t care if it is 51-48. You become mesmerized by it. But 10-3 defensive struggles, I mean, an unaffected fan will slog through that and watch it. Football fan is football. Football is football.But when the offense goes nuts like it did for much of this season and if you ll notice, all of the soap opera stuff this season was about the game! Look at the Steelers. The Steelers may as well be Payton Place. But none of it involved protests. None of it involved the flag. None of it involved people being ticked off at America. It was all related to what happened on the field, which is what sports fans want.So it revived the fantasy league aspect, and it makes sense. The league itself got rid of all of these distractions. They got rid of things that reminded people of negative reinforcement in terms of people and image. And the fans felt free to go back to the game and did.  "

That s 2007, The 1/2 Hour News Hour, and what we joked about back then   as we often do   has come true today in terms of what the media is trying to convince the American people.  Anything to diminish Trump!  Anything to make Trump seem like an idiot or a buffoon or somebody detached and lonely and not involved.  I mean, it s incredible.  This is the mainstream media.  It has become and continues to be a gigantic joke.  The thing is it s like the rest of the left.  I don t think they understand how ridiculous, how just flat-out childish they all sound.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. Grab audio sound bite number 4. Now, this is Sunday morning on Meet the Depressed. Mick Mulvaney, who is sitting in there for a while acting chief of staff. He also runs the Office of Management and Budget. He was on with F. Chuck Todd. And the question:  The implication here is that essentially Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter have more sway over the president s base than the president. Now, don t play the bite yet. This is NBC. This is Meet the Press. This is Tim Russert s legacy. And this is absurd. Now, don t misunderstand. I ll take it. As a media figure, I ll be glad to accept the accolades that in these people s minds this can actually be true. But that s the point that in their minds this can actually be true, that media people. I think it gives us a window on how important they think they are and how they re a little bit jealous. They think that Trump and national policies are actually being made by media people!Now, part and parcel of that is their steadfast belief that Trump is an idiot, and I m telling you, folks, he s got more common sense and intelligence in his little finger than these people have the ability to think independently in their entire brain. So here s the acting chief of staff, takes his job very seriously, loves and respects the president, Mick Mulvaney,  The implication here is that Sean Hannity, Limbaugh, Ann Coulter have more sway over the president s base than the president does. Is that the implication here? MULVANEY: I ve seen that. I would make the argument the president has probably more sway over Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter than vice-versa.RUSH:  I would make the argument the president has probably more sway over Hannity and Coulter than vice-versa.  There s a name not mentioned there. I wonder why. How many of you caught that? Anyway, this is the point that Mulvaney made and I think it s another indication of just how absent reality so many people on the left are getting.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Rush Limbaugh, a guy in a golf shirt in Palm Beach ostensibly running the country and am responsible for the government shutdown, according to the Democrat Party and the Drive-By Media.Now, do not think that I am falling for this. I know full well what the media s doing. The media, they already hate Trump so they want to do anything they can to diminish Trump and to portray him as basically a stooge and me as a puppet master Svengali diminishes him. Mentioning me, they think, is one of the best fundraising tools that they ve got. And so continuing to criticize me and using me to diminish Donald Trump they think is a twofer winner for them in terms of keeping their base stoked.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/07/americas-anchorman-is-back-and-nothing-has-changed/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 7, 2019RUSH: And greetings once again to you music lovers, thrill-seekers, conversationalists all across the fruited plain. Welcome to a guy in a golf shirt in Palm Beach on the EIB Network! That s right, my friends, a guy in a golf shirt running the country in Palm Beach. I tell you what I did   by the way, the phone number, 800-282-2882 if you want to be on the program.I ran a little test of sorts, although I intended to do it anyway. I went off the grid. I am not exaggerating when I tell you I did not see   this is two weeks ago, was the last I was   we did a Christmas Eve show, and for two weeks straight until this morning I did not turn on cable news. I didn t turn on any news whatsoever. I didn t read any news whatsoever.I heard some. I heard about the wacko who called Trump an M-Fer and I heard about Kyrsten Sinema taking the oath of office on a law book. I heard about some of the wacko left stuff because even the tech blogs that I was reading were talking about it, in high praise, by the way. But I literally tried to get away from it, A, just for my own sanity and health, but also as an experiment    spearmint,  for those of you in Rio Linda.I wanted to see what I would miss. I wanted to see, even though it s a two-week break, it s still a different time now because Trump is president and nobody s taking any time off. The media and the left are as animated, exorcised and panicked as ever, so I just wanted to see. And it is stunning to me. These last two weeks there isn t a single thing that happened that I missed and suffered for it. There s not a single thing that happened in these two weeks   the government shutdown started before I left, and it s gone on.And, by the way, has anybody experienced any strife whatsoever because of the government shutdown? No! Exactly as I forecast and predicted. If you didn t know, because the Drive-Bys are harping on it that there s a government shutdown, you wouldn t know otherwise because it s not impacting daily life, despite the best efforts of the media to create fear and panic over what might happen if it continues. And, of course, how it s all Trump s fault.Now, I knew the Democrats were sworn in because I knew that was gonna happen, but it s amazing. And the next thing I did, I checked the audio sound bite roster today from Cookie, and it is incredible. The first 16 sound bites are me. And they continue this ridiculous meme that I put to bed before I left. And that is that Trump was all set to sign the continuing resolution until somebody ran into his office and said,  Mr. President, stop, stop. He d already had the D of his name signed, already it had it written down on the bill and said,  Mr. President, no, no, no, Rush Limbaugh is warning you not to do it.  And Trump stopped. They re still running that story, still running that version of the story even though I put it to bed and tried to explain to everybody that that is not at all what happened. And so the Drive-Bys are purposely carrying forward a meme or a narrative that is not true, it is demonstrably false.And so you have to ask yourself why. Also, again, this is something that was eminently predictable. The left cannot get enough of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I m already bored with her. I m not interested in her. But it doesn t matter because the Drive-Bys are. I think obviously there has been a political consultant that is advising Democrats to do videos now in the kitchen drinking beer.Fauxcahontas opens a beer in her kitchen getting ready to run for president in Iowa and says something along the lines of  I m gonna go grab me a beer  and then opens the bottle and starts swilling it in an effort to make herself look like an average, ordinary, run-of-the-mill Indian, uh, American.I m reminded of John Kerry when he was running for president in 2004, goes to Ohio and walks into some bait and tackle shop,  Is this where I get me a huntin  license?  Trying to make himself look like the rube that he isn t but likes to put everybody down as being. Nothing changes. Nothing changes in terms of how the left goes about it. Nothing changes about how the media reports it.In fact, all of this great economic news that happened, the new jobs, 312,000 new jobs, the manufacturing in December, manufacturing sector is skyrocketing. And the Democrats are trying to spin that as bad news. How would you spin 312,000 new jobs and a totally revived manufacturing sector in December, how would you spin that as bad news? If you worked for Democrats and somebody ordered you to do it, how would you do it?Well, here s how they did it. First the numbers. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the economy added 312,000 new jobs in December. That s twice ñ (interruption) What? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what happened with Apple. Yes, yes, yes, and if anybody cares I ll be glad to weigh in on that. That I found extremely fascinating too. Oh, yeah. We have a lot of stuff. I had to go back and refamiliarize myself  cause I really was off the grid.But folks, I m not ignorant. I m up to speed. Actually, I cheated. Last night I started cramming. But I literally did spend two weeks without reading or looking at any of it at all. It s amazing how much my mood improved. But I ve mentioned that before. Anyway, 312,000 new jobs in December, nearly twice what Wall Street analysts had expected.The Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, blasted Trump for increasing economic volatility! So 312,000 new jobs is bad because it s too many! It s too big a spike. The manufacturing sector recovery and all of the massive increased output in our manufacturing sector, that s not good, either, because it s too much. It s too volatile. It s not stable. It can t be counted on. And so Perez blasts Trump for increasing economic volatility.His statement,  Thanks to Trump, volatility in the federal government is translating into volatility across our economy.  All of this happens in the month of December when the Democrats are thinking the bottom s about to fall out on Trump. Oh, and guess what? There s a story on CNN today. I don t recognize the guy who wrote it. Doesn t matter. But the headline:  What if Mueller Comes Up With Nothing?  What if Mueller has nothing?Did you hear that Mueller has asked to extend his grand jury six more months? He s nowhere near winding this down. Don t you think that if they had something that was really damaging and devastating to Trump, we would have had some leakage, some indication of it. But they re still searching.Ruth Bader Ginsburg is missing oral arguments today for the first time in her history as a Supreme Court justice.  You know, she had cancer surgery not long ago.  First time she s missed oral arguments ever.  Expect panic to ensue over this news.  Numerous leftists have been offering her their own body parts.  People have offered her their hearts, people have offered her their kidneys, people have offered her their sexual organs   whatever it takes to keep Ruth  Buzzi  Ginsburg alive   and that panic is gonna start all over again.Mitt Romney s piece that ran in the Washington Post.  You know, this is classic.  The Romney piece is a clear illustration of why the Republican establishment no longer gets it, how they are still clueless over the things that matter and don t matter to Republican voters.  Romney s basic beef is that even though Trump is doing some things pretty well and is experiencing good results, he s putting a black mark on the presidency because of his character, and we just can t tolerate this any longer.  We have got to get rid of Trump.We ve got to get rid of these horrible, bad character influences that this man is poisoning all of Washington with.  I was reminded of the Clinton years when I read Romney s piece, and I thought we had all learned that going after people on their character is not a winning thing politically.  Isn t that how people objected to Clinton?  Wasn t that the primary objection to Bill Clinton starting in 1992 and going into both terms and when the Lewinsky thing happened?What happened when everybody attacked Clinton s character?  The American voter said,  We don t care.  We don t care.   The Republicans haven t figured this out yet.  I m not saying it s a good thing. It s just a political reality.  Anyway, more on that as the program unfolds. There are 4.8 million more Americans employed since Trump took office.  This data released by the labor department on Friday  reveals that 4.8 million more Americans have joined the workforce since Trump took office January 2017. The figure includes the 2.88 million more Americans who are employed now than were employed in December of 2017.  The manufacturing sector has added 84,000 jobs throughout 2018.  That s a 37% increase,  and that makes 2018  the best year for manufacturing since 1997.   If you would have told me that this kind of economic growth and performance would lead to this kind of criticism and unhappiness and misery, I would have had a tough time believing you.  I mean, if you would have told me this years and years ago.By the way, White House has announced that Trump is gonna go to southern border on Thursday  to meet with those on the front lines of the national security and humanitarian crisis.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/24/hold-firm-mr-president/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 24, 2018RUSH: You know, I wanted to be here today, folks, just   oops. We got a mix minus problem. Can you hear that in there? Do you hear the problem? Level check, test   we are in the process here of over ñ I ll tell you what we re gonna do here. I m gonna explain this snafu here which, we re going to have to temporarily work around.I was going to say I m not gonna let any government shutdown keep me out of here and I m not gonna let the EIB Network be closed if I want to be here. And I definitely wanted to be here with everything going on. Folks, it s safe to say in 30 years of doing this program there has never been a month of December like this. There has never been a Christmas season like this, and there has never been a Christmas Eve like this, with this much important news going on.And I was fretting all weekend that I was gonna miss today,  cause the arrangements are already made. And what we had started to do here, we re gonna remodel and upgrade some of our tech equipment here, both in this studio and in the control room on the other side of the glass. And they started working on it over the weekend and then I come along and say,  Look. And they asked me,  What are the odds you re gonna be here on Monday before we start ripping things apart? I said,  Not very good. Can t imagine it. But then yesterday I said,  You know what? I gotta come in.  So they had to stop what they were doing and try to put it all back together again just to get ready for me here today. It s gonna be at least a week or maybe a two-week project to do the tech upgrade. And there s some furniture stuff involved too. So there was a little snafu here at the beginning. I was hearing what I was saying a split second later. It s like an echo. And it s gone away, but have I lost talk-back here?Everything s fine. So you guys screwed up at first and we didn t know it. (interruption) Right. Oh, it was New York that screwed up. Oh, okay. New York screwed up. We don t know who New York is today so we ll just slough it off on New York.Anyway, it s all up and running now. Here s the phone number. Hope to chat with you on the phones today. 800-282-2882, and the email address, ElRushbo@eibnet.us.The shutdown is obviously a top priority subject. I just need to reiterate some things about it. We re hearing that it s not going to be resolved until the new year. The Democrats have no incentive, really, to solve this until they take control of the House of Representatives on, I think, January 3rd. But I want the president to hold firm on this.This shutdown is one that the Democrats own. This would be very easy to resolve, and they don t want to do it. They don t want to do it, because I ll tell you, if you look at the media today, the Washington Post today, CNN, folks, they have Trump gone in three months. They think this is gonna lead me to the next subject we re gonna dissect here today. They believe in three months they will have fractured Trump s base, i.e., you. They think they will have split Trump s base.I ll tell you why they think that. They think that Trump has made an incorrectable error by firing Mattis and pulling us out of Syria. The Trump base is made up of two distinct types of voters: the so-called populists and standard, ordinary, everyday conservatives. And the populists don t mind getting out of Syria. The populists don t mind having power taken away from a bunch of political generals like Mattis and McMaster and so forth.But there s another part of the Trump coalition which is conservatives who believe in an active foreign policy. I m sure you ve talked to a lot of people that don t like the fact we re pulling out of Syria, that we re abandoning the Kurds, that we re abandoning allies, this is not good.The Drive-Bys and the official Washington permanent residents believe that this move by Trump has the potential to split his base. Remember when I said that Trump cannot be destroyed by the media because they didn t make him. And, by the way, this is true. If the media makes you, they can destroy you. If they don t make you, they can try to destroy you, but they can t.If you become a success and all the media does is report it and acknowledge it, has no role in it, then they can t harm you. Well, they can t destroy you. But if your success is owing fully to Media Buzz and hype, like if you do a radio show, but it s not number one but they treat you like it s number one and everybody thinks you re number one but you re nowhere near number one, if they turn on you then the fact that you re really number 10 is going to do revealed and you re finished.Well, I ve always said that the media really can t destroy Trump. Only he can. And there are some who think he s done that with this immediate withdrawal from Syria. I m sure you know people that voted for Trump that don t like this at all and I m sure you know people that voted for Trump who don t have a problem with getting out of Syria and with withdrawing half the troops out of Afghanistan. And I m sure you know some people who think,  Oh, my God, firing Mattis, big mistake.  And I m sure you know some Trump voters who don t think it s any big deal.So that subject I will explore and explain to your hearts  content. The other thing is the fed, the stock market, and Mnuchin. This one has a whole different group of people concerned. When Mnuchin started calling the banks   you heard about this? Steven Mnuchin is the treasure secretary, and out of the blue he announced that he d been calling six CEOs   or let me better say it   CEOs of six of the largest banks in the country. And his point was to ask them what their liquidity was.Now, these economics people speak in their own language. It s designed to keep outsiders from not understanding what they re talking about. When Mnuchin, the credit sky-is-not-falling-phone call is made and reported, and when Mnuchin is checking with the CEOs about their liquidity and assuring them that there s liquidity, what he s talking about is credit. Do people have enough money to lend? Because nobody can do anything sizable without borrowing money.So Mnuchin wanted to call these blanks, get a check on their liquidity and assure them that there was liquidity at the Fed, that borrowing and credit would still be up and running, nothing s gone south in that regard. But it s being treated as though an owner of a sports team giving a coach or manager a vote of confidence. It s relatively certain he s gonna be fired not long after. So people are thinking, why would Mnuchin do this? Mnuchin wants everybody to think the sky isn t falling, so his phone call indicates that it is.This has created a sense of panic in the market that accompanies the fact the stock market is down 4,000 points since early October, now below 22,000. And it involves the Fed and the usage of interest rates. By the way, this is another issue kind of like Syria and Mattis. There are Trump voters who actually think it s okay for the Fed to raise rates because it s stability that they care about. There are other Trump voters who think that it s sabotaging Trump to raise rates because it stalls what is a growing economy, which will ultimately hurt Trump.The one thing that runs true in all this is that the effort to destroy President Trump is in full swing. It s being waged on many different fronts. It has eventuated now that many in the Drive-By Media think it is a foregone conclusion, it s just a matter of time now.As I mentioned, the Washington Post gives Trump three months   and by three months, they mean three months until this coalition is fractured to the point that the Senate might have 67 votes to impeach if the House Democrats actually bring up impeachment charges.  Now, don t misunderstand.  I don t  (chuckling) I don t think any of this is true.  This is their mind-set.  This has been their objective for two years and is all  What they see is destruction all around us: The stock market, foreign policy.They think Trump is goofing up left and right, and they re happy for it to be screwing up. They re happy for this to happen! As long as they can peg it on Trump, like anything else, the Democrats will destroy whatever or weaken what for as long as it empowers them to so-called fix it later.  There are even some really out-of-control leftists who would willingly take a financial hit if it meant getting rid of Trump.I don t think (chuckling) we re anywhere near that, but I m just telling you that s what they think.  That s why they re in such good moods when you watch the Drive-By Media.  They think it s over, it s just a matter of time now   and at the top of the list is the government shutdown.  They are convinced that most Americans object to this, don t like this, and, by tradition, blame Republicans (that would be Trump) for this.  And they think Trump has just swerved into a self-destructive move here and so forth.Whether it was a good move or not irrelevant now.  The point is stick with it. I think it was a good move.  I advocated it before the midterm elections, as you know.  But the president wasn t listening to me.  "

Finally, it s time to get to the phones, and we re gonna start in Washington. This is Edward. Welcome, sir. Great to have you. You are up first today. Hi.CALLER: Merry Christmas, Rush, and Merry Christmas to your incredible audience too.RUSH: Thank you, sir. They all appreciate it. We all do.CALLER: I know you do. Hey, Rush, I m gonna give you a report from Washington, D.C., at the corner of 14th and Constitution, and I just want to let you know that the Treasury just collapsed, the mint is on fire, and the street is strewn with automobiles tipped upside down and they re all on fire, and Nancy Pelosi is leading a throng of illegal aliens throwing Molotov cocktails down Independence Avenue. So, yeah, there is chaos here. Okay. (chuckling) I drive into D.C. every day. This place is like a ghost town! Everybody s already left, everybody s already checked out of here, okay? This government shutdown, it s a bunch of smoke and mirrors.RUSH: Exactly right!CALLER: Yes!RUSH: The Christmas break probably starts the day after Thanksgiving in that town.CALLER: Oh, I notice. I know  cause I drive into town every day I notice the traffic patterns, and as soon as we re coming to Thanksgiving time, you could just see that the traffic tail off, and you know everybody s just  They re taking their vacations now. This place, everyone s left already. So who cares? You know, Rush, I agree with you 99% of the time. But today I agree with you 99.99% of the time (chuckles) because I say we ought to do this more often. I wish the Republicans would do this more often. Take these issues and make them eat them. Make Nancy Pelosi eat that issue. She wants drugs coming over the border? Let her eat that issue. Chuck Schumer wants illegal aliens coming in? Make him eat that issue.RUSH: Exactly! Put the onus on these people! This is what s at stake here! You know, the Democrats portray all of this  For example, they say that we want to shut down illegal immigration because we re racists and we don t like poor people. We don t like brown people, and we don t like people who don t speak English. They try to portray our position on this as something other than what it is. It s very simple. It s the glue that holds the country together actually. It s called the rule of law. That s first and foremost. It s illegal!Then you add unconstitutional to it when you start talking about sanctuary cities. It s illegal! The country can t function this way. We re not opposed to immigration, and it ticks me off to even have to say this. We have systems established to allow legal immigration, and people have played by those rules forever. The Democrat Party wants these rulebreakers and lawbreakers to be able to come in to the country with open arms on our side and impunity when they get here! And it s time that the results of this get thrown right back down their throats. I agree with you.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/21/its-the-schumer-shutdown-redux/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 21, 2018RUSH: Grab audio sound bite No. 20. Chuck You Schumer just in. They re still in shock. They literally cannot believe what happened. Seriously, you have to go back to Wednesday when they thought that they had not only defeated Trump but humiliated him, because here he is making a big deal over the border wall and they thought it was such a slam-dunk defeat that they re out celebrating, partying, dancing, consuming adult beverages, singing.Now this. And I don t care how they try to slice this; the onus is now on them. They can point fingers at Trump all day long for putting them in this position, but it s very simple. They keep talking about government shutdown and how,  We cannot afford them. We cannot have them! They re devastating; they re bad.  Well, all you gotta do is $5 billion. Forget even what it s for! Spend $5 billion and your precious government can stay up and running.Do you remember, ladies and gentlemen, Chuck Schumer shut the government down for three days back in January this year, way back in January? The Schumer Shutdown! Remember that? Remember everybody was talking about how Schumer had his lunch handed to him? The Drive-By Media was really lambasting Schumer for making a strategic mistake in forcing a shutdown, and it was called the Schumer Shutdown.But do you remember any itinerant chaos attached to it? Do you remember the media or anybody in Washington acting like the end of the world had happened? No! They were mad that Schumer ended up getting blamed for it, and thus the Democrats, not that it had happened. It was a three-day government shutdown in January that was so devastating, you don t even remember it! Nobody remembers any of them because nothing horrible ever happens in a government shutdown!Nothing horrible ever happens as a result of a government shutdown. Never, ever! Doesn t happen, ain t gonna happen, didn t happen. Last January, the Democrats were not upset that there was a shutdown. They were flabbergasted that Schumer ended up being tactically outsmarted and blamed for it! That s why there wasn t any chaos. That s why there wasn t any panic. There wasn t anything like the reporting that we are seeing now, because it was Schumer and Pelosi who shut down the government.You know why they did? You don t even remember that, do you? No, don t feel bad. Nobody does. Nobody remembers that government shutdown. That s the whole point! I m sorry to yell, folks. But I m at my wits  end here dealing with this stuff. In fact, how many times we been through this? How many times does this game get played and the same damn ? The media has a cut-and-paste script that they use for these stories! There s nothing original in it. It s the same song and dance. It s the same doom and gloom.It s the same apocalyptic nature. The fact is nothing happened. The stock market actually (in the last three got there shutdowns) has gained strength, the last one by three percentage points. The last government shutdown, the Schumer shutdown in January was on her the fact that they did not get amnesty for their beloved dreamers. Ahh. Now you re starting to remember. Yeah, Trump refused to cave on amnesty for the DREAMers.They thought they had Trump over the barrel because, as always, Republicans cave when there s a government shutdown threatened. But Trump didn t. And they purposely forced that because they wanted Trump to do a 180 on anything involving illegal immigration. They wanted Trump to cave and allow amnesty, even if it was just for a relatively few number of DREAMers. That would have been a major score.  Trump caves! Trump agrees to amnesty.  I can see the headlines now.Instead, he didn t and there was a government shutdown and it was called the Schumer Shutdown. The media did not make a big deal about it  cause they didn t want the Democrats getting blamed. They did jump on Schumer for making a mistake and being outmaneuvered and outsmarted, but they didn t report on chaos and the end of government and all these government workers out of work and not getting paycheck. There was none of that. So here s Schumer today. This was just moments ago on the floor of the Senate SCHUMER: President Trump hounded by the radical voices of the hard right, threw another temper tantrum. And here we are, once again, on the brink of what the president has spent months saying he wanted   a Trump shutdown. The president seems to relish it. He seems to feel it will throw a bone to his base. The problem being his base is less than one quarter of America.RUSH: His base got him elected president, Chuck. His base got him elected president, Chuck, and he has now solidified his base, Chuck. What is this? Trump base continues to shrink every time they open their mouths about it. Trump s base is less than 25% of America? Hardly. Dream on, pal.  Hounded by the radical voices of the hard right   threw another temper tantrum, and here we are once again on the brink of what the president has spent months saying he wanted   a Trump shutdown. You ve got a Democrat shutdown on the way   and, by the way, talking about what s next here. Supposedly there s gonna be another meeting between Trump and this time Republicans in the Senate. Yesterday it was Republicans in the House. During situations like this, it is often thought that back-room negotiations are underway and that a deal is on the verge of being struck, that everybody s out in public posturing on their hardline ideological positions. But in the back, smoke-filled rooms there are adults that are negotiating and finding ways to end this chaos before the end of the day when the government would have to shut down.CNN says that that s not happening. CNN says don t look for such a deal because there isn t anybody working on one. Here s how CNN reports it. This is on their website.  Often in brink-of-disaster moments on Capitol Hill, there are cooler heads behind the scenes who are working on a way out. Drafting a way to thread the needle. Figuring out a pathway to pull everyone back from the edge. Quietly pulling together a deal to calm everyone and serve as the legislative silver bullet.  CNN says,  That is not happening now. It s not happening at all because there is no back room and there s nobody in the back room. As a result,  The federal government,  the precious, the beloved, the can t-do-without-it federal government,  is hurtling toward a partial  (Snort!) Partial!  government shutdown. The only way it doesn t happen is for one side to cave a massive way. And there s not a lot of hope that s in the cards, according to aides in both parties on Capitol Hill.  There s one thing we know. This is gonna end. Everything ends and begins again. This is going to end.There is going to be a resolution. This is what everybody knows. Everybody playing this stupid game knows that it s gonna end. Someday, somewhere, some hour, it s gonna end. How it ends is what this is all about. I have to laugh at this Trump s base is 25% of the country. Trump has higher approval ratings right now from Republicans than any other president except George W. Bush right after 9/11. Trump s approval rating in his own party Ninety-three percent of Republican women approve of the job Trump is doing. His base is not shrinking! His overall approval rating is holding steady at 44 to 48%, depending on where you look at the poll. He s not losing ground in personal or presidential approval polls. But you listen to these guys,  With everything that happens in Washington on a given day Trump is losing support and the country s descending into further chaos. And now, the fact that he actually is listening to Rush Limbaugh makes it even worse!  They can t stand it!  A guy on the radio?  They can t stand! They re the ones that are supposed to be influencing Trump! They re the ones Trump is supposed to care about! They re the ones Trump is supposed to be courting! They are the ones that call the shots! There is none of this that is going their way, and all you have to do is watch.  "

No, this is not  Baghdad Jim.  Sorry. This is different, Jim McGovern, Democrat, Massachusetts, that is last night on the floor of the House.MCGOVERN: The American people chose a different course. They don t want a government that reacts only to the wants of the president s ever-shrinking base, the small segment of society who actually supports his offensive border wall. If the president s most senior advisors are Fox & Friends and Rush Limbog (sic), maybe we shouldn t be surprised where we find ourselves here today.RUSH:  Rush Limbog.  You hear that?  Rush Limbog.  By the way, Congressman McGovern, the  small segment of society [that] supports his border wall ? I think it was enough to get him elected president, sir.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The Senate has been voting on a procedure just now to call up what the House passed last night. It s a parliamentary procedure. They have to do this in order to get to an actual vote on the amendment to the continuing resolution that the House passed with the $5 billion. It s actually $8 billion because there s some money in there for disaster relief. They thought that if they  Get this. Get this. The money for the wall is $5 billion, give or take. It s $5.1 billion, four-point-something, $5 billion.They thought in the House if they added, like, three or four billion for disaster relief, that that might entice some support in the Senate. Because after all, who opposes disaster relief? Like for the next hurricane in Haiti or tsunami in Indonesia. So they added a  sweetener,  something that Congress never turns down.  Disaster relief? Why, to turn that down would say that we re cold-hearted.  So that s actually what the whole package is. It didn t work. It didn t change anybody s mind about this.McConnell has met with Trump at the White House this morning and so far, appears to be   appears to be   standing with Trump. Now, Bob Corker, outgoing senator from Tennessee, Republican, said that Trump is suffering from the  tyranny of talk radio,  and he mentioned me and Sean Hannity. The  tyranny of talk radio ?

I ve got four minutes here. I ve got  Okay, first up, I want to show you some meltdown samples and let you hear them. We have a montage here.

This is the government working! This is you not getting your way each and every day!You didn t win the election, Don! Elections have consequences! There s no chaos except on your side because you re losing your system. You re losing control of what you ve always been able to count on. You re realizing you actually don t run things, and that s why there s chaos. A.B. Stoddard last night on Fox, Special Report with Bret Baier. Now, A.B., I need to tell you, she s worked at a bunch of stuff.She s worked at TheHill.com. She s worked at  Well, everywhere. And her reputation is she right down the middle. She s a straight shooter. You  When you listen to A.B. Stoddard or when you read A.B. Stoddard, you don t know whether she s a left-winger, right-winger. You don t know any. That s how good she is. Well, she had a meltdown on Bret Baier s Special Report last night.STODDARD: The nation s fourth graders know this is no way to run a lemonade stand. This is completely irresponsible. The markets are rattling on the prospect of a shutdown. The president time and again is contemptuous of process and of compromise. He doesn t have 60 votes. He must compromise. He was all for a DACA deal. He refused to take it. He took four positions on the Goodlatte bill.BAIER: I get it. I get it.STODDARD: He refuses to do the hard work.BAIER: If he listens to the Mark Meadows and the Jim Jordans and the other people on the House floor  STODDARD: They don t know what they re talking about! This is political malpractice. They re wrong!RUSH: (impression)  They don t know what they re taking about.  Members of Congress don t know what they re talking about.  Political malpractice! He refuses to compromise with us.  I guess there goes the end of A.B. Stoddard being seen as a centrist down the middle who you don t know who she is. (sputtering)  He doesn t have 60 votes he has to compromise it s like last year he was offered a DACA deal. He refused to take it. Yeah. There was a shutdown. Three days.We re all still here, aren t we?We re all still breathing.We re all still eating.Climate change hasn t killed us.There was a government shutdown for three days in January. Chuck Schumer arranged it. So Trump will not suffer. He will not bite. He will not cave. He will not give you what you want, and so what do you have? Political malpractice? It s political malpractice when elected president refuses to go along with the media, political malpractice when he refuses to cave to demands of Democrats and media who hate his guts?  Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan? They don t know what they re talking about! It s political malpractice! They have no idea what they re talking about. He doesn t have 60 votes! He knows he doesn t have 60 votes.  Yeah. He may know that.So what is he doing?Let s wait and see, folks,  cause it s gonna be fun.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: One more sound bite here in case you missed this. We played this at the top of the hour. We put together a montage of all the Drive-By Media that have gone ballistic when they found out   when they were led to believe   that Trump made this decision on shouting the government because of me. Now, the media over the course of the years have tried to do great damage, harm my business, get rid of me, whatever, on things like that Michael J. Fox or Donovan McNabb, some of these surface things, Sandra Fluke. This   is different. This, they are beside themselves. They cannot stand this.So we put together a montage of Drive-By people going ballistic when they found out or think Trump listened to me.NINA TURNER: Does he serve the American people, or does he serve Rush Limbaugh?BRIAN STELTER:   Rush Limbaugh challenging the president to do something and then what did Trump do this afternoon?

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/21/trump-blindsided-the-swamp/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 21, 2018RUSH: I think I can honestly say this is a first. I can t remember a last program of the year that might not be the last program of the year. I can t! (laughing) I can t remember a last program of the year going into Christmas this intense, this less festive. I ve been trying to remember   30 years is a long time   but I can t come up with one.JOHNNY DONOVAN: And now, from sunny south Florida, it s Open Line Friday!RUSH: Yes, siree. So here we go, folks, three hours of broadcast excellence hosted by me, the new villain in Washington, D.C. Wait  til you hear the media montage that we have put together. This is all my fault. I made the mistake of taking Trump seriously and then broadcasting it and now everybody s in trouble because of me. You think they were mad at me with Donovan McNabb or with Michael J. Fox. That s nothing compared! Everybody I tell you what, these people are acting like life as we know it is about to end even before climate change kills us all. This is stunning to watch! All because Mad Dog Mattis is leaving, now there is nothing holding Washington together, because Trump will not compromise and because Trump will not engage in normal behavior for Washington, D.C., because Trump is causing a government shutdown at Christmas, where at Christmas employees may not get paid and so forth. I mean, I ve never seen anything like this.It is so illustrative. It is such a teachable moment (if people are only paying attention) to find out exactly how that town works and what is demanded in that town and the fealty and loyalty to systems and so forth. Here we have somebody elected to shake it all up   and that is exactly what s going on. This is exactly what it looks like. This is what pushing back against the Washington establishment looks like. It was never gonna be pretty. It was never gonna be clean. It was never gonna be supported and so forth. But, man, there is panic.There is legitimate panic over this. You would think these people would be happy because they re telling us that, in effect, Donald Trump is destroying himself and Donald Trump is destroying his support base. They ought to support that! They re acting like Donald Trump is going to destroy life as they know it, and that s why they re panicked. They ought to be celebrating if Trump is making this many mistakes, if he is doing this many things wrong.I mean, these people ought to realize if this is true, Trump s imploding and he s gonna be gone before very long and they ll be able to pick up the pieces and put it all back together again. But they re treating it as though a secretary of defense resigning is the end of the country, it s the end of foreign policy, it s the end of sanity   and now there s no  adult supervision  left around Trump and he s totally dependent on me and Fox News.We ve got audio sound bites here to demonstrate some of this, show you some of the things I m talking about terms of the media meltdown. In fact, let me just get this out of the way. Grab audio sound bite No. 3. This is the montage we put together of the media. You see, now, you have to understand: They thought that they had Trump. They thought that there was no way the House was gonna vote to add $5 billion for a wall or for border security. They thought it wasn t gonna happen. Chuck and Nancy are out there telling everybody it isn t gonna happen.Nancy s at a bar drinking and partying and dancing, and the Democrats are singing Christmas carols on the House floor on Wednesday night. And they really don t think these votes are gonna be there in the House. A bunch of Republicans lost and left town because they had no place to live. It wasn t gonna happen. Except it did. Except it did. Now Trump has positioned these people, these Democrats as unwilling to stop a government shutdown over $5 billion for a wall. Forget that the $5 billion is for a wall.The Democrat Party is willing to let this government shut down happen over $5 billion, period. Now, you add to it that it s the wall and border security; it makes them look even worse. But for a bunch of people that don t even blink at spending a trillion dollars, it is they who are shutting down this government over $5 billion. It is the Democrat Party doing this. This is so easy to avoid. But this is how much they are afraid of anything substantively happening that would improve our illegal immigration situation.They simply cannot abide it. It s a measly $5 billion. What Trump did   and I m just gonna go out on a limb and say this. What Trump has done here is tactically really smart, and no one is gonna say it because no one s gonna have the courage to say it (especially in the Beltway) because of the reaction they would get. But Donald Trump blindsided the swamp yesterday. He put the Democrats in the position here that they can t  You know what their only retort to this is?(sobbing)  I can t believe that 400,000 federal workers are going to miss their paychecks at Christmas and not have a fun holiday season. It s so heartless and it s so mean!  That s their only comeback to this. They cannot talk about the issue. They do not talk about the substance of illegal immigration, border security, the wall. They don t want to go there. It s the same thing, the shutdown: Blame the Republicans for  having no heart or cold heart, unwilling to care about the suffering.  Most of these people we re talking about are on Christmas break anyway!They re not gonna be shunted out of their jobs because they re not working at the moment, and this thing isn t gonna go on very long if it happens at all and everybody s gonna be back to work. There s nothing detrimental to anybody that has ever happened after a government shutdown. Nobody s been ruined, nobody s been destroyed, nobody s ever lost their job. Nobody ever lost their Thanksgiving turkey, nobody ever lost Christmas presents. It s never happened!This shutdown won t even affect much more than 30%, if that, of the government. The only retort they ve got is (sobbing)  Four hundred thousand,  and some people say 800,000,  federal workers! It s Christmastime and they re missing their pay!  It s a bunch of people sounding like Christine Blasey Ford all the time, when nothing long-lasting or even short-term lasting pain-wise ever happens after a government shutdown. So they didn t think that the House would come up with the votes.And Trump was gonna be embarrassed, and now the Democrats are back on their heels and are now being forced to defend not securing the border. They re being forced to defend not authorizing or voting for a measly $5 billion. At the same time, Trump has got his base solidly behind him again. Now, this is not being said because this really is one of the many things that irritates them. For two years, they ve been trying to drive a wedge between Trump s base and Trump because that has been necessary in order to get his approval numbers down to the 30% area where they think they can force him out of office.What Trump has done has solidified the support of his base here. I was with a bunch of them last night. Believe me, they are ecstatic. I got an award last night, a Lifetime Achievement Award. Charlie Kirk and Turning Point USA saw fit to give me an award. And of course, when you get an award, you gotta go out there and you gotta make some remarks. I made some remarks. It was at Mar-a-Lago. It was about 800 people. I m telling you, every damn one of them every time Donald Trump s name mentioned by anybody, standing ovation, cheers and so forth.Trump s base is solidly behind him. A lot of young people. In fact, this group is a group, Turning Point USA, of young conservatives, and there s a bunch of them in town now for their annual convention. They have three, four thousand people over there at the convention or 2,500 something. It varies from year to year. I mean, this is another aspect of all this that they re not talking about. He took Chuck and Nancy, those legislative experts, and he turned  em back on their heels.They look like deer in headlights in their press conferences yesterday and today, and Schumer is out there (impression),  This is not my shutdown! This is his shutdown! He knew this was gonna happen! It s his shutdown.  No, it s yours. It was very simple to avoid this. $5 billion? Come on! We re talking a continuing resolution that s got trillions of dollars in it. $5 billion? But it s border security, and they won t do it. Trump got people to do things that everybody in the swamp said was impossible, surprised them all.They re all ready to go home. Some of them are already at home celebrating Christmas. The Democrats were singing and dancing in victory on the floor of the House on Wednesday night, Pelosi singing and dancing at the bar. He got the House to vote for his funding when Nancy said it was impossible   and it was thanks to conservatives, the Freedom Caucus in the House, where this happened. So now it s all the Democrats are on the hot seat. It s now all the Democrats that appear to be putting politics over country.It s the Democrats who for some reason, are perfectly fine with a government shutting down as long as they think they can get the media to blame it on Trump. But $5 billion for border security? No way. They spend $5 billion on toilet seats for the military. They spend $5 billion on paper clips. Without even thinking about it. They spend $5 billion on anything literally without thinking about it. That s how tiny an amount of money it actually is in comparison to all federal outlays or expenditures, federal spending.It s chump change to the Nth degree. They re saying, by the way   and you re gonna hear it in a moment   that Trump folded, that Trump caved to the pressure of conservative media voices. I say that Trump has been playing these people from the start. Starting in an Oval Office meeting with Chuck and Nancy. Starting with  In fact, no. Even before that. Right after the election, the day after the midterm elections Trump is out there saying In another example of what I call Trump pacing, he s out there saying,  I think I can work with Chuck and Nancy. I think we re gonna be able to get along. I think we re gonna be able to come up with legislation maybe even on the wall,  he said.  I think they want to get things done. I think we re gonna be able to work together.  It s what he always does. He acts conciliatory. He acts open; extends the hand of welcome, friendship, and apparent cooperation. But during that meeting with Chuck and Nancy in the Oval Office he told them what he was gonna do. I m gonna own the shutdown. I m not gonna just shut the government down. I m gonna own it. I ll be happy to own it. We re talking border security.  They re look at him like he s an idiot, like he doesn t mean it like he s just posturing or else he s a total blithering idiot, doesn t know what he s doing, trying to suppress their laughter, what have you. Like every other arrogant bully, they think they re dealing with a neophyte idiot who doesn t know the ways of the world, doesn t know the way to behave in their world.So they act mockingly tolerant, thinking that they re dealing with an immature little child. But he has more power than they do. So they have to publicly acknowledge that he s president, but privately think he s the biggest dolt on the face of the earth and he outsmarts them and outmaneuvers them. We read that Trump has achieved very little legislatively, which, by the way, is the definition for success in the swamp. The gold standard is,  How much legislation have you got. How much legislation have you passed? How much legislation has your name on it? Well, take a look at the prison reform bill. That is a huge deal to everybody in that town. They love it and they don t dare talk about it! I myself am not crazy about it, to tell you the truth. But they, in the Beltway, love that bill. It is a bill that every liberal has apparently been trying to get passed and failed since Obama! But it s right out of something they want and always have wanted   and they don t dare talk about it.Because leftists will like hearing the details of what s in this prison reform bill. And it happened  I made mention of this yesterday. It happened with hardly any effort at all, apparently, 87 votes in the Senate. There was none of this kind of contretemps involved in it like we re having with $5 billion for border security, and this prison reform bill affects 180,000 people. The farm bill? The criminal justice bill? Bipartisan support. No mention whatsoever.  "

We start at No. 1. Last night s ABC s World News Tonight with David Muir.BRUCE: Conservatives are outraged. Rush Limbaugh says the president  got less than nothing.  Tonight, Capitol Hill is heading for a short-term fix to keep the government open until early February. But by then, Democrats will control the House and the chances of the president getting money for his wall will be even more unlikely.RUSH: I m sorry. That wasn t David Muir. He introduced it. That s Mary Bruce. She s one of their reporterettes. So you see,  Conservatives are outraged. Rush Limbaugh says  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Here s more Mary Bruce, ABC s World News Tonight.BRUCE: The White House says the president is now willing to consider a short-term fix, but he has not yet committed to signing this. And now here on the Hill, some conservative members are launching a last-ditch effort to try and change his mind.RUSH: Right.  Oh, no! Oh, no! We ve been dancing on Trump s grave and, oh, no! There are people trying to change his mind.  That was yesterday, ABC s World News Tonight. This morning, ABC s Good Morning America, Dan Harris talking to the same infobabe, Mary Bruce. Question:  The Senate passed a stopgap spending bill to avert a government shutdown but there s a huge question hanging over all of this: Will Trump sign this bill without any extra spending for his border wall? BRUCE: Some on the right are criticizing the president for retreating. Rush Limbaugh says the president got, quote,  less than nothing  in this deal, and Fox News is declaring the president lost.MUIR: In the end, here, do we think he ll get on board with this spending bill and sign it if it doesn t include any money for the wall?BRUCE: The White House says the president is now willing to consider this short-term solution, but he has not yet committed to signing this. And here this morning on the Hill some conservative members are launching a last-ditch effort to try and change the president s mind about this. But the political reality is that there is just very little appetite here, even from the president s own party, to fund the wall right now.RUSH: Hey, Mary? There never has been an appetite from either party to fund the wall. That s why there is Donald Trump. That s it, in a nutshell. Neither party has ever had  Both parties want the borders to be open! For all intents and purposes, the majority of both parties want open borders, and they want amnesty on top of it. That s why there is Donald Trump. The guy that won the presidency! The swamp can t figure this out. They can t figure out why Trump won!They re still scratching their heads. They think the Russians might have had something to do with it, something else went wrong, the Electoral College. There s a simple reason. Donald Trump was the only guy running for political office, nationally, in 2016 who was believed when he said he was going to illegal immigration. One issue. I ll tell you something else, folks. The American people have been fighting this since the early 2000s. The American people have had no assistance.They have called, they have faxed, they have emailed, they have inundated that town on a number of occasions and they have stopped amnesty in its tracks, and the establishment is fit to be tied over it. But it is a powerful thing to realize that Donald Trump was elected president, and what was his No. 1 issue? Stopping this, shutting down illegal immigration, building a wall   which is essentially border security!Which every one of the Democrats and Republicans has always conceded (sputtering),  Well, we ll do it. We ll do amnesty, but we need border security first.  Knowing full well they re not gonna do border security!  Okay. We ve gotta do border security first, and then we ll deal with the amnesty.  They set it up that way knowing full well they re never gonna deal with it   and there isn t any, is there? What border security additions have been made?What new policies have there been? There haven t been any. They re looking for reasons why Donald Trump was elected president? Well, here you go! (chuckles) I mean, it s undeniable. They can deny it all they want, but there you have it   and if the issue goes away here, and if it s punted again to February, it s gonna be punted forever. Last night on WABC TV in New York, Channel 7 Eyeball News, the anchor Bill Ritter was talking about all of this RITTER: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced a continuing resolution today   that s to temporarily fund to federal government for the next two months. It also does not include any funding for President Trump s (pause) wall. Conservatives are outraged over this; Rush Limbaugh leading the way. If approved, the measure will provide the funding necessary to continue normal operation of government agencies through February 8th.RUSH: Yeah. If signed. Normal operations. These guys can t even sit down and do a legally required, full-fledged 12-month budget. Even when we run both houses, we can t even seem to do that. Continuing resolution here, continuing resolution there. This went up to February 8th, right before Valentine s Day. Here s Bret Baier, Fox News this morning. Bill Hemmer says,  Mark Meadows called the continuing resolution without funding for the wall a fumble. He said that if you don t do the shutdown now, then when? So he s a member of this Conservative Caucus talking to the White House urging the president to stand tough on this and to not give in. BAIER: Yeah, it s not just Mark Meadows. I mean, you have some voices that obviously the president listens to   uh, some opinion makers. Rush Limbaugh was railing against this saying he should not sign it and go to Mar-a-Lago and let the government shutdown. That is not where the administration overall is.RUSH: No, it isn t. It isn t. Trump is up against opposition wherever he turns, whatever direction he turns   except in yours, except when he looks at you, the American people. When he looks at you, the people who voted for him   when he looks at the people most profoundly affected by this   he sees support. The Washington establishment, the inside-the-Beltway crowd in Washington, however you want to characterize it or term it, honestly I ve seen enough commentary on this to know that they think all this is a joke.Five billion! They re laughing that it s so insignificant an amount of money. They literally think this is a joke. They think that people that care about this are not worth paying any attention to. It s a huge disconnect, folks. The people who are supposed to be our representatives, who are supposed to be concerned with and aware of the expressed will of the people as in votes at the ballot box  But it s not just them. It s media commentators who think that they re all on the same team inside the Beltway   and not just leftists.I mean, you ve got plenty of so-called Republican and conservative media commentators on the various cable networks, and they all are holding firm on this, and their basic belief is that it s just unserious. It s a joke, and they can t believe that so much time is being spent on this, and they get sooo excited talking about a possible government shutdown,  cause they looove conflict, apparently, and they looove being able to report that the Republicans are committing suicide.The fact is history does not show that Republicans commit suicide when blamed (fairly or unfairly) for government shuts down. You want to know why this is important? I have a story here. You know, but this is a story Strategic-Culture.org. This is a globalist website following globalist kind of news.  The United Nations Will Soon Try to Enforce Open Borders as a  Human Right,   and then they talk about a member of the German government here.His name is Markus Frohnmaier. He says he  is most disconcerted by the latest developments. Piled up on his desk, is a mountain of papers with the headers showing the logo of the United Nations.  Every MP of Europe, every MEP and even every mayor should be forced to read this,  says 27-year-old Frohnmaier, one of the youngest deputies in the Bundestag  said. The United Nations is going to attempt to enforce open borders on every member nation as a human right. Now, this story dates back to October.But I ll bet you haven t heard anything about it. But this story gives us an open window to what we are up against when it comes to having any borders whatsoever. The left is fighting like mad to eliminate the whole concept of nation states   and to do that, to further that is getting rid of the idea of borders all across the world and actually make this a global commune. Look how hard it is fighting this two-year-old vote for Britain to leave the borderless EU. What do you think the EU is? The European Union wipes out borders, creates this gigantic commune of nations that once were Europe.Every nation had its own currency, had its own language.The Brits voted to exit the EU, and they re not implementing the will of the people.They re doing everything they can to stop it and now even calling for a second vote, thinking that the people of Great Britain may have changed their minds. If they re not already, get ready, because the American left is gonna be talking about illegal immigration the same way they talk about  Uh, what s the word? I m having a mental block on the word. Uh, uh, uh. Asylum! They re gonna be talking about it as a human right. Asylum! Illegal immigration, a human right   that human beings have the right to pack up and go to the United States and nobody can stop them.That s why for many other reasons this is so important.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Grab audio sound bite No. 24. So we just heard from members of the Drive-By Media   ABC, Fox News   talking about the efforts here to reach President Trump. I don t think President Trump needs to be reached on this. He knows. What President Trump needs here is assurance that he s not alone. You can t  I replayed an interview that I did with him in August about all of this, and he openly talked about how hard this is because there isn t much support from even the Republicans.There wasn t much support the Republicans on repeal-and-replace Obamacare because back then the Republicans didn t think Trump was gonna survive the Mueller investigation. They actually believed there had been Russian collusion. They thought Trump was not long for the world; so they didn t have the guts to sign on. As time went on and they realized that it was bogus and that Trump was gonna happen survive, they began to turn around and support him on things.We got tax reform. But this is  You know, all the Republican donors, the big money is so against anything that would tighten border security, and he was talking about how hard that it is. And here s another reason. This is a Republican strategist named Kevin Madden. He was on CNN this morning. He was asked,  Is a win for the president possible here? Either he keeps the government running or gets funding for the wall. It just seems like there isn t a good situation to the president either way you cut it here. MADDEN: The White House knows that they re not gonna be able to get the funding, but have they been able to convince the president, and have they been able to convince those allies on Capitol Hill that are pressuring the president to veto this? There s a huge canyon between that reality and what the president, I think, is willing to accept. The folks up on Capitol Hill have to find a way to communicate that, uh, to this president in a way that where they can come together on a coherent strategy. They ve been entirely at odds now for the last week, and that s why we have a situation where we really don t have many good options left for Republicans   and we re sure to sort of bear the brunt of the bad headlines if there were to be a shutdown.RUSH: There you have it. That s the Washington mentality, the Republican political consultant mentality. (sobbing)  Oh, my God. We can t do this! I mean, we re gonna they re gonna have bad headlines about us are gonna blame us for the government shut.  People are worn out on this! A government shutdown never hurts anybody! It s become almost a straw dog. But, see, the White House knows they not gonna be able to get the money. Congress knows. Now they ve gotta be able to convince Trump. So the pressure on him is immense not to veto this and to go ahead and keep our precious government running.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/20/do-the-right-thing-and-be-a-hero-mr-president/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 20, 2018RUSH: Well, once again, my friends, as we open the program today, the Drive-By Media and the Washington establishment are again breathless. Breathless they are! There is an unscheduled meeting that is either starting right now or will start soon at the White House. Earlier today the Republican conference in the House of Representatives canceled their daily press conference   or their weekly press conference, however they do them   and instead they re heading up to the White House for a meeting with President Trump.So everybody is breathless here over what s going on. There was a lot of action on the floor of the House. Congressman Mark Meadows basically came out and just unloaded and said,  President Trump, veto this bill. We will have your back. We will have your back throughout the entire process.  President Trump called for a meeting with House Republicans today, and it s either happening now or imminently, very soon. A lot of people think that this is to discuss elements of the procedure of shutting down the government, vetoing the spending bill.Let s give you the details of what happened last night.  The Senate passed a continuing resolution to fund several government agencies including Justice, Commerce, Department of the Interior, and Agriculture through February 8th. This to avert a partial government shutdown,  because of course as everybody knows (sobbing),  We cannot shut down our precious government! Oh, my God. We ll die! We re gonna be so harmed politically!  The fact of the matter is, folks, the biggest government shutdown in the history of government shutdowns in terms of Washington s memory is 1995.It was the big budget battle with Newt Gingrich and the Republicans and Bill Clinton. There was a shutdown, and Clinton had arranged a deal with federal workers that they would get their Thanksgiving turkeys and money for Christmas presents if they just stuck with him. They shut down the government, and that set the stage for every government shutdown that s followed because the media coverage is,  The Republicans hate government. Republicans hate anybody that likes government! Republicans don t want government! Republicans don t want you depending on government! Republicans suck! Republicans are horrible! Republicans are mean-spirited.  So that media coverage has determined and shaped Republican thinking ever since, all the way back to 1995. But here is the down-and-dirty. In the immediate elections following   the midterm election, the presidential election following   that  95 shutdown, the Republicans were not wiped out. They were not significantly damaged.It is a myth that government shutdowns deal an insufferable blow to the parties that are blamed for it. It s a typical media myth, and it has survived since 1995. But there is no evidence that the party blamed for a government shutdown suffers tremendous electoral losses in the future. There s another aspect of this that needs to be mentioned, and I ve made this analogy two or three times; I m gonna make it again. I beg your indulgence. All of my lifetime, the Democrat Party accused Republicans of wanting to cut Social Security, of wanting to kick senior citizens out of their homes   and, at first, it worked.Senior citizens can t take the chance that that might be right. So they voted Democrat on the belief that the Democrats were not gonna take anything away, that the Democrats were not gonna kick  em out of their homes. But the Republicans hate everybody, see?  The Republicans hate seasoned seasons! Republicans hate their own mothers and fathers. Republicans hate their own grandparents and want to see them kicked out of their homes   and then their water poisoned and then their air made unable to breathe.  People can t take the chance. So seasoned citizens voted Democrat.But after a while  Democrats kept every election making the same charge. But after awhile, seasoned citizens began to say,  Wait a minute. They keep saying this, and it never happens. My Social Security has not been taken away, and I haven t been kicked out of my home. And, by the way, I haven t even seen a serious effort to take my Social Security away.  So eventually the Democrat threat became diluted and watered down, and people stopped panicking every time the allegation was made. That s where we are right now with this government shutdown business.The Democrats have been crying wolf about government shutdowns since 1995. There have been plenty of them. There s a government shutdown when there s a half-inch of snow in that town. The government shuts down many times a year that we re not even told about. They re procedural and they re formal. Because there s no politics attached to  em, nobody ever talks about it. Bbut the federal government has elements of it that shut down constantly. But even these shutdowns that occur because of political action, nothing hands!Life goes on! Nobody dies! Nobody doesn t get their check. Nobody is unable to get their food stamps and use them. Nobody who is dependent on government suffers! There might be an occasional thing (and CNN ballyhoos it) where the sleigh ride concessionaire in Yellowstone National Park may shut down. So CNN goes out there and talks to this guy. That s it! The sleigh ride concession. But in terms of the government shutdown literally harming people, it doesn t! There was polling data earlier this week from the AP documenting that people are getting tired, they re getting worn out, of all of the assaults on Trump.Their emotional reservoirs are empty. They re getting tired of it. They don t react to it as they used to. They kind of greet it with a ho-hum. It s just more of the same. Nothing ever happens with all of these apocalyptic predictions. The world doesn t end. People don t die. People don t starve. In fact, what happens is more of the same that people oppose. So the weapon of accusing Republicans of wanting to shut the government down used to be a very powerful one. It s kind of diluted now and watered down.The frustration is that the Republicans in Washington still think it s 1995! Even in 1995, I need to point out again, it did not hurt them electorally! At the next election, it did not hurt them. Now you talk about the reasons for a shutdown, and we re not even really talking about a shutdown here. We re talking about a veto of a spending bill that does not contain even a measly $5 billion for border security. When you hear the term  wall,  you need to substitute in your mind  border security,  because that s the debate.The media and the Democrats would love you to think that it s strictly about a wall   concrete, steel slats. It s about border security and the fact that the Democrats do not care a whit about it because they want open borders. And, sadly, some Republicans do too for their own reasons. We have a federal budget in excess of $4 trillion and a rounding error of $5 billion can t be found for border security. It s very clear: They don t want it. The problem is, Donald Trump does. Donald Trump promised it and Donald Trump is already fit to be tied.If you go back to April of 2017, we ve been here! I went back to my own transcripts, my own show archives from 2017. Let me read to you what I said on April 25, 2017. Quote me:  I m not happy to have to pass this on. I m very, very troubled to have to pass this on. And I want to say at the outset that I hope my interpretation is wrong, and I hope this is not the case. But it looks like, from here, right here, right now, it looks like President Trump is caving on his demand for a measly $1 billion in the budget for his wall on the border with Mexico. It was $1billion in 2017.  The Democrats are threatening a government shutdown. It s the same day old, same old, and I was hoping that Trump would throw this shutdown thing right back in their face and have everyone realize they re the ones engineering these shutdowns that nobody would notice anyway unless a big hullabaloo was made about it.  By the way, that s important thing. If they shut the government down and nobody told you, you wouldn t even know it, folks, because it happens all the time. Now, back to me.Again, April 25, 2017:  The Democrats seem to have successfully used this stupid, silly threat of a government shutdown to get their way. What Trump is saying is if we need to get this done, then I ll delay the spending on the wall until September. And it s just a measly billion dollars.  It was a billion dollars just a year and a half ago.  But the problem here, folks, is one of politics. If this happens, if Trump does cave   and I use the word  cave  guardedly. Trump, I m sure, does not ever think he caves on anything. But outward appearances are what they are. And the bottom line is that if he is willing to withdraw a demand of his for a measly billion dollars for the wall because the Democrats are threatening a shutdown, then the Democrats will have just learned that this threat works on Trump, too, not just all the other Republicans,  and guess where we are? Eminently predictable!We are right back where we have been. This is like the third or fourth time a spending bill, temporary spending bill, is threatened by a shutdown. Trump knows his history. A tweet:  When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership.   It didn t happen!  Trump knows. He s been promised this twice, folks. For agreeing to previous spending bills, he has been promised twice that the next one would contain what he wants for border security.It doesn t. Last night, the Senate passed their continuing resolution to fund several government agencies through the 8th of February to avert  a precious and partial  government shutdown.  But the Senate did not include any money for the wall or securing the border or for border security. The senators passed this CR by a voice vote so that nobody s vote would be on record. A voice vote! This continuing resolution will push the next shutdown showdown to right before what? Valentine s Day.In February (sobbing),  Are we gonna throw federal workers out right before Valentine s Day? Oh, my gosh! Are we heartless? We can t throw federal workers out of their jobs right before Valentine s Day. They won t get their flower deliveries. We can t!  It s the same thing. Folks, this is a game. It is fake. It is being replayed. The thing that I worry about is what I call the Nixon Syndrome. Richard Nixon was in a similar position with the media and the left during his presidency, and Nixon thought that he could buy his way out of it.He thought he could buy their support or buy their love or that he could purchase an end to their criticism. (chuckles) So what did he give  em? He gave  em brand-new government agencies like the EPA, and he gave them OSHA! He expanded the federal government like it hadn t been expanded before! And it didn t stop a syllable of hate or criticism for Richard Nixon! By the same token, Donald Trump cannot buy their love. He cannot buy their acceptance. He shouldn t want it! He shouldn t care about being accepted by the people who are trying to destroy him.It s not the way out of this. There s a fascinating piece by my old buddy Conrad Black at National Review today, and his point is the Democrats don t know it, but they re making fools of themselves, and they are losing each and every day they push every one of these spectacles against Trump. I ll share it with you as the program unfolds. But this is not just about a campaign promise, although it is. It is about the American way of life. It is about Donald Trump s instinctive understanding of what is right and wrong in America.It s about the fact that he acknowledged and got elected on the basis that he understands the importance of border security. This constant flow of a permanent underclass for the Democrat Party has got to stop, because if it doesn t, the America that was founded will eventually cease to exist   which happens to be the objective of the American left. Which is a socialist-based   socialist-and-worse based   movement. It is demonstrable that vetoing this and would be one of the most tremendous and heroic things.Donald Trump does not know the esteem with which he will be held if he follows through on this veto. Because, folks, forget February 8th. January 4th. This is it. Pelosi s already out dancing, singing and so forth. She was caught in a place dispenses adult beverages last night dancing up a storm, already celebrating the fact that there will not be a wall. Pelosi is celebrating that there will not be border security. Pelosi is celebrating that Donald Trump folded after that White House meeting with Chuck and Nancy where he made it plain he would gladly be the architect of a government shutdown.They think they ve made Trump cave. They re happy as they can be. They re already singing and dancing in celebration, and this is before they even get official control of the House of Representatives. This isn t complicated. A government shutdown happens frequently. They don t harm anybody. The biggest threat is what the media is gonna say   and Mr. President, the media s gonna say what they say about you no matter what you do. You may as well do the right thing and make the criticism legitimate.By  legitimate,  I mean legitimately angry at you because you did the right thing. Not fake criticism just  cause they hate you. So veto this thing and then head down to Mar-a-Lago. I will meet you on the first tee wherever you want to play golf, whenever, and this will end up being resolved in your favor. Oh, they ll huff and puff, and the Democrats will try to make it look like this is never gonna get solved and we will be treated to any ending media stories about lives lost and damage done because of a government shutdown.But at some point, you have to make a stand. It s $5 billion in a $4 trillion budget. Mr. President, they are mocking you, members of Congress. Not including a penny for border security is a direct challenge to you. The budget is $4 trillion, and they can t find five billion? These are natural power fights that occur between the three branches of government, by the way. They re normal and they re natural. Everybody is fighting for as much power as they can get, both individually and institutionally.  "

He doesn t care. He s gonna become a dictator!  Dictator? I don t know what Trump is thinking about. I ll tell you what he ought to do, my humble opinion. I just saw on Fox everybody s breathless.

Thank you for all the information to keep me informed.RUSH: (chuckles) You re welcome, sir. Thank you. It used to be,  Thanks for all the great work.  Now it is,  Thanks for the information.  That s a trend in the wrong direction.CALLER: Well  You know, this thing with the $10.6 billion that Congress has allocated towards Central America but yet they can t find $5 billion to give the American people for border security, there s no way  I don t know if that s a law. I heard you say Trump didn t have to sign that, but he s put in a box. If he does not  I don t know if it s veto this funding bill that s coming to his desk   and he does not veto that   and he signs it, he loses. The only winning move he has is to veto this bill and shut it down and say,  Look, if you give Central America 10.6, I want five.  He ll win all day   and I agree with you. Get on the plane. Go play golf. Get your swing in order and play golf for a week.RUSH: Right! What are they gonna do, impeach him?CALLER: Right.RUSH: How much worse can it get? The Republicans already lost the House. There s no salvation there. I mean, what else is there here? Grab audio sound bite No. 1. Can I get away with playing No. 1 without No. 2? Yes, I can. Let s go back to August 1st, 2018, had Trump on the program talking about the shutdown and when it should happen, when it would be most advantageous. Here we go BEGIN ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Here you are suggesting that you d be willing to maybe   you d talk about   shutting down the government if that s what it took to get this wall built.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.RUSH: Now the traditional Republican says,  Oh, no! No! Don t say that!  There you are saying,  Oh, yeah. I ll be glad to do it if that s what it takes. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I actually think it would be positive.   It s like pulling teeth, though. Getting these guys to get it done is  You have no idea how tough I ve been. I say,  Hey, if you have a shutdown, you have a shutdown.  Now, the shutdown could also take place after the election. I happen to think it s a great political thing, because people want border security.   One way or the other, it s getting done. But I d be willing to do it. And you could do it before the election or after the election.RUSH: Well, speaking of before, as a campaign issue, I saw a couple consultants say  I don t need to mention their names. They re Washington, D.C., professionals.THE PRESIDENT: Right.RUSH: They said that you need to drop this immigration stuff, Mr. President. You re cruising for defeat if you base the midterms on this.THE PRESIDENT: I know. I ve heard that. (chuckles)RUSH: You need to pivot back onto the economy, start telling people what a great economy that we have,  cause that s the only way the Republicans can have a chance of holding the House in the midterms. What do you think about that advice?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I ve heard them. Probably different people than you, but I ve heard a lot of people saying,  Oh, don t do it before the election, you ll upset the applecart,  and  You know, because we are doing so well economically   But I happen to think that border security would be a good thing before the election, but there are many people within our party   that are good people that are like you that agree with you on everything you say. But they d rather do it after. They don t agree on doing it before, and I accept their opinion, but I happen to think it would be a good thing to do before. I actually think we d get more and there d be more pressure on the other side, because we re doing it because the Democrats are not giving us the votes.RUSH: I think immigration is the largest reason you got elected, your consistency on that.THE PRESIDENT: Uh huh.RUSH: I mean, it reverberates all across the country. There are people that the media, the inside-the-Beltway denizens are never gonna understand about this issue that you do. You ve just articulated it, and you have articulated the thinking of what I think is a vast majority of people in this country. It d be silly for you to abandon this issue now, going into the midterms.THE PRESIDENT: Well, if you do it before, there s a lot more pressure to get a great solution. But it s riskier. If you do it afterwards, there s less pressure; there s less risk. I m just not sure you d make as good a deal.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: You notice what happens? We can never do it now!

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/12/the-swamp-doesnt-get-what-trump-did-with-chuck-and-nancy/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 12, 2018RUSH: So the Drive-By Media and others continue to debate the Oval Office meeting yesterday between Chuck and Nancy. They re becoming a couple. Chuck and Nancy went to the Oval Office, Chuck and Nancy did this, Chuck and Nancy over there, Chuck and Nancy here. And of course the Drive-Bys think that Chuck and Nancy just hit a grand-slam home run. And many of the Never Trumpers think that Trump just made the biggest mistake in the world by claiming that he would own a shutdown if it ever happened.
And that one example I think serves to illustrate one of the things that we are all up against here and have been for I don t know how long. The Republican Party and the so-called conservative movement in Washington thinks exactly and identically the way the people who run that town think. And that would be the Democrats, the media, the American left. And one of the tenets of official Washington, one of the inviolate beliefs is that if there s a government shutdown, the Republicans are gonna get the blame, no matter what.And so you never want a government shutdown, because the Republicans are gonna get the blame. So what happens? Well, you never shut down the government, which means Democrats win every budget fight. Because the Republicans have made a calculation.  We would really get creamed if the government shuts down. We would get blamed for not caring about the poor and the downtrodden and the thirsty. And so we ll fix this budget stuff, we ll kick the can down the road and we ll get  em at the next budget fight. And the same thing happens, threatened shut down, the Republicans shudder in fear,  Ah, ah, shut down, oh, no, no, no, no, no, we don t want any part.  And Democrats win every budget battle. And that leads to groupthink that says government shutdown equals death for Republicans, therefor never, ever shut down the government. No matter what else happens, don t do it.So Donald Trump, who s not a citizen of the swamp, he s not a denizen of the swamp, understands that there are crucially important things that are happening that are threatening our country in a lot of ways. One of them is illegal immigration. It s got to stop. He has promised a number of things to try to stop it. Among them, building a wall.So they have the meeting yet the Oval Office yesterday and Trump says,  You know what? The American people are with me on this. We ve gotta stop this. I was elected because of this. We ve gotta get a handle on it. We re gonna build a wall. If you shut down the government, I ll gladly own it.  And the Republicans,  Oh, my God.  Get  em the vapors.And so the Washington intelligentsia thinks that Trump stepped in it. They think that Trump committed the biggest faux pas that is possible for a Republican to commit, and in their world this is why Donald Trump is just flat-out stupid. You never, ever advocate for a shutdown and you never, as a Republican, claim that you ll take the blame for it or own it. And that is what you ll hear from any and every Republican inside the Beltway that lives in Washington.And I m just telling you that way of thinking equals perpetual, never ending budget fight defeat. It s what it has always meant. We now have a president willing to stand up to it to try to win these budget battles for the good of the people of this country and at the same time accomplish something that s necessary, and that s stop massive illegal immigration. And if it takes a government shutdown to do it, then that s what Trump is gonna do, it s what he was elected to do.I told you he s got nothing to lose here! He has now the Democrats running the House   I would suggest to you Trump does well. Look, when he was running for the Republican nomination, he had 16 opponents. He vanquished them all. He had the media; he vanquished them. Now he s up against the Democrats and constantly the media. I think Trump is gonna shine in these next two years. At least he has the potential to based on his track record. These are circumstances where he does shine.And he continues to take advantage of a really great opportunity, and that is to continue to demonstrate that he is not of Washington, that he is not of the swamp, that he is a different breed, which is what people perennially say they want election after election. Somebody that s not an ingrained insider.So what actually happened yesterday? When these debates between Democrats and Republicans actually happen on live television, whether they happen in the Trump cabinet meeting or a meeting with congressional leaders that the cameras were allowed to stay, or yesterday in the Oval Office with Chuck and Nancy, when these debates on policy happen live and unedited and people are allowed to see them, we re always gonna win! And the reason is our ideas are going to trump   no pun intended.They never want to debate us on ideas. That s why we re racist, sexist, bigot, homophobes. That s how they try to discredit us. They never engage us on ideas. When Trump keeps the cameras in there, guess what? They got no choice. What s the first thing they did?  We gotta close down the cameras, Mr. President. We need to have these negotiations go on in private. We need to get the media outta here. Wait a minute, the media is your big buddies. Why do you not want them there? The reason they don t want them there is because they don t want the people to see how they actually operate and what they really believe. They can talk about Trump stepping in it by owning a government shutdown. What did Chuck and Nancy do? Chuck and Nancy stepped in and owned the idea that they don t care about border security! They were made to look like that is not a concern to them. You tell me how Trump loses that.The debate that Trump had with the Democrat leaders in the Oval Office is a great example. The Democrats were so uncomfortable. Chuck Schumer, there s a picture, there s a picture, Trump is talking to Schumer   it s a still shot   Trump is talking to Schumer, Schumer is looking at his lap. I have the perfect caption.  Where are my gonads?  Schumer is asking. That s what this looks like. So uncomfortable.They can t support their positions with fact or common sense. They can only win these events when there s no coverage and then they walk out to the cameras and microphones and start spinning what happened with media total support. In other words, they have to go out and misrepresent what happened in there like Pelosi did. She left and went up to Capitol Hill. (imitating Pelosi)  I felt like the mom. I felt like I was dealing with a child. I felt like I was in a tinkle contest. You never want to get in a tinkle contest with a skunk. So she calls Trump a skunk and said they got in a tinkle contest, said that she had to act like the mother. And then she started questioning Trump s manhood. (imitating Pelosi)  Yeah, that was just a tinkle contest to show his manhood. Manhood from this guy?  That s what she was reduced to, not debating Trump on the issue, not rejecting Trump on his idea of a wall. She had to go out there and start personally insulting Trump, and Schumer does the same stuff.These things ought to happen more and more is my point. All of these debates, as many of them as possible should happen live on television. And I don t mean like they happen in Congress because there you have formal rules where,  The gentleman yield for two hours?  Yes, the gentleman will yield. A bunch of pablum and blather going on for two hours, tune out  cause they get so boring. But these things like Trump does in the Cabinet Room or in the Oval Office yesterday, Democrats don t want any part of that. And the proof is Pelosi walking out of there and trying to recast what happened in terms of Trump being a bumbling fool.But that doesn t work on people who saw it. Believe me, everybody that watches cable news or any news saw it because the Drive-Bys couldn t help themselves. They kept playing it over and over again because they think Trump committed this great, gigantic faux pas by claiming to support a shutdown and then saying that he would own it. But the Democrats need these things to happen in private, they then go out the phalanx of cameras and microphones where they lie and spin what happened. The media starts carrying their water.More of what happened yesterday, as much of it as we can get issue after issue after issue. Here s a classic example too. Now, this is a story from TheHill.com. Wait a minute. It isn t The Hill, but it s about a Los Angeles Times reporter whose name is Eli Stokols and the story is that Los Angeles Times White House correspondent Eli Stokals s reported yesterday that Donald Trump stormed out of the Oval Office after his contentious meeting with Chuck and Nancy and then threw a folder full of papers out of frustration.He was on Hardball last night, PMSNBC. He stormed out of the oval, he walked into an anteroom just off the oval, he had in his hand a folder of briefing papers, just scattered them out of frustration, threw them across the room. He was citing his own reporting, which means nobody else saw what he claims to have seen. He said Trump was frustrated with Schumer following the meeting. He felt that Schumer got the best of him in the meeting. And he refers to Schumer as Trump s old New York sparring buddy.I don t think Trump would ever consider Schumer to be an old New York sparring buddy or any other kind of buddy. They ve had very little to do with each other before Trump s election. But there s no evidence. This is what the Democrats have constantly relied on. There s nobody else that reported this. There is nobody else that can confirm this, that Trump thought he had been beaten by Schumer and got so mad he starts throwing briefing papers all over the anteroom in the Oval Office?This is what the media does for the Democrats. This is what and why the Democrats do not want any of these things happening live. And then Pelosi, of course, minutes after the, quote, unquote, public showdown went back to the capital, started railing against Trump in a private meeting with her colleagues. If it s private, why do we know about it? If Pelosi had a private meeting with her colleagues, why do we know about it? We know about it because it wasn t private. It was intended to be leaked to the media.She said Trump must have said the word  wall  30 times. I was trying to be the mom, but it just goes to show you, you get into tinkle contest with a skunk and you get tinkle all over you. She said it s like a manhood thing with him, as if manhood can be associated with him. This wall thing, this wall thing, is just tinkle stuff, is just manhood stuff. They wanted it out. Not one word on the substance. Not one word on the substance of what Trump wants to do to stop illegal immigration.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Upstate New York. William. Great to have you, sir. You re first today. Hi.CALLER: Hi. Mega dittos from upstate New York. Hey, Rush, I was listening about the Republican intelligentsia, you know, and how they responded to what Trump did with the press conference, I guess you could call it, in the Oval Office. But I think Lindsey Graham made a difference. His comments on Sunday morning talk shows about how to stand up like that. I think it s important because I think there could be a little bit of a shift between the thinking, especially possibly in the Senate and the House.And, you know, I think we first saw that with the Kavanaugh hearings and we re hearing it now. And I think it s important considering Lindsey Graham s past positions on amnesty. And I think under Trump they possibly   and we may not be seeing yet   really uniting behind him and so forth, contrary to what the media and everybody is telling us. And considering us to not listen to this the way the academic class and the consultant class have been doing and just look at the responses, you know, in terms of where Trump wins the election, how he fought back in the Kavanaugh hearings. And I think there will be much more emphasis on people like us than on the consultants.RUSH: I guess I ll chalk this to my hearing. I m not sure what your point is. You started to talk about Lindsey Graham. Lindsey Graham supporting Trump means what, do you think?CALLER: Well, I think because he was out there Sunday more of an amnesty guy saying on I think it was Face the Nation and on Fox News Sunday how he said Trump, you better shut down this wall, and that was such a bizarre position for him historically. And I think over the last 48 hours that because he was getting that support from Lindsey Graham as well as other establishment Republicans possibly behind the scenes and I ve heard some strong talk from other senators like (unintelligible) et cetera, that it s possible that this has been a setup and that they re more solicited, the establishment class, behind Trump than we re led to believe. And I was wondering  RUSH: Ah. You mean Republicans in the Senate are more aligned behind Trump than we may know?CALLER: Yes. And I think the shift by people like Lindsey Graham and what he was saying was a prelude for what happened yesterday in the Oval Office, more of a united front, shall we say.RUSH: Okay. All right. I got it. So you think Trump was emboldened to stand up for the wall and a shutdown, to claim credit, because Lindsey Graham was on TV supporting him on Sunday, which you think means that there may be some more behind the scenes unity for Trump among the Republican Party than is known. Well, it could be. One thing about Lindsey Graham, he has become a full-fledged Trumpist in the aftermath of the passing of Senator McCain. That has been noted.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Couple of headlines.  Poll: Americans Want Trump to Compromise on Border Wall to Avoid Shutdown.  That s NPR.  Poll: Nearly Two in Three Trump Voters Support Government Shutdown for Border Wall.  The first one s NPR. And it s predictable. We always get polling data right after an event like this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: That s right. It always happens. The Drive-By Media produce a poll that shows the American people want exactly what the media and the Democratic Party want, after an event like happened yesterday in the Oval Office. So Trump takes Chuck and Nancy to school, we immediately the next day get a poll showing a majority of the American people agree with Chuck and Nancy.You can make book on it! And it s why I claim these people are not news, they re not journalists, and they re not engaged in trying to tell us what we don t know, what we didn t know what happened when they were there and saw it then report it to us. They re activists. And they are working to advance the anti-Trump agenda, the Democrat agenda.And here we have a new poll from NPR/PBS/Marist that claims that 57% of Americans say that Trump should compromise on the wall to avoid a government shutdown rather than stand firm.Now, can you imagine the questions that were on the poll to get this answer?  Do you agree with the president that the government should be shut down, jeopardizing Social Security checks, unemployment checks, food stamps, and the free flow of water from your faucet? Or do you think the government should remain open and you should be able to eat and get to and from work and have Christmas? What the hell are people gonna say? I mean, I don t know that those were the questions, but I can guarantee you that they re pretty close to that. The director of the Marist poll claims that the wall is only important to Trump s base, not to Democrats and independents. So what? Trump s base won the election. Donald Trump won the election on the strength of his base. So the Democrats and independents oppose it? BFD! So what?Well, I ll tell you so what. When Democrats don t want something, why, it shouldn t happen, because what Democrats are just is. What Democrats are is just normal. And everything else is extremist wackos. The Marist director also claims that everybody agrees they don t want gridlock or a government shutdown. Bohunk! I can tell you right now that a lot of people on our side like gridlock if it stops the left. If it stops the growth of government, if it stops the encroachment on liberty and freedom.But it s funny because remember last January when Chuck and Nancy shut down the government for three days over DACA, we never heard anything about how people opposed gridlock. We didn t hear anything about you how people oppose government shutdown when Chuck and Nancy did it for three days over DACA. It was the Schumer shutdown.So as President Trump continues to threaten to potentially shut down the government over his border wall, Americans would prefer to see him compromise to prevent gridlock, according to NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll by a 21-point margin. Sorry if I don t buy it. It s too camp. It s too predictable. It is too usual.But there s another poll, ladies and gentlemen. Breitbart reported it. What s the polling unit? Well, it doesn t say here, but nearly two and three supporters of President Trump and Republican voters say they support shutting down the federal government in order to secure full funding on a border wall for the United States Mexico   oh, it s a Marist poll   what? What? The NPR poll is a Marist poll. The latest Marist poll reveals 65% of Trump supporters, 65% of Republican voters say the president should not compromise on the wall even if it means a shutdown. See, that s the point! Build the wall! And if there s a government shutdown along the way, fine, build the wall!The government shutdown is not the objective. Building the wall is! The media turns it around,  Are you in favor of a government shutdown denying people Social Security checks, welfare checks, food stamps.  None of which happens, by the way. So it s just predictable after a meeting like yesterday s where Chuck and Nancy kind of had it taken to  em. Right there is NPR, PBS with a poll showing by a 21-point margin people don t want Trump to succeed.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  So we have all this polling data we re being told here, majority of Americans don t want a wall.  Does anybody remember the polling data that a majority of Americans didn t want Obamacare once we learned how much it was gonna cost and how much it was going to deprive us. Does anybody remember the media caring that the American people opposed Obamacare?  Does anybody remember that Jeremiah Wright said, Reverend Wright said that Obama offered him $250,000 during the campaign to shut up.  Reverend Wright said it.  Obama, 250 grand, a quarter of a million dollars to shut up.  Why is that not a campaign contribution?  Why wasn t it?  Well, we all know the answer.  Obama s Steph Curry.  Impossible to say stupid things, impossible to do wrong things, impossible to be an idiot or unethical.    "

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/28/what-happened-to-all-the-shutdown-suffering/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 28, 2019RUSH:  White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney says President Donald Trump is willing to give Democrats  a chance  to stand up for a border wall. But he warns that Trump will get the wall  one way or another.   It s better   to get it through legislation. That s the right way to do it, but at the end of the day, the president is going to secure the border one way or another,  Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday. He was adamant that this was gonna happen one way or the other. I know they don t want to pull the trigger on the national emergency, folks. I know they don t want to do it, and there s a political reason why. Once they pull the trigger on the national emergency, this thing is brought to a screeching halt. I mean, you re gonna have the left run off to court. You re gonna get a judge to issue a stay of execution stopping this thing in its tracks.That will begin a court fight and a court battle. I suggested to  em  I said,  You know what you guys ought to do if you re gonna do this? Have your own lawyer beat the left to court! Find a friendly circuit, go in there, and find a judge to pronounce it okay despite what the left does. Just be first with it and see what happens.  But it s more than that. The politics of this  When he declares a national emergency, you know what the news becomes then?Bye-bye, any discussion of the wall and of border security, the whole thing. The media s focus, the narrative every day is going to be on Trump the dictator, Trump the totalitarian, Trump acting outside the Constitution and so forth   and I know that Trump  When Mulvaney says they want to do this through legislation, the reason for that is they d love to find the illusive bipartisan support for this so that the nation could be seen expressing a unified opinion about it.Pelosi is never gonna let that happen. Pelosi isn t going to let the House, anybody in the House have anything to do with Trump winning anything. Pure and simple. So whatever tricks Mulvaney and crowd have up their sleeve, it s gonna have to be something oriented around a way of defeating Pelosi. We ll see what they ve got. In the meantime, back to the phones. We have  It s either Delia or Delia. I m not sure how you pronounce it. She s 13 years old. How do you pronounce your name?CALLER: It s Delia.RUSH: Delia. And you re from Strongsville, Ohio, right?CALLER: Yes.RUSH: Well, I m glad you called. 13 years old. Great to have you in the audience, Delia. Thank you very much.CALLER: Of course. So I wanted to ask you if you think that government shutdowns are necessary. Now, we had this debate in the eighth grade, I think, two weeks ago, and I was on the side that said it is necessary. Our side had three people, and it s a class of 18. So I was defending my point of view. And I think it s necessary because President Trump ran on border security, he became president on border security, and he s finally trying to build a wall. And that s how he was gonna use the government shutdown, to try to get a budget for the wall. And my classmates didn t agree with me. But I ended up winning the debate for my team.RUSH: Well, what do you think ? I know you ve got the issue there that you like, building the wall and Trump s support for it. But what do you think, in general   and did your class debate just the concept of the government shutting down, be it for this or for any other reason? Did your teacher lead a discussion about it? Did your group discuss that at all, just in and of itself?CALLER: Well, the other side of the debate that said it was unnecessary kept bringing up the fact that 800,000 federal employees aren t getting their paychecks, and they never really debated, but said government shutdowns in general are unnecessary. But I made the point that border security is essential for our country, and even though there are negatives that come out of that, there are still one big positive that could possibly overshadow everything else.RUSH: So you were on the side with three supporters. You were up against 15 people who opposed you. The reason I asked you about just the government shutdown in general is because what I hear you saying is that you basically were supportive of the shutdown as a tool to accomplish something you think is very important: Securing the border.CALLER: Yes. Correct.RUSH: But yet look at what you say that your opponents argued:  Oh, we can t shut down the government! That s 800,000 people without paychecks,  and so forth. So to them, it had nothing to do with your border issue. It had to do with the fact that people were suffering because they weren t being paid, and that s why the government need to reopen. As a lifelong conservative, Delia, I think that our people have become   and it s been a slow process.But our people have become conditioned to think that life in America isn t livable or isn t normal unless the government is open and operating and running every day. I think more people ought to realize that the less government they would have to deal with, the better off everybody would be. And so a government shutdown, to me, is an opportunity to illustrate this. And look at what happened.We had a government shutdown   and for the first three weeks, everything was fine, and the media got in gear and started focusing on the negatives, which people react to. And then what really caused this shutdown to end? What do you think? There s no wrong answer. Just asking. What do you think was the straw that broke the camel s back here that forced the president to have to end it?CALLER: Well, that s a really complex answer and a question, because Pelosi and  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were going around, and they were saying,  Oh, God bless Nancy. Nancy was the reason that the government shutdown ended. She carried the entire Democratic Party,  and it s not true. It was the president deciding that, saying they re gonna have to talk about this. Whether it s you running the country, as the media s saying   which you re not   President Trump was the bigger person and decided that until February 15th, if they can t resolved their issues with the border wall (garbled).RUSH: Well, look, that points out something. You re right. Democrats, as usual   and get used to this, Delia, as you continue to pay attention to the news as you get older. The Democrats are totally blameless in this, and yet you could intellectually make the case that they re the ones that shut the government down. Because every one of these Democrats that wanted no part of a wall or even $5 billion from a wall, had as recently as six years ago and nine years ago authorized the wall, and they had authorized 10 times this amount of money to build the wall! Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi had all come out in favor of it. So Trump, in this go round, wants $5 billion to sign a continuing resolution to keep a $4 trillion government up and running.And the Democrats said no to five billion dollars   it s a rounding error in the budget. And they said  no  simply to prevent Trump having a victory, even if they agree with him on the wall, even if they were to agree with him in part on border security, they re not going to let him have the win. They re looking at 2020 and defeating him, of course, and this is where politics rears its head.But the answer to the question   maybe I should leave it open so those of you on the phones can take a stab at answering it. What was the straw that broke the camel s back that convinced the   and I m not talking about maybe he had some staffers in there ill advising him, I don t doubt that was going on. Folks, look. Let me mention this as a caveat. And, Delia, thank you so much for the call. You keep doing what you are doing. You re awesome.There s no doubt in my mind that even within Trump s staff, the White House, the West Wing, there are people advising him on things against his will. I don t want to mention any names, but there are a lot of people who are looking at how all this affects them long after the Trump presidency. Their careers, their social status. There s all kinds of interest in this beyond the issue.You got all kinds of people advising Trump who don t want to be part of any organization that shut down the government to build a wall, because they don t want it on their resume, for example. And the president has to resist some of this, and I m sure some of this advice comes from people he trusts. But there had to be something, one thing or two things that caused the administration or the president to finally pull the plug on this and to order the government open so that people could get paid. I just wonder what you think it is.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, when I asked the question, what was it? What was the straw that broke the camel s back that caused the shutdown to end? Let me ask you some questions as I hint at you the answer. Have you noticed today, did you notice on Sunday, did you even notice on Saturday, there are no delays at the LaGuardia, there are no delays at JFK, there are no delays at Newark, there are no delays at Reagan National, there are no delays at LAX, there are no delays at Chicago O Hare except maybe if everything s frozen. No delays anywhere!Have you noticed that the IRS has said it s gonna take them, however, a year to rebound from this 30-day shutdown, and it may mean a longer delay in you getting your refund? And they said that before the shutdown. Yeah, they said, if this goes on it s setting us back, and our time to recover from this is getting longer and longer. Now they re saying it may take  em a year. But at LaGuardia, Reagan National, JFK, Newark, why, everything s on time. I mean, it s normal.Have you noticed that all of the soup lines for federal employees are shut down? I mean, free food s free food. Why shut down the soup lines? Did you notice there were no stories of soup lines on Saturday, no stories of soup lines on Sunday, certainly no stories of soup lines today. We have had no stories of,  Even though the government has reopened, the president is remaining an obstacle here by refusing to sign   Whatever they want to report the president not being cooperative with the federal government. You haven t seen any of that, right?Have you noticed that nobody needs a loan, no federal employee needs to call Wilbur Ross to borrow money? Have you noticed that all of the suffering, all of the misery, all of the disastrous results from 30 days of the government shutdown is gone? There are no lingering after effects of all of the suffering and all of the delays and all of the hunger. Those government checks sure must clear fast. He-he-he-he-he. Right?The back pay of the missing check and then the second check. Why, they must have cleared on Saturday. You notice that the Coast Guard is back up patrolling the coast? Have you noticed how fast   except at the IRS, there seems to be a problem there. So, yes, yes, yes. That s exactly what I am saying. A bunch of artificial, made-for-TV suffering and some legitimate,  I m not going to work. I hate Trump.  Various employees gave the news media everything they needed.  "

ive-Bys are gonna portray this as a total failure for Trump, that Democrats got exactly what they wanted.  Trump shut down the government; he got all the blame in the polling data. He didn t get anything he wanted. He got no wall, he got no money for the wall, he is forced to reopen it! Federal workers got repaid.  Democrats are gonna be able to say, along with their media buddies, that Trump caved because he knew he couldn t beat the Democrats  cause he knew it was not good to shut down the government, blah, blah, blah.I just want to prep you for what you re gonna hear. Steel your spine for it. Here s Wendy in Pittsburgh as we hit the phones. Great to have you. Hi.CALLER: Hi I, Rush. I just want to say that I thought I heard a wonderful State of the Union dress just now from the president. He mentioned   let s see   this wonderful country of ours, our wonderful federal workers. We have a great economy. You know, all the superlatives he uses: The greatest, the best. Jobs are up. He detailed all that and about how great the wall is going to be once it s built, and he went into the long explanation of why we need that wall. He also talked about money we need to help all the people who are suffering, you know, from the crime   and even the people that are being trafficked over the border. He even mentioned make  Make America Great Again,  which I think helps those poor Covington kids. So I thought it was a real great State of the Union Address.RUSH: Do you expect to see it portrayed that way in other sectors of the media? Do you think other people will see it that way as well?CALLER: (chuckles) I don t think the media   you know, the leftist media   is going to portray it that way. But I think if people were really listening to it and listening to what he was saying, you really can t miss it. I think he outsmarted them. (chuckles) I really do.RUSH: Interesting take.CALLER: Everybody was listening! You know, everybody was listening. You know,  Oh, the president s going to speak!  Even the media,  Oh, the president s coming on! He s gonna cave,  and so everybody, you know  RUSH: Well, they didn t hear anything the way you heard it. Look, all they heard was the cave. In media world, let me tell you what s happened, in media world what s happened, exactly what s happened. Trump shuts down government. Federal workers don t get paid. They experience hardships. It s either can t buy diapers, can t buy tampons or medicine for the kids. They re starving. The Trump commerce secretary says,  Don t worry. Get loans! All you have to do is pay back the interest. Then we get news that TSA is not staffed up as airports so there s slowdowns at Dulles, at LaGuardia, and elsewhere. Meanwhile, there s no money for the wall. The Democrats are not offering a dime. They re not moving one inch to end the shutdown so Trump ends the shutdown. Media s saying,  The Democrats got everything they want! They got Trump to hurt himself in the polls, they got Trump blamed in the media for the shutdown, and they got no money for the wall in order to reopen the government. So your take on this, which is I think a common take that Trump supporters are gonna have  The media didn t hear this the way you heard it. They re not interested in hearing it the way. The media doesn t think there s a problem on the border. It s all being the made up. There s no crisis. The Republican Never-Trumpers in Washington don t think there s trouble on the border. They don t think there s a crisis. They don t think there s any reason to shut down the government. There s no reason for emergency legislation. There s nothing, everything s fine.All this crisis stuff just made up. As far as the media is concern, the only take on this is,  How can we harm and damage Trump the most?  They don t care about circumstances on the border. They don t care about human trafficking. They don t care about the drug problem. They don t care about the inherent criminal problem. They don t care about the damage to the country. They don t care about any of that! Trump could say this to them for five days in a row; it wouldn t permeate. They re not interested.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Well, the president made an attempt to sway public opinion to his side of things. You can at least say that about this. The recitation of the problems, the commitment to address them and deal with them   and there is no question that that was a tremendous recitation and reminder to people of the problem, and a reminder that the Democrats have said they will negotiate once the government was reopened. So, this is pretty much what he said. If we don t get a fair deal from Congress," the government will either shut down again on February 15th or he will use the emergency powers he has under the Constitution to address this. So we ll see what happens.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here s how it happened. We re up to audio sound bite No. 7. CNN s Newsroom is the name of the show. The host here is Jim Sciutto. Not to be confused with Jim Acosta. But, I mean, they probably share the same brain. They ve got the National Air Traffic Controllers Association Executive Vice President Trish Gilbert on there.Question:  Is there any reason why people flying should be concerned that there s not enough man and womanpower to keep a plane safe as they are flying? GILBERT: Each day that this shutdown continues, the situation gets worse and worse. Uhh, there are several complicated, complex layers in our system to assure that it maintains the critical safety components that we all rely on when we fly. What we don t want to see is a catastrophic event occur and for us to come to you and say,  We told you that controllers are working longer hours.  Now they don t have their support staff! They re going to work unpaid, so they re not sleeping at night. They re looking for other jobs. Maybe they re driving Uber before or after their shift. This is unacceptable.RUSH: They re what?  [T]hey re driving Uber before and after their shift. This is unacceptable.  So, you see, it s not safe to fly the friendly skies of  Ignited.  It s not safe out there. Air traffic controllers are having to drive Ubers and so forth in their spare time. I happen to think this is the height of irresponsibility, and I m just gonna tell you point-blank: Donald Trump can win this if he hangs on. It s gonna be few more weeks. It s gonna be risky.But I actually, folks, really believe that if he hangs on and continues down this road, at some point there s gonna be a shift in public opinion and the vast majority of the American people are gonna end up with him on this   if he hangs in there. He s got a good start. There s all kinds of really good, long overdue things happening that we ve wanted to happen. Like 95% of the EPA furloughed? A lot of nonessential government workers on furlough?This is exactly what we ve wanted: The deemphasis of government, the shrinking of government, the illustration of the (pfft!) redundancy in the number of people and policies and so forth. The idea that people can function, that their lives can go on even in the midst of a partial government shutdown. If he can just hang on a few more weeks. There s one more on this. Poppy Harlow, the infobabe at CNN, following up on the dire warning that we re just days away from airplanes falling out of the sky HARLOW: (solemnly) Would you say, Trish, that flying is less safe today than it was a month agoGILBERT: I would say it is less safe today than it was a month ago, absolutely. We do not have the professionals on the job. We are working with bare-bones crews! This is a horrible game of chicken that we re in the middle of  HARLOW: (grunts)GILBERT:   and we need to get out of it today.HARLOW: You said it all. You said flying is less safe now than it was a month ago! That is something every American and every member of Congress and in the White House should be thinking a lot about!RUSH: I don t think a plane crash would upset these people, do you? I know it s a heck of a thing to say, but I don t know. This is  Trump was elected to interrupt. We have major disruption of all kinds of things that have not been good for the people of this country. It s a really great start. It s gonna be hard because this is the kind of stuff that s gonna be in the media over and over and over and over again: People dying, people having to choose between insulin and their mortgage, people running out of food, people running out of gas.The horror stories are gonna intensify, they re never gonna end, and largely most of them are gonna be exaggerated or made up. Pelosi here trying to cancel a State of the Union? That is one of the greatest opportunities that she has presented. She s gonna close the House chamber, tell Trump,  It s just not  We don t have enough security to do this. Let s come up with a different date when the shut down s over.  Trump should just find an alternative place if she s not gonna host it, if the House is not gonna invite him and welcome him in.He can go do it anywhere he wants, and he can call it whatever he wants. But he can give the State of the Union, and he can do it with a friendly crowd rather than a bunch of freshman Democrats protesting and mooning him probably and hanging up a bunch of protest signs in the House chamber, shouting at him. Who needs any of that?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Ocean City, Maryland. Hey, Freddie. Great to have you with us, sir. How you doing?CALLER: Oh, Rush, it s an honor to be on the show. First-time caller.RUSH: Thank you.CALLER: Yeah. I just wanted to talk about the shutdown. I feel like they tried to put the onus on Trump right off the bat, but he got out so far ahead of them with that live event that he did with Chuck and Nancy that he put the onus on them. So once he put the onus on them their strategy became to put it on someone else, and that was naturally you and Ann Coulter.RUSH: A-ha. That s an interesting thought process. You think that they re trying to blame or pawn the shutdown off on us to keep Chuck and Nancy out of it?CALLER: Absolutely,  cause it s not sticking to Trump the way they want it to. So the public, who s not   a lot of the public isn t very informed about these things. They probably don t even   a lot of them don t even know who Chuck and Nancy are. All they hear is Chuck and Nancy, Chuck and Nancy. Now all they hear is Rush and Ann Coulter, Rush and Ann Coulter.RUSH: Now, wait a second. Wait a minute. Explain something to me seriously now. How can so many more people know Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Rush Limbaugh, whatever, and not know Chuck and Nancy?CALLER: It s like they re hidden in a shroud of protection. Like I try to talk to people all the time. I m 29. So I m a Millennial. And I gotta tell you, a lot of the stuff you say about Millennials, it makes me laugh  cause a lot of it s true.RUSH: I know! I wouldn t say it otherwise. I m trying to find   I don t know if I had this yesterday or the day before. There was some polling data on this that was mixed at best. Yeah, here we go! There s a Pew Center for the People and the Press poll out there that says Trump is losing his shirt polling-wise on this shutdown, that a vast majority of the American people are blaming Trump for it. And I don t believe that for a minute because the Democrats are not acting like they re winning this, and Chuck Schumer s little speech about me on the Senate floor today is evidence. Chuck Schumer knows people voted for a wall. He knows the majority of people want a wall, and he let that slip.But here. I have a story here. This is from the Washington Examiner:  Support for President Trump s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is at an all-time high weeks into a partial government shutdown. According to the results of an ABC News and Washington Post poll released Sunday morning, 42 percent of Americans support a wall. Now, you may be saying,  Wait a minute, Rush, 42%, that s not much.  That s up from 34% a few months ago. The previous high in this poll of Americans supporting the wall was 37% in 2017. Now it s at 42%. And any of these people in politics will tell you that more than the final result of any poll will be the trend. That s what s either encouraging or discouraging.And for the left this is discouraging, that the number of people supporting a wall is continuing to increase, and that s for one reason, me and Ann Coulter. No. It s for one reason: Donald Trump. And so all of this scuttlebutt that you re hearing, the American people massively opposed to the wall, it isn t true. More and more people are supporting it.Now, it says here 54% of Americans polled   this is ABC News/Washington Post ñ  still oppose building a border wall. However, that opposition is shrinking.  It was 63% a year ago. And there s also polling data. People don t think $5 billion is anywhere near an amount of money to not do something when talking about the federal budget.Look. This is why my riff today is that Trump can win this and he can turn this around. He can turn this into a big win, but he s gonna have to hold on for a few more weeks. We re gonna have to endure all of the scare scenarios, airplanes falling out of the sky, people dying from insulin shock or lack of insulin, people being run over by driverless cars, whatever they come up with, and it s gonna intensify.We ve got to hold fast on this and understand that it s like most everything else in the media, agenda-driven, the objective being anti-Trump. The last thing anybody on the left   media, Pelosi, Schumer, you name it, the last thing any of them want and the last thing any of them can afford is Trump success. But he can turn this around.The fast food burgers at the White House for the Clemson football team, you would not believe, although you would probably, from all of these elitist, highfalutin places like the Atlantic and Vanity Fair, they re just so outraged and offended because it was typical Trump. Trump loves to show off his wealth. He s so incorrigible, he s so gauche, he s so brutish, he violates all these societal norms showing off his wealth.What, showing off his wealth by buying thousands of hamburgers? What do you mean?  That s right. But he did it in the state dining room. He made it look like he made it all happen with the candelabra.  These people are beside themselves with this.Meanwhile, the star quarterback for the Clemson Tigers is out telling everybody what a great time it was. He s a real freshman. Cannot go to the NFL for three years. I don t know what his politics are if he even has any. He s a 19-year-old young man, but they all had the greatest time in there. And they love Trump. And this is just offending the so-called civilized sensitivities of all of these people.And Trump I don t think even has to stop and think about this. It s just instinct. These things come to him by instinct, how to win, how to rattle these people, how to force them into doing and saying things that make fools of themselves. But the bottom line, folks, we elected a disrupter.We elected somebody to turn that town upside down because the town has been distant, unconnected, unresponsive. You know the drill on all that. And this is exactly why Trump was elected. Every time he opens his mouth about this he s doubling down on it. There s a couple of Trump tweets today that indicate how dead on he is about this. Trevor Lawrence, the quarterback for Clemson.Where did I put the tweets? It s two tweets about the stats of how many walls there are around the world and how successfully they are. And this is what happens. By this time in the show I ve got 15 different stacks and I don t remember where I put what in the stacks. And, by the way, it s not possible to digitize. Here it is.First tweet:  There are now 77 major or significant Walls built around the world, with 45 countries planning or building Walls. Over 800 miles of Walls have been built in Europe since only 2015. They have all been recognized as close to 100% successful. Stop the crime at our Southern Border! That s a tweet from this morning at 6:30. Then 15 minutes later.  It is becoming more and more obvious that the Radical Democrats are a Party of open borders and crime. They want nothing to do with the major Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border. #2020! So as Trump does, he s doubling down. And in the process, Trump is forcing these people out of the shadows, and they are demonstrating the vitriolic hatred that they harbor, not for him, but for us. There is a brilliant piece today written by Victor Davis Hanson at the Hoover Institution website. It s not at National Review. It s not American Greatness. Victor, among the many places he works, is the Hoover Institute, which is on the campus Stanford Palo Alto. And the Hoover website, Hoover.org, has this great   it prints to six pages. I can t read the whole thing to you. I d love to, but I can t. It s six pages.It s called  License to Hate.  And it quotes all of the hatred from all of these leftists, the hatred for you, the way they re insulting you. The way they insult the people that voted for Trump and how they get away with it,  License to Hate.  It s how the left has full exemptions from all the hate in the world. While they accuse us of being hatemongers, while they accuse us of all these horrible behavioral things, they actually engage in them.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This is Victor in Edgewater, New Jersey. Hey, Victor. Great to have you here. Hi.CALLER: Hey, Rush, 26 year mega dittos from New Jersey.RUSH: Thank you, sir.CALLER: Yep. So my point is, in past speeches Chuck Schumer s given about advocating border barriers and border walls he never once said,  But only if Mexico pays for it.  So why does he care now? If he thinks it s right and he thinks it s needed, why does he care who pays for it?RUSH: Well, you re talking back in, like, 2010 and all that was Schumer was advocating paying for a wall and agreeing to $54 billion for one?CALLER: Yes.RUSH: Is that what you mean?CALLER: Exactly. Yeah, exactly. So  (crosstalk)RUSH: Well, the only reason he s talking about Mexico now is because he s trying to convince people that Trump said the wall was gonna be paid for by Mexico. Schumer is actually  Here. Let s grab the sound bite again. It s No. 1. Here, listen. This is Chuck Schumer on the floor of the U.S. Senate, and it s just this morning.SCHUMER: Why is our country suffering self-inflicted damage? Because President Trump is using the American government as leverage in an attempt to extract taxpayer money for a border wall he promised Mexico would pay for.RUSH: See?SCHUMER: You know, I hear Rush Limbaugh.  He promised this in the campaign.  No, he didn t. He promised a wall that Mexico would pay for. He never said once, that I can recall, in the campaign,  But if Mexico doesn t pay for it, we ll pay for it.  Of course, people voted for it! (pause) Or some. (pause) Not that many.RUSH: See? He caught himself. He stepped in it so big at the end.  Of course, people voted for it,  meaning: It s the epitome of common sense to stop illegal immigration.  Of course, people voted for it.  Schumer knows the drill. He knows why people voted for Trump. This is manufactured, that Trump s promise was exclusive with Mexico paying for it.Trump never said that! He added that Mexico s gonna pay for the wall just like he said,  Hey, Russia, maybe you can find the missing Hillary emails. There s 30,000 of  em out there. Maybe if you can find  em, give  em to the U.S. media. They really seem eager to find them. Ha-ha.  There isn t a Trump voter out there who believes the wall was only going to be built if Mexico paid for it.That is a purposeful misrepresentation. It s  (groans) It s so weak. It is so flimsy trying to undermine Trump s honesty by saying,  He didn t promise to build a wall. He promised a wall that Mexico would pay for.  He promised a wall, and he told voters that Mexico would pay for it one way or the other! But I ll tell you this: The people that voted for Trump because he s gonna build a wall don t care if Mexico pays for it! That s not the point! But that s all the Democrats have.That s the only thing they can use to try to poke holes in what Trump said. But I ll guaran-damn-tee, every Trump voter voted for a wall because they want to stop the rule of law being violated so openly and wantonly. Not just by illegal immigration, but by sanctuary cities and all the rest of this garbage that is corrupting our culture every day and getting worse. They want it stopped. Part and parcel of stopping it is stopping the flow of illegal immigrants into the country, which the Democrats want.Trump said,  I m gonna build a wall to stop it.  They said,  Build the wall.  It doesn t matter who pays for it. There s a GoFundMe campaign right now to pay for it. The people don t care that Mexico pays for this. This is one of the gigantic total misrepresentations by Schumer because they re losing this. They re the ones that are shutting down the country. They re the ones that won t come up with $5 billion when they previously authorized $54 billion for it.They re the ones who will not come up with one smidgen of 1/10 of 1% of the federal budget to shore up the border regardless how it s done. They don t want it to happen. They do not want Donald Trump to have a political victory whatever that may mean for the country. But if Schumer and the rest of these clowns are produced now to saying,  Trump lied! He said Mexico was gonna pay for it,  then they are running out of ammo. Do not doubt me.Who s next? John, Galveston, Texas. Great to have you on the program, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hey, thanks, Rush. I m a first time caller. I wanted to bring up the money that comes in through the border. I worked at RJD Correctional Facility, and I knew a couple of the Border Patrol agents that work there. They took some pictures of some of the places they had drugs and money. I mean, it looked like pallets full, kind of like the pallets that went to Iran. That much. But pallets and pallets. When he went down there, I hope he talked with those people.I hope he saw what they had. I don t know who gets it, but I think he may be on target and get that wall built probably 10 times over with the money that comes through there. The sex trafficking   I work for the police department here in Harris County   and the prostitution arrests? Unreal. They re coming, and they re designed to shut the country down and break it, just like Soros was the key word for (unintelligible)  RUSH: Let me ask you a quick question here. Let me ask you a quick pregunta, John, because we re running out of time. Are you ? I don t know if you re suggesting. Are you asking whether or not the Democrats are being paid off by these traffickers and stuff?CALLER: Exactly! They re getting a lot of money because those people that are coming across and the money that s coming across, they re paying  em off to make sure that wall don t get built. They don t want it built because it was  RUSH: Well, that   (crosstalk)CALLER: They wanted it built at one time, when we had a different president, but now   (crosstalk)RUSH: That may be  CALLER: (crosstalk)RUSH: (sigh) Look, I have no clue. You re in the Houston Police Department, did you say?CALLER: Yes.RUSH: Harris County. Well, look. (chuckles) You would be closer to that than I am. I just would say in response that I don t think anybody has to pay  em a penny to get  em to keep the border open. I think they d do it if nobody were giving them a dime. They would do it because that s their future! Voter registration among illegals and eventually illegals voting? That s their permanent underclass continuing to cross every day. I think they re not  They may be paid off, I don t know. But I m telling you: They would do all this for nothing, in terms of money, simply because of what they think it does in guaranteeing their future.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here s Fred in Denver. Welcome. Great to have you here, sir. How are you?CALLER: I am great, Mr. Limbaugh. It s an honor to be on your show once again. What I wanted to talk about is kind of piggybacking on what you said earlier in the show, and it s this: Ronald Reagan back when there was an illegal strike at the air traffic controllers back in the eighties  The way I understand the law is if they are furloughed for 30 days   22 of those which are working days  RUSH: Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.CALLER: They can then be given a pink slip with 60 days  notice.  Your job is now terminated, regardless of performance or merit. CALLER: (crosstalk)RUSH: No, no, no, no, no, no. I m gonna stop you. I don t want anybody knowing this. I don t  CALLER: (crosstalk)RUSH: Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Zip it! It s enough for you to know that I know what you re talking about, and I m just gonna tell you you re right, but we re not going to talk about it. Just be patient for a few more days. It s why I have been encouraging the president to hang in there. He can win this! It s gonna take a few more weeks, and it s gonna be rocky and bumpy, but he can win this, and he turn this into a huge win at the same time.I m sorry to be rude here, but what he was talking about, I don t want anybody that doesn t know this to know it. I don t want cable news talking about. I don t want panels assembled. I don t want any of this crap. It s not crap. It s actually  I m not gonna say any more. But, Fred, I m sorry. I don t mean to be rude or any of that. I just  I ve had this here for a couple of days, and I m not gonna use it until it s safe to mention it.RUSH: Here s Tom in Buckley, Washington. Great to have you with us, sir. Hi.CALLER: Thanks, Rush. Good to talk to you.RUSH: Thank you, sir. What s up? What s shakin ?CALLER: I was calling, Rush, because I would like to see if it s possible for the people using the immigration coming here to work to pay for the wall. One way to do that is increase visa fees from say $200 for 90 days. If you have a million out there, making $4 million people a year, you re looking at about $80 million in revenue available, not out of the Americans  pockets but out of the pockets of the people that benefit from the program.RUSH: Yeah. I understand that. I ll tell you where I think the president is on this. A lot of people are curious why he doesn t just declare the state of emergency under the state of emergencies act of 2006 or whatever and just go get the money from various federal departments like the Pentagon and start building the sucker. I think it s because the president wants this to come from legislation. That will be a victory.He wants this to come from Democrats compromising and agreeing to the premise. That s a long shot. I don t know what leverage he s gonna have for them to do it, but that s why he s not going some of these other alternative funding routes. And I think that is great as well. Staring them down. It would be a simple matter to declare this an emergency and get started. It d be a simple matter to go, like you say, to raise the $5 billion. We could get the from a rounding error in the budget. Coming up with $5 billion is literally the definition of chump change.He could have done that 15 days ago. Do you realize the federal budget is so massive that an error of $5 billion even if caught would not even cause a revision to be rewritten? It s not big enough! That s what s the real joke about this. Schumer and the Democrats and these clowns authorized $54 billion or $56 billion for a wall as recently as eight years ago.The money is not the issue, and where it comes from is not the issue. The issue is that Trump wants this as a standard operating win, the result of compromise between the legislative and executive branches. Because that means it s happened under the terms of Constitution and theoretically is happening because of the will of the people and the way they have voted and so forth. I don t know if that s gonna be how this ends, but I know that s one of the objectives.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/09/vice-president-pence-talks-to-rush-about-the-crisis-at-the-border/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 9, 2019RUSH: Well, let s welcome to the program the vice president of the United States, Mike Pence. Greetings, sir. I m glad you could carve some time out for us today. How are you?THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Rush. It s always an honor. I just left the Oval Office   told the president I was headed to be on your program   and we couldn t be more grateful for your voice on the airwaves of America every day. Everything we ve accomplished over the last two years   rebuilding our military, reviving our economy, setting a record for conservatives appointed to our courts, America s growing at home, we re standing tall on the world stage   you ve played a key role in that. And, Rush, we don t thank you enough. But thank you for all that you ve meant to this movement and to the progress that we ve made in this country.RUSH: Thank you, sir, very much. I m floored. I appreciate that. I m all-in, because you guys are right where we all think you need to be. We re just  We re so grateful. I mean, we have a president keeping campaign promises, a president committed, a president willing to withstand these endless personal and professional assaults and so forth. It s remarkable, and we re very thankful that all of you are hangin  in. I don t know how  I mean, we re really grateful that there isn t a bunch of buckling and caving to all this pressure. You re doing great.THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I ll tell you what. You put your finger on it, though. You know, you ve known the president for a long time. I gotta tell you, you know, what an honor it is for me to serve alongside a president who literally gets up every day  Just like he just signed a bill to end human trafficking in the Oval Office. This is a president who gets up every day and says,  What can we do today to keep the promises that we made to the American people?  And he just said a few minutes ago We ve made tremendous progress in this country in our economy, security, but, as he said last night to the nation   and your listeners know it well   we have a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. And while we re in the midst of a partial government shutdown three weeks and counting, we are also in the midst of a crisis at our southern border, and President Trump and I and our entire team is determined to stand firm until the Democrats in Congress come to the table and work with us to secure the border, build a wall, end this humanitarian crisis, and do what s right for the American people.RUSH: Lindsey Graham, senator from South Carolina, says it will be  the end of our party,  quote-unquote, if we don t continue to hang firm, that if we cave in the slightest way, that it will be the end of the Republican Party. Do you share that sentiment?THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, you know, honestly, we just don t think about this and the president doesn t talk about this in political terms. I mean, he really believes that we ve got broad-based support across the country. Republicans and independents, and even many Democrats, are committed to border security, who understand that building a wall on the southern border, giving more resources to Border Patrol agents, providing more medical resources, more detection resources   all of which we ve proposed   is just common sense. But I gotta tell you, I mean  RUSH: All of which, by the way, they have supported!THE VICE PRESIDENT:   (crosstalk) you ve heard the president talk about this. It s just the right thing to do. It s the right thing to do for the country, and that s why, even in the midst of a partial government shutdown, you re gonna continue to see President Trump stand strong. But this is a critical moment, Rush. And I know you don t do calls of action. You know I ve listened to your show for decades. I m, like, your second biggest fan in the White House here.RUSH: (laughs)THE VICE PRESIDENT: Look, you don t do calls to action. But for heaven s sake, your listeners need to know: If there s ever a day that they need to call their congressman, call their senators, today s the day. Tell them you stand with the president. Call their Democrat elected officials and tell  em that they need to come to the table, they need to roll their sleeves up, and they need to go work to secure our border. Democrats are refusing to even negotiate until the president reopens the government. That s unacceptable.RUSH: Good.THE VICE PRESIDENT: The American people need to let our elected representatives know today how they feel.RUSH: We are speaking with Vice President Mike Pence. You know, there s audio and video   a lot of it   of Obama, of Hillary, Chuck Schumer, Pelosi   all of them   promising, pledging to support the building of a wall; authorizing the expenditure of $50 billion, not $5 billion. They re all on record as being for this from 2006 on. I, frankly, was really hoping that the president would do a little bit of a show last night and include some of that video, because these people are engaging in some of the most blatant hypocrisy ever.Now, I know that hypocrisy usually doesn t attach to them. But you ve got a gold mine. You have a reservoir of every one of these people advocating, promoting, agreeing with the premise of a border wall because of the dangers posed by an open border, and I know you re gonna find a right time to use this stuff,  cause it would render them speechless. It would cause the media to have palpitations in how to explain it. I want to run a quote from the president last night by you because, I tell you, it was  THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah, please. But, Rush, on that point, can I say one thing?RUSH: Well, sure. You re the guest.THE VICE PRESIDENT: In about 40 minutes the president and I are gonna head to Capitol Hill. We re gonna meet with Senate Republicans. The president s gonna take his case to the United States Senate. Today we re meeting with Republican and Democrat leaders later this afternoon. To your point, back when I was in Congress more than ten years ago, I think 79 members of the Senate voted for the Secure Fence Act, including a senator named Chuck Schumer.RUSH: Exactly.THE VICE PRESIDENT: To your point, this is an issue that is common sense. But your listeners ought to know, the president is committed to build the wall. He said we ll build a steel barrier on the southern border. We described that. But beyond that, it s not just   the president wants to give our border agents the kind of resources and reforms to stem this incredible tide, particularly of families and unaccompanied children. Sixty-thousand people a month are attempting to come into our country illegally. Two-thirds of them are families and unaccompanied minors. We have to bring about broad-based reforms and build a wall. The president s laid out a plan. It s time for the Democrats to come to the table.RUSH: Mr. Vice President, it s become abundantly clear to me that the Democrats, the media, all of your opponents, the illegal aspect of this is something that doesn t even register with them. In fact, they don t even have the ability to determine the immorality of simply the illegality of this. For most of us this is a rule-of-law issue as well as the societal and cultural destruction that s taking place and the budget pressures that are being placed   this is simply a violation of law.Without the rule of law and without people upholding it, that s the glue that holds everything together. And the opponents, your opponents on this seem to think that it s not even a factor. And that, to me, is a golden opportunity in your conference this afternoon just to remind people what we re really talking about here. We re talking about enforcing the rule of law. It s not complicated. If you guys don t do it, who is? You re in charge of immigration law.THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, that s exactly right. And the president and I are committed to uphold and faithfully execute the laws of this land. And that includes securing the border. We have 2,000 illegal immigrants trying to enter our country every day. I mean, we talk about caravans. I ve heard reports there s another caravan marshaling. Those are very troubling, as you see several thousand people in a caravan. We literally have 60,000 people coming into our country illegally every month. And beyond the rule of law, which you make that point very eloquently and it s one that is foundational in our society, it s the foundation of our prosperity in the way our nation is set apart in the world.But beyond all of that, in the last year alone border agents arrested 17,000 people with previous criminal records at our border. Three thousand special interest aliens who had travel patterns and backgrounds that might represent a nexus to national security or even terrorism. Now, you know, there s some 4,000, nearly 4,000 people apprehended who are known or suspected terrorists attempting to come into the country from all different ports of entry. But, at our southern border, 3,000 in the category that Homeland Security calls a special interest alien were stopped and apprehended attempting to come in.Beyond all of that, though, the president just signed this bill on human trafficking. Rush, when you see that two-thirds of the 60,000 coming into our border are families and unaccompanied minors, what you re witnessing is a multibillion-dollar operation run by the cartels and human traffickers that exploit vulnerable families and take cash to lead them on the long and dangerous journey north to take advantage of loopholes in our law. The president wants to change the law, close the loopholes, build a wall, give our border agents. That s how you secure the border.But all we heard, again, last night from the Democrats, what I heard all weekend long from their senior staff is that they will   Democrats have said they refuse to negotiate until the president opens the government. What the president s made clear is we have a plan to deal with the crisis on our southern border. It s time for Democrats to come to the table and start negotiating in good faith. Not just reopen the government, but to deal with the humanitarian and security crisis on our border.RUSH: Well, they re out there saying that illegal border crossings have declined dramatically in recent years. We know that isn t true. Look, I m about out of time here, and I know you ve got many other things to do, but I just wanted to thank you again, your comments to me earlier, deeply appreciated. And I m just so grateful, as so many people are, that all of you there are committed to what you re committed to and are hanging tough.THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we re so grateful for your voice. The progress that we re making for this country is a result of the support of tens of millions who listen to you and cherish your conservative voice on the airwaves of America, just like the president and I do. And we ll always be grateful, Rush.RUSH: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Mike Pence, Vice President, United States. Excellent timing. Former radio guy there.  "

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/24/why-the-drive-by-media-wants-you-to-think-im-running-the-country/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 24, 2018RUSH: I got a note from Cookie today before she prepared the audio sound bite roster, and I m gonna read this email.  Cookie s the production director, and she scours all of this stuff day in and day out to produce the audio sound bites which appear on this program. Dear, Rush:  This weekend could be an all-time record for Rush mentions.  I almost did a whole cue sheet that was just sound bites about you!  But then I decided I had to mix in a few good ones from other people, because, like you say, you don t like the show to be about you.  But, if you wanted it to be, I have 40 sound bites today that mention your name, that blame you, that essentially say you are running the country. I could have done 40 bites, but I just picked the most interesting   plus a montage, of course.  All these senators and congressmen whining about a guy on the radio.  It s unbelievable.  It s still all about you, though, anyway, because they re convinced you caused the shutdown, that you are running the country, and that you are the president.  Except for some people who now think that what makes this even worse is that you re nothing but an entertainer.   You know, they go back and forth on this.Depending on the day, depending on the issue, I m the titular head of the Republican Party, conservative movement, and the next,  Ah, he s just an entertainer.  For 30 years, it s been that styling.  So to give you a flavor, here is the montage.  This is audio sound bite No. 1, and it s the exasperated Drive-By Media convinced that I am running America.  There s some people from  NBC, CNN, PMSNBC, Republican strategerists, syndicated radio host  Oh, really?  Really?  Syndicated radio host?  I m being turned on even by brethren in the business here, and there s some bloggers and so forth.  So, anyway, here it is.  This is one we don t  I m not playing all 40.  I don t have all 40.  But I m telling you, the vast majority of the cue sheet here today is me.  Here we go.KATY TUR: Rush Limbaugh is in control of the government.DON LEMON: President Rush Limbaugh?BAKARI SELLERS:  You have a president in Rush Limbaugh.CHRIS MATTHEWS: Rush Limbo. (sic) There s a guy, in a golf shirt down in Palm Beach telling the president what to do. This is crazy. Is Rush Limbo calling the shots or are his listeners calling the shots?PHIL RUCKER: Well, this week, with the shutdown I would say Rush Limbaugh.RINA SHAH: This entire debate has been hijacked by Limbaugh.HUGH HEWITT: One person: Rush Limbaugh.MARIA CARDONA:   puppet masters in the likes of Rush Limbaugh.MICHAEL SMERCONISH: I don t think we d be in a partial government shutdown without those voices like Rush s.BRIAN STELTER: This is kind of a Rush Limbaugh shutdown.NORMAN ORNSTEIN: This is a Trump-Limbaugh shutdown.JENNIFER RUBIN: Maybe the Democrats should go negotiate with Rush Limbaugh.RUSH:  Now, you know what they re trying to do here.  They are attempting to embarrass President Trump.  You know what this all traces back to?  It traces back  I don t even remember the day, but it was one day last week, and I got word   as everybody did. The word got out that the president was preparing to agree with the continuing resolution that the House had passed that had no money in it   none   for border security.It went over to the Senate, and the Senate passed it and the president was ready to accept it, I couldn t believe it.  Because what really frosted me is there was $1.6 billion for wall construction or border security that got stripped out in this continuing resolution.  So there we started out with $1.6 billion, and then by the time it was ready to go up to Trump for signature, there was nothing in it.  So that s what I said.I m sitting here discussing it saying,  This is a gigantic mistake.  This was the signature issue that got President Trump elected.   Well, I get a message here from somebody who wishes to remain nameless, who said,  Rush, I m letting you on behalf of President Trump, this is all wrong. He s not signing this. He s gonna veto this.  If there s no money in it for the wall, he s gonna veto it.  So don t worry about it.   So I was told that whatever I had heard and was telling you about was not true.  It was a message.It was a name you would all know, but the person asked me not to mention their name. But I was on the air, and this is how the president chose to get the message, because obviously he was told that I was succeeding that this was an absolute disaster if he would do this.  His point was, he wasn t gonna do it and wanted me to know. I didn t talk him into or out of anything.  The message I got was,  Don t worry.  He s not gonna sign this. He s not gonna sign it until there s money for the budget.   It s not that he was going to sign it then heard me and changed his mind.  So what the media wants to do is try to humiliate him, make it look like he doesn t know what he s doing and all that has to happen is some guy on the radio.  But what bothers them, folks, is that their scenario that they constructed where Trump is ready to do what they want and just about ready to sign.Then I speak up and say,  No,  and then it doesn t happen! They just can t stand that, that that could possibly be true.  So now, it s time to start denigrating Trump and at the same time denigrate me while building me up at the same time.  But it s all for the purposes of making Trump look small and indecisive and insecure.  And I can tell you that the only message I got was,  Don t worry.  Whatever you re seeing isn t true.  He s not signing this unless there s money in it.   Not that,  Okay, Rush, the president heard you. He isn t gonna sign it!  It wasn t that at all.  And these people know this.Here s Little Brian Stelter at CNN. Yeah, we can squeeze this in before the break.  This is the second bite STELTER:  The president seems very influenced by right-wing news   not right-wing news outlets.  Right-wing entertainers like Rush Limbaugh.  He does not seem so influenced by his own staff.RUSH:  His own staff? He had people on his staff telling him what to do, the right thing?  Anyway, they love portraying Trump as not knowing what s going on, not knowing who to talk to, not listening to anybody, not having any good.  They love this idea that Trump doesn t know anything and he s not in control.  I can tell you that they re a hundred percent wrong about this the way they re interpreting this.  They re the ones that created this narrative, not me.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  Yeah, it was Chris Matthews who, in the opening montage, said,  There s some guy in a golf shirt down in Palm Beach telling president what to do. This is crazy.  (chuckles)  Some guy in a golf shirt! Here.  Play it again.  People are finding this hilarious.  We ll do this and we ll move on to No. 3.  But let me set this up again, folks, what happened last week. The way the press is misrepresenting this, I am doing the program.  I m in the middle of a broadcast segment.And the news is the president s gonna sign the continuing resolution   that the House has passed and the Senate had just passed   that has zero money in it for border security, wall, whatever.  I said,  Wait a minute.  It at least had $1.6 billion in it before these guys started messin  around with the continuing resolution.   So found out that that $1.6 billion had been stripped out.  I said,  Trump s not only getting nothing, he s getting less than nothing,  and the Drive-Bys pounced!  That was like gold to them, my saying Trump was getting less than nothing.They heralded it, they loved it, they thought it was perfect.  They even thought I might be turning on the president.  So I m reading that the news is saying that Trump s gonna sign this thing and I m on the air saying,  This can t happen, should not happen, there s no way. Shut the government down. Don t sign this,  whatever.  At that point, I get an iMessage, direct message from the president.  The president wants you to know he s not going to sign it unless there s proper money in it for the wall,  and I mentioned that to you.I said,  Folks, I just got a direct message from the president.   Well, it was somebody sending the message,  cause Trump doesn t email or message.  He tweets and that s it.  I don t tweet.  So he had a third party get me the message.  I shared with you the message.   I just got a message from the president that he s not going to sign this. He will veto it unless there s money in it for border security and the wall.   The media took that story and turned it into Trump had his pen ready to go. He s on the verge of signing it!
And then I start complaining on the air and somebody walks in and says,  Mr. President! Mr. President! Rush Limbaugh  (stammering) Y-y-you re losing Rush Limbaugh! He s going nuts,  and Trump stops.   Oh, really?  I better not sign it.   That s not what happened!  What happened was the president got word to me that whatever news stories we all had that said he was gonna sign it were not true.  He wasn t.  It wasn t that anybody had changed his mind.  Now, the Drive-Bys have since reported what I just told you.He s there, he s poised, he s got that pen in his hand. He may even have the D already written down! Then they run in there and say,  Mr. President! Mr. President! Rush Limbaugh says you shouldn t sign it,  and Trump stops.   Oh, really?  Okay. Well, then I won t.   That s not what happened.  But they want you to think that s what happened because it diminishes Trump.  And it gives them another chance to shoot at me, which they, of course, love doing as well.  And we put together a montage, one more time, of how it sounded over the weekend.KATY TUR: Rush Limbaugh is in control of the government.DON LEMON: President Rush Limbaugh?BAKARI SELLERS:  You have a president in Rush Limbaugh.CHRIS MATTHEWS: Rush Limbo. (sic) There s a guy, in a golf shirt down in Palm Beach telling the president what to do. This is crazy. Is Rush Limbo calling the shots or are his listeners calling the shots?PHIL RUCKER: Well this week, with the shutdown I would say Rush Limbaugh.RINA SHAH: This entire debate has been hijacked by Limbaugh.HUGH HEWITT: One person: Rush Limbaugh.MARIA CARDONA:   puppet masters in the likes of Rush Limbaugh.MICHAEL SMERCONISH: I don t think we d be in a partial government shutdown without those voices like Rush s.BRIAN STELTER: This is kind of a Rush Limbaugh shutdown.NORMAN ORNSTEIN: This is a Trump-Limbaugh shutdown.JENNIFER RUBIN: Maybe the Democrats should go negotiate with Rush Limbaugh.RUSH:  Well  I have a lot of emails, by the way,  I wish you were running the country.   Which I , of course, understand.  But it s not the case.So here I am just a guy in a golf shirt in Palm Beach running the country.  Here s Senator Chuck You Schumer.  This was Saturday on the Senate floor SCHUMER:  Even Rush Limbaugh, one of the biggest supporters of the president, said it was a Trump shutdown.  That he caused it.  He said, quote   this is Limbaugh speaking    The president wants you to know it s money for the wall or nothing.  And if it s nothing, he shuts it down.   All indications were that the president would sign the bill.  But President Trump, beholden to the far, far right, unwilling to shoulder even the slightest critique from Rush Limbaugh, changed his mind.RUSH:  See?  You see how they re doing this?  Trump was ready to go, and then somebody told him that I was complaining about it. So he stopped, got a message to me and said not to worry about it, he wasn t gonna sign it.  By the way, Chuck, you missed my program on December 21st, because if you hadn t missed it, you wouldn t have said this because this shutdown is all yours.  You own this, and the Republicans have got to stay unified in making that point.I m gonna go through this again.  This may be one of those days I m gonna have a tough time getting everything in.  That s how much there is here.  But they ve got to stay unified on this.  They have got to stay supportive of the president on this in the sense that this is the Democrats.  The Democrats do not want border security!  The Democrats do not want one thing that would shore up the border and put any limits on illegal immigration whatsoever because they need their permanent underclass and a current flow, inflow of people not being interrupted.That s their base.  That s their future base.  They don t want Trump to have any kind of a victory, either.  But this is theirs.  They could fix this shutdown.  They care about their precious government being open, they care so much? By the way, the government has been shut for three or four days.  How many of you are suffering in pain that you cannot deal with because of this?  How many of your lives have been temporarily ruined or destroyed because your government shut down?Zilch, zero, nada.  The Democrats  We spent  You know how much we spent to bail out General Motors? It was $11.5 billion.  We spent $12 billion to bail out General Motors, and General Motors is tanking.  This is $5 billion, and Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff said on TV over the weekend,  We ll come off the $5 billion.   Democrats have offered $1.6 billion, but it s gone.He said,  We ll come off the $5 billion, find a happy medium.  They won t do it.  They don t think they have to this happen.  They think they can hold out  til they take control of the House.  It has got to be pounded they are the reason for the shutdown and why.  They do not border security.  Pat  Leaky  Leahy, Democrat senator from Vermont, also on the Senate floor.  This was Saturday LEAHY: (whispering) The president had agreed to sign it. We finally had a path for it.  But then Rush Limbaugh started criticizing.  The president s ego won out over his duties to the country.  He went back on what he had agreed to, and here we are.RUSH:   The president had agreed to sign it.  We finally had a path forward.  But then Rush Limbaugh started criticizing.   Do you realize this thing that they re making up here  (chuckling) They re creating this scenario to diminish Trump and at the same time, I mean, what s it doing to me?  Once again, they are elevating   Politico had a story over the weekend. Did you see this?   Rush Limbaugh Comes Roaring Back.   Roaring back?  Where did I go?  Where the hell did I go?You know, it shows that the way they define   the Drive-Bys, the way they define   success in terms of what I do is,  How much influence is there in Washington on the part of people in the conservative media?   Will you ever see a story,  Dan Rather comes roaring back,  or  Chuck Todd comes roaring back ?  I mean, those people are never assumed to have gone anywhere.  But somehow because Trump watches Fox News and doesn t to listen radio, I m a nonentity.  I m a nonfactor.  Trump is totally into Fox, totally into television, doesn t listen to radio, and, therefore, I am nothing more than a bump on a log?Until this comes along and,  Oh, my God.  Limbaugh?  Limbaugh s still there?  Oh, my !   They have no idea how to define the success of this program using business measurements and so forth.  It s all just horse race to them.  Such a limited view.  So now I ve come  roaring back,  even though I never went anywhere.  How do they know I haven t influenced President Trump before this?  Why are they assuming this is the only time?  How do they know other things the president has done at my behest?  This is the only one that s been made public.Imagine if they knew other things!  "

e will not approve a wall from reprogrammed funds or anything else. It won t happen.RUSH: (impression)  Except if we want to send $10 billion down to Central America, southern Mexico, and if we find that money somewhere in the executive branch  Oh, wait. We don t have to allocate that, it s already been acted like, but we can do what we re telling Trump he can t do   and by God, we re gonna do it. We re gonna send that money there so they build up their economies so they don t have to come here in the first place.   Chris Van Hollen. He s now a Democrat senator, used to be one of Pelosi s No. 1 lieutenants in the House of Representatives. He was on with Neil Cavuto last night on the Fox News Channel.Cavuto said,  You know, he might look at a number of other things, including maybe reallocating money from defense department to the wall construction project. Would you be against that? HOLLEN: The president does not have this unlimited authority just to, uh, use the defense department about that as a slush fund, uh, for the Department of Homeland Security and the wall. So, uh, that s not gonna work. Uh, we ve had bipartisan agreements down here on Capitol Hill on the most effective way, uh, to achieve border security, and, uh, I hope that the president will listen to, uh, what a bipartisan group of members of Congress, uh, has come up with.RUSH: Yeah, and what s that? What is this bipartisan group and what have they come up with? Zilch, zero, nada. So now here are the Democrats telling Trump what he can t do. He s got his Department of Justice telling him what you can t do. He s got the FBI out there mocking him and telling him what he can t do. He s got Chuck You Schumer telling him what you can t do and he s got Mitch McConnell telling everybody what he won t do!(impression)  Because we do our duty keep the government that you know and love and need up and running.  And here s a Republican. Grab No. 7, John Thune. He s from South Dakota. He was on with Cavuto last night. Question:  Are you of the mind-set that reallocating money from another department like the defense department is a wise strategy,  money to build the wall,  or would that be rejected out of hand?  Republican senator here.THUNE: I m not a big fan of moving money. I think Defense ought to be building airplanes and ships and all the things that we need to do to defend the country.RUSH: There you go. John Thune, Republican senator, South Dakota.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: All right. Let s stick with the audio sound bites and get back to your phone calls here in just a second. Grab No. 8. This is Mr. Newt today on Fox & Friends with Steve Doocy who said  Mr. Speaker, it looks like the Democrats are gonna win on this. There will be no money for the president and his wall this time. MR. NEWT: They may win for two weeks. But again, I think the president s probably trying to get past the Christmas season. I ve always thought having been through shutdowns when I was speaker, I don t think shutting the government down on Christmas Eve is a particularly big win for anybody. It s a pain in the neck for the hundreds of thousands of families that are affected directly by it. The president has not given up. I don t know that he minds dragging it out for a while.   a series of two-week agreements. I suspect he believed that every week that he s talking about security for Americans and they re posturing against protecting the border, I think he thinks he s probably winning in the long run.RUSH: All right. So let me translate this for you.  We got a two-week deal here just to get us through the Christmas and the new year seen, the holidays here, and then we gotta come back here and do it again in January. Now, at some point the Democrats are gonna be running the House like on January 3rd or 4th, whenever it is that they re sworn in. So the thinking is here that the president will keep talking about border security. He doesn t want to shut down government why Christmas season, Christmas Eve. It s too tough to people affected by it. But it s only two weeks! We ve gotta go through this again. After Christmas it s a different ball game, and that s when Trump can play hardball and threaten not to sign it right when the Democrats are taking over the House, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and the more president talks about border security   the more he talks about the wall, the more he talks about the need for it and the more the Democrats oppose it   then the better the issue continues to be for Trump. That s what Mr. Newt is saying. I m sure some of you will have thoughts on that, and there is a case to be made for that. It s not give as though this deal will fund the government for the next year. It s just a short period of time and the thing s gotta find be done again. That s what McConnell was referring to.  We re doing our duty to keep the precious government everybody loves up and running and then we ll come back here and we ll do it again with the president,  whatever. Now, on Fox & Friends they played a sound of me talking about this today. It began with Ainsley Earhardt.EARHARDT: Rush Limbaugh was saying that nobody in Washington wants this Trump wall. The president likes to negotiate, and maybe this was a way for him to compromise, say,  If I give you a little bit of this, you ll soften on it maybe you ll give me more money.  But the thing is, most Republicans are saying Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are not gonna budge on this; they re not gonna give him anything. Rush Limbaugh also said this. Listen RUSH ARCHIVE: [T]he White House could back down from its demand for $5 billion in border wall funding in this year-end spending bill. If that s true, it means the Democrats can get pretty much what they want and block anything they don t want simply by promising to shut down the government, because that s what s on the table.   The ironic thing about this is that polling data is finally starting to show (even in the AP) that government shutdowns have lost their impact in terms of benefiting the Democrats. There have been so many of  em, there have been so many threats, and nothing happens.   This is all smoke and mirrors and made up.RUSH: My point there is it s like the Republicans were constantly accused of wanting to deny Social Security to seniors. Seniors couldn t take the chance of that so they always voted Democrat. Democrats kept saying in every election for 20 years,  Republicans want to take away your home! They want to take away your Social Security,  and yet it never happened. Nothing ever happened to Social Security. So after a while voters began to tune Democrats out on this.Now, the polling data from AP suggests that we re at the beginning of that same phenomena happening on government shutdowns. There have been some, and no calamity ever happens. People don t die. People continue to get their checks. Yeah, you might lose the sleigh ride concession at Jellystone Park for a while, but for the most part nothing happens to anybody. Hell, folks, they shut the government down with a half-inch of snow in that town!So we ve got the Newt Gingrich theory. We have another caller theory that Trump has got to get rid of his opposition in the Republican Party before he can drain the entire swamp; everybody should be patient here. Look, I don t think the president s caving on the idea here, folks. Don t anybody misunderstand me. I don t think the president is essentially saying,  Forget the wall. Can t do it. Never gonna do it.  That s not what s going on here. But you elected the fight as well, and a lot of people are beginning to get a little uneasy here at the apparent lack of any of that on this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We have a tweet here from Mark Meadows who is one of the two members of the Republican Congress with Jim Jordan and maybe others who are dead set in favor of finding the money to fund the building of the wall. Congressman Meadows is from North Carolina. His tweet says,  Punting to February 8th on the continuing resolution not only gives Democrats a Christmas present, it offers them a Valentine s Day gift. Democrats will win, the wall will not be built, and Congress will once again have punted when we should have been taking a stand. The time to fight is now. Zero excuse.  Note no mention of President Trump there. He s throwing this all off on Republicans in Congress, where it  I call your attention back to the sound bite on August 1st of this year I played with President Trump in which he   and he wasn t complaining. He was educating. He was talking about funding of the wall and how difficult it is. Because, folks, I m telling you, I m not exaggerating on this.There isn t anybody in that town that wants it, for any number of reasons. But the primary reason why is that there s nobody in that town that thinks illegal immigration is a problem! It s not a crisis. What s happening as a result of it is no big deal. That s their attitude, and the reason for that is they don t get affected by it. They re insulated. They don t live on the border. They don t vacation at the border. They don t even go to the border.Now, of course," the problems are not even contained at the border. They re all over. But the point is they are not  These people in Washington are not confronted with the consequences of their beliefs on any of this. They don t think it s a crisis. They don t think it s an emergency. They don t think America is in any peril whatsoever. And they think that those of us who do their are just knee-jerk reactionaries who don t know what we re talking about and really can t be listened to.   "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/18/nobody-in-washington-wants-the-wall/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 18, 2018RUSH: Now, about the wall funding, there s news on that, and it isn t  (sigh) It isn t good. Sarah Sanders apparently said today that the Trump administration is willing to take less than $5 billion in order to get the wall built. Of course, there s nobody in that town that wants it. We re always talking about Pelosi and Chuck. You know, Chuck and Nancy. Nobody wants the wall. There isn t a single person, and the reason they don t want the wall is because they don t want Trump to get it.It s that simple. It has nothing to do with the issue and has nothing to do with stemming the tide of illegal immigration. They just don t want Trump to get it. So I don t know what backing down from the $5 billion  Sarah Huckabee Sanders said a few minutes ago that the White House could back down from its demand for $5 billion in border wall funding in this year-end spending bill.If that s true, it means the Democrats can get pretty much what they want and block anything they don t want simply by promising to shut down the government, because that s what s on the table.  We re gonna shut down the government! Shut down    Okay! Well, we ll reduce the demand.  Why not just go with the enlarged defense budget and take the $5 billion out of the defense budget to build the wall like they said they were gonna do when Chuck and Nancy first presented their blockade of this?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Kalamazoo, Michigan, first up. Hello, Bill. Great to have you with us, sir.CALLER: Good afternoon, Rush. About Trump s changes to the funding for the border wall, this is reminding me too much  You know how everybody s been musing about George H. W. Bush recently. Well, this move, if it s played out according to what you re saying, I think that Trump may have killed off his chance for a second term in the same way that George H. W. Bush ran on the platform of no new taxes and then when he backed off of that during his term. He lost his support.RUSH: Yeah. I totally get where you re coming from. Let me try something with you here, though. I have spoken on previous occasions of Trump  pacing,  and the most recent example  Maybe not the most recent, but a very recent example is Christine Blasey Ford. Now, granted, that s not an issue on which Trump ran for election and won. But after she came forward and said whatever it was she said, Trump s first reaction was to say he found her very compelling, and that if there s truths to what she said, that Kavanaugh s gone.Remember, a lot of people said,  What do you mean, if she ?  He does it all the time. When the first discussions of repeal and replace Obamacare came out, Trump said some things that made it sound like he was perfectly willing to compromise with Democrats on it. If I applied myself, I could think of five or six of these. There s actually a very good one that s not coming to my mind right now, and it was an issue before Christine Blasey Ford came in.What always happens is that after these initial statements  Remember, it was Sarah Sanders on Fox today who said that the White House could back down from its demand for $5 billion in border wall funding in a year-end spending bill. Look, the only reason to do this  If they re serious, the only reason to do this is fear of government shutdown. The ironic thing about this is that polling data is finally starting to show (even in the AP) that government shutdowns have lost their impact in terms of benefiting the Democrats.There have been so many of  em, there have been so many threats, and nothing happens. It s like for 20 years the Democrats told senior citizens,  If you vote for Republicans, you re gonna lose your Social Security! They re gonna kick you out of your house,  and Republicans won elections and nothing ever happened to people s Social Security. Seasoned citizens finally stopped listening to Democrats, and the polling data suggests much the same thing is happening here with this never-ending,  Republicans want to shut down the government and deny you your benefits. You ve got Elijah Cummings of the Congressional Black Caucasians is out there saying if the government shuts down, government employees will not have any money to buy toys for their kids this Christmas. Are you kidding me? If they haven t already bought toys for their kids, I got a clue: Your kids are not getting any toys. It s December 18th, for crying out loud! They wouldn t be losing any money any time soon. This is all smoke and mirrors and made up. Trump has  I developed a term for this called  pacing. Trump s initial statement on something is to make it sound like he s acquiescing or participating or cooperating and then he always retreats back to his original position of  no deal.  Now, I was at the White House yesterday. That s why I wasn t here. There was a beautiful White House Christmas reception yesterday from 4 to 8 p.m. I was there, and I got there earlier by request, and I  (chuckles) Look, this is not what I heard yesterday. All I can tell you, it s not what I heard   or last night.When I saw Sarah Huckabee Sanders on TV today, when I saw her saying that, I said,  I heard the exact opposite last night.  I don t mean to be getting anybody in trouble here. But remember the original option on the table from Trump was,  If Chuck and Nancy wouldn t cooperate, we ll just expand the defense budget by $37 billion and take five of that 37, $5 billion of that and build a wall with it.  Even if the defense budget doesn t expand by 37 just take $5 billion. There s $5 billion in defense budget somewhere. Just take that.That was what Trump was gonna do to get the wall built under the premise that the president can take whatever action necessary he deems necessary for national security. So I know this looks like  Read my lips: No new taxes  and caving on it. I know it does. I m not here to defend it, either. Don t misunderstand. I m just telling you that it s not unusual for Trump to do this. Now, on this issue it s very alarming because this is the issue that got him elected. This is an issue that your supporters are saying,  Don t tease us! Don t play games on this. Stay straight. I m sure that s what a lot of you are thinking. I understand it.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This is Troy in Queen Creek, Arizona. Hi, Troy. Thank you for calling, sir.CALLER: Hey, Rush. Thanks for taking my call. Yeah, so I m a married Millennial dad, two young boys, a beautiful wife, in a border state, here, Rush, and the reason why I voted and so many people that I know voted for Trump is for border security and illegal immigration. And I know that was a staple of his campaign, and I say it s a staple of his presidency, and I say,  Shut it down.  Shut the government down, roll with the punches and, you know, just show us that that s the reason why we voted you in. I think it s paramount to his reelection.RUSH: You think his presidency s on the line now because you re afraid he s caving?CALLER: I m afraid he s caving, Rush, yeah. I woke up this morning, I read the news, and I saw that the bill may be off the table   you know, the amount of money and the construction of the wall   and it just made me a little disheartened. I m such a huge Trump supporter, and I just don t like seeing that.RUSH: What did you ? Are you referring to Sarah Sanders, that story, saying that maybe they would come down off the $5 billion, or did you see something else that has you concerned?CALLER: I did, yes. That and the Drudge Report. I read that quite a bit.RUSH: Let s see. What did the the Drudge  Hang on a minute. Let me call to make sure  cause I like to know what my callers  It says,  Wall Funding off Table.  Is that the headline that you saw?CALLER: That s one of the ones I read, yeah.RUSH: Let me click on it and see what it goes to,  cause that will tell us everything. Who is this? Okay. It s CNBC.  White House Suggests it Could Back Down on $5 Billion   That s the Sarah Sanders. Essentially that s what she said on Fox this morning.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: And I don t know if this is shutdown related or not. Again, I don t know if this is just Trump  Look, Republicans have an instinctive fear of government shutdowns and the fact that they re gonna lose them. Even though there s a poll out today cited this last hour the AP, the American people no longer have this conventional wisdom view that government shutdowns are the result of Republicans being mean-spirited extremists or any of that.It doesn t have the  The world doesn t end when these things happen, you know, the Democrats can t keep getting away with,  Your life ends if the government shuts down,  because nothing happens. Life goes on. So it could just be that Trump is trying to show his willingness to cooperate, to show that the Democrats won t  Look, I m here to tell you, Troy   and I m not trying to talk you out of anything; please don t misunderstand.I m just here to tell you, there isn t a single person in that town that wants this wall. No, I take it back. Some House Freedom Caucus members are hell-bent on getting it. Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows are insistent on getting the wall built. Outside of those two and Trump and maybe some stragglers in the House, nobody in that town wants this wall. Now, don t misunderstand my telling you that. I m just trying to give you an idea of the obstacle this is.There isn t anybody in that town that wants this. Trump is all alone in this, and I don t know whether he is simply making this statement and sends Sarah Sanders out there to send a signal that the White House willing to cooperate with the Democrats so that ultimately the Democrats are shown to be the immovable objects. It s not the first time, if that s what s happening. I can just tell you, I was there yesterday.By the way, speaking  Troy, thanks for the call.  I feel you,  as they say. I understand your queasiness.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I just want to remind you all of something. From the very beginning, I made the point that the media did not make Donald Trump and therefore the media cannot destroy him. What comes next that I said? Hmm? I said,  The only person that can destroy Donald Trump is Donald Trump.  The only person that can separate Donald Trump s voters from Donald Trump is Donald Trump. Meaning: His voters are loyal; the media cannot talk them out of supporting him no matter what they say about him, no matter what allegations they make.Only Trump can do that, and I say this  We ve had two calls today and both of are from people who are panicking. That may be too strong a word. They re disappointed that this claim that the White House has made they ll come off the $5 billion for the border wall is tantamount to caving. The wall, which equals border security and stopping illegal immigration  As our last caller said, that is why Donald Trump got the elected.He was the only one that was believable when he said this was his intent. Voters that voted for Trump know that nobody in Washington really cares about illegal immigration to the point of stopping it. Those who said they did were not trusted to mean it. But Trump was trusted to mean it. So, look, folks  (sigh) I m kind of between a rock and a hard place here because I was there last night, and this subject came up, and this was not what was discussed.Now, this is not to say that people would be open and honest with me. After all, I m a guy that has a microphone that reaches gazillions of people, and so they might not be forthcoming or they might not want to reveal what s really going on. I totally understand that. I m not lost in this belief that nobody would ever try to use me or mislead me to do something. But there was literally no indication of this. As I say, there s no reason to suggest that I would have been given indication, either. But what I did hear was the exact opposite of this.Look, I can t say any more and I can t attach names to it,  cause obviously it s a fluid the situation. I don t want to put anybody on the spot here. I m just telling you, when I saw Sarah Huckabee   and I saw her last night. I didn t talk about anything with her. Just pleasantries. But when I saw her on Fox today make the statement, I said,  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.  A little bitty warning tick or two started happening to me. But we ll see. Time goes on and we ll find out in due course. This is Henderson, Nevada, next, near Las Vegas. Brian. Great to have you on the program, sir. Hi.CALLER: Rush, it s an honor to speak to you again. And like your two previous callers, I was a bit down in the dumps this morning with the news also. But you helped allay my fears with your pacing comments about how our president responds, you know, the way he paces his comments back. So I wanted to take this in a different angle. I remember back in 2005-2006 when the McCain-Kennedy immigration bill was trying to be stuff down our throats and it looked like the skids were greased, it was gonna happen   and then a funny thing happened.The heartland of America rose up and began ringing the phone lines off the hooks in Washington, D.C., for about a week or 10 days, and suddenly that thing went from the front burner to the back room, and eventually it was defeated. And what you have to say about our president is so true. He s gotta feel isolated at times like, you know, he s the only one out there, you know, putting on the armor and going to battle every day. So what I would like to see, Rush, is for the American people   the deplorables, the Tea Party folks, you know, the freedom people, caucus people   everybody rise up and support our president and hit those phone lines again, let Washington, D.C., know how we really feel about this issue.RUSH: Well, I remember that and you are exactly right. In 2005-2006, they thought they had it in the back. They did. I m telling you, you people in this audience and elsewhere in America   without being prompted, without being given any phone numbers or fax numbers or email addresses   Washington was overrun with public comment. It shut down operations. It shut down switchboards, and it just happened. It was organic, as I say, and that s why they believed it in Washington. There was nobody out there pushing it.There wasn t some loco weed out there promoting it, claiming credit for having all this happen. It was just  Like the Tea Party itself was organic   and it did. It intimidated  em. It frightened  em much like the yellow vests intimidated and frightened Macron, except this didn t happen in the streets. This happened with public opinion being expressed peaceably by millions of citizens. Your idea is a good one. I cannot emphasize  I would not use the word isolated, although it fits. But isolated carries with it a meaning or a tinge of loneliness.I don t think Trump is lonely. He s just alone in this, on this issue, and he s alone on the idea of his presidency succeeding. He s got that entire town arrayed against him with every bit of power that town can amass. It is arrayed against Donald Trump. So I don t think he can take  em on head on. There have to be end runs. There have to be head feints. There has to be a little subterfuge, which is why I acknowledge the Trump pacing. He did it with DACA. He did the same thing when DACA came up.He clearly sent a signal that he was all for the children, all for the kids, all for doing it, and he s done it  Climate change. Do you remember when he had that interview with the New York Times and then when he was a candidate. Before the Paris climate accords, he made it sound like he was open to the possibility of signing on? And then when the pedal hit the metal and the rubber hit the road, we found out that he had not moved at all. He was just publicly posturing for the value of showing that he was flexible and was not closed mind on things.So this is by no means the first time something like this has been done. And if the effort is, if the strategery is to try to demonstrate to as many people as possible the real inflexibility here   and remember the term the White House is using  They re not talking wall so much. They used the term  border security,  and to the to the extent that Trump can demonstrate to the large number of people possible that the Democrat Party doesn t care about it, he would consider that part of winning the issue. Cause I don t think he believes that he single-handedly can force a wall on an entire town that doesn t want it. Now, he s gonna need public support for it, but if he can demonstrate to people   and again, I don t know that this is what s being executed here in terms of strategy. But it would be really helpful if he could demonstrate that Chuck and Nancy have no interest and that anything they say about it is just a bogus lie, whenever they talk about needing border security, agreeing with the premise.But they re both on record   and so is everybody else on that town   as  No wall. No wall! Hell no. No wall.  That s the last thing anybody wants in that town. He s alone on that, and so I know you would love to see him become a steamroller and just,  Pffft!  power over and through everybody, but I don t think he thinks that s the way he s gonna get there. And there are ways he can get this wall built without Congress signing off on it (i.e., the defense budget) as we have discussed previously.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here s Sarah Sanders this afternoon. I guess this was at the   yeah   daily press briefing. There was an unidentified Drive-By interrogator who said,  $1.6 billion in border wall funding or continuing resolution to take this matter up after the Christmas break, what are you gonna do? SANDERS: The president threw out a lot of ideas. We re disappointed in the fact that they ve yet to actually vote on something and pass something. So when they do that, we ll make a determination on whether or not we re gonna sign that. In the meantime, we re looking at every avenue available to us possible. The president s asked every one of his cabinet secretaries to look for funding that can be used to protect our borders and give the president the ability to fulfill his constitutional obligation to protect the American people by having a secure border. So we re looking at the other options.RUSH: All right.SANDERS: The president has asked every agency to look and see if they have money that can be used for that purpose.RUSH: Okay. Now, this makes sense with  I don t mean to be speaking in code here. It s just that the conversations I had yesterday were off record and I was not there as a journalist. I was an invited guest. But I m just telling you that this business of caving on the wall never came up. It was the exact opposite, and I m telling you right now that when she says here that we re looking  for funding that can be used to protect our borders,  the president is  looking at other options. He  has asked every agency to look and see if they have money that can be used for that purpose,  it dovetails exactly with what I heard! Meaning:  We don t care if Chuck and Nancy are forthcoming with any money in this budget deal. We don t care if the Democrats join us. We don t care if the Republicans don t. We re looking for money to build this wall elsewhere in the budget, with the president being able to earmark it under the terms that he is protecting national security.  The idea of  I know she said that we re willing to come off the $5 billion figure.That sent some shockwaves through the troops, and I think she was clarifying it here,  cause I m telling you, this is consistent with what  Look, folks, I don t know what. Last Friday that it was publicly posited that Trump could get money from the defense budget to do this by requesting an additional $37 billion and taking $5 billion of that to build a wall! And making them say he can t do it! And whatever he does they re gonna sue, they re gonna take it to court, they re gonna stop. Whatever it is.But I just can t see him caving on this. I just can t see this as being  Read my lips: No new taxes  and then,  Read my lips: I m raising taxes  moment. I just can t see this. It doesn t make sense with anything that was discussed last night. That s why I was shocked when Sarah Sanders said, but she did say what she said. You have to listen to it. But this clarification makes a lot more sense, things that  I don t mean to tease you with this. I m just being honest. I can t divulge things that were said to me.It was not  They were not said to me to be repeated. I don t even know if they were looking  (interruption) Yeah, they were giving me heads up, but it was their business to announce it what they re gonna do when they want to but I think I can tell you with certainty that it s not time to panic here over this, and if I m wrong we ll know soon enough.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/11/trump-jousts-with-chuck-and-nancy-on-the-wall/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 11, 2018RUSH: It s happening right now in the Oval Office. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer meeting with President Trump over the funding of the border wall. And I think I understand what s going on here, and I m gonna try to explain it to you.Greetings, my friends. Great to have you with us, as always. Telephone number, if you want to be on the program, 800-282-2882, and send an email to ElRushbo@eibnet.us.Okay. So this really revolves around what does Trump have, as in leverage over Schumer and Pelosi? They don t want a wall. They ve offered a paltry $1.3 billion. Trump wants $5 billion. He wants $5 billion to build a wall. Schumer, Pelosi don t want a wall, but they have offered $1.3 billion as a starting point.They think they hold all the cards. I mean, if they deny Trump any of the federal budget to build a wall as the incoming king and queen of the   well, she s gonna be the queen of the House. Schumer is, course, gonna be the minority over in the Senate, but he s still the Democrat leader there, so that s why they re both up there.So Trump wants $5 billion. Here s what s happened. The original budget request for the Department of Defense, Trump did not give the secretary of defense, Mad Dog Mattis, every dime that he asked for. Trump actually has submitted a budget, or will, that does not contain   this is before today   the precise amount of money that Mattis wants. Pelosi and Schumer offering 1.3. Trump say he wants $5 billion. All of a sudden Trump has changed his mind on the defense budget, and he has told Mattis to submit a defense budget for the Pentagon of $750 billion.This will be the proposal for fiscal year 2020. This is different from a previous promise that Trump had made to cut the defense budget. It wasn t much, but it was still a cut rather than what usually are automatic expenses. The $750 billion number came out of a meeting last week when Trump got the lay of the land and figured out that Pelosi and Schumer are probably not going to come close to the $5 billion or agreeing to it in the budget, because this is all gonna happen next year. And they re trying to get some of this done before the budget expires at the end of this year, government shutdown on December 21st if they don t come to any sort of an agreement on spending for the remainder of the year.Now, the original defense budget was $733 billion. That s what Trump had previously said that he would support. Now he s asked Mattis to go back and resubmit 750. The upshot is that if Pelosi and Schumer do not join him and authorize and agree to $5 billion for the wall, Trump is gonna take it out of the military budget. That s why the increase from $733 billion to $750 billion. There s $34 billion additional in the defense budget authorization or request than what the original number was.And Trump is said to be thinking of getting the $5 billion, if Pelosi and Schumer don t play ball   and there s no reason for them to. They don t want a wall. They want no part of Trump having any kind of success on his key issue. They re up there talking to him. I think it s exploratory to figure out what his mood is, to figure out where his head is.But as far as the Democrats are concerned, they now run the town again. And since they have the House of Representatives and run the Ways and Means Committee in the House, which is where all spending bills must, by law, originate, unless presidents try to play games with executive actions and executive orders. But all legislative funding bills must begin in the House in the Ways and Means Committee.So it looks like Trump, in requesting an additional $34 billion for defense, could simply say I m gonna build a wall out of defense money, and I m gonna call it a national security project. This is one of the theories that is being bandied about. And this in effect would be an end run around Pelosi and Schumer and anybody else in Congress, either party, neither of whom want a wall, if we get down to brass tacks.But it s key for Trump, as you know. It s the seminal primary campaign issue that got him elected. Getting a handle on border security, illegal immigration, and building a wall. And I think Trump knows that he s got to get something done on that score, especially now with the phony attempts to claim that private financial transactions between him and a couple of women who were trying to extort him are somehow crimes which would qualify as impeachable or indictable crimes. It s just absurd.Mark Penn has written a piece on this today which covers much of the ground we covered on that whole premise yesterday. And there s some others weighing in on it as well who I think understand exactly what s going on. When you compare, by the way, what one of the lines in Mark Penn s column is that we are on the verge of going back to the horrible days of 1998, which is a period of time Mark Penn says we should not ever want to return to.What happened in 1998? Well, that s when Bill Clinton was impeached, and everybody thought he was impeached over sex. He actually wasn t impeached over sex. He was impeached because he lied under oath during grand jury testimony and attempted to get other people to lie under oath, which was a direct assault on, of course, the rule of law and the Constitution.But everybody thought that the Republicans were going after Clinton for sex, having an illicit affair with a 19-year-old, helpless intern who had groupie eyes and groupie heart and was take advantage of. And Penn says, we re going back now to sex, we re gonna go back, we re gonna get rid of another president because of sex? And this isn t even about sex. The SDNY and Mueller will say,  It isn t about sex. This is about illegal campaign finance violations.  It s not that at all! And, if necessary, we ll revisit this to again make the point.But, you see, here s the thing. Back to the budget business with Pelosi and Schumer. Congress does not usually earmark every dollar in the federal budget and how it must be spent. They designate areas and how much money an area or an item or a department is going to get. I s done, but very rarely does Congress actually specify dollar for dollar where money must be spent.So in the defense budget, if there s $34 billion extra and Congress does not say that the money must be spent here, and if they do not earmark every dollar of the defense budget for certain projects, that means Trump s theory is that, hey, that s the money that s not earmarked, it s not specified, I can take it and do with it what I want since I m commander-in-chief.If the Democrats figure this out, figure out this is what s going on, then they might try to earmark everything, or they might try to put something in legislation specifying that not a single penny of the defense budget or any other budget can be used to build a wall   or, as they might say,  Nothing over $1.3 billion.  Now, you might be saying,  Well, if they re totally opposed to it, why allow $1.3 billion? Well, it s to allow them to say they care about border security. It s to allow them to say that they ve authorized $1.3 billion. It s also not nearly enough to get the job done. It s not nearly enough to build a serious wall in all of the places that a serious wall needs to be built. But it will allow them cover. It will allow them to be able to say (and for the media to say about them) that,  Hey, we care about border security. We worked with the president. But his demands were just over the top and unreal and unusual. We offered $1.3 billion, and he refused it and is now making an end run.  The bottom line for Trump is: Get it done. If he has to expand the defense budget by $34 billion and go take an additional $3.5 or the total $5 billion out of it to get the wall built, he s got to do it. That is, for lack of a better term, the security blanket that Trump has.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So right now the cable news networks are showing delayed video of Trump and Pence and Pelosi and Schumer in the Oval Orifice. No details on the talks yet, but I can tell you, I m pretty confident how this might manifest itself,  cause I really can t see Pelosi and Schumer agreeing to this $5 billion. They don t want a wall! They certainly  They don t want Trump to have any kind, at this stage   any kind of success   on an issue, especially one that was his primary campaign issue and one they know is the reason he got elected.They want him to crash and burn on this. So it s gonna be up to Trump to creatively find money that they don t authorize, and they re gonna have to find ways to make sure that Trump can t spend money that they haven t authorized, because they haven t earmarked it. Now, everybody in the room s all smiles and everything. But we re gonna find out here. You know, what does Trump have? What leverage does he have? We don t know.We know that he s sitting on documents, classified documents about the Russia investigation that apparently are dynamite and will blow the lid off a whole lot of people and careers, and we ve been told that he s waiting to release all of this for his reelection effort in 2020. He doesn t want to release it too soon. He doesn t want it to not work when he releases it. I don t know if any of the classified data he s holding involves Schumer or Pelosi or would frighten them enough about the impact it would have on the Democrat Party.So if he doesn t have any leverage other than something like that or something we don t know about, then it ll be down to his negotiating skills and The Art of the Deal and this kind of thing and how he can make these people understand the severity and the seriousness of this. But, see, they don t want a border wall, and they really don t want a very massive reduction in illegal immigration anyway. They need their permanent underclass.They need a constant stream of people that cannot provide for themselves and can t speak the language. They need that group of people. The theory is that the vast majority of them are gonna vote Democrat. There s also a story in the Stack here: 750 million people want to migrate. I don t know how they reached them, but they ve got a poll here that said 750 million people want to migrate, and the U.S. is the most popular destination.This is a Gallup world poll that  revealed yesterday more than 750 million adults   or 15% of the world s population   between 2015 and 2017 said that they would like to move to another country if they could. That s up from 14% three years ago. The U.S. has consistently ranked as the No. 1 destination for potential migrants.  Really? That s a shock. We are the No. 1. sought out destination now; 750 million people want to migrate to the U.S.I ask you, based on anything that we have seen, everything that we ve seen in the past two years: Who in Washington wants to put a stop to it? I m being serious. Neither political party shows much interest at all in seriously dealing with this. The Democrat Party specifically seems to be just the opposite: Encouraging it, promoting it, and seeking to take advantage of it. It s 750 million people   and, by the way, I think the number is small. I think it would be many, many, many millions more than that if Gallup s World Survey could actually find.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, we were rolling on it. Of course we re gonna have it. Apparently, this meeting in the Oval Office   and Trump left the cameras in again, and you know what he does that, it s always great. Apparently, he just took Pelosi and Schumer to school on the importance of securing the border and asking,  Doesn t everybody want border security?  forcing them to say,  Yeah.  I mean, they couldn t very well sit there and say  no. He s telling them how legislation works. He s telling  em,  I ll be happy to shut this thing down like we did last time   and, Chuck, you got the blame for it. It was called the Schumer Shutdown, and I ll be happy to do it again. I ll be more than happy to do it again. We re gonna have border security. Who doesn t want border security?  You know, and this is what happens. These two people show up   Pelosi and Schumer show up   and they believe that they re having a meeting with an absolute idiot.They believe they re having meeting with a bumpkin, somebody who doesn t know what they re doing, and certainly somebody   Donald Trump   who doesn t know how Washington works. They, on the other hand, show up arrogantly and condescendingly filled with uber-confidence thinking that they re gonna take this guy to school.  He just lost the midterm elections! He s on the verge of being impeached. We re gonna have this guy in the palm of our hand.  What happens, as is classic in those kinds of situations, is they were embarrassed. Cause Trump schooled them on how legislation happens and it s gonna happen and that he knows how it happens, and that he s more than willing to shut down the government! How many times have we actually articulated here that Republicans ought to be courageous about this rather than bowing to media pressure and bowing to Democrat pressure? Shut it down! The government gets shut down many times a year anyway. Nobody even notices. Shut it down. The media gonna say what they gonna say about us regardless what happens.So do the right thing! You got something you really want and the only leverage and pressure you have is to take away something precious to them? Shut it down. Trump said,  I ll be happy to. I ll be glad to   more than happy to   shut it down and I ll take the credit for it, because everybody wants border security, right? Who s against border security? Nancy, you understand we need to secure the border, right? (sputtering)  Uh, uh   And Trump made mention of the fact that she s on thin ice with the Democrats in terms of the speaker election. I mean, he was in total command of the meeting, which I guarantee you is exactly the opposite of what Pelosi and Chuck Schumer thought the atmospherics would be when they walked into that room. Schumer was yelling at Trump at some point because he was just pounding on Pelosi.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Chuck and Nancy are doing a little press conference here outside the White House. Our microphones are there. We ve missed much of this, but let s JIP it here just to catch the tail end and I ll fill you in.SCHUMER: One final point.REPORTERS: (shouting questions)SCHUMER: No, no, no!REPORTER: (shouting questions)SCHUMER: Stop!REPORTER: (fall silent)SCHUMER: Okay. One final point. The $1.3 billion that we gave him last year for border security   no wall, but border security   less than 6% of it has been spent. They haven t even spent last year s money, and now they re demanding much, much more this year.REPORTER: (shouting questions)SCHUMER: Go ahead. Now, we re just gonna take questions on this subject only.REPORTER: Given what we saw in there, the bickering, back-and-forth, what does it say about your ability to work with this president over the next two years?PELOSI: Well, I ve told the president, as I ve said over and over again: This new Congress will be something different from the Congress we have now. It will be a Congress of transparency so that the American people can see, not passing a tax bill with $7 trillion impact on the economy in the dark of night, speed of light, so nobody can see what it is without hearings or any expert opinions on it. So it will be about transparency. It will be about reaching out  RUSH: All right. All right. That s sufficient. What happened is that Schumer came out and started calling this  the Trump Shutdown,  started saying how eager Trump is to shut down the government. (paraphrased)  But that we   we, Pelosi and me, we   offered Trump two different ways out of this,  and both of them involve a continuing resolution. None of them involve actually doing a budget. Schumer made a point,  This is how we ve been funding government for a long time now. We offered him two ways to do this, but he wants to shut down the government. He had a little temper tantrum in there,  Schumer said,  and these are getting little tiresome, but that s the way the president is. We ve given him two ways out of this.  Schumer made the point,  What happened to Mexico paying for the wall? I thought Trump said that Mexico was gonna pay for the wall, but apparently that s off the table now. So, anyway, in this meeting, I guess Trump really got to  em, really irritated  em. They re now out talking to the press and trying to reestablish a narrative for what actually happened in there, and as soon as I get the audio from the meeting in the Oval Office, we will have that for you.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This is obviously a contentious meeting in the White House, a stare down between Trump and Pelosi and Schumer, and they felt it necessary to go back out to the microphones outside the White House and try to reestablish themselves as in control of the narrative and to try to paint Trump as immature and childish and had a little bit of a temper tantrum. But I wasn t able to hear it either.It was happening during the opening segment of the program, but reports I got on it were that Trump humiliated these people. He was just schooling them and telling them the way things have to be, the way things are gonna be, and reminding them that any shutdown is gonna be on them. He ll happily take the credit for it, reminding Pelosi she s not a lock for Speaker of the House election for the Democrats.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. So what happened is that Trump maneuvered Pelosi and Schumer into beginning the negotiations when they didn t expect them to begin. Normally what happens is these meetings occur, cabinet meetings that we ve seen or, in this case, Schumer, Pelosi, and the media s allowed in. And there are handshakes and smiles all around, and everybody says how wonderful everybody is.And then the media is ushered out and the meeting begins. Trump began the meeting with the media in there, with the cameras in there. And it took a while, Pelosi and Schumer finally figured out what was going on. They ve seen this drill.Trump ran this same kind of a drill during a cabinet meeting and embarrassed Dianne Feinstein on a couple of issues. And he does it occasionally. He did it today and Pelosi finally figured out what was going and was not happy. She wanted this open discussion shut down so that nobody, like you and me, could hear it.PELOSI: We re here to have a conversation in a careful way, so I don t think we should have a debate in front of the press on this. But the fact is the House Republicans could bring up this bill if they had the votes immediately and set the tone for what you want.THE PRESIDENT: If we thought we were gonna get it passed in the Senate, Nancy, we would do it immediately. We d get it passed very easily in the House. We would get it ñ (interruption) Nancy, I d have it passed in two seconds. It doesn t matter, though, because we can t get it passed in the Senate because we need 10 Democrat votes.PELOSI: Well, let us have our conversation, and then we ll meet with the press again.RUSH: See, she doesn t want to hear any of this. She doesn t want you hearing any of this. She and Schumer did not want you or anybody hearing Trump give the lay of the land on this. (paraphrasing)  We thought we were gonna get it passed in the Senate. We could get it passed easily in the House, Nancy, right now. You re not running the place yet. I can get it passed in the House right now. We can t get it passed in the Senate. We need 10 Democrats. Pelosi says, oh, no, oh, no  cause it s border security. Trump s got  em set up here in such a way that they are advocating no border security. He s positioned this so that they re kind of in a no-win. They have to agree with the concept of border security in this meeting even though they don t mean it in truth. They don t mean it in terms of building a wall. They don t mean it in terms of it of actually doing anything, but they have to say it. Common sense says any nation would secure its border. They cannot be seen opposing that.But at the same time, Trump maneuvering her into agreeing with the concept. She doesn t want that, either. So she s getting very, very nervous. And Trump says (paraphrasing),  We can t get it passed in the Senate. We need 10 Democrats who are not interested in border security.  And Pelosi says,  Well, well, let s have our conversation and we can meet with the press later.  Here s Trump again.THE PRESIDENT: Chuck, did you want to say something?SCHUMER: Yeah. Here s what I want to say. We have a lot of disagreements here. The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much of the wall is built and how much is there. But that s not the point here.THE PRESIDENT: The Washington Post?SCHUMER: We have a disagreement about the wall, whether it s effective or   not on border security, but on the wall. We do not want to shut down the government. You were called 20 times to shut down the government. You say,  I want to shut down the government.  We don t. We want to come to an agreement. If we can t come to an agreement, we have solutions that will pass the House and Senate right now and will not shut down the government, and that s what we re urging you to do. Not threaten to shut down the government  cause you just did it,  cause you can t get your way.THE PRESIDENT: The last time you shut it down  SCHUMER: Yeah. Let me tell you something Mr. President. You just say, my way or we ll shut down the government. We have a proposal that Democrats and Republicans will support to do a CR that will not shut down the government. We urge you to take it.THE PRESIDENT: And if it s not good border security, I won t take it.SCHUMER: It is very  RUSH: And it s not good border security  cause it doesn t feature the wall. The wall is it. They don t want the wall. Trump does. Trump needs the wall. The nation needs the wall. These people don t want there to be a wall. It would be a huge defeat for the Democrats, who apparently have just retaken government back in the November midterms. If they agree to a wall, then why win? Their base would be livid with them, even though a wall is a good thing, the base would be livid with them for losing!So Schumer and Pelosi have to provide a stiff upper lip here and they have to be insulting of the president and they have to offer a bunch of stuff that s meaningless. But we ve got two different ways we can go with great border security. Trump knows there s no border security in these two ideas. They re nothing more than continuing resolutions which don t do anything to fix the budgeting process, they don t solve any real problems, it just allows everybody to get out of town for the Christmas holidays and say they ve done their job to keep the government up and running.And Trump, let s face it, Trump s got nothing to lose here. I mean, in the big scheme of things he s got nothing to lose by shutting down the government, he s got nothing to lose by insisting on this wall, he s got nothing to lose playing hardball with these people on this. That s the real thing. The only thing Trump s got right now is his continuing level of support from his base voters. He s got to hold on to that. If he does anything to start that wavering, then there could be problems. Next bite, Pelosi.PELOSI: We came in here in good faith, and we re entering into a   of this kind of discussion in the public view.THE PRESIDENT: But it s not bad, Nancy. It s called transparency.PELOSI: I know. It s not transparency when we re not stipulating to a set of facts and when we want to have a debate with you about saying we confront some of those facts.THE PRESIDENT: You know what? We need border security. That s what we re going to be talking about. Border security. If we don t have border security, we ll shut down the government.RUSH: If we don t have border security, we ll shut down the government. It s only been two years, and it s time to do this, and I really don t think Trump has much to lose by insisting on this. They do. You know, they claim to not want a government shutdown. BS! They love government shutdowns  cause their buddies in the media start blaming Trump or any nearby Republican for it. They love shutting down the government. Trump ought to call them on it. Final bite. This is Schumer, Trump telling Schumer he s gonna shut the government down to get his wall and he s gonna be proud to do it.SCHUMER: Twenty times you have called for  I will shut down the government if I don t get my wall.  None of us have said  THE PRESIDENT: You want to know something?SCHUMER: You ve said it. You.THE PRESIDENT: I ll take it.SCHUMER: Okay. Good.THE PRESIDENT: You know what I ll say? Yes, if we don t get what we want one way or the other, whether it s through you, through our military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government.SCHUMER: Okay, fair enough. We disagree. We disagree.THE PRESIDENT: I am proud. And I ll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don t want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I m not gonna blame you for it. The last time you shut it down, it didn t work. I will take the mantle of shutting down and I m gonna shut it down for border security.SCHUMER: We believe you.RUSH: And this is not what they expected to happen. They didn t expect any of this to be public. They did not expect to encounter a Trump eager and apparently willing to shut down the government. They thought they would run into a compliant, maybe even acquiescent Trump.See, in their world, Trump lost the election so he ought to be humble. In their world, Trump lost the election so he ought to be trying to get along with them. They run the show now. I mean, the establishment won the House back so now they run that town again and Trump should know that.And Trump s not playing ball the bay they envisioned it and he certainly shocked them by having the meeting televised publicly, which is why they had to make a mad dash to the microphones and cameras outside the White House to try to reestablish the narrative. But I m glad you were able to hear that because it s a firm implantation of Trump and his position on the wall, which is desperately needed.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So Pelosi tells Trump at the beginning of their meeting in the Oval Office that she s got a new Congress coming and it s gonna be one of transparency, unlike the current Congress, she says,  It s gonna be transparent, Mr. President.  And then Trump,  Okay, fine, let s do some transparency here in the meeting,  and Pelosi wanted no part of it, wanted it stopped. Didn t like the set of facts Trump was using.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/23/the-latest-on-the-shutdown-and-state-of-the-union/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 23, 2019RUSH: The Senate has said votes on two bills that could end the shutdown. They are both expected to fail because they re gonna need seven Democrats. These are basically bills that will provide $5.7 billion for the wall, but to continue the current status and treatment for, what is it, 400,000 DACA people and some TPS people, Democrats are saying no way, no how. Trump has sent a letter to Pelosi saying,  Hey, I ll see you next Tuesday for the State of the Union. Despite the fact that she s disinvited him, he has sent her a letter saying he s showing up anyway. CNN is asking, (paraphrasing)  Why in the world does Trump even want to do a State of the Union show? Why? I mean, it s not gonna sway public opinion. Nobody watches these anyway.  Little Brian Stelter is saying We ll have the sound bite. (paraphrasing)  Why does Trump want to do this?Nobody watches these anyway. And if he does a rally like we re hearing, the only people that cover that will be Fox News.  So basically CNN s saying Trump has nowhere to go here because we re gonna freeze him out. We shall see.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The president has sent this letter to Nancy Pelosi (paraphrased),  Hey! I m looking forward to the State of the Union address next Tuesday. I ll see you in the House chamber at whatever time.  The media is saying that this constitutes a flagrant disrespect of the speaker of the House who has disinvited the president. The president can t just show up wherever he wants on Capitol Hill. He s gotta be invited up there by the people that run Capitol Hill.He can t just show up. So he s showing great disrespect for Pelosi and the House in general. I mentioned at the top of the program that there s beginning to be some cracks here in the Democrat resolve. By the way, a lot of people want to know,  What is the status? Where do things stand now?  Here s the deal that Trump proposed. I m gonna give you the basic elements of this.It has $5.7 billion for wall funding, border security, in exchange for the continuation of DACA status for 300,000 and the temporary permanent status for another 200,000 or 300,000, but no pathway to citizenship. No amnesty! No pathway to citizenship! It gives the Democrats a lot of what they want. But it has the $5.7 billion for the wall, which, the Democrats don t want Trump to have any kind of a deal here that constitutes a win, that could be portrayed as a win.I am told that there is a lot of pressure inside the White House on Trump to including a pathway to citizenship for the DACA kids and the TPS people. But I think that would be an egregious error. It s not time for that. It isn t necessary to get this. This is about border security. No amnesty, no pathway to citizenship. None of this. But there s pressure inside the White House for Trump to do this. Look, folks, we all know. We ve talked about it. There are people in there who, A, are trying to sabotage Trump, who think that he s a neophyte, doesn t know what he s doing.And they re trying to massage what he does in their image of what should be done. And then he s got other advisers who, in this case, do think a pathway to citizenship might get a deal. And it might, but that would be self-defeating. I personally think the president has to hold fast on no pathway to citizenship. Just stick with the deal you offered. Stick with it. It s been presented to the Senate. It needs seven Democrats voting for it. That s not gonna happen. I don t think  Nobody expected this to pass. You got 53 Republicans; you need 60 votes in the Senate. They re not gonna get seven Democrats, at least at this stage.The purpose of offering this deal is to demonstrate that one side is willing to compromise, negotiate, cross the aisle, make sure government works, demonstrate cooperation   and whatever all the cliches are that the American people supposedly all want to see. This is another myth, by the way, that the American people at large   the vast majority of them   want the Congress and the president to get along. That assumption is belied by presidential results! The people that voted for Donald Trump do not want Trump getting along with the Democrats if it means the Democrats get what they want!So many cliches. (impression)  The American people want Washington to work. They want to see cooperation. They want to see Republicans crossing the aisle.  It s all a crock. But to the extent that there is a benefit in showing they re willing to talk, right now Trump is winning that. It is Pelosi refusing to even enter a room with Trump. It s Pelosi refusing to even talk about this. She s pandering expressly to her base. This is causing a weakening in the resolve on the left. TheHill.com has a story. Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minnesota) called on his Democratic colleagues to give President Trump the funding for his long-desired border wall   saying its construction is inevitable.  We re gonna get this thing anyway.   Give Trump the money,  Peterson [said] on Tuesday.  I d give him the whole thing   and put strings on it so you make sure he puts the wall where it needs to be. Why are we fighting over this?   says this Democrat.   We re going to build that wall anyway, at some time.  So he s tantamount acknowledging the need for the wall, and he s not a newbie. He s a 15-term congressman. Thirty years this guy s been there.  The 15-term congressman said top Democrats look at him  cross-eyed  when he makes this suggestion.  I guess looking at him cross-eyed is their best argument? That s all they ve got? I think we ve got the sound bite. Let me  Yeah, Collin Peterson. Yeah. Grab sound bite No. 10. This is on KFGO. It s in Fargo, and the interviewee is Representative Collin Peterson, and the host says,  If you were in that room talking about the government shutdown, what would you do? PETERSON: I m a committee chairman. So I m in the room with other leadership.HOST: Right.PETERSON: And I told them,  You guys are making a mistake. Give Trump the money.  I d give him the whole thing. Put strings on it so that you make sure that he puts the wall where it needs to be. Why are we fighting over this? We re gonna build that wall anyway at some time.RUSH: Wow. That s a 15-term, 30-year Democrat congressman, Collin Peterson, saying give him the wall, give him the money. We re gonna build the wall anyway. Meaning, this guy, he s betraying  Wrong word. He is portraying what the actual thinking on the Democrat side is anyway, because you know what he knows? He knows that Schumer and Pelosi and Hillary Clinton and all these other Democrat leaders have   in the past   proposed a wall. They ve all supported building a wall, including spending as much as $56 billion for one.He s also telegraphing that the Democrat position on this is at some point there has to be something done about the-never-ending flow of illegal immigration. Now, I m gonna tell you something, folks. If there are Democrats who think that, it must mean it is really out of control, because the Democrats need a permanent underclass. They have been in favor of amnesty for all the illegals they can round up. They have been for open borders. They have been for anybody getting into this country who wants to get in because they re future Democrat voters.If there are now Democrats willing to go along with putting some limits on it and even building a wall, it tells me that there s a bunch of  em   and I don t know how many, but some of them, at least   who are beginning to think that this whole thing is out of control. Meaning the degree, the number, the amount of illegals. Let s see. Here is Steny  Hoyer Breaks with Pelosi, Says He d Be Open to Trump Giving [State of the Union] on House Floor,  and also disagreeing with her on walls, that  Walls Can Be  Moral.  So there s some fissures, if you will. Meanwhile, during all this Trump s approval rating is holding steady at 45%, amid the government shutdown. Again, this is in TheHill.com. So they re telling us   and CNN s running all these polls,  71% of the American people blame Trump, 71% of the American people want the government shutdown ended, 71% !  Well, how is Trump s approval number at 45% in the shutdown then if all those CNN numbers are true?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Last week the Trump administration ordered tens of thousands of IRS workers to go back to work. Many IRS staffers belong to a union, the National Treasury Employees Union. That group put word out this week that tax refunds may be delayed due to the current shut down. They said some IRS employees are taking advantage of a provision that allow them to skip work if they suffer hardship. Do you know that this was not reported. I ve got the tweet here, some of the   the Republicans actually offered legislation last week to pay certain federal employees even during the shutdown?It was representative Dan Crenshaw. Big deal that never got reported. Last week, House Republicans voted to pay federal employees their first paycheck of 2019 despite the shutdown. Only six Democrats voted with us. It failed. Democrat priority is not paying workers or opening government. It s opposing Trump. Did you know this? It was not reported. We wouldn t know about it if congressman Crenshaw had not told us.All we got was the sob story that said now soup kitchen, soup line, soup kitchen stories, federal employees, they out of clothes, they re out of shoes, their shoes have holes in them, don t have any gloves, such horrible, it s all because the. Well, the Republicans offered to pay them, yet the Democrats, only six voted with them. You didn t hear about that.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Nancy Pelosi has responded to Trump s letter saying,  Hey, I ll see you next Tuesday for State of the Union.  She says,  No, you won t. The House chamber is not authorized. You can t come while the government is shut down.  Children everywhere. We re surrounded by em  disguised as adults.  "

Great to have you on the program. Hi.CALLER: Hey, Rush. Thanks for taking my call.RUSH: Yes, sir.CALLER: First off, I gotta say any time you want to fly down here to Phoenix, I will gladly pull a Loretta Lynch, meet you on the tarmac, and talk golf and grandkids with you.RUSH: (laughing) Thank you, sir, very much.CALLER: (laughing) I got two points for you, Rush, here. I m a Millennial and I live here in Arizona. And first off, I want to say I m just upset that not a lot of our Republican senators are out there on these Sunday shows and whatnot saying that they re gonna go without pay in order to relate to the American people until this shutdown is resolved.Because they re upset that people aren t getting paid, and that we need the Democratic Congress to solve something for the first time ever. It s actually affecting Americans. So that s my first point. Second point is, I am just  It s so hypocritical that Nancy Pelosi is willing to shut down Donald Trump s State of the Union for  security reasons,  when us here on the border and normal Americans have security issues with human trafficking and whatnot, and she doesn t give a crap about it. It just doesn t matter.RUSH: So great to hear from you, and it s great to hear your thinking that these things are occurring to you, and I hope that you keep it up. I tell you, you ve hit the nail on the head in asking,  Where is the backup? Where are the attaboys? Where is the party of the president? Where are the allies?  We re faced with an obvious opponent here that wants to radically rewrite the script and the foundation for life in America.And that script involves essentially overturning the founding of this country. That should have people up in arms in opposition on our side. But it doesn t, and it s evidenced by the things that came out: The BuzzFeed hoax and the ho rum reaction on the Republican side. The Covington High School situation and the ho-hum reaction. People on our side didn t even wait to hear what happened. They immediately started sounding like leftists in their criticism. So I m glad you picked up on that.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Our last caller, the construction worker out there from Staten Island, was talking about how nobody ever cared when he was laid off and nobody ever cared that he might be missing a mortgage payment. Nobody ever set up a GoFundMe page for him. Nobody ever had a food bank set up for him. Nobody ever expressed sympathy in the media for his plight. A lot of people are worried that Trump is not moving things along. We re not moving things forward here. We need to get the government back up and running. We need to open the government that s been partially shut down. Trump has made his point. Now it s time to deal.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. No, no, folks. This is going along exactly as I had written it up. I m gonna continue to say, I think Trump should just keep on. Just stay strong and committed. It s gonna be hard. There s no question. But he s already He faces a shellacking from them every day and has for two years. This is no worse or any different than the kind of debasement, slander, and libel that he s been subjected to since the campaign began to be taken seriously back in 2016, and maybe even 2015. But there is something that needs to be noted about this shutdown, and it is something that I believe President Trump knows. If he doesn t, he will know about it after I have said this.Who are the people most inconvenienced by this shutdown? Who would you say they are? Ah, ah, ah, whatever you re saying  (interruption) Yeah. Right.  The workers.  But that doesn t even get close to my point. The people most inconvenienced by the shutdown are members of the Democrat Party electoral base. They are federal workers. (interruption) No, I did not fall. I m fine. I did not fall. My watch. I started gesticulating here, and my Apple Watch Series 4 thinks that I have fallen.If I bang my hand, I can understand it. It s got fall detection on it. A lot of people think it s a great feature. But I trigger it just doing my program sitting here in my golf shirt. Anyway. If your answer to the question,  Who s most inconvenienced?  is,  The workers,  exactly right. Democrat Party workers. I think the vast majority of federal employees are Democrats. They are part of the Democrat electoral base   and in the big cities where the shutdown has the greatest impact, all these people vote Democrat.You re saying,  So what, Rush? I mean, that s just gonna make the Democrats angry. It s not  No, no, no. Wait.  Cause there s two parties here. One party is the Democrats, one party s Pelosi, and Pelosi is refusing to budge! Pelosi  The news today is, she s not even gonna talk to Trump. As long as he s got this offer out there, she not gonna even talk to him. Well, don t think that these in-great-stress and suffering, out-of-work Democrat federal employees are not aware of that. The very people who put her back in power, you could say   the Democrat base   is now largely the people affected by the government shutdown.Now, nobody makes this point. You probably haven t heard this point made. But it is salient, and it is one of the reasons why I think that you   if you listen carefully and if you read carefully and if you watch carefully   you can see pockets of elected Democrats here and there start talking about,  Yeah, well, you know what? We do maybe need some wall. Well, we do need some fencing. Yeah. There are  In other words, Pelosi is not presiding over a unified front on this. And it s probably far less unified than we actually know  cause the Drive-Bys are never gonna report any kind of fractures or friction within the Democrat Party leadership, particularly on this, since they all hate Trump. Just all that aside, a little observation I wanted to assure with you.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: All right. Audio sound bite No. 1. This from Friday, Sunday, yesterday, and this morning, a montage of a bunch of different media people from USA Today, NBC, the Washington Post, and former congressman Barney Frank talking about the Democrats and the government shutdown and TOM NICHOLS: I don t see where the Democrats have an option here. If they give in on this, the next time Rush Limbaugh doesn t like something, the president will have learned the lesson. I can t imagine that that s a good precedent.PETER ALEXANDER: Having heard from Rush Limbaugh, he can t go backward.EUGENE ROBINSON:   Rush Limbaugh, those mega-voices on the right, uh, speak to his base   and he pays attention.BARNEY FRANK: Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh now have a veto and they can t be overridden by two-thirds. We ve never seen this! I voted to override vetoes by Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan. Literally trashes the Constitution.RUSH: That s  My Boy Lollipop  there, Barney Frank. (impression)  Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh have a veto! (sputtering) They can t be overridden by two-thirds! We haven t seen this this! I voted  I voted to override vetoes by Clinton and Reagan. This literally trashes the Constitution!  These people are out of their minds, and they re all operating on a lie. I got an email from a friend.  You know, Rush, you re laughing about this, but I am very worried what is happening to you here. This is Alinsky Rule No. 13. They re trying to  target you, freeze you, isolate you, and ruin you,  and they do it every so often.  I know. They do. They do it every so often, and they have failed. Now, they have damaged my reputation with people who don t listen to this program. But at the same time, they continue to create curiosity about it. Can you imagine if you re, you know, Average Joe Dummkopf Democrat out there, and you keep watching the news and there s this guy that apparently is telling Trump what to do?You d say you can t believe it! You heard this guy  You heard the name  Rush Limbaugh.  You never listen.  I   I   I gotta find out what this is all about.  They re creating traffic here, and then these Joe Dummkopf Democrats tune in and pfft! Who knows what they think of what they hear here. I guarantee you that the things they hear on this program are things they have never heard before, if they re tuning in here for the first time. Just about the news and about life in general.I appreciate the concern that all of you have out there, but I m not under any illusion.They think that they are actually dissing Trump here by putting this all on me, and they also are doing an ancillary project of fundraising. Apparently, I cause people on the Democrat side to write checks. Whenever they hear my name, they run to the checkbook and send it to the nearest Democrat candidate or organization. Even if I said,  Stop it! You re being unfair,  they wouldn t stop it. There s nothing to make  em stop it here. But it s ultimately a way to slam Trump as a coward. He s afraid. He s afraid to do anything  til I give the okay.I chuckle at the possibility there are people who really believe that, although I know that they are out there.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This morning on my program, my friends   well, the first hour today   I said to people,  Can you imagine what would be happening if Barack Obama were president? Nathan Phillips would already have been invited to the White House for a ceremony on his bravery in standing up to these vicious kids. Now it has been leaked that the Covington kids may be visiting the White House to see President Trump. I wonder how that happened? Also, it has been leaked that the president is considering a rally in Texas instead of doing the State of the Union. I wonder where that idea came from? Wait  til the Drive-Bys start connecting these dots. And, folks, Nancy Pelosi visited a temporary food kitchen today set up by Jose Andres to help serve free food to federal workers.PELOSI: I m here to thank the volunteers and to praise the federal workers for what they do and to praise Chef Andres for being a   a   an angel, really, to feed the hungry. It s a biblical charge.RUSH: (impression)  It s a biblical thing. He s feeding the hungry! Chef Andres is feeding out of work Democrat federal workers at his soup kitchen! (Gasp!) Such a beautiful thing! It s biblical,  says Pelosi. Out of work federal employees at a soup kitchen set up by some celebrity chef, Jose Andres. I don t know what he s a celebrity chef of. I really don t, but he is. Can you imagine the construction worker in Staten Island that called earlier?Now he s hearing about the fact that biblical that a chef is doing soup kitchen meals for out-of-work, Democrat government workers?

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/17/pelosi-just-wants-to-delegitimize-trump/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 17, 2019RUSH: This is Brian in Monroe, Louisiana.  You re next.  It s great to have you, sir.  Hi.CALLER:  Good afternoon, Rush.  Like I said, I do live in the South, and I work for the Federal Aviation Administration as a technician.  And I am for President Trump building a wall.  I think it s necessary for our safety of our country.  I do believe that.  But I also feel that Representative Pelosi and him, they need to sit down and talk this out and don t use the government s workers as pawns.  I mean, we should not be involved in it.  That s something they need to discuss on their own and come up with a conclusion and not to affect all the people that work for the government, for the people.RUSH:  Let me ask you a question.  There s no right or wrong here.  This is asking you your opinion.  Do you think Trump is willing to sit down with her and chat about it?CALLER:  Well, I think originally he was, and she shut him down.  And I don t think that was appropriate, you know, I don t think that was appropriate for her to shut him down.  I know that she doesn t want to give up any money, supposedly, even though a few years ago  RUSH:  It s not about the money.  It s not.CALLER:  Well, I know that.  When Clinton and them, when they all wanted the wall and she wanted the wall, too, but I really feel this right now is just   and this is my personal opinion   she doesn t like Trump, and she wants to make it rough for him. But they need to sit down and talk this out as adults and as comprehensive or good leaders for this country, because it s not appropriate what they re doing.  It hurts a lot of folks.  We got young air traffic controllers here and other places throughout the country, that it s really hard. You know, nobody has like four and five and six and $7,000 in the bank to live on while you re trying to get through this.RUSH:  I understand ñ (crosstalk)CALLER:  We don t want to take loans. We want to be able to take care of ourselves.  I m sorry.  Go ahead.RUSH:  No, no.  I understand all that.  I want to try to have as many people as possible understand what is really going on here.  And the first thing that I have to tell you, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, and I m not exaggerating, and I m not trying to be provocative, and I m not trying to make anybody mad. Nancy Pelosi doesn t care one whit about the hardships of anybody or anything during this shutdown.  Nancy Pelosi and the Democrat Party care about one thing:  making sure that nobody like Donald Trump ever tries this again.The message being sent here is that somebody Washington disapproves of being elected president is going to be shut down and will not be cooperated with and nothing will ever get done because the objective here is twofold.  It s to get rid of Donald Trump and then to paralyze Donald Trump. Paralyze him first, get rid of him, and then send the signal, you Republicans better never, ever send somebody like this, because it s gonna end up being like this every damn time,  cause we re not gonna do business with somebody like this. We re not gonna let somebody like this ever be legitimate.That s what this is.  It is nothing about the shutdown.  It s nothing about the hardships that are being faced.  It s not even about the wall!  Pelosi and the Democrats, as you said, have supported a wall in the past.  This is about making sure, about doing everything they can do to make sure that this guy who they despise does not have one demonstrable success so that nobody like him will ever, ever try this again.This is a long-term message to everybody outside Washington, everybody outside the Washington political class, the elites, whatever, you re not welcome here, and we will damage whatever it takes to make sure none of you ever end up here again.  And those of you who voted for this, don t you ever do this again.  Your votes are wasted.  You re not gonna get one thing you want, you re not gonna get anything, and we ll be glad for all this destruction to send the message that you don t get to do this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Right after I just made my point to the last caller and to   let me briefly repeat it. Nancy Pelosi and most of the Democrats have a singular message in all this, and it has nothing to do with the wall or with the money or any of this. We have two years until the   actually less    til the next presidential election. And that s all this is.This is Pelosi and the Democrats swearing that no matter what Trump wants, if it s gonna make him look good, presidential, if it s gonna help the Republican Party, it isn t happening. But there s more than that. This is really about Nancy Pelosi   I cannot   I ve tried to describe this numerous times. I ve tried a bunch of different ways. I cannot, I don t believe, adequately describe for you how personally despised and resented Donald Trump is and those of you who voted for him.I mean, folks, there is visceral hatred. Donald Trump being elected president, not just beating Hillary, but just being elected is the equivalent of a killer virus being released in Washington. And they have stop it. They have to kill the virus. That s Trump and you who voted for him. This was never supposed to happen. The governed are never supposed to have this much influence over what happens in that town. You re not supposed to have anywhere near this much say over what your government does. You re not supposed to have much say at all.You get to vote, but beyond that, (raspberry) you. And Trump brought you with him to Washington. Trump is doing everything he can to keep every promise he made. I cannot tell you how offensive that is to them. I can t tell you how disruptive it is. I can t tell you how they are livid about it. And this whole government shutdown and the intransigence that Pelosi has, the unwillingness to even negotiate anything here is purely and simply about making sure that none of this is ever seen as legitimate.It s always, if she has her way, gonna be seen as one of the most oddball things that ever happened in American history that was a pure quirk of fate, it was abnormal, it was not supposed happen, and because of that, it s not going to be legitimized. The previous two years have been all about that, not legitimating President Trump, his agenda, his voters, especially now,  cause everybody s racing to get ready for the 2020 presidential election.As far as Pelosi and her side are convinced, it s all about getting rid of Trump and it s all about erasing these past two years, it s about erasing the two years of the campaign that led to Trump. And it s personal. And it is literally governed by a visceral hate. This is why there is no compromise here. Some of you are saying,  Well, how do you think Trump can win?  I think the longer this goes on, the more people are gonna see this for what it is. The longer it goes on, the greater opportunity for people to finally see the Democrat Party as they are, who they are and so forth. Not a slam dunk.But there is no way in my book they get away with delegitimizing you and your votes in 2016. There s no way they get away with essentially saying,  You don t really count. You count on Election Day if you vote the right way, but other than that we couldn t care less about you.  The Democrat Party agenda is aimed at undermining everything you believe in. The Democrat Party is championing everybody who isn t you. Sanctuary cities, open borders, anything that disrupts the foundational structure of this country   and I mean foundational, from the days of the founding   that s their agenda.So here s the tweet from Charles Grassley, senator from Iowa.  Good news for Iowa farmers: USDA will reopen 37 Farm Service Agency offices in Iowa during partial govt shutdown. Seems to me Trump admin trying to help ease burden of shutdown & Pelosi trying to maximize + refusing to negotiate or even show up. Exactly! Exactly! I got this tweet during the break, after I had made my original point, but he s exactly right. Pelosi is trying to maximize the burden on everybody so you ll not never do this again. She wants you getting hurt! She wants you suffering! She wants you thinking you re responsible for this. You elected Trump! This is what happens when you send somebody to Washington they don t prove of. You deserve to be suffering, damn it, for this act of insolence of yours. It s bad enough when you elect a traditional Republican like George W. Bush, but this? You re going to pay.And Grassley here is exactly right. And it is about exactly that, folks. It s,  I wish Pelosi would negotiate, we need to put the air traffic controllers back, certainly some ñ  Pelosi doesn t care about the air traffic controllers! She doesn t care! In fact, the more chaos and the more disruption, the bigger the opportunity for her and others like her and her party.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/16/why-do-they-keep-mentioning-my-name/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 16, 2019RUSH: Let s go to the audio sound bites. They just can t give this up. I think I know why. Audio sound bite No. 1, this morning on the floor of the United States Senate SCHUMER: Why is our country suffering self-inflicted damage? Because President Trump is using the American government as leverage in an attempt to extract taxpayer money for a border wall he promised Mexico would pay for. You know, I hear Rush Limbaugh.  He promised this in the campaign.  No, he didn t. He promised a wall that Mexico would pay for.RUSH: (laughing)SCHUMER: He never said once, that I can recall, in the campaign,  But if Mexico doesn t pay for it, we ll pay for it.  Of course, people voted for it! (pause) Or some. (pause) Not that many.RUSH: He stepped in it at the end of this! Did you catch this? This is choice!  I hear Rush Limbaugh.  He promised this in the campaign.  No, he didn t. He promised a wall that Mexico would pay for.  These guys are on the thinnest of ice! Is this all they ve got, that they re trying to say that Trump never promised to build a wall unless Mexico would pay for it?That s the case they want to make now?  He never said once, that I can recall, in the campaign,  But if Mexico doesn t pay for it, we ll pay for it.   (chuckling)  Of course, people voted for it!  Chuck You stepped in it.  Of course, people voted for it! Of course, a wall makes  Oops! Some people, some people, not that many. Aw, damn it. Can we edit that out? Too bad.It was live, Chuck.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Continuing with the audio sound bites. Moving over to CNN this morning   look, I m convinced, I don t want anybody to misunderstand things here. I m convinced, I mean, why does Chuck Schumer, why do these people keep mentioning my name? Why are they running out there saying that I m the guy running the country, determining the shutdown?Now, I will acknowledge that maybe some of them actually believe it. I have always been surprised, even though I ve been doing this a long time, I have been surprised to learn what these people actually believe sometimes. I mean, they fall for jokes that are obviously jokes to you and me, like Trump asking Russia to find Hillary s emails. That may have actually made some of these locoweeds in the FBI think that Trump was an Russian agent!It was a joke! Mueller is investigating it! They might have gotten a FISA warrant in part because of that line, that joke. They don t understand. They take literally things that people say that are satirical and in the genre of parody. And I ve wondered, do they do this on purpose, or is this just one of their techniques to try to convince people that these jokes are what people honestly believe?So I m asking myself, do these people really think that Trump was ready to sign the continuing resolution until I warned him not to do it? Do they really think that? Or are they just saying they believe it for their brain-dead base because they ve got focus group data that shows that whenever my name is used, their base sends money.My name is a dog whistle. I think my name has become one of the premier fundraising techniques that they have. They have spent all of these years destroying my reputation, lying repeatedly about what I say and what I think and what kind of person I am, and so within a certain segment of their base, I am Satan incarnate. People that have never listened to me, people that have never taken the time to read any of my transcripts, don t know a thing about me other than what is said in left-wing media and left-wing journalism.So it could well be that they keep throwing my name around because it keeps their base fired up with hatred and gets their base to send in money. But then, how does that explain the media continuing to blame me for this, too? Well, the media is an adjunct of the Democrat Party and vice-versa.But listen to this. This is CNN s New Day today. Alisyn Camerota talking to the chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin about the impact of the government shutdown. She said,  Jeffrey, with the damage to the U.S. economy, I mean, that s something to get Trump s attention. Is that the game changer today, Jeffrey? Is the economic hit that we re hearing about gonna cause Trump to cave and end the shutdown? TOOBIN: I don t think so, because, remember, who started this shutdown? What started the shutdown was Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh saying we have to shut down the government or we re gonna abandon the president. I don t think Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter have a long-term perspective on what s good for the country. They re all about what s good for their viewers and their constituency, and that s who the president has geared his entire presidency towards. I wish I could come to you and say I think I see a way out of this, but I just really don t.RUSH: Now, folks, I m sitting here, and I know things that Mr. Toobin apparently doesn t, and I can tell you that s just plain stupid. What he said there is intellectually lazy and vacant. In the first place, remember who started the shutdown.  What started the shutdown was Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh.  Does he really believe this? I think he does. I think his mind is this obstructed and this clouded, that he is incapable of independent thought. While being passed off as some legal analyst, brilliant guy, he s really a closed-minded, incurious, obedient to left-wing agenda items kind of person. Anybody in their right mind cannot possibly think that I started the shutdown. But they do.Now, you might think I m crazy for sitting here not taking credit for it. Oh, I ll take all the credit in the world. I m just fascinated by these people. And then  I don t think Rush Limbaugh has a long-term perspective on what s good for the country.  Mr. Toobin, for you to say that puts you at or near the top of the list of people completely, totally ignorant about who I am and my career and what this radio program is all about.Because that s what it is exactly all about: the long-term perspective on what s good for the country. And that s why I oppose you. That s why I oppose CNN. It s why I oppose the Democrat Party, because you and they are not good for the long-term perspective for this country. You are about reordering it. You re about transforming it. You are about getting rid of the founding. And we have evidence today from none other than Beto O Rourke!Beto O Rourke is out saying in a Washington Post interview,  I just don t know if our founding principles serve us anymore, as intricate and complex as the world has become.  Mr. Toobin, I look at myself as doing everything I can to stop people like you precisely for the long-term good of the country. It isn t about my constituency. I don t have a constituency. I have an audience. I don t have political power. I m not involved in that. I m probably more of an open-minded journalist type than you will ever be.This is just mind-boggling to me. You cannot have listened to this program and think or say what Toobin said. Now, I understand their objective is to poison minds of people about me and all this. I understand all that. But, I mean, it s embarrassingly ridiculous to claim that I   and you, by the way. Don t forget all this criticism of me and all this criticism of Trump is literally criticism of you, for listening and for voting. That s who they really hate when you get down to it. That s who they really despise. Trump wouldn t be there if it weren t for you! They could get rid of Trump if it weren t for you. They could get rid of me if it weren t for you.That s who they really hate. The fact that they can t control you, that they can t influence you, that they can t indoctrinate you, that they cannot somehow propagandize you into voting and supporting what they want to do, which is nothing about the long-term perspective on what s good for the country. These people win, the long-term good of the country becomes entirely differently defined. And it s not what s good for the country. It s what s good for them.And so  the president has geared his entire presidency towards my listeners.  No. Make America Great Again. What is so hard to understand about that? No more complicated than making America great again. In fact, I saw something   I wonder if I printed this out. I think I did. Some guy who wasn t even intending to make a point about the president was talking about China trade relations since the year 2000. And this guy s chronicling how only recently has the United States changed dramatically its posture and status in trade relations with China for the benefit of the United States.He doesn t even mention Trump in this. The guy is not even talking about presidential politics. The guy was lamenting how we were always on the short end of the stick in dealing with Chinese in matters of trade. And only recently has that begun to change. The guy was oblivious as to why. He was chronicling historical changes but not mentioning personalities.It s exactly what Trump is all about! But they don t understand making America great again, because they think America is flawed. They think America is immoral, unjust, it does not have the moral authority to be the solution to the world s problems because we ve caused so many of them. They don t understand American exceptionalism, and they continue to attack the premise of American exceptionalism and to claim that people who advocate for it are themselves racists and bigots.But the overall level of ignorance here is just striking among people who think that they re smarter than anybody else in the world.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay, audio sound bites very quickly, Paul from Texas called C-SPAN. This was earlier this morning PAUL: The president allowed a radio disc jockey to determine and create the shutdown. It was already a done deal. So a deejay decided that he s gonna make an input on the status of how he felt about the president, his decision   and the Republican and Democrat had already decided. And therefore, he put the spin on it. So this right here is not on the president. This right here is a radio disc jockey. Our president allowed a radio deejay to determine the fate of America.ECHEVARRIA: Are you referencing Rush Limbaugh?PAUL: Yes, I am.RUSH: So the host here is Pedro Echevarria, and he continued ECHEVARRIA: Why do you think he has that much influence?PAUL: Because once that phone call was made, he made a statement over the air and said the president at this point in time will be losin  all of his constituents. He was puttin  the threat and said he cowed down and weakened to the Democrats. Then the decision was made to go ahead, and the president changed his mind. Rush Limbaugh did this.RUSH: (laughing)PAUL: Any time you allow someone of authority, allow someone else to just share an opinion with you    cause there was no basis or facts to that! That s just Rush Limbaugh s opinion.RUSH: Any of that make any sense to you? (laughing) Touchdown! It makes no sense whatsoever. This is what the Democrats  This is their average constituent, how they think, how they react. I did it. They literally, literally believe I did it.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/08/cnn-to-fact-check-trump-in-real-time/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 8, 2019RUSH: What I wanted to print was I just got an email that says Pompeo is in the Middle East. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, is in the Middle East, and he just was heard and videoed talking to some king that he has seen the speech Trump is giving tonight. He paused and then laughed and then said,  It s gonna make a lot of news.  I assume this is Pompeo saying this not the king.Although I wouldn t be surprised if the king has seen the speech. I don t know which king. I don t know where Pompeo is. I just got this note from somebody who is keeping a sharp eye on the Drive-By Media. So, anyway, the Drive-Bys are gonna get ahold of this. You know what CNN s gonna do? CNN s gonna fact check Trump s speech live. If you watch CNN Tonight, they are going to have chyron graphics pointing out when they think Trump has lied, when Trump is making it up, what you should believe, what you shouldn t believe.Let s see. In fact, grab sound bite No. 7 and then we ll do No. 8. This is Joe Lockhart, the former spokesman for Bill Clinton. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. Wait. Ah, these guys run together. Was it Clinton or Obama? It had to have been Clinton,  cause this guy then ended up  No. Damn. I don t remember. One of the two. Then he ended up being the chief of communications for the National Football League during the kneeling and all that stuff, and he ended up leaving. Obama rented his house in the Kalorama section in Washington   around which there are numerous fences, by the way. There are numerous fences and walls.So Lockhart was on CNN New Day today, and he had this idea about covering Trump s national address tonight LOCKHART: The networks, I hope, struggled yesterday with the decision to put this on because he consistently, uh, hasn t told the truth, and, you know, someone s got to fact check that. If I were a network executive, which I m not, I wouldn t put this on live. I would let him give the address and I d look at it and find out what s true, what s not, or I d say,  Give me the text in advance. Let us decide in advance what s true, what s not, because we shouldn t be using our public airwaves for someone to spew more of these lies.  You know, you have a president who s trying to create hysteria for his own political purposes, not to protect the American people.RUSH: This is  (laughing) The audacity of this is almost incomprehensible. (translated)  So let us in the media   let us Democrats, let us radical leftists who define the truth to be whatever we say it is. Let us see Trump of his speech in advance and let us determine what s fit to be seen and heard and what isn t. Let us decide whether or not Trump is telling the truth.  Yeah, Lockhart worked for Clinton, and Lockhart rented Obama s house. Exactly right. The one with bunch of walls around it.  Let us determine what is cynical and what isn t.  Let us determine what s hysterical and what isn t. Let us determine what you should see and what you should not see in advance. The White House should give us the text.  This is, by the way, a request for somebody there to leak the speech to them. This is actually what Lockhart is asking. He s asking for some Trump saboteur in the White House to leak Trump s speech, the text of it, so that they can do it right, so that they can protect the nation from the lies and from the hysteria that Trump intends to say tonight.Because Trump doesn t want to fix anything. He just wants to create chaos. So Lockhart is saying (translated),  We at CNN should determine what Americans see and what the American people don t see. We alone should determine whether the president is factually correct or not, whether he s lying or not, and then whether or not the president should be heard or seen.  David Gregory this morning, same program (now at CNN, formerly of Meet the Press) had this to say GREGORY: I think there s an opportunity and a responsibility   and I know CNN will do it   to really scrutinize what the president says in real time, as well as provide Democrats an opportunity to respond so that there can be some debate in prime time that s in the national interests about the government shutdown and about whether there is any kind of emergency at the border, which has been a case thus far made with so many falsehoods that are provably false.RUSH: Okay. So these guys are convinced that Trump is lying, that his speech tonight s gonna be filled with more lies, and that they are going to basically   as a public service, and as media responsibility. They re gonna provide real-time commentary and analysis. I mean, line by line, they re gonna determine whether Trump says something true or false and let you know. You know, this is  Again, this is something we used to do on Rush Limbaugh: The Television Show.Now, we didn t do it live because our show wasn t live, but we did this. When Democrats spoke, we created   we suggested people create   various signs to put on their TV screens to help them watch a bunch of lying-sack Democrats and have fun with it. Jeez. I have more ideas being pilfered and stolen and used by the Drive-By Media than I can keep track of anymore. But aside from that, the audacity of this. Do you think they would ever do this with Obama?Do you think they would ever even try this with Obama? If they do this with Trump, which they re gonna do, are they not setting a precedent for now doing this all the time in the future, whoever the president is, if they determine the president should not have the right to address the American people without the media filtering it first? You know their presidents are gonna get a pass on this. The Drive-Bys, of course, have announced that they are going to carry the Democrat response.Chuck and Nancy are gonna respond to President Trump tonight. This could be  (laughing) This could be fun. I ll tell you why. It s because the Democrats and the media are so cocksure that Trump is going to just make a fool of himself. They are just certain that this is the night they re gonna expose Trump for everything they think he is. This is the night that they re gonna destroy Trump because Trump has lied through his teeth about immigration, illegal immigration, and the wall, and the crisis at the border   and tonight, they re gonna expose it all!And then we have the news that Pompeo is out there talking to some king somewhere telling him that he s seen the speech that Trump is giving. He paused and laughed and said,  It s gonna make a lot of news.  (laughing) I ll tell you what it is. It s almost like The Roadrunner and the Coyote and the media and the Democrats are the Coyote. They think they ve got The Roadrunner in their sights how many times in a 30-minute show? And the anvil still ends up falling on their head where Trump is concerned.And the anvil falling on their head  The analogy is Trump is president the next day. Trump continues to be president, and he continues to try to implement his agenda despite their best efforts to stop it. And they have launched everything in their arsenal to stop Trump, and they haven t been able to, and they keep launching. And every time they get an opportunity like this, they think,  This is D-Day! This is the day it s gonna happen. I ll tell you, the night before the Mueller report comes out, they may not be able to contain themselves. But they re already starting to wonder. Some various people in the Drive-By Media are starting to worry, because there haven t been any substantive leaks,  What happens if Mueller doesn t have anything?  They are starting to worry. (interruption)  Are they gonna fact check Chuck and Pelosi?  No, they re not gonna fact check Chuck and Nancy. Don t be silly!They re not gonna fact check Chuck and Nancy. They re gonna automatically assume that Chuck and Nancy are telling the truth in order to save a beleaguered nation from this disaster. You know, fact checking was practically invented for the 2008 campaign because the Drive-Bys felt they had to tear down every criticism of Obama. You remember this? In the 2008 campaign, Obama was out with one whopper after another.We had the Reverend Wright aspect of the campaign and Obama s real history and whether or not he was born wherever he was, and there were just constant attacks. So the fact-checking industry was practically born as a means of destroying the critics of Obama   and then once Obama was elected, all the fact-check sites announced that they were gonna go dark, unless they needed to defend Obama on some important point again. But that s how fact checking in its current existence really got going.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. We have some more detail here. Pompeo is over in Jordan, and he is meeting the king of Jordan, King Abdullah, and it was while speaking to King Abdullah that Mike Pompeo said,  I saw an early version of the president s speech tonight,  and then he chuckled, he says he s gonna make a lot of news. The truth about this is that you have Lockhart saying we need to fact check this while it s happening, Trump s flying, chaos. David Gregory,  We re gonna fact check it all during. They re scared to death, folks, because they do not hold the factual or moral ground when it comes to what s going on at the border. They know damn well that what s happening at the border is illegal, is unconscionable, it is devastating to the country. It s why they support it. They know damn well that Trump has every fact on his side. They are scared to death that Trump is going to persuade an increasing number of Americans that what s going on   we already have polling data. Only 7% of Americans think that what s happening with illegal immigration at the southern border is not a problem.Ninety-three percent do, including 88% of Americans. The truth of the matter is the Democrat Party and the media are scared to death of what Trump is gonna say tonight. That s why they re ballyhooing the response by Chuck and Nancy. Trump has the facts on his side. They have heard what Trump says about the border. It has been a staple at every Trump rally and it generates standing ovations.It is filled with patriotism, the desire to maintain and protect America,  Make America Great Again,  all of that. It s designed to protect the law-abiding in this country from people who are wantonly breaking the law getting in and then committing numerous crimes, including murder. There is no way the president does not have the moral and factual high ground on this! They have been dreading that he would do a national address on this, and now it s coming and now they re doing everything they can to distort it and destroy it before it s even given and will do so while it s being given.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Ed in Las Vegas, the future home of the Oakland Raiders. Great to have you with us. Hi.CALLER: Thanks, Rush. It s great to be on your show, and I thank you for taking my call. My question is, they talk about immigration from years ago. And from my understanding, in order to for these people to come from other countries to come into our country, they had to have a sponsor, they had to have jobs, they couldn t be sick. And, you know, all these things that went along with immigration, and if any of those didn t fit you weren t allowed into the country. And that s my question. Is that law no longer there in the immigration section, or does it still apply?RUSH: Well, when it comes to sponsors, I think that there has been some sponsorship, certain aspects. But when you talk about the health of people attempting to get into the country, that would require us to go back and look at Ellis Island, which is where hundreds of thousands of immigrants legally entered the United States. Ellis Island, by the way, is not the island on which is built the Statue of Liberty. People confuse two, but it s not. They re close, but it s not the same place.And you can tour Ellis Island, you can take a ferry out there. You can drive to it, actually, strangely enough. I know this because I have delivered speeches there. But it s one of the things happening at the southern border. At Ellis Island if you had any kind of a disease, even if you had a bad cold, if you had anything communicable, you were not let in, you were not the permitted in. We had leaders and we had a population with good sense, and that good sense had not been beaten out of them yet by leftists.And so back then, the population of the country was not going to be subjected to any communicable diseases being permitted into the country. Everything about immigration back in those days was for the benefit of the United States of America. That was the purpose of it. And people who made it in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans. They had to demonstrate love for country.Trump talks about this all the time, and he s exactly right about it. This is the kind of thing that people don t know. They certainly haven t been taught it, and they don t want Trump talking about these things in something like a national address tonight. But it was restrictive as it could be on the premise that nobody deserved to get in, nobody was owed a living or life in the United States.Now, we realize the importance of immigration, melting pot, all that stuff. But all of the requirements for immigration were based on whether or not it was going to benefit the United States. That s not at all the judgment that s being used today. Whether or not it helps the United States is irrelevant.In fact, many of the people who believe in illegal immigration do so because of their belief the United States is immoral and unjust and deserves whatever gets in because we ve caused all this suffering and this misery around the world, and we should not be able to build walls or other limits to protect ourselves from it. We have been founded in injustice and racism and bigotry, and we are responsible for most of the suffering and misery in the world! And therefore we deserve to see what we have caused, and we owe it to these people to be admitted into our country! Whether or not it helps the United States is not even a factor to the open borders crowd.In fact, it s worse than that. If it will harm this country, then bring  em in! Because that s what needs to happen. The United States still has not paid the price for all of the suffering and misery and racism and bigotry that was present at its founding. And so now what s the practical result of this? I have a story here from the Washington Times. Right here in my formerly nicotine-stained fingers. Tuberculosis, Flu, Infections Rampant As The Number Of Sick Migrants Surge At Border   Border authorities are referring 50 people a day for urgent medical care, including tuberculosis, flu and even pregnant women about to give birth, a top official said Monday, saying it s unlike anything they ve ever seen before. Most of those in need of care are children, and a staggering 28 percent are under age 5, having been dragged along for the trip by parents who in many cases are hoping to use the children as a shield against speedy deportation from the U.S. This would have never been permitted. It would have never happened during the salad days of legal immigration. And I hope this is something Trump mentions tonight as he defines and explains the crisis that is occurring at our southern border.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. Listen to this. This is Democrat Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, and this is his idea for President Trump s address to the nation tonight.MENENDEZ: The president s address should also come with a warning to viewers, and that warning is the comments you are about to hear are not based on fact and are likely to include misinformation, blatant lies, and fearmongering.RUSH: Well, why, Bob? Because CNN s already gonna be fixing all that. They re gonna run instant fact check. You re gonna clutter up the screen here to the point nobody s gonna be able to read anything. Gonna have too much up there. You re gonna have all these Trump warnings. This is another idea that I m telling you they re stealing from us here at the EIB. We ve done all of this and more on Rush Limbaugh, the television show. We can find it in the archives at RushLimbaugh.com.You can see the episodes where we have suggested signs that people   now, this is back, you know, the internet, digital stuff had not yet become widespread. You had to make analog signs and tape  em to your TV screens, but we suggested, you know, during Clinton States of the Union or any other type speeches that leftists were making. These people, I ll tell you what, I actually think   I ve thought this for a while, and I ve been wrong. Or have I? It may be too soon to say.I really think, despite the elections last year, the midterms, I think these people are in the process of imploding. I think the Democrat Party still has nothing but their hatred for Trump. They don t have anything salable to a majority of the American people. The reasons they won the midterms are undeniable, and more and more people, more and more people in this country have become deranged leftists at the same time.But the things the Democrats are doing are not things upon which a strong foundation is built. We may be too close to it to see if it s affecting us and it s nothing imminent, but I think they re in the process of self-destructing just on the basis of the immorality alone of what they ve become and how it s worsening. Like with the Soviet Union, it took time, and they needed to be nudged.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/20/trump-cant-buy-off-his-enemies/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 20, 2018RUSH: Paul Ryan canceled the Republican press conference today. He said that there was too much conflict. There was a scheduled new conference, and there was just too much conflict within the Republican caucus. I was just watching CNN, and here s their take on all this. They think that this is all for show. They think the Republicans canceling their press conference and going up and having a meeting with Trump in the White House, which was scheduled to start at noon. We don t know if it did, but it was to begin near then.CNN says all this is for show.The meeting, the canceling the press conference, this is just so that Trump  Cause he s gonna sign the thing. They re telling each other at CNN,  It s a done deal. Trump s never gonna shut down the government before Christmas! It isn t gonna happen. All this is designed to make you Trump voters think that he s seriously considering it, and that he s in there fighting for you, and that he took it down to the wire and he was this close to not signing it, to vetoing it. But in the end, common sense prevailed, and President Trump realizes that he cannot shut down the government before Christmas and therefore they think this is all for sure. That s what they are saying at CNN. Then they threw it to some reporter somewhere.Well, I wouldn t be so sure. You know, the one thing about Donald Trump is we never know what he s gonna do. Which is true. But they re trying to comfort themselves in the Drive-By Media that all of this is for show. And they re talking about the fact that this has happened before, that there have been threatened government shutdowns and Trump has huffed and puffed but in the end, he has gone ahead and kept government opening by giving Democrats whatever they want. In this case, Republicans too.And that s true too. This is why all of this argues for drawing a line in the sand. We re talking  We re not talking about $5 billion. By the way, can I mention another aspect of this that is not even being mentioned? We re talking about federal spending here that is out of control. We re gonna have a total expenditure in this fiscal year of over $4 trillion. We don t have it. You know, I am convinced that something has happened in Washington and maybe it s not recent, but I think all of the talk, whenever there is talk about spending restraint or responsibility is just that.Because there isn t a person in that town that is actually acting as though they re concerned about it. I actually wonder, why do we even need a budget? Because there s no pretense at trying to balance it. We have money raised via taxes, which is at an all-time high, by the way. Washington is collecting more money from all of its sources than ever before, largely because of tax cuts. Tax cuts always result in more money to Washington because more jobs are created. More taxpayers are created.But as this money comes in, the spending  There s no correlation of the two. We ve got monthly deficits now of $300 billion. It used to be that was the annual deficit! Now it s $300 billion per month that is a deficit. And I m convinced that most people in Washington don t think there really is any budgetary reason for not spending money. There is no clerical reason, there s no pressure to balance a budget, there s no need to balance a budget. Just spend the money. I mean, we can print it and we ve got the Federal Reserve over there to keep the economy in check by raising interest rates.That is an entirely different subject, and that is another attempt at sabotaging Trump. It s Fed Chairman Jerome what s-his-face, Jerome Powell, is that his name? Raising interest rates in this economy is crazy, but they re doing it and talking about even more. It s not just the interest rates that they ve raised recently. It s the promise to keep doing it next year and the market continues to lose value. It s fascinating to watch the media. You know why the market s losing value today? Because Trump might shut down the government!Don t insult my intelligence! People invest money are not sitting there, (impression)  Oh, my God. Government shutdown? Ah, sell, sell!  That s not at all how this happens. So much of this trading is automated and done by computers based on algorithms and so forth. The idea that the stock market s down because Trump might shut down the government, it s just another bunch of media drivel designed to create the impression that everybody hates Trump because nothing Trump does is right and there s nothing that he s doing that anybody understands, and that nobody agrees with anything he s doing, this is totally out of control.Yet this guy who doesn t know what he s doing and has no business being there and is dangerously incompetent has produced more positive results for the U.S. economy in two years than happened in all of eight years with Barack Obama, who was the most seasoned veteran we could have had, the most responsible, the most sophisticated, the most intellectual, the most knowledgeable. You d be hard-pressed to find economic activity like this in the first two years of any presidential term. You have all these insiders cannot hold a candle.And of course, what s on the table is slowing it down. We cannot allow any of this to be seen as caused by Donald Trump. We cannot allow any credit to accrue to Donald Trump. So possibility of a government shutdown, market sell-off, it s because of Trump. Everything is because of Trump and this isn t gonna change. He cannot buy, he cannot purchase their goodwill, he cannot purchase their support, he cannot buy the lack of criticism. He cannot stop them from criticizing and he cannot stop them, he cannot do anything that s going to change the way they approach him.Their objective is to get rid of him and they re going to keep trying to do it throughout the next two years no matter what. So his thinking ought to be just to continue to rack up wins, continue to do the right things based on his own instincts. He ran for office following instincts, and those instincts are correlated and oriented around making America great again. We all knew what that meant, because America does need to be made great again because America s under attack. America as founded is under attack, and there are substantive reasons why this agenda won the presidency, and there s no reason to abandon it whatsoever.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/11/dems-expected-surrender-but-trumps-intent-on-keeping-his-promise/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 11, 2018RUSH: I think Pelosi and Schumer were walking in there expecting Trump s surrender. You gotta examine their frame of mind, and I m an expert in that. I m an expert in the liberal frame of mind. I m an expert in how liberals act and think. I m an expert in their psychology, and I don t have to treat a single one of them to be this expert. I have studied them more than they have studied themselves. They think they won the government back when they won the House in the midterm elections.They think they won the power to get rid of Donald Trump via the judicial branch and the connections they have. So their agenda now is that it is just a matter of time. Trump is gone; they re back running the show. They have, for all intents and purposes, by winning the House back. Democrats are now telling themselves that they have gotten control of Washington back after having lost it temporarily in 2016.  Trump is a lame duck. He s not even really there. He s not deserving of any respect. We re gonna steamroller him. He has no idea what s coming. He doesn t know what he s doing in the first place. He s out of place. He should never been here! We won the House back, and so now we pretty much have a handle on everything.  So they walk up in the meeting today, and they expect Trump to be somewhat  Maybe  surrender  is a bit of a tough word. But they expected Trump to be accepting and malleable and hoping to try to mend fences.Because in their world, that s what happens. When you soundly defeat somebody   which they think they ve done. They think they have soundly defeated Trump, and they think they have retaken Washington. The deep state now thinks they re back in charge,  cause all the rest of this   getting rid of Trump finally   is now just a fait accompli. It s just a matter of the days on the calendar being marked off as we get closer and closer to that day when Trump is gone, and certainly not reelected.So in their world when they vanquish somebody like this and particularly Republicans, they expect the Republican to be almost begging for forgiveness and acceptance and understanding.  Please don t hold it against me that I tried to beat you. I m willing to admit that you won and that I lost and now want to work together, cross the aisle, shake hands, cooperate,  blah, blah. They show up there expecting that kind of thing, because, folks, they have still not  None of them have.They still have not endeavored to find out who Trump is, who he really is, beyond the stereotypes they ve created of him and the cliches, and they certainly have no idea who his voters are. They just hold us all in contempt. So Trump blindsided  em. He totally, totally blindsided  em. A Democrat that s been paying attention, that has even a modicum of respect, should have realized a meeting in the White House with the media and cameras in the room oftentimes ends up being televised.That didn t even cross their minds until it started happening, and then that s too late to do anything about it. All Pelosi could do was mutter that it s not  (muttering)  We   we   we need to get rid of the press. We shouldn t be having these negotiations in the media.  Well, what? You just said, Nancy, that the House of Representatives now with you Democrats in charge it is gonna be transparent again! The Democrat control of things is never transparent.Democrats and liberals, by definition, hide who they are and what they re doing from public scrutiny. They do not permit it to happen. They lie about what they believe in, what they want to happen, what their agenda s gonna be, and who they are. So Trump just totally maneuvered them and took them by total surprise and laid the land for them. (paraphrased)  It s gonna be border security or there s gonna be a shutdown and I m gonna be the one to do it. I ll happily do it. I ll claim the credit for it. They didn t know what to do because Trump framed all this in terms of border security. Now, border security is something the Democrats will say they support. But when it come time to actually do something that would promote it, you can t find  em. They don t want there to be any changes in how people cross the border   by definition. They want amnesty for those that are already here illegally, and they don t want any limits on people coming in other than the ones they impose for their own political reasons.But nothing about what s good for the country. Because, in their view, what s good for them is what s good for the country. Not the other way around. So it was fascinating to watch. And, you know, the media  Even when the Pelosi-Schumer press conference outside the White House was had, the media kept boring in on some things, and Schumer finally held up his hand and said,  Stop! Stop! No more.  Now, wait a minute.The last time that happened, Trump said that to Jim Acosta. He got thrown out of the White House and so forth. I don t see the media upset. I don t see the media upset that somebody in the Democrat Party told them to stop their basic line of inquiry. So we ll see where this goes. Again, just to review, there s a military budget option where Trump could take some money from the massive military budget, $5 billion. Believe me, there s $5 billion in it that he could take and have the wall built under the umbrella of national security.Now Schumer and Pelosi are very much aware of this. So look for them to take steps to make sure Trump can t do it by trying to earmark the expenditure of every dollar in the defense budget. But they don t have that authority until January. They don t run the House of Representatives and they re not gonna run the Senate period. They don t run the House. Pelosi s not running anything right now. December 21st is the date of a potential government shutdown.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Didn t we just have a week-long celebration of George H. W. Bush, and wasn t he celebrated, at least by the Drive-By Media, for one specific thing? Let me see if anybody is picking up on what I m suggesting. What do you think the one specific thing, Dawn, was that the media highlighted   nah   that s an overall attitudinal thing. I m thinking of a specific thing George H. W. Bush did that he was praised to the heavens for, and it was said we need more of it, we need to have much more of this to take us back to a time when our politics was friendly, noncombative, and where everybody got along.What was it? When he broke his promise and raised taxes! George H. W. Bush was celebrated and praised to the hilt. We had a week of it for not keeping a campaign promise. Now, here comes Donald Trump, and he s gonna put it all on the line to keep a campaign promise, build a wall, shut down the government, if necessary, and Washington thinks he s crazy for doing it.A lot of people are ripping into Trump for having this kind of commitment to his campaign promise, and he s kept as many of them as he s made. One of the most amazing aspects of the Trump presidency is how much of what he promised he has followed through on, including getting the wall built.See how this works? George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush broke his campaign promise,  Read my lips: No new taxes,  raised taxes. One of the greatest presidents ever, we need more like him, the media said. Four full days of celebrating a president who broke his promise and did what the Democrats wanted to do. This proved bipartisanship. So there goes Trump s chance to have a great, week-long funeral when he passes away.Okay. We re gonna start on the phones in Bloomington, Indiana. This is Mike. Great to have you with us, sir. Hi.CALLER: How you doing, Rush? First off, I think you nailed it on the head. The president has nothing to lose. He should just go ahead and shut down the government. They re gonna impeach him. They said it over and over again. So what does he have to lose? Really nothing. And the selection of the 21st, whoever put that in there, was pure genius because the entire government has been funded and paid by the 21st. So he s got until the next Friday to get the government reopened. And they never saw it coming.RUSH: I m not sure what you re getting at with the 21st. The reason the 21st is chosen is because it s right up against Christmas, and we can t shut down the government at Christmas. It would be mean and cruel to shut down the government at Christmas. That s why they chose the 21st.CALLER: Yeah, but everybody s been paid. Everybody s been paid. On the 14th the DOD and the DOE and associated are paid, and on the 21st everyone else is paid. The next payday isn t  til the following Friday.RUSH: Oh, I see. The government employees and that kind of thing. In this case, the government shutdown is going to be affecting entitlement recipients. Even though it won t, shutting down the government will mean at Christmastime all those that depend on uncle Santa Claus are going to be denied. There won t be any trips down the chimney by U.S. government Uncle Sam Claus. Isn t gonna happen because Donald Trump shut down   this is why these shutdown dates always border the Christmas holiday.They re intended to put pressure on Republicans not to follow through on shutting down the government. It s Christmastime, shutting down the government, what are people gonna do? People will have no idea where to go to get anything if we shut down the government. That s what they want attitudinally created. But I agree. Trump has got to get this done. He s got to keep his supporters with him.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So Schumer shows up, along with Pelosi, and he says to Trump,  Elections have consequences, Mr. President.  He thought Trump would be back on his heels. He thought Trump would be nervous and defensive and hoping for mercy, and Trump said,  That s right, Chuck. And that s why the country s doing so well. Elections have consequences. Country s doing so well, Chuck, because I won. And I m gonna keep doing what I was elected to do, Chuck.  Here s Nancy Pelosi as we get this parade going.PELOSI: We re here to have a conversation in a careful way, so I don t think we should have a debate in front of the press on this. But the fact is the House Republicans could bring up this bill if they had the votes immediately and set the tone for what you want.THE PRESIDENT: If we thought we were gonna get it passed in the Senate, Nancy, we would do it immediately. We d get it passed very easily in the House. We would get it ñ (interruption) Nancy, I d have it passed in two seconds. It doesn t matter, though, because we can t get it passed in the Senate because we need 10 Democrat votes.PELOSI: Well, let us have our conversation, and then we ll meet with the press again.RUSH: Pelosi realizes this meeting has started and the cameras are still in there,  No, no, no, we can t do this. Let s have our meeting, let s have our conversation, meet with the press later.  And Trump s pointing out,  Look. The deal you re offering, I could get that in two seconds in the House. I don t need you for that. I need 10 Democrats in the Senate and they re not gonna help.  The Democrats are not interested in border security, was the theme. Trump continued.THE PRESIDENT: Chuck, did you want to say something?SCHUMER: Yeah. Here s what I want to say. We have a lot of disagreements here. The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchio s because they say you constantly misstate how much of the wall is built and how much is there. But that s not the point here.THE PRESIDENT: The Washington Post?SCHUMER: We have a disagreement about the wall, whether it s effective or   not on border security, but on the wall. We do not want to shut down the government. You were called 20 times to shut down the government. You say,  I want to shut down the government.  We don t. We want to come to an agreement. If we can t come to an agreement, we have solutions that will pass the House and Senate right now and will not shut down the government, and that s what we re urging you to do. Not threaten to shut down the government  cause you   (interruption) let me just finish,  cause you can t get your way.THE PRESIDENT: The last time you shut it down  SCHUMER: Yeah. Let me say something, Mr. President. You just say, my way or we ll shut down the government. We have a proposal that Democrats and Republicans will support to do a CR that will not shut down the government. We urge you to take it.THE PRESIDENT: And if it s not good border security, I won t take it.SCHUMER: It is very  RUSH: That s the bottom line. There is no border security in it. There is no wall. This is all about the wall. Trump has to do the wall. He s got to get that done. If he can t do it with a deal with these people he s gonna take money from the defense budget and he s gonna have it built through the aegis of national security. These got to do it. These people don t want it to happen. They re offering another continuing resolutions. What in the name of Sam Hill are we still doing with continuing resolutions?When is somebody gonna insist that we actually have a budget? A budget with articulated spending and limits and allocations instead of these emergency continuing resolutions with the never-ending threat of a government shutdown every six months, every three months guaranteed to have one right before Christmas. And I love seeing Trump just stand up to  em and say,  I ll gladly shut it down, Chuck, and I ll take the credit for it,  because the American people are sick and tired of us not resolving this issue. He s right about that.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay, here s the final bite. And remember, you know, Schumer and Pelosi, they go in there   this is really important to note. They go in there, and Pelosi starts preaching to Trump about how her House of Representatives is gonna be transparent, implying that the House of Representatives under Paul Ryan has not been transparent, but we Democrats, we re gonna bring transparency back. And then what s the first thing she wants to do? Kick the cameras out of the meeting with Trump.And the reason she doesn t want the cameras in there is so that she and Schumer can then go to the cameras and microphones outside the White House when the meeting is over and lie about what happened in there and create their own narrative and their own spin.And Trump is supposedly so stupid and so dumb that he wouldn t realize their trick strategy, blows it up on  em by having the cameras stay in the room, the media continues to televise everything, and so they can t spin it when they leave, although they did try. But here s the final bite. This is Schumer. Remember, Trump is calling  em out. He was yelling at Pelosi for a couple of minutes and Schumer was trying to get him to quiet down.SCHUMER: Twenty times you have called for  I will shut down the government if I don t get my wall.  None of us have said  THE PRESIDENT: You want to know something?SCHUMER: You ve said it. You.THE PRESIDENT: I ll take it.SCHUMER: Okay. Good.THE PRESIDENT: You know what I ll say? Yes, if we don t get what we want one way or the other, whether it s through you, through our military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government.SCHUMER: Okay, fair enough. We disagree. We disagree.THE PRESIDENT: I am proud. And I ll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don t want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I m not gonna blame you for it. The last time you shut it down, it didn t work. I will take the mantle of shutting down and I m gonna shut it down for border security.SCHUMER: We believe you.RUSH: Now, again, this is really crucial because what the president did here, what Trump did was as best he could make it look like Pelosi and Schumer are not interested in border security. He kept throwing that up and claiming  I will shut down the government for border security.  He was trying to maneuver them into a circumstance where they were made to look like it wasn t a concern to them. And it isn t! Border security is not a concern, not the way you and I mean it. It s not a concern to them. They don t want the flow interrupted, and they certainly don t want it reduced. They want the flow of illegal immigration to continue and expand.And so Trump owning the shutdown, that s a pretty bold maneuver itself, because supposedly nobody benefits from that. Why, that would be silly to shut down a government and to take credit for it. Why, we usually win by blaming the Republicans for it. And here s Trump owning it. I guarantee you their heads were spinning in there.And just one other minor little observation that doesn t really mean anything, but I just noticed something here. I don t even know if I ve told this story. I ve alluded to it, but I don t know if I told details. This has to be seven or eight years ago now. I was summoned to a meeting with two senators and the founder of a well-known conservative news network. It was a dinner in New York to discuss the latest plans on the table at that time to deal with illegal immigration.And the reason I was summoned is that I was told by the two Senators,  If you call it amnesty, you will kill it! And we wanted you to come here because what we re proposing isn t amnesty!  And I got the lowdown on how E-Verify was gonna work and this and that and the employer aspect of this was gonna be monitored and that whatever it was, it wasn t amnesty. And they were trying to educate me on their plan so that I would see that it wasn t amnesty so that I wouldn t call it amnesty!Well, one of the senators was Schumer. And everybody was nice. It was a very civil occasion. It was nothing combative. It was nothing insulting. But at one point Schumer got off topic, he started talking electoral politics and treating me as though I were a Republican consultant type guy, and he was using that kind of language and how the Democrats were gonna really score big, and he started talking about demographics versus districts and states and how this was gonna happen to make the Democrats win here.And I put my hand up,  Senator, senator, hold on. I don t look at this the way you do. All that stuff you re talking about to me is irrelevant. I believe in ideas. I think all Americans will respond to good ideas. I don t care if they re black or white or Hispanic or anything. The way I go about reaching people is with ideas. And he threw his hands up,  Okay, fair enough. Fair enough.  I didn t make any particular note of being fair enough, but I hear it here, and Trump is telling him what for and giving him his lowdown,  Okay, fair enough. Fair enough.  I don t know what that means. I don t know if that s Schumer s way of signaling, okay, conversation over, okay, we re not gonna discuss it anymore or what have you.Because everybody has ticks. Everybody has tells   and as a student of the voice and a professional practitioner of the voice and the use of words, those kinds of things I notice about people. And they are unique the way people use phrases, how often they use them and in what circumstance. You can discern intent by certain phraseology if it s used routinely and regularly in certain circumstances. I haven t formed any conclusions yet on Schumer, and it may be nothing at all here. I m just pointing out here that I was massively disagreeing with him.He was telling me how Democrats are gonna win everything and why because all of these demographic facts and figures and population shifts and the women vote   black women, white women, suburban women. I said,  Senator, I don t look at it that way. I mean, I do a radio show and I m not trying to trying to target niche audiences here and there. You know, getting votes is a much different thing than getting an audience,  I told him. He said,  Fair enough, fair enough,  and he stopped what he was talking about.You know, there was a moment I was worried that I have let too much out of the bag in terms of how I do what I do,  cause these people think that I do whatever I do and they re dead wrong about how and why and why it works   and that s fine. I d rather keep them ignorant about it. Their arrogance is such they never admit to themselves that they don t know how I do what I do or why, and I worried for a minute that I was maybe too informative.Because once you tell people how you operate, you can arm them to oppose you. I don t think it was the case, but I found it interesting that his view of the country was not really of people. It was of groups and skin color and as many different demographic delineations as he could make, versus my view of the country as just one giant sea of humanity and that we re all human beings and we can all be reached with decent ideas, firm connections, and so forth. I found it fascinating in that regard   and I still did continue to call it  amnesty  afterwards  cause it was.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let me grab Joe here in Seneca, Pennsylvania. I m glad you called, sir, and glad you waited. Hi! What s happening? What s shaking?CALLER: Thank you for taking the call. Merry Christmas. I just wanted to make a comment about the Pelosi-Schumer meeting. I don t understand how on both sides of our government they can t understand that the people are gonna stand up against this and they re gonna vote in 2020, and I feel they re gonna vote both a lot of Republicans and Democrats out of office, I hope. Do you have any comments on how we might get that across to them?RUSH: Uhhh, yeah. I don t think they care, until four or five months of the election year, what you think when you get down to brass tacks. The last six months before an election, they ll do everything they can to make you think they care and that they re gonna listen to you, but they don t care. You especially! (chuckles) Trump s election is proof positive. The objective here is to ignore you! The objective here is to pretend that 2016 didn t happen!The objective here is to get rid of the winner and to overturn the results of 2016. They don t listen to you. These people don t look at the will of the people as being the directive for the nation. You re to be tricked. You re to be fooled. You are to be cajoled and so forth. But when the election s over  They already think, by the way, that they ve won the presidency in 2020. They ve already got themselves convinced that everybody hates Trump and the Republicans.They re already thinking that way.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/24/trump-can-build-the-wall-without-congress/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 24, 2018RUSH:  Hi.  Welcome back, folks.  Rush Limbaugh, the EIB Network, and we are right here with you on Christmas Eve, all three busy broadcast hours, one of them already in the can.  And it s a thrill to be here with you, a fun day.  Telephone number if you want to join us, 800-282-2882.  The email address, ElRushbo@eibnet.us.A couple of people who are not Washington insiders have written an op-ed in the USA Today today. It prints out to four pages, and their basic point is that Trump is only gonna get this wall built if he does it using executive power, that the Congress is never gonna agree to it particularly when the Democrats come back and take control of the House.  It isn t gonna happen.  They re never gonna come to an agreement. They re never gonna give Trump what he wants.The last thing in the world they re gonna do is give Trump what he wants while they re in the middle of trying to bust up Trump s base   and that is probably true.  Now, I think there would be a way to do it, but it would require shifting public blame for this in a majority sense or basis to the Democrats, who deserve it!  They re the ones unwilling to capitulate and agree to border security.  It s no more complicated than that.  They re unwilling to participate in anything involving border security.Not just a wall.  They re unwilling to appropriate any money whatsoever for border security.  So you heard Trump float the idea that he could get money from the defense budget or elsewhere in the federal budget that the executive branch controls and build it that way.  And you ve heard Chuck Schumer and other Democrats say,  He can t do that!  He can t spend money we have not earmarked.  He can t spend money we have not appropriated.   It simply isn t true.There are all kinds of departments and bureaucracies and areas of the executive branch with unspent money, and Trump can go get whatever he needs from any of those different departments and allocate it, and he can get started building the wall, and he can do it constitutionally on the premise that he is engaging in an act of national security!  He is the executive.  He does not have some of the executive power; he has all of it!It s on that basis that if he really wanted to fire Mueller, he could!  If he wanted to fire anybody at the Department of Justice, he could.  He can fire anybody.  He is the only source of power.  It is not divided.  There isn t a committee.  There s not a board of directors.  He is the executive, and, as such, he alone has the full power of the executive branch.  And as long as he is executing those powers under the terms of the Constitution, there is nothing anybody can do to him!  The price he pays for blunders in this area is at the ballot box.The price any president pays is political.If using his executive power angers many people in the country to vote against him and his party, that s the price he pays for doing it!  But it is not impeachable to act on behalf of national security according to the Constitution, which he is singularly allowed to do.  And if he believes that open borders are resulting in the infiltration of the country of all kinds of undesirables   including terrorists and gangs and whatever   then he is perfectly within his rights to go get money already allocated to the executive branch and build the wall.So you question: Why doesn t he do it?  Well, there are any number of answers to this.  One of the answers is that not everybody on his team is for him.  Not everybody on his team is for a wall.  Not everybody on his team believes in his ideas.  By  his team,  I mean in the administration, in the West Wing.  As we all know, there are people there who   to one degree or another since Trump was inaugurated   have attempted to undermine via leaks and sabotage.  It s been one of the curious aspects to me, Trump s staffing choices.But, remember, to fill positions in Washington in an administration, executive branch, the odds are you re gonna get some people from Washington.  Everybody in that town is a devotee to one degree or another of the swamp.  Trump has not brought in a bunch of full-fledged outsiders.  He s got some people that are careerist Washingtonians, career government types. And I m sure that he has chosen people he thinks can help him navigate the waters   he being an outsider   on the belief that they are on his team.But I have no doubt, for example, that there are people on his staff  You know, the Drive-Bys are trying to tell you that I changed his mind on signing this continuing resolution.  The real truth is that there are people in his administration trying to get him to sign this thing with no deal for him.  There are people on his team that are telling him (because it s the way they think) that getting a deal with Congress is the best thing you can do.You know it as well as I do that many measures of success, when it comes to president and Congress   individual senators and congressmen and members of the House   is,  How much legislation did they pass? How many bills have their names on them?  This is just the way the town works.  It s one of the many reasons Trump was elected to blow it up that it works this way.  My only point is, in staffing an administration   and it s massive, folks.It s so big, Trump doesn t know them all.  He can t possibly know everybody.  Now, in his immediate circle, yeah.  But you should take a tour.  You can t, but you should take a tour through the West Wing.  You would not believe.  I don t know what you think the West Wing is, which is where the Oval Office is and all the executive offices. They can t put 5% of the people that work in the administration in the West Wing.Across the street is the Old Executive Office Building, now called the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, and that s not even big enough to house  em all.  I mean, they re everywhere.  And they re all working through their superiors   and everybody has superiors   to try to influence the outcome of the administration.  Some try to protect Trump from himself, they think. Some try to advocate and help him.But they re all people who believe that the route to success is this old crossing the aisle, shaking hands, showing Washington works, compromise, process.  How many media people went bananas last week   we played the sound bites for you   when Trump announced that he was not gonna sign this thing, the CR, and that there was gonna be a shutdown? Remember A.B. Stoddard?  She went ballistic on Fox News, on you Bret Baier s show.She was beside herself!  She could barely speak because the president had rejected what?  Process and compromise.  Now, you and I both know that process and compromise in Washington equals Republicans caving and getting nothing and Democrats getting what they want.  And that s what it is, and that s what A.B. Stoddard was upset about.  (impression)  Trump should realize he s got the losing position here.  That would be immature thing to do. Trump should realize he s got nowhere to go on this, that he lost the House.  Trump should realize it! He should take what he should get, can get, and be thankful for it.  And when Trump didn t do that   when he said,  Hell, no, not signing this thing.  Government shutdown    and then starts trying to lay blame on the Democrats, they go apoplectic on the basis that Trump has rejected the way Washington works: Compromise and process.Well, there are people advising Trump to do just what people like A.B. Stoddard wanted him to do.   Take a deal, Mr. President!  Take $1.6 billion, take $2 billion and get as much as you can.   But this is how we show people we are governing.  This is how we show people that we re cooperating.  Well, that s not what Trump was elected to do.  Trump was elected precisely to overwhelm and overcome this process because we always end up on the short end of the stick on it.We have been fed up for years and years working under these concepts of process and compromise where we always end up losing and our politicians that cave into it are then praised to the hilt as mature.  They re growing in office!  But we always end up losing somehow   legislatively or otherwise   to the Democrats.Well, Trump has totally eschewed process and compromise now.  And his position is that until the Democrats are forthcoming with the amount of money he wants for border security, the government is gonna remain shut down. And so it is.So now there are people who are thinking that this compromise is never gonna happen, meaning the Democrats are never, ever, particularly with control of the House only the January 3rd away, they re never gonna cave. They don t think Trump has any leverage and they think they have it all.And they think if they can humiliate Trump that they might be able to cause some of you in Trump s base to get frustrated, throw your hands up and give up and fade away and realize that you can t beat the swamp and never, ever again vote for somebody like Trump who says that that s what he s going to do. That s what they have at stake. And they re so close to it in their minds that they can taste it.Now, the Donald Trump of the campaign, what do you think he d be doing right now? I tell you what I think he d be doing. I think he would already have amassed a pile of money, unused, from other areas of the executive branch and the various budgets. And I think that he would have already started on the process of building the wall and that Congress would be going nuts like they are now, like they do anyway. The Democrats would be going absolutely bonkers, and the media would be going absolutely bonkers.I saw that Dinesh D Souza had a tweet where he thinks Trump ought to deliver a major address to the nation on the importance of immigration policy and trade policy, the importance of both those to national security and prosperity.I like the idea of a national address. I don t know the networks would give him the time, though, if he requested it. You know, they don t have to. But a national address that s written and promptered could explain what s going on and why. Doing it during the break between Christmas and New Year s might not get the largest audience.We also had the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, was on I think Fox News over the weekend, one of the Sunday shows, and he said that Trump is willing to accept less money to build the wall. He said the new offer is between Trump s $5.7 billion request and the $1.3 billion the Democrats are offering. Mulvaney said he s waiting to hear back from Schumer, but he hasn t heard anything.Dick Turban said that all we need is technology along the border like drones instead of some medieval wall. This is such caca. You will find walls around every important business or every important wealthy person s estate, because they do work. This is absurd. This is just distracting.This has now become   the Democrats, there are two things involved. Trump doesn t get a win, and there isn t gonna be anything done that would interrupt the flow of illegal immigrants to the United States because the Democrat Party wants them. The Democrat Party needs them and they re not gonna agree to anything. So there isn t gonna be an agreement here.There s going to be a showdown of power, executive branch power versus congressional power. And there are many people who think the president has the executive power to start building this wall with money that s already been allocated in budgets that exist in the executive branch and he can and he does. There will be hell to pay.I mean, if you think this is bad, the minute a wall s construction has actually begun with money that Chuck Schumer and his gang don t think they participated in allocating or appropriate, they go nuts and they start shouting and yelling  impeachment.  But the fact of the matter is   and the Washington swamp would be too. And I m sure that there are people in the administration they do not want anything like that to happen, that they think the only way out of this is a negotiated settlement where nobody gets exactly what they want from both sides, just the usual way that these kinds of things end up being settled.Does anybody remember, for example, how the 1995 budget deal was solved? Or any other government shutdown. Do any of you remember what happened to end them? I will wager you don t. I will wager there s not a one of you that remembers what happened to end any of those shutdowns. You d have to go look it up. You d have to Google it. You d have to Wikipedia it. You d have to do something to find out.How did the shutdown 11 months ago, the Schumer shutdown over DACA, three day shutdown over DACA, how did that end? Do you remember? My point is nobody ever remembers these things anyway. They don t remember how they end. This is time to take a stand on a premise that has existed since the Trump campaign. And it is border security. If you want to throw the wall in, go ahead and throw the wall in.But I think it s time to take a shot at breaking these people on this right now. I think it s time to illustrate that the Democrats are acting like a bunch of spoiled brat little kids when it comes to an issue of national security and prosperity and the rule of law. Don t forget here we re talking about illegal immigration.The message should continue to be it is the Democrats who do not want to fix this! It s the Democrats who are saying  no ! It s the Democrats who are the obstacle to border security or to reopening the government or whatever. It s the Democrats who want no part of it. It s the Democrats who are stopping things. It s the Democrats who won t cooperate. It s the Democrats who won t across the aisle. It s the Democrats who won t compromise.All of this is true. All of this needs to be part of the messaging. It is the Democrats who are not interested in securing the southern border. It s the Democrats who are acting like children. It s the Democrats who are acting like spoiled brats. That is what needs to be illustrated and with every Republican signing on to this, that objective can be reached. It requires full-fledged support for the president and the premise which every Republican should sign on to.I know people are quoting polling data,  42% of the American people don t want a wall.  You re gonna get polling data that backs up the Democrat during every controversial issue there is. You re gonna get polling data that shows Republicans are in the minority on everything. Ignore it!It s the Democrats willing to damage the country rather than support the president. It s the Democrats willing to put the country in great peril because they are refusing to shore up the border. It needs to be demonstrated. And to me this is a golden opportunity. Everything we want to do, everything we want to teach people about the Democrats and illustrate is right here on the table, and it s already happening. We just need to be pointing it out each and every dayBREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  So I checked the email during the break, and people are asking,  Rush, are you sure that Trump can go get unspent federal dollars somewhere and allocate it to whatever he wants?  I don t know.  I ve heard people saying that that s not constitutional.   Let me ask you all a question: Where did Barack Hussein O get his $150 billion, much of it in cash, to drop on the tarmac at Tehran International Airport in the midst of the Iran deal negotiations?Where did that $150 billion come from?  Did Obama call his buddies at the Fed and say,  We need you to print me some money ?  Did Obama go to various federal agencies?  Did he go to the defense budget or did he go to a bunch of different places and get the money?  Where did he get cash?  Where do you get that much cash?  I think it was $8 billion in cash.  It may be $8 million, I forget.  But it was a hell of a lot.  Where did Obama get it?  And you ll notice that nobody in Congress raised a stink about it.Nobody in Congress said,  Mr. President, you can t do that. We didn t authorize it.  We didn t appropriate it,  and even if somebody in Congress would have said that, Obama would have said (impression),  I can do it  cause you can t stop me and I know you won t and I have the media on my side,  and it would have not changed.  What did we do when Obama said that?  Well, we shouted from the rooftops and we tried to tell everybody that this stunk and that Obama was lying to us about the deal. He gave $150 billion to the mullahs.Now, it was also part of a prisoner release.  So some were saying that part of that money was a ransom payment.  The point is that Donald Trump can certainly go find federal money and start building the wall.  I m just telling you that he s probably got a lot of people in his own administration   and I don t doubt his lawyers are telling him not to do it, either.  I think, in fact, if I may be so bold   and this may not be bold now.  I think other people have probably pointed it out.  But in the early days of the Mueller investigation, Trump s Office of Legal Counsel The White House counsel. Not personal lawyers, but the White House Office of Legal Counsel, presidential lawyer, presidential adviser and so forth. I will bet you a dollar to a doughnut that almost all if not all, of those lawyers were telling Trump to not criticize Mueller,  Don t be public. We ll try to negotiate a deal. We ll show we re willing to compromise,  because they re all Washington people.  They re all  Their clients come and go, and presidents come and go.But people that live in that town are gonna be there long after presidents come and go, and so their loyalties really are to a system.  Their loyalties really are to a set of circumstances that exist in the establishment inside the Beltway.  So that even Trump s lawyers that he hired that ostensibly are there to advise him on how to prevail in things probably were preaching compromise.They probably were preaching the standard things that lawyers tell clients,  Don t criticize the prosecutor!  Don t make  em any angrier at you than they already are,  which I thought would be irrelevant.  They re gonna be angry at Trump as long as he s alive. But the point is, he didn t have a whole bunch of Donald Trumps around him.  He s had people around him trying to rein him in.  And I m   don t doubt that some of them have been acting on what they think are his best interests.I mean, if you live and work in that town and if the coin of the realm in that town is compromise and process  Here. Just to repeat this, grab sound bite No. 23.  This A.B. Stoddard.  I referenced this earlier.  You may not have heard this last week.  It was last Thursday the Fox News Channel.  This was after Trump vetoed the budget and began the shutdown. Listen to this meltdown STODDARD: The nation s fourth graders know this is no way to run a lemonade stand. This is completely irresponsible. The markets are rattling on the prospect of a shutdown. The president time and again is contemptuous of process and of compromise. He doesn t have 60 votes. He must compromise. He was all for a DACA deal. He refused to take it. He took four positions on the Goodlatte bill.BAIER: I get it. I get it.STODDARD: He refuses to do the hard work.BAIER: If he listens to the Mark Meadows and the Jim Jordans and the other people on the House floor  STODDARD: They don t know what they re talking about! This is political malpractice. They re wrong!RUSH: (impression)  They don t know what the president  The   the   the congressional caucus there, the Freedom Caucus, they don t know what they re talking about! Anybody urging Trump to do anything than compromise doesn t know what they re talking about.  He doesn t have 60 votes. That means he s got to compromise.   He doesn t even  They don t even need 60 votes for this!  If Mitch McConnell really wanted to act like the guy running the Senate and wanted to make the rules, they don t even need 60 votes for this!You and I know this!  But that s not how the town thinks.  The town thinks,  We got these rules, and they re sacrosanct, and we dare not touch them.   But the Democrats always do.  Sometimes it comes back to bite  em, but the Democrats will do whatever they have to do whenever to win.  We could fix this. Mitch McConnell could fix this so he doesn t need 60 votes.  Now, it s not just as simple as me saying it.  There s a process, and it would require taking a lot of hits in the media.It would require taking a lot of incoming fire that they re not used to talking about, not to degree that they were on this.  But you hear her.  Political malpractice.  The markets are reacting to this.  The president time and time again is contemptuous of process and compromise.   My point to you is that I think a large number of people called his advisers (who surround him) believe exactly that.  And I think his first team of lawyers did via Mueller.  Maybe even the current crop of lawyers believes that way. Process and compromise.  It s the coin of the realm. It s the way it works here.  Well, that being the case, it s one of the reasons why our side always ends up coming up short, which is why Trump was elected to kind of blow all of that up, which he is in the process of doing every which number of ways.  And it is causing the predictable meltdown reaction. Nobody should shy away from it because of the reaction.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  I need to make a correction, folks.  The Iranian deal was not $150 billion.  It was $1.7 billion.  It came out of something called the judgment fund.  There s some aspect of this Iran deal, my memory is, that s 150-something.  And I misspoke when I said $150 billion.  It s $1.7 billion was the entire deal that Obama arranged to pay Iran in the middle of the negotiations on the Iranian deal. But then there were those pallets of cash that were delivered to the tarmac at Tehran international spaceport.  And I m gonna have to track down that 150.  I know that there was a cash element here, and for some reason this figure of 150 is  being bandied about inside my deep, dark crevices of my fertile cranium, little gray cells. BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This whole Iran deal now has got me bugabooed here because I ve used some figures here that I thought I knew were right. But I ve been having people say,  No, no, no. It was this and it was that.  Everybody s trying to be helpful. So I did a little search here in the top of the hour. I found a Breitbart story. The date of this story is not specified but it was a fact-check story, and the headline:  Yes, the Nuclear Deal Hands $150 billion Over to Iran   During the opening statements on Sunday night s presidential debate   Donald Trump described the Iran nuclear deal as a  one-sided transaction  that would result in $150 billion returning to the coffers of   Iran.  So I ve had that number going about my head, and I ve used it.  No, Rush, it was $1.7 billion, and that was cash, and that was dropped on the tarmac. It came from the judgment fund, and it was part of a ransom payment for hostages and also part of the Iran deal.  Then another friend said,  No, the cash element, Rush, was $400 million. Well, that figure rang a bell, too! I said,  Okay, that makes sense.  So I finally said,  I need to go check this,  and the fact check says it s mostly true on the premise that the nuclear deal hands $150 billion over to Iran, and much of that is from the unfreezing of Iranian assets that was part of the Iran deal. Lifting of sanctions and the unfreezing assets. I do remember that there s something to that,  cause I remember that there were so many American corporate entities that were in favor of it, in favor of the Iran deal.I said,  Why in the world ? What possibly could explain this?  I said,  There has to be a reason,  and I looked and I found one explanation for it, and it was Boeing! Boeing was looking forward to Iranian sanctions being lifted because the Iranian national airline fleet was practically falling apart because of these sanctions. They hadn t been able to import or pay for any modernized jets for airliner travel. The lifting of the sanctions would permit it! The Iranians were on the way to signing a contract with Boeing for $60 million, I think.No, it d be much more than that. I mean, that s one plane. But it was a deal for Boeing to participate and compete against Airbus for purchases by Iran of modernized jet aircraft. The point is none of that could have happened unless Iran ended up being flush with money, and one of the ways it happened was the lifting of sanctions and the unfreezing of assets, and all of it totaled a $150 billion benefit   give or take a few billion. Now, the amount of money on the pallets was $1.7 billion.It was cash. That s a lot of cash. (chuckling) I don t know where you go get that. There isn t  I wonder how much cash there is in circulation the country at any one time. I mean, it is regulated, the amount of actual hard, cold cash that s in circulation. It would shock you how little it is. Well, maybe it wouldn t shock you, but it would shock you how little it is compared to the total gross national product, gross domestic product. The amount of cash in that is actually chump change because there s so much credit and credit card usage.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/20/my-sources-say-trump-wont-sign-a-bill-without-real-money-for-the-wall/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 20, 2018RUSH: As I went to the break, Paul Ryan was outside the White House addressing members of the Drive-By Media. So I went to the break to find out what he was saying, and here s the bottom line. The president told the Republicans he s not gonna sign this. He told them flat-out he s not going to sign it. He hasn t vetoed it yet. He told them he s not gonna sign it. So Ryan said (summarized),  The president s very, very interested in border security,  (whispers) damn it,  and we in the House are going to go back and try to put together a bill that will feature border security the president will accept and then we re gonna send that to the Senate   and we re gonna find out in the Senate if they re serious about border security. So I m picking up this stuff on the fly. But as I understand it, they had the meeting, and the president told the Republican conference of leaders there,  I m not signing this.  Now, it s important to state that this is not a veto yet. He just told them,  cause we ve still got a couple of days to go on this. I think Friday. Maybe one day to go. Anyway, the president told  em he s not gonna sign this, that there s nothing in it for border security and he s not signing anything until there is something for border security.Now, it s assumed that that means some money for the wall. But we don t know that, either. I want to caution everybody here that the House now is gonna go back and take this continuing resolution that funds the government through February 8th and they re gonna put something in it that they re gonna call  border security,  and we ll see what this is. If it s $5 billion or $3 billion or $7 billion, whatever? Okay, fine. If it s a simple commitment, a verbal commitment that (impression),  We re gonna get serious about this and come the next continuing resolution come February 8th and we will  If it s that, then Trump had better not sign that. There has to be some serious appropriation. So, I mean, it s time for applause. (clapping) Yes. This is a great, great first step. But it s not a full-fledged veto. Not that we want a veto; don t misunderstand. This is simply the president telling the Republicans,  I m not signing this. There s no border security in it.  So now the Republicans are gonna go back and put some border security in their version of the continuing resolution. We ll know what that is soon enough.Then when they finish doing that and they vote on it   and it will pass   they ll send it over to The Turtle, Mitch McConnell in the Senate, and then they will deal with it. The Senate was very happy to have not a penny in this CR for border security. So it looks like the onus now is  It looks like it s on the House, but it s actually gonna be on the Senate, because we have to assume the House is gonna put something in this. Meadows was dead serious about this. Ryan? I don t know. But it s still his House. He s still speaker for a while. So that s where we are. But it s great news that the president refused to sign this.Now we have to keep our eyes on what they come up with as border security.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay, folks, this is good. This is interesting. I just got a phone call. Well, I got an instant message. It s the equivalent of you getting a phone call. That s how people communicate with me, particularly during the program. It s impossible to use the phone during the program. Anyway, I just said less than 10 minutes ago in my translation of what s happened here,  The president told Republicans he s not going to sign this. It s not a veto yet, but he s not gonna sign it until there s border security in it. And I said,  Now we have to look out for what does  border security  mean? Republicans are gonna go back to the House and they re gonna rewrite. They re gonna add something to the continuing resolution that passed the Senate and they re gonna put something in there called  border security.  We have to keep a sharp eye on what that is. If it s not money to build a wall, if it s not money to do something to shore up the border   if it s just words, if it s just a commitment to care about and seriously tackle border security   then it s nothing. So I get this direct message:  You tell Rush that if there s no money in this, it s getting vetoed. If there s no money   if there s no money for a wall   I m vetoing this, plain and simple.  This was the message that I just got, and I trust it and I believe it to be the case. By the way, it s a legitimate question. I mean, the way the media reports this   and it was not just the media. It was Paul Ryan saying,  The president cares deeply about border security. So we re gonna go back and we re gonna get some border security in this thing. The president said he s not gonna sign it unless there s border security in it.  Well, we know how these guys work. We know what  border security  can be anything. If it s not specifically a wall   and I guarantee you it s what the media is gonna say. The media is gonna say,  Trump is continuing to fake you out! Trump is continuing to play with you. He s going to sign this even if there s no money for the wall. He just wants you to think that he s playing hardball  cause he thinks that will satisfy you. So be prepared to hear that and that the Republicans are winking and nodding that,  Yeah, this is all still a big game.  By the way, I want to point something out. I got a note from David Asman from the Fox Business Channel. You know, he s one of their economics gurus over there. He pointed out to me, he said,  During the past three shutdowns, the stock market has improved during the shutdown. The last time, the stock market went up 3% during the duration of the shutdown.  Long-term   and, folks, this is me   a veto and a shutdown may actually help Trump here.I think it would!I think a veto would rally the American people. I think a shutdown would rally the American people. Getting the border wall would be preferable. Don t misunderstand. I mean, getting the money for it would be the biggest win. But if that isn t forthcoming, shut it down   and the stock market in the last three shutdowns has grown. It has gained value during the duration of the shutdown, and I m glad David sent me this, because it s true. I opened the program pointing out that since 1995, these government shutdowns have not meant anywhere near the end of the world for the Republican Party.They have not been significantly harming. They have not been determinant in anything. It s just media hype   and, of course, Republicans inside the Beltway are scared to death of media hype. Media hype, to them, is reality. But the fact of the matter is starting with the  95 shutdown   which was the mother of shutdowns   Republican electoral successes after that were not significantly affected, if at all. Now the stock market during the last three shutdowns has gained value. The last one, it was up 3% during the duration. The point is it could be a win-win in so many ways if they don t come up with the money for the wall.If they come up with money for the wall, it s a huge, big, big win.But so can a veto be.Okay. Time to get started on the phones. It s Wendy in Atlanta, and I m glad you called. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Mr. Limbaugh. It s an honor to talk to you and thank you for everything you do, and Merry Christmas.RUSH: I appreciate that. Thank you very much.CALLER: I ll get right to my point. That s great news you just gave us because I want the money. As usual, you are right. Meadows is right. Congress is a joke. Mitch McConnell? I can t even. I just want to say,  Here I am!  I am middle America and I am so tired of being screwed, most especially by people in my own party. I voted for a fighter. I know Democrats who voted for Trump because of immigration. I think that Trump is holding a royal flush in his hand right now and he s got to know that. I do not see a scenario where he loses on this. Do you?RUSH: I m with you a hundred percent. You know how ? I think you are demonstrating how fed up Republican voters are with this entire charade working every time!CALLER: Right.RUSH:  Government shutdown! Government shutdown!  Republicans cave. We re tired of that affecting the way Republicans govern and what issues they push and don t. Try something new! Challenge it!CALLER: Exactly.RUSH: Why should these people get away with intimidating us every time when there s no evidence to suggest that government shutdowns actually end up harming Republicans? It may be exact opposite.CALLER: Yes, sir. We ve had it up to here. Shut it down! I m so tired of it.RUSH: Well, I hear you, and I appreciate your call very much, Wendy. I appreciate that you held on too. She has been holding out there for a long time. All right. Here, ladies and gentlemen. I just received clearance. The president has gotten word to me that he is either getting funding to the border or he s shutting the whole thing down. This is what I was referring to. I was referring to this a few minutes ago, but I needed clearance on what about this I could say. It is the case that the president has gotten word to me that he s either getting money for the border   for border security   or he s shutting the whole thing down.Now, this is important. again, because the way this was portrayed is Republicans say they gotta go back and get something for  border security.  But if it wasn t money, if it wasn t a commitment to get started on the wall   if it was just, you know, a side resolution that  we Republicans believe in border security, and we commit going forward to do everything we can to get it.  If that s all it is, then it s a nothing burger. And that s when I heard,  No, no, no, no. The president wants you to know that it s money or nothing,  and if it s nothing, he shuts it down. So there you have it.Here s Karen in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Great to have you on the EIB Network hello.CALLER: (talking to someone) I gotta go for just a minute! I ll be right back. I ll be right back. Hi, Rush!RUSH: Hey. How are you? Do you need to do something? Go ahead.CALLER: No, I m good! It s such an honor and a privilege to speak with you. I m so glad I was on hold because I was just so revved up when I was talking with Snerdley. So I ve calmed down a bit. But I want you to know I think the government has already shut down. I have tried to call Paul Ryan at four different numbers. Can t get a hold of him! I ve contacted my congressman, my senators, and expressed my frustration. We ve had the House, we ve had the Senate, we ve had the White House. Nothing s getting done. I m just furious, Rush! We can t lose this, and Paul Ryan is nowhere to be seen. I mean, he doesn t even have his staff answering any of his lines. I called four different numbers!RUSH: Did it ring and ring and ring and nobody picked up or what? Did you get a busy signal?CALLER: It rang, and it went to an answering machine telling me that they were closed, that I should try this number, that number.RUSH: (chuckles) They may well have already decided the term is over. The Senate signed the thing and sent it to the president and they thought it was over. Remember, they were prepared to do a press conference, their end-of-the-year press conference today, and it got canceled because Ryan said (summarized),  There s too much conflict in the caucus, so we can t do the press conference. We don t have anything to say in unity here.  Then it leaked that there was gonna be a meeting between the Republican leaders in the House and the president at the White House, and that was at noon.So I don t know that Ryan s avoiding anybody.He just may have given the office staff off for the beginning of the Christmas holidays. Who knows? But your line about the government shutting down? This is a good point. It may have already shut down in places (chuckles) and nobody knows! Meaning it s not affecting anybody other than you can t get a phone call answered. But big whoop! It doesn t gonna affect the rest of your day, it s not gonna affect your holidays because somebody s office in Washington doesn t answer a phone call. This is the point. Anyway, I m glad this all happened when you were on hold out there, Karen. Thank you very much for the call.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. So what the latest is, the House is going to add an amendment to the continuing resolution. The amendment will specify a $5 billion expenditure for the border wall. That s what they re gonna do. So that s even better news! It s not gonna be some verbal resolution or trick. They re actually going to do it. They re gonna try to pass it. This has to pass the House   and keep a sharp eye on this too. I m not trying to drop cold water on everything. Every step of the way here has been fantastic, and it s worth standing up and cheering.But the House now has to go. The Republicans still run the House, and that s why this has to be done now. To put this off until February is absurd. When Nancy Pelosi and the rest of her crowd run the place? It s impossible then. So they re gonna try to pass an amendment, a $5 billion amendment for border wall; then it will go to The Turtle. It will go to Mitch McConnell in the Senate and then they deal with it, and then if it doesn t survive either place?If this same bill with no $5 billion goes back to Trump, he s on record as having said he s gonna veto it. If it doesn t have funding for a wall (i.e., border security), he s going to veto it. Here s a statement from Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  President Trump just met with Republican members of the House. We protect nations all over the world, but Democrats are unwilling to protect our nation. We urgently need funding for border security, and that includes a wall.  Now to the audio sound bites. Paul Ryan. This was outside the White House after the meeting with the president RYAN: We just had a very long, productive meeting with the president. Uh, the president informed us that he will not sign the bill that came over from the Senate last evening, uhh, because of his legitimate concerns for border security. So what we re gonna do is go back to the House and work with our members. We want to keep the government open, but we also want to see an agreement that protects the border. We have very serious concerns about securing our border. So the president said he will not sign this bill. So we re gonna go back and work on adding border security to this, also keeping the government open because we do want to see an agreement.RUSH: Now, let me remind you and add one more thing to this. The president got word to me 20 minutes ago that if it comes back to him without money   if whatever happens in the House and Senate comes back to him with no allocation of $5 billion for the wall   that he s gonna veto it. So this is a  I don t know if you call this a 180 for Paul Ryan, but my take on it is he wasn t particularly positive or upbeat about a wall. But after the meeting with the president, all of a sudden border security has become very important.I m not meaning to be critical of Speaker Ryan. I m just chronicling things for you as I see them and digest them and then analyze them. (summarized)  We had one productive meeting. The president informed us he won t sign the bill that came over from the Senate because of his concerns for border security. So what we re gonna do is go back to the House, work with our members. We want the government open, but we want to see an agreement that protects the border. (whispers) But you didn t yesterday.Sorry. I don t mean to be  I m not trying to cloud things here. This is just how I react to things. If you were sitting next to me watching the news, this is what I would be saying to you. Another sound bite. It s all good. Don t misunderstand. This is Jackie Speier. She is on CNN with Brianna Keillor. She s a Democratic congresswoman from California, and Keillor asks her about Ryan s remarks. The question:  The president is rejecting the bill from the Senate. He wants more money for the border wall. Where does that leave things with this shutdown about to begin? SPEIER: He is really all about, uhh, an audience of one, and that s Fox News   and when he started getting some criticism about not having any funding for the wall is when he changed his mind. I m sure the senators had conveyed to him what they were passing, and he was okay with it. The president also is planning on leaving for 16 days in Mar-a-Lago tomorrow. So I don t know if he s suggesting that we all come down to Mar-a-Lago to negotiate this on the golf course, but he s all wrong on this.RUSH: Well, why? What s wrong with going to Mar-a-Lago? I don t know if he would even want you there but  By the way, there s no golf course on Mar-a-Lago. The golf course is a hop skip and trip away, but it s not on Mar-a-Lago. These people don t even know what they re talking about now. (impression)  What, does he expect us to go to Mar-a-Lago?  You could do worse, Ms. Speier, you could do worse. By the way, that go funding effort, the GoFundMe effort?They re getting close to raising $1 billion. We may not even need five. They re getting close already to  They have $3 million. They re not close to a billion. They re at $3 million right now, a little bit more, but  Sorry, it s $5 million, $5.4 million, and their goal is $1 billion. So they re halfway there. I m amazed GoFundMe hasn t shut it down. You know, they re a bunch of left-wingers over there too. Here is Rick in central Missouri. Great to have you on the program, sir. Hi.CALLER: Good afternoon, Rush. Mega dittos from central Missouri.RUSH: Thank you, sir.CALLER: Hey, I want to I guess echo some of the sentiments of the previous callers, you know, with the frustration over this border wall. And, you know, I think we kind of have to  You know, it changed here while I was on hold with the president coming and saying he s not gonna sign that continuing resolution. We kind of gotta trust him, and we really gotta be after our representatives. You know, in so many instances our elected representatives, they represent the party, and they forgot about what their constituents want, and I think we have to hold them accountable for that.RUSH: Well, here s  As I see this within the context of your observation, this is where we are. These Republicans, the last thing they want is a shutdown. I think they re grossly mistaken and overly frightened of this, but the last thing they want is a shutdown. They want that more than they want border security. They re petrified of a shutdown. If they believed the president when he told  em he ll veto this without money, then they ll get the money.If they believed him. If they really think that he ll veto this.  Cause $5 billion? Folks, it s so insignificant when compared to the total expenditure of $4 trillion. That s gonna be the annual budgetary expense. That s not what s in the CR, but it s, you know, a third of that or fourth of that. It s just chump change to come up with this. If they think the president really meant that he s gonna veto this, they will come up with the money.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/02/06/how-american-greatness-triggers-the-left/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Feb 6, 2019RUSH: Now, in the last hour I made a point that I think what s driving the left on all this is this abject racism, this hatred for Caucasians. It manifests itself in their so-called hatred for the founders. And they never say that, by the way, folks.They never openly rip   well, some of them do, but just trust me on this. Their animus and the thing that s propelling the deranged left right now is their belief that this nation is unjust and immoral from the first day because it was founded by a bunch of rich white guys who enshrined slavery into the founding and creation of the United States. They also further believe that these white guys set up a country and government for themselves and their families and their descendants and so that only white males would actually ever benefit, have power, have wealth.Now, it used to not be. In the sixties  protests, it wasn t about that. This is relatively new, and it coincides with the direction that higher education has taken in the last 30 to 40 years in corrupting and poisoning the minds of people about the very injustice of the American founding. This has become an all-out attack on the existence of the United States of America in toto, and it s being done under the context and the premise that America is racist.Nothing worse can be said about someone than that they re racist, right? Racism is a card the Democrats have been playing on Republicans  cause it works. Obama was uncriticized. Obama was elected by white people hoping everybody would realize they weren t racists after they voted for him! Race is something the left will not allow to evaporate. They will not allow it to find a level of normalcy. They will not admit that we have dealt with slavery.They will not admit that we have done more than most nations in the world to deal with discrimination and unfairness, that we fixed a lot of these problems and we lead the world in it. No. To them, we re still in the 1800s because the very foundation of our founding enshrined all this stuff, and we cannot fix this! We cannot recover! We cannot reciprocate! We cannot erase! This country needs to be transformed. We need to get rid of every aspect of the founding, including the political and economic structure.Only then will this be a just and decent country, and that s the objective. If you doubt me, the evidence is everywhere. But I found a story last night on Vox, a Millennial news website, written by a white guy, Zack Beauchamp. He may pronounce it  Beecham.  I don t know. It s pronounced both ways.  B-e-a-u champ.  The headline:  Trump s 2019 State of the Union Was an Ode to an Imaginary America   A kind of faux populism that s really about race. Here s a pull quote:  The tension between Trump s State of the Union message and his actual record reveals the core of his administration s thinking: Not populism, but ethno-nationalism. An ideal of a country whose politics center the interests of one ethnic group, the white majority. That is really what the State of the Union was about, and no amount of supposedly race-neutral populism can mask that,  and this whole piece attempts to prove that what Trump stands for is white privilege, while nationalism.The white majority remaining the white majority. The reason Trump doesn t want illegal immigrants is because of race. The reason Trump wants people in jail despite his actions on criminal justice reform is race. Everything, they say, that s rooted in Donald Trump s success is you, his voters. You don t want any brown people in your country. You don t want any black people in your country (except those that work for you for nothing). You want a white majority like it was when you were growing up, when your parents were growing up.That s when America was great, when white people ran everything, and that s what Trump wants! That s what  Make America Great Again  means to these people:  White people always in power, never losing their power, being able to discriminate, enslave, and do other horrible things to any minority,  and that s what is animating them, folks. So Trump can deliver a State of the Union last night that details the current state of American greatness, and they hate it.They re not even open to the concept that everybody in America can be great, that everybody in America can pursue excellence, that everybody in America can use whatever ambition and desire they have to become the best they can be. That s lost on them. To them, none of that s possible. White people prevent anybody else from being able to do any of that. White people don t want anybody else to succeed. White people don t want anybody else to be free.The real interesting thing here is how many people white kids they have convinced of this. The white Millennial population, the white snowflake population largely buys into this crock! So Trump s  Make America Great Again  isn t about making America great again. It s about making sure white people don t lose control of America. That s what they think; that s what they re telling people. That s why every group in the Democrat Party is a victim, even these women who are a majority of human beings in America are still a minority.Because they are a victim of these white guys   imaginary white people who want to have everything for themselves, give none of it away, share none of it, make sure anybody not white lives a life of misery and second-class status. That is what they think  Make America Great Again  means   and they really do, folks. Particularly these young people. They ve had it drilled into them. This is how they ve been taught. It s how they ve been raised. It s how they ve been educated. They re running around with guilt like you can t imagine.They have been given this guilt trip and a sign that if they re white, they have to be accepted by the new minority class that s gonna be taking over. The way to do that is to acknowledge that they themselves have white privilege and they want to get rid of it, that they themselves have been racists, that they themselves have been unfair, that their parents and grandparents have. So you get them running down their own families, their own race, the founding of America or what have you. And this is what So it s all about race. And then everything, women and Hispanics and illegal immigrants, they re all subsets of the primary attack, which is that Donald Trump   and, most importantly, his supporters   they don t care about America being great. That s all just a slogan. They don t care about anything except making sure that they retain control and that they remain the majority. And so if you happen to be white and vote for Trump, guess what?You re a white supremacist.You re  white privilege. Doesn t matter who you are, what you really are.That s what you become in the eyes of college professors and high school teachers instructing students and so forth. This is what we re facing, and so that s how you get,  Trump s 2019 State of the Union Was an Ode to an Imaginary America.  That greatness, that economic success, that stuff that Trump detailed last night that s really happening really isn t happening except for white people. See? Nobody else is enjoying it. Nobody else is experiencing it. Nobody else is benefiting from it because of racism and bigotry. It is a poison, folks   and it s been so successfully used that many Republicans are afraid to even speak one syllable of opposition to it lest they be called racist over and over again.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Time to get started on the phones here. I ve had diarrhea of the mouth here for most of the program. So Naugatuck, Connecticut, Patty. You re next. It s great to have you here, by the way. Thank you for waiting.CALLER: Oh, it s an to speak to you, Rush. Thank you so much for taking my call. Twofold. Last evening was the most outstanding State of the Union speech I have ever listened to, and I listen to them all   and the delivery was exceptional. Second issue, in regard to the Trump shutdown. If Congress is so unhappy with it, they could legislate that shutdowns could never occur again. They could just legislate it right away. Second fold: If they re so concerned about security, with all due respect, they could actually eliminate the TSA, privatize it, and it could be modeled right after Israel. A win-win. They could take that $7.6 billion budget for the TSA and put it on the wall.RUSH: Well, you ve just identified the truth of it. They don t want government shutdowns to end. In their view, government shutdowns are a political winner for them.CALLER: Mmm-hmm.RUSH: Because they have a media on their side blaming Republicans for them each and every time they happen; so they re not ever gonna be serious about that.CALLER: It s a win-win.RUSH: Would you say, would you say that President Trump appeared presidential last night?CALLER: Oh, he was eloquent. The delivery was meaningful. The audience was adhered, including privately. I listened to every single word, glued to the television. The guests were so meaningful, heartwarming. The issues were pertinent. He encompassed all the important issues that are happening.RUSH: Well, it was all of that, but I m gonna tell you, I want to  I gotta take a break that s coming up. Well, there it is. Hang on. I got a point I want to make. I appreciate the call. Thank you, Patty!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Toward the end of the president s State of the Union address last night, I got an iMessage from a golfing buddy of mine, and the message was very short and succinct. He said,  Will you explain to me how can anybody watching this not feel good about what he s saying? He s basically saying that life is good in America and that the potential is even greater. What in the world is there not to feel good about?  Exactly. Do you realize a lot of people watching that last night were made angry, enraged?But literally over what?I mean, what, after all, was offensive last night? Trump did not get partisan other than attacking socialism and promising it would never happen here. He didn t really go into a confrontational partisan mode last night. He spelled out the greatness of America. But see, it goes back to what I told you, folks. This is why so many people literally can t understand it. Because to so many Democrats,  American greatness  simply means  white people having all the power, staying in power, and being able to mistreat anybody they don t like and deny anybody they don t like. That s the picture Trump painted last night to them. It s perverse, it s perverted, it s nonsensical. It s inaccurate and not supported by any evidence, and yet they believe it with all their hearts, or whatever they believe things with. But how could you not feel good about the picture painted of America, about our potential? Especially coming out of the eight years of Obama where we were told the exact opposite! We were told that a declining economy was the new normal and we had to adjust to it. We had to adapt to the fact that America s best days were finally behind us.A lot of people just ate that up! Man, that s really good. Again, it goes back to something that s not very complicated. You talk about the greatness of America, you talk about all the potential, you talk about the opportunity just waiting? If you have made yourself a victim already, then none of that stuff is available to you. By definition, it s being denied you by these powerful people, and so you become a victim. You can t do anything on your own! You have made that clear about yourself. You have announced yourself as a failure before you even try because a political party has made you feel comfortable with that.So the greatness of America, the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity life in America offers people who live here, the potential, the limitlessness? You know, you re only bound by your imagination and your dreams   and the tax code   and that s pretty much it. If hearing that doesn t inspire you or motivate you, I suggest there has to be a psychological reason. Victimhood, victimology is, I think, one of the large reasons/explanations for that. Because how anybody in the world can hear that last night and be mad at it or disappointed or whatever? It doesn t make any kind of logical sense, which is why it s hard for a lot of people to understand it.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let me read a paragraph of this column by Zack Beauchamp from Vox.  Trump s 2019 State of the Union Was An Ode To An Imaginary American.  This is the guy that wrote the piece claiming that there is no  Make America Great Again.  That s just code language for white privilege, white supremacy, white majority, nobody else gets or has anything unless whites let them have it. This is what Trump wants America to be, wants it to return to. Way too many Millennials have bought into this.Listen to this paragraph.  This is not, in fact, true. Trump s tax cut helped the wealthy, not the working class, and his attempt to weaken Obamacare is taking away health care from Americans who couldn t otherwise afford it. There s no evidence his trade policies are helping the working class. His policies on immigration have terrorized an untold number of working-class migrant families, who live in fear of an ICE raid targeting their loved ones. If Trump s goal is to help the little guy at the elite s expense, he s doing a terrible job of it. So we re supposed to help the little guy and hurt the elite! We are supposed to make the comfortable uncomfortable.  Trump s ethno-nationalist State of the Union.  Don t discard it, don t discount it, keep it in mind as you seek to understand or explain some of what appears to be insane belief and statement by people on the left.Here is Jeannie in Littleton, Colorado. I m glad you called. It s great to have you with us. Hi.CALLER: Long-time listener and great admirer. I just wanted to point out that as a successful woman in the private sector, I looked at those women in white last night and it really struck me that they represented what must be the culture of the public sector. I had never seen   I was so saddened for them because they had been supposedly released from some kind of a culture that would not allow women to be free. You don t find that in the private sector. Thanks in some cases to federal laws or state laws. But these poor women must have been  RUSH: Well, I need to step in and help you. You could say the same thing about race. We have ended slavery and we have done affirmative action and we have gone so far that the wealthiest woman in America is African-American and the most popular woman in America is African-American. We elected an African-American. But the point is, Jeannie, this doesn t count for anything!These women last night, all of these success stories that you know, that you re about to tell us of women in the private sector, what s happening today doesn t count, the successes that have taken place since 1963, since 1880, don t count. It was the way America was put together that counts. The fact that those things had to be fixed proves that America was unjust and immoral as founded and, as such, needs to be blown up and reassembled.The fact that there s been progress is irrelevant. The fact that people have lost their lives in a civil war to end slavery is irrelevant. The fact that we ve had affirmative action, the fact that we ve done any number of things to redress past wrong doesn t matter.No amount of fixing, no amount of repairs will ever matter because the original sin was the founding of the country by rich white guys who did what they really wanted America to always be. And if we don t want it to go back to the way it was founded, we ve got to get rid of the white guys who founded it and their descendants. And that is what this is about.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: It really is the case. There s no amount of fixing that will do. There s no remedy, amount of remedial action that will ever address the original wrongs. We gotta get rid of the people responsible for the original wrongs. That would be the white patriarchy. That s what this is all about.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We re gonna get into some of the audio sound bites from the State of the Union last night and some of the reaction. But I want to expand on something, a point that I just made, just to illustrate the assertion. My assertion is what we re up against   and, really, I m so thankful for that last call, the woman Jeannie. She was saying,  These women in Congress last night were so upset. If they could see the success women are experiencing in the private sector, they wouldn t be nearly as mad,  and it was like bright light went off all over the place for me.Like you, I endeavor and I struggle to understand what we re up against so as to develop ways to oppose it and stop it. It s crucial to understand who they really are and what they re really about. And it s always  I ve always noted that whatever progress has been made in whatever area of grievance, it doesn t matter. Whatever progress is made in race relations, it doesn t count for anything. Whatever progress has been made on feminist-related issues, it doesn t matter!There s never any happiness with it. There s never any satisfaction, appreciation. There is just a continuing rage and anger at it   and why? We elected the first black president; it has made race matters worse! The most popular entertainers in America, some of the wealthiest people in America, are African-American men and women. Doesn t count for anything! It doesn t change what these people feel about their own plights, and it doesn t change what they think about America.Now, let s go back and look at that incident with the Covington High School kid, Nick Sandmann, and the aging, decrepit Vietnam War-era veteran Native-American activist, Nathan Phillips. Do you remember how that triggered these people into an un-understandable and inexplicable rage? Well, I understand it better than I ever have now. Because, you see, there isn t any amount of remedy that will ever suffice. There s no amount of affirmative action, there s no amount of feminism accepted.There s no amount of change that will ever satisfy the left, and Donald Trump s presidency offers the clue as to why. That kid was wearing a  Make America Great Again  hat, and that was the trigger. That sent these people off into areas of deranged irrationality that you and I could not comprehend. The picture had it all. It had what they thought was a smirking, arrogant, sniveling, white supremacist kid wearing a Donald Trump hat confronting a poor, decrepit, aging Indian and laughing at him and mock.And what that told them was what the Donald Trump presidency is. Since there s no fixing, since no amount of redress and no remedy will ever be enough, what must happen is the original sin has to be changed. The founding, the  white patriarchy  has been destroyed because that s the root of all of this. And no amount of fixing it will ever, ever change the founding   and since it was founded that way, if we re not careful, we could always go back to it.So when they say,  Donald Trump s populism is really a quest to return to white nationalism, to white supremacy, to white privilege,  they believe it. They live in constant fear that this country is, at some point, gonna revert to the way it was founded and all of these remedies and all these changes are gonna be wiped out. That s what they see Trump as.  Make America Great Again,  to them, means rolling back every civil rights advance, every feminist advance, every minority advance there s ever been   because that s what white people want.So the only to prevent a return to the days of America as founded, is to overthrow America as founded, and to get of all vestiges of it. That kid, Nick Sandmann, told them  That picture actually encapsulated their fear of what a Trump presidency is, that kids like that are gonna be ruling the roost and determining who gets to be happy and who doesn t, who goes to jail and who doesn t, who gets paid and who doesn t   and he was smirking! The fact that it was an Indian? The original sin goes way beyond the founding of America.The original sin begins with white Europeans coming here in the first damn place and taking it away from Nathan Phillips and his ancestors! And then taking it away from Mexico! And then taking it away from Cuba and then taking it away from the West Indies. The original sin goes back to Christopher Columbus and that era when this whole area was supposedly discovered by these filthy white Europeans who brought all this pestilence and racism and sexism and bigotry and homophobia with them.It s kind of ironic now that these same people look to Europe as the salvation of America s problems.  We need to be more like the Europeans. We need more trains! Uh, we need narrower streets. We need to drive around little matchbox cars. We need windmills! We need nobody earning more than $10,000 a year. We need this and we need that. That s the   But seriously, folks, the key to this is   and the reason why these people have to be defeated and the reason they cannot be negotiated with or accommodated   that there s no amount of whatever we can give them in a negotiation to make them happy!There s no amount of compromise. Electing the first African-American president didn t do a diddly-squat thing to changing their rage and anger, because then we have the audacity to oppose him. We were opposing of his policies. The fact that Stacey Abrams had Oprah behind her and still lost proves what a racist, scummy place Georgia still is! And it s all traced back to the original sin.The fact that we lost 500,000 people in the Civil War to end slavery doesn t count, doesn t mean anything, because we were still founded by people who said it was okay   and we can t ever allow those people to be back in charge. And those people are epitomized by Donald Trump and  Make America Great Again,  which means (to them) all of the original sins that they think are sins of the white population and what they ve done to this continent returning to power.And that s why these women, many of them white, not all, but many, it s why these women are unimpressed with how much more money women make. They re unimpressed with how much better life is for women in America overall. Doesn t matter. Because there was a time when they were all in The Handmaid s Tale for real. And that s what white guys really want women to have to go back to. That s why they make movies depicting it!So no amount of fix, no amount of remedy, no amount of negotiation. And that s what their objective is   I don t care what word you use    overthrow,   transformation  their objective is to make certain that this faceless white supremacy majority can never, ever again be in charge of anything, ever, otherwise all these people will be the second and third class citizens that they, in their minds, still are, even though they ignore all of the positive changes, all of the opportunity, all the greatness that s there to be had in this country. Doesn t count for a thing.It s an unnatural view of things. It s an illogical view of things. It s a denial of the reality of things. It s therefore only possible if people s minds have been propagandized with this way of thinking or have been indoctrinated with it. And, sad to say, they have. I mean, this has been the way America has been taught for many decades.We have a couple of generations now who have been taught that this is what America really is, not the old storybook Founding Fathers, greatness, Abe Lincoln, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson. They re just a bunch of racist, slave-owning bigots who have been romanticized way beyond reality. It s really a perverted way to look at things.And, by the way, this view encompasses every minority. Every minority is welcomed into this view that when this nation was founded, they were considered second class.  Really? Well, I ll show them something.  So all these minorities unify around the central premise that America, unjust and immoral from the beginning and therefore America cannot be reformed under its current founding structure. It s why it has to go socialist or communist. That s the only real redress, the only real remedy is wiping out every vestige of America, from capitalist economics to the legal system.And they re on the way, they ve got a two-tier justice system when they re in charge of it. It s not just we have differing ideologies and these people can be persuaded. And it s not that they can be accommodated and various demands of theirs be met. If we admit it, every demand they ve made that s been met makes them angrier, makes them more outraged, makes them more primed for a fight. It s as though all the advances don t matter because, in essence, they haven t really happened because they still happened 200 years ago when this country was founded.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/11/trumps-winning-the-shutdown-bigly/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 11, 2019RUSH: Do any of you have the sense that President Trump is winning this shutdown battle with Chuck and Nancy? I do. I have the sense that he s winning this thing big time. By winning it big time I m talking about with the American people. And I think Chuck and Nancy and the Democrats are beginning to look the way we see them to a lot of people.And in fact there are some Democrats now   there s a break in the Democrat wall around their party. There are five or six Democrats, elected Democrats in Washington who are now publicly expressing their thinking that we need fencing here, maybe a wall here, not the whole border, but there s some breakdown here. You know, the Democrats won the House in 2016, but a lot of Democrats won in districts where Trump was elected. And those Democrats I think are hearing from their constituents on this.There s another interesting facet about this. There is some history taking place here. This manufactured crisis, and, by the way, I love Trump on this. Trump says, you know, everybody s looking for collusion. Well, look no further than the collusion between the Drive-By Media and the Democrat Party on this whole business of this crisis being manufactured. And we have pointed out the collusion between the Drive-By Media and the Democrats with different montages illustrating this over the years starting with the now-famous gravitas montage.And now there s a montage put together of all of these media people ñ well, first all the Democrats calling this a manufactured crisis followed by another montage with media people echoing it and Trump correctly points out that this is collusion. The media and the Democrats working together, as you know, I believe that it s the media that s actually leading all of this, running inference for the Democrats. And I don t think there needs to be any coordination. These people are on the same page. There s no memo needed. There s no instruction manual needed for how they re gonna act every day. It s something that occurs naturally to them.And it remains the media montage of the day, despite that it s been nuked, despite that it has been blown to smithereens, despite that everybody has performed the public of the collusion here, it remains the media mantra of the day. And that s really odd when you think about it, because the Democrats, everything else is a crisis! The Democrat Party has turned politics into an ongoing series of crises.It doesn t matter, whatever is on their agenda is a crisis. Food stamps, crisis. Health care, crisis. Climate change, crisis. Whatever it is they want is a crisis, except this is not a crisis. In every other issue the Democrats have told us how many people are gonna die if Republicans do X. From opposing Obamacare to enacting tax cuts. The Democrats even had a figure, 10,000 people are gonna die if we cut taxes. But there is no crisis with the open border, and there is no concern over the number of people dying.The Democrats have expressly abandoned their modern modus operandi. And it s kind of funny, they are in the process of still trying to convince everybody of a manufactured crisis at the border, the same people who have been trying to convince us for decades that climate change is the biggest and most urgent crisis the world has ever faced. They ve never wavered. They continue to pound that. They amplify it. They intensify it. Climate change, big crisis, X-numbers of millions of people will die.Meanwhile, people are dying. People are being victimized by crime because of our situation at the border. And the left is mocking that. They re making fun of that! They re making fun of expressions of concern for victims of violent crimes committed by people here illegally, some who are members of gangs. As if the president is some kind of uptight fool who s out of touch.I mean, this is really bad for them, folks. This is a glaring example of how literally out of touch they are with the people who make this country work. And how about all of the hand-wringing over these poor federal workers are gonna miss a paycheck. Oh, my God. Meanwhile, how many people missed paychecks and lost jobs during the eight years of the Obama administration and you couldn t find a single syllable of concern from the Democrat Party!The hypocrisy is raging here. I ve never seen anything like this. It s deranged. We have an ongoing problem that results in rapes and murders, illegal drugs, human trafficking. The president, who wants to fix the problem and help innocent people, is being mocked, laughed at, made fun of, and ridiculed and stonewalled by the Democrats. This is what unhinged looks like.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  I m gonna kick off Open Line Friday with an email question.   Dear Mr. Limbaugh:  Have you noticed that there has been very little polling   almost no polling   since Trump s Oval Office address to the nation earlier this week?  And there was none of the usual stuff they do for presidential speeches.  There was no  snap poll  on CNN or any other network right after the speech.  There was no online quickie,  What do you think?  poll anywhere. There has been no polling data that we could find anywhere following Trump s speech.  There weren t any Frank Luntz focus groups with any undecideds out there.  They didn t gather any Trump voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and ask them if they re still behind Trump.  The media didn t do any of the stuff they usually do.  We have no idea what the valued and very wise independents thought of Trump s speech. Usually, Mr. Limbaugh, we get a flood of polls. We get a flood of reactions and focus groups here. The internet and Twitter are filled with polling data, focus group data after an Oval Office address like this. But not this time.  Why?  Why, Mr. Limbaugh, has there been literally no reporting of any public reaction to Trump s speech on Monday night?  Doesn t the question kind of answer itself, folks?  Well, the short answer is it s because they  I m sure they did do a couple of polls.  I m sure they did, in a flash way, sample public opinion.  They didn t get the negative reaction to Trump they hoped for. But there s more.  Hang on.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  So the first Open Line Friday call today is actually an email.  Mr. Limbaugh, why no polling data?  Why no focus groups?  Why no flash polls on the internet?  Why not a single report of any public reaction to President Trump s Oval Office address on Tuesday night?   Let s go to the audio sound bites.  This is Brad Parscale.  He is the Trump reelection campaign manager.  He was on the Fox News Channel last night.  Question:   You said that according to your internal polls, the president has the highest numbers you ve ever seen him at. PARSCALE:  We ve been monitoring him over the entire two-year period and prior to that. But we kind of started it over when he became president and he got into office. And watching the data, you know, I started to see this rise as he started making this fight.  And I m not surprised by it.  Because if you go back and you look  You look at the people that are kind of these swing voters, these people who possibly not like him for personality or different reasons, the No. 1 reason they will vote for him is because of his stance on border security.RUSH:  Bingo.  So here you have the Trump campaign manager saying that their data, their internal data   and it makes no sense for them to lie to themselves. Internal polling data campaign to campaign, candidate to candidate, politician to politician, that s the one result they don t lie to themselves about.  They have to take that seriously.  It s theirs.  And their internal data shows Trump s at his highest level since this fight began.  It makes perfect sense why the Drive-By Media would not be reporting a single public opinion reaction to Trump s Oval Office speech or even on the subject The public polling data that we do have is 93% of the American people think it s a major problem; 70% of the people support a national emergency declaration to solve this.  And I want to go back. Grab sound bite No. 4.  I want to go back to the day that basically sets the Drive-By Media off on their three-week narrative that I am president.  It was December 19th.  Let me see  The 19th? (muttering) Was that the last day I was here, the 20th? No.  It was the middle of the week.  It was close to the last day that we were here for the year, December 19th, and that was the day that I advised the president to walk away from the continuing resolution deal and go ahead and let the government shutdown.RUSH ARCHIVE:  I think the president ought to veto this. This is why he got elected. This is why people stick with him. This is why his support base has not abandoned him during this full-frontal effort of the Democrats and the media to destroy him. They ve hung with him because of this. This issue predated Trump. The American people have been telling Washington for 25 years they don t want this, and the American people have continued to triumph. Washington continues to try to thwart the will of the people on this. Finally, the people elected somebody who actually said he meant what he was talking about regarding this, and they have stuck with him. The president should veto this thing, tell  em he s not signing it, and leave for Mar-a-Lago today. He s not supposed to leave until the 21st. Somebody in the White House tell him I ll meet him on the first tee tomorrow.RUSH:  Well, we all know what happened.  It was shortly after that little brief monologue that I got a direct message, an instant message from somebody delivering to me a message from the president.   Don t worry, I m not signing this thing! I don t know who s telling you what, but we re not signing this. We re not signing the continuing resolution.  I m gonna veto this.   I then shared those exact words, that exact story, and we were off   and we re still in it.Three weeks of the Drive-By Media claiming that Trump was on the verge of signing it until I raised hell, and somebody walked into the Oval Office and said (sputtering),  Mr. President! Mr. President, Rush Limbaugh  You re gonna lose Rush Limbaugh! Don t do it! Don t do it, sir,  and Trump stopped.  That s the story they told.  You just heard it.  Nobody ran in and told the president anything.  The president sent somebody to tell me that I was worried about nothing.  So let s see.  Where are we?Here we go.  Sound bite Nos. 6 and 7 to continue the theme here.  This is yesterday afternoon.  This is CNN International.  This is CNN around the world on a program called Hala Gorani Tonight.  That s somebody s name. It s not a holiday. It s Hala Gorani Tonight, and she had on with her senior media reporter Oliver Darcy about the government shutdown.  Now, this is yesterday afternoon, but they went back all the way before Christmas to explain how I shut down the federal government.GORANI:  Rush Limbaugh s a   one of the, uh, far-right radio hosts.  Here s what Rush Limbaugh said on his radio show.RUSH:  Looks like a lot of people s worst fears may be realized and that the president is getting ready to cave on getting any money from a wall in the current budget.GORANI:  How much influence do these types of commentators actually have on the president?  Can we measure it?RUSH:   How much influence do these types of commentators have ?   What type of commentator am I?  What are these types of commentators?  That was Hala Gorani, and she s reporting or asking the senior media reporter, Oliver Darcy.  Here was the answer to his question.  Again, this is yesterday afternoon.DARCY:  We know for sure that they have influence!  He received so much blowback in right-wing media from individuals like Rush Limbaugh that he ended up reversing his decision, and our reporting indicates that it was in large part due to his critics.  I think the president is very smart.  He knows that the people his supporters watch are the people that are on Fox News and the people that are on talk radio like Rush Limbaugh.  And he knows that if they start criticizing him, he s gonna be in trouble with the base.  If someone like Rush Limbaugh is saying that the president s not being tough on the wall, he s not delivering on his promises, that s when it gets dangerous for Trump.RUSH:   People can t  You know, I tell you, folks, it s amazing how consistent these people are.  In the early days of this program, you were the mind-numbed robots, incapable of independent thinking, unable to make up your own minds.  You were nothing but a bunch of  Well, I was the Pied Piper, and you were the little animals running around and you didn t do anything until I told you to do it.  So the presentation is always conservatives have no ability to think on their own.  Every conservative is the result of evil influence from some savant.  Now it s Trump.Trump is the idiot.  Trump is the guy that has no mind of his own, Trump is the guy incapable of independent thought.  Trump will only do what certain types of commentators tell him to do.  You see, the theme here is that Republicans/conservatives are idiots, incapable of proper independent thought and are the result of brainwashing or pied piperism or what have you.  It s constant.  I mean, it s been this way for 30 years, and I m here to tell you, Donald Trump doesn t need to be told by anybody what the right thing to do on the border is.He s only the leader of the issue.  He is only the guy   the one guy   that s taking any action on it that the American people want taken on it.  They voted for countless numbers of politicians to do this and not a single one of them has, certainly not to the extent that Trump has.  The idea that Trump is the product of being influenced by certain types of commentators is just another creation of the idea that Trump is a blithering idiot and doesn t know what he s doing, doesn t really care about issues, doesn t really have a core.He s just subject  (impression)  He s afraaaaid !  He s afraaaaid of Fox News.  He s afraaaaid of losing his base.  He s afraid of Matt Drudge, and so forth,  and it s just the exact opposite.  It s more evidence that they have no idea who Trump is, and they have no idea how to deal with him.  By the way, the panic is now skyrocketing out there when news hit that the Trump administration is making plans to move on from Ruth  Buzzi  Ginsburg.So the Ginsburg site s putting out news,  Hey, she s perfectly fine!  The surgery that she just had says there s no remaining cancer, no further treatment will be needed.   You can interpret this any number of ways.  But there s panic setting in on that.  Of course, if you thought the Kavanaugh fight was something, it was Romper Room compared to what happens if one of these libs on the court resigns.  One more little sound bite before the break.  This is Mara Liasson last night on (impression)  NPR All Things Considered.   This is a bit of what she had to say.LIASSON:  Almost every poll shows that while border security is broadly popular with voters, the wall   and shutting down the government to get a wall   is not, except among Trump s core supporters.  And now that Trump is promising to act alone if necessary, he s getting praise from some of the same conservatives that previously attacked him for waffling on the wall.  Over the weekend, Rush Limbaugh told his listeners that Trump has to do this all by himself.RUSH ARCHIVE:  It remains a one-man show.  Donald Trump against the Democrat Party and the media!  We are very fortunate the guy does not cave.RUSH:  There must have been a best-of show that played  over the weekend  that she heard because everybody knows this is not a weekend show. But she said that I said it  over the weekend,  and she s NPR.  So they know.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Grab sound bite number 21. Changing gears. Lisa Murkowski. This is a lesson on what would be happening if we didn t have Donald Trump in the White House. Lisa Murkowski, Republican senator from Alaska,  We just want the shutdown to end. It s so terrible. So bad. We can do everything we need to do if we just end the shutdown.  This is what would have already happened. We can already chalk up a defeat were it not for Donald Trump.MURKOWSKI: We want border security. I want border security. I think that the president s request for a comprehensive view of how we address this is not something so unreasonable. Let s figure that out. Let s walk through it. Let s do a short-term CR to allow us to process this, but let s not keep the government shut down while we do this.RUSH: There we go, so basically let s capitulate to the Democrats. The Democrats have said they will negotiate in good faith if we just reopen the government. So let s take them at their word and let s end the shutdown and let s have a discussion with them. There won t be any discussion, but this is what would have already happened, absent Donald Trump.This is on the floor of the Senate just earlier today.  We want border security. I want border security. I think the president s request for a comprehensive view is not so unreasonable. See? I think the president s reasonable. Let s figure that out. Let s walk through that. But let s do a short-term continuing resolution to allow us to process this. Let s do it after we reopen the government.  And you can chalk up another big-time Republican defeat.Now, these next two sound bites are   I don t know what   amazing, penetrating, shocking, eye opening. Late yesterday afternoon in McAllen, Texas, while touring the border we have for you the audio of a portion of President Trump being briefed about the situation there by the Rio Grande Valley Sector acting chief Raul Ortiz. Rio Grande Valley Sector acting chief patrol agent   what a title   Rio Grande Valley Sector acting chief patrol agent Raul Ortiz, and he s briefing Trump on the circumstances.ORTIZ: We continue to see an influx of people, as you described, humanitarian crisis. Yesterday we had 450 apprehensions, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Yesterday alone you re telling me?ORTIZ: Four-hundred and fifty. Out of that, 133 from countries other than the Central American countries and Mexico. India. We apprehended some Pakistanis, folks from Romania, on and on and on.THE PRESIDENT: How many Pakistanis yesterday?ORTIZ: Two yesterday.RUSH: Were you able to hear all that? See, I wasn t. To me that just sounded like   I didn t hear a single word of that. I just heard noise. So in the event some of you have difficulty, let me just read the transcript of what he said,  cause this is stunning.Ortiz: Mr. President, we do have a humanitarian crisis, as you have described. Yesterday we had 450 apprehensions.Trump said: Yesterday alone, 450?Ortiz: Four-hundred and fifty. Out of that, 133 from countries other than the Central American countries and Mexico. India. We apprehended some Pakistanis, folks from Romania, on and on and on.Trump: Just how many Pakistanis yesterday?Ortiz: We had two yesterday. Well, okay, two, 10, whatever. They re not from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras and Mexico exclusively. So the president asked Rio Grande Valley Sector acting chief patrol agent Raul Ortiz to continue, and he did.Ortiz: So far this sector has apprehended folks from 41 different countries. Just yesterday we apprehended 133 people from countries other than Central America and Mexico. That includes individuals from India, Pakistan, China, Romania, Ecuador, Nicaragua, on and on and on.And so I know we keep talking about the family units and unaccompanied children, and that makes up typically about 60, 70%. We ve seen a change over the last couple of weeks where that number is less than 50% of the apprehensions we make here in south Texas. So south Texas continues to lead the country in apprehensions as well as marijuana seizures in between the ports of entry. So CBP and DHS are committed to both our border security mission as well as our humanitarian mission. Mr. President, Senators, we couldn t do it without your support. We really appreciate you coming down here. It means an awful lot to the men and women of DHS, CBP, the Border Patrol, our local law enforcement.RUSH: Trump asked him to repeat all that for the reporters  cause this guy Ortiz repeated this in the meetings and Trump asks him to tell the news media this. One hundred and thirty-three people from countries outside Central America and Mexico. And the Democrats continue to say that there s nothing going on, nothing unusual here, and we ve got it handled, we don t need to do anything other than what we re doing. Trump is confronting a problem that American presidents have been ignoring for 30 years and have been dealing with the way Lisa Murkowski wants to deal with it. Here s what Trump said yesterday. Number 3.THE PRESIDENT: It s all common sense. And Nancy and Chuck know that. Look, they re not winning this argument, they re losing the argument badly, they know it. And it s not about an argument, and it s not about politics. For me, it s about doing the right thing. I could do a lot easier things. I could just forget this like everyone else did. This should have been done 30 years ago. And 20 years ago. And 10 years ago, and 5 years ago. I could have done like everyone else, just sort of say, hey, forget it.RUSH: Yeah, just like I could have ignored what was going on at the NFL, let them ruin themselves. But he doesn t ignore. Campaign promise. He s keeping a campaign promise. Do you realize just how much this flummoxes people in Washington? Keeping campaign promises is for total idiots. Nobody does that. They can t believe that Trump would even care to keep a promise. That s how insignificant campaign promises are to these people. I m not exaggerating. They cannot comprehend this. It s another in the long line of things that they think Trump is crazy about.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/13/why-democrats-will-never-fund-the-wall/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 13, 2018RUSH:  Boynton Beach, Florida.  This is Wayne.  Wayne, welcome.  Great to have you here, sir.CALLER:  Well, Merry Christmas, Rush.  How are you?RUSH:  Fine.  Same to you, sir.CALLER:  Yeah.  Thank you.  Before I go off the air, I was wondering if you wanted  My brother s an electronic engineer. He d be able to help you with your Apple charger, I m sure.  He s been an electrical engineer all his life.  Anyways, I ll get to my question.  I ve always wondered where Obama got his $150 billion of cold cash from and why Donald Trump can t go through that same federal ATM machine and pull out $5 billion?RUSH:  Yeah.  Not only that, Obama got $150 billion, much of it in cash, and that was done  Cash is hard to trace.  Where did it come from?  But everybody on the team would have been an Obamaite, as opposed to anybody Trump would call wanting to do that would try to sabotage it.  So they put together whatever the amount of money, and they delivered it in cash on pallets to the Tehran airport, $150 billion.  $150 billion.Democrats didn t scream.  Nobody screamed.  It was part of the Iran deal to make sure that Iran got a nuclear weapon.  They tried to tell us,  No, no, no, no, no! This deal is to ensure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.  Really? We re paying them and we re facilitating their nuclear infrastructure so they can someday get a bomb, and you re telling us it s not for that?  By the way, the European Union  This did not make any news earlier this week or maybe lake last week.The European Union  After the Iranians test fired a nuclear device, the European Union very sheepishly said,  Gee, I guess you were right.   The European Union were believing the Iranians were not developing a nuclear bomb.  One of the reasons why is Obama told them that the deal was that was not part of it.  Now they are out there testing things that have relationships to nukes and so forth and the European Union says (muttering),  Oh, gosh, I guess you were right. You haven t seen that story, have you?  I guarantee you haven t seen that story.  If you Google it, you might find it on page 25 of Iran nuclear search page results.  It won t be at the top.  But about this $5 billion for a wall.  You understand, ladies and gentlemen, that no matter what Chuck and Nancy say about it, there is no way they are ever going to agree to a wall.  They re never going to agree to a deal.  If they did, it would be fatal to them.Whatever they say about it is designed for public consumption.  They have to make it look like they care about border security.  But, my friends, they could never, ever sign on to and assist in the funding and construction of a wall.  You know why?  Because walls work!  These people that we re talking about put walls around their homes and their estates!  They know that walls work, and that s precisely why there isn t gonna be one (if they have anything to say about it) on the southern border, because if there ever is a wall, guess what?We finally will have control over who gets into this country and who doesn t.  They have walls around their estates in Malibu, don t they?  They have walls around their homes up in Napa Valley; Silicon Valley; Austin, Texas; wherever.  Walls work.  But a wall would be bad for two things.  Imagine the optics!  A wall? A wall sends the signal:  Don t come.  You can t get through.   The wall says,  Don t even bother trying.   The Democrats need these people!They re never gonna stand for a wall being built.  The optics would stop them from succeeding and the wall itself would.  No more caravans.  You put up a 30-foot concrete wall or whatever it is, and I ll guarantee you illegal immigration in the southern border of the United States is brought to a screeching halt.  That s why the Democrats are never gonna go for it!  You put a wall up, and you free the Border Patrol to go after illegals already in the country and deport them.The wall is the single greatest obstruction to the future of the Democrat Party.  They do not want a wall.  They will not support a wall.  A wall would bring about the end of the Democrat Party.  That s why all this that they re talking about is nothing but smoke and mirrors.  They re never gonna support it.  They re never gonna fund it.  They want people to think they might.  They ll argue about money, government shutdowns.  But they can t survive as a party if that wall is ever built.  That s their permanent underclass that would not be permitted to enter the country.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I can t emphasize this enough, either. This is why the wall is so important. Not only is the wall important for the preservation of our culture and our society and our country   and if you doubt that, look at California. You could make  If you wanted to, you could make an argument that Mexico has already succeeded in taking back California. If you wanted to lay that out and make the case based on certain criteria, you could do that. That s how far gone California is. California is its own country. We had the news yesterday.They re thinking of actually taxing texts. They re so out of money. There s a story from San Francisco. People who work in San Francisco restaurants can t afford to. They can t afford to live anywhere near the city where they work. The amount of money it takes to commute, many of them  Even in 1985 when I was in Sacramento, there were people who worked in San Francisco every day who lived in Sacramento. It s a 90-minute commute.Now, back then, it was being done for a lot of reasons, lifestyle and such. But today, it s necessary financially, and a lot of California is this way. People can t afford to live where they work. They re so out of money, they re now gonna start taxing text messages? The story I have says that iMessages on iPhones would be exempt. Yeah, well, not for long. You know most of these elected officials don t understand tech whatsoever. They don t know the difference between a text and an iMessage. It s all the same thing to them.You have to tell  em,  Well, no. The text messages are the green bubbles and the iMessage are blue.   You mean we re not gonna tax the blue bubbles?  Yeah, your law is not tax the blue bubbles.   Well, we re gonna change the law,  which is what would happen when these dummkopfs fitted out what they were exempting. They don t know diddly-squat about what they were doing. All they know is they don t have any money. This state is already gone when it comes to climate change.If you want to see a proving ground, you don t have to go to France. You just have to go to California. It s gone, and France is too, and you see what happened. Eventually this kind of revolt may not be possible in California because the people who would revolt are gone   and those who aren t would realize the futility of it. The people who would never revolt are the people that are mostly living on government largesse anyway. So what difference does it make to them? Arizona s gonna be next.You go to the southern border of Texas and the entire border of Texas that borders Mexico is either already blue or turning that way. So the Democrat Party has made all this happen without a wall. They ve made all of this happen with illegal immigration. It has been as much a part of their part of their political forecasting and belief system as anything else in it is. And a wall they simply cannot permit.No matter what they say, no matter how understanding they appear to be in conversations about border security, they cannot afford there to be a wall. It would bring an immediate end to their primary constituency, which is the great unwashed and permanent underclass. And then the derivatives off of that. This is what President Trump s up against. Now, Trump wants to build a wall to save America, the culture, and basically to enforce existing federal law.You know, simpletons are that way. There s a law says we shouldn t break it. Well, let s enforce it! People are breaking it every day. This is not good. We need to enforce the law. That becomes,  This guy s not qualified! This guy doesn t get it! This guy represents a threat.  All he wants to do is enforce the law. It s why he wants to enforce the law the Democrats can t permit. As far as they re concerned, Donald Trump is trying to make sure that future Democrats don t get to register to vote!That s what the wall represents to them. So don t believe any Democrat chitchat that they agree with it or that they understand the need for border security or any of that,  cause they don t! And they don t care about preserving America as founded. It s the exact opposite. Their power, their perpetual power, their never-ending power depends on the country not remaining as founded. Back to the phones we go to Sudbury, Massachusetts. This is Paul. Great to have you with us, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Can you hear me okay?RUSH: Yeah, I hear you fine.CALLER: Perfect. Merry Christmas, and I wanted to give kudos out to the peach iced tea that you guys sell. It s awesome. I really love it.RUSH: I m glad to hear that. That s great. It is the best-tasting iced tea that anybody has ever made or sold. I appreciate your compliment.CALLER: Sure. No the problem. If there s any time left, I would like to ask you a quick question about a cell carrier. But my main question today was talking about the government shutdown, and then doesn t the executive or the president himself have the ability to determine what gets defunded or will not go forward? So couldn t the president say,  You know, we re gonna start the shutdown and we re going to hold off on congressional pay to sort of get those folks to come to the table and really work with Trump on getting some of this fall funding down? RUSH: No. When you start talking about the president telling Congress what s gonna happen, you can t do that. You can t eliminate congressional pay. He can authorize the expenditure of money under the aegis of national security, which is what he s threatening to do.  Okay. If you guys aren t gonna authorize $5 billion for the wall, I m just gonna go get it from the defense budget and I m gonna claim that it s a national security expenditure and I m gonna have the military build it and you don t stop me. Well, they would. First thing they d do is go to court and get some federal judge somewhere in Hawaii or say,  Trump can t do what he s doing because he just can t  cause we don t like him and we don t like what he s doing.  Get some judge to stay it and then Trump would obey what the judge says because Trump s a law-and-order guy, and they d have to go through the whole process of taking this to the Supreme Court and so forth.That s what they re gonna do. Whatever he proposes that is in any way injurious to them, which is open borders. They are the open-borders party. They need it. They need the border to remain open and porous. They don t care who comes in. They re all potential Democrat voters. If they re drug cartel members, if they re thugs, if they re MS-13 or if they re just poverty stricken people escaping a war-torn place, they re all potential Democrat voters. It doesn t matter anything beyond that.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/24/hang-in-there-mr-president-and-ignore-the-media-narratives/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 24, 2019RUSH: Okay. So the news is the president folded, the president caved on the State of the Union. He backed down to Pelosi, who refuses to open up the chamber. You know, the Drive-Bys and their acolytes are always painting Trump as an autocrat, dictator, Hitler, despot. What do you call the woman who is dictating that the House Chamber not be used for an address to the nation by the president of the United States? And now the excuse is,  Well, it isn t any big deal. Nobody watches the State of the Union. Well enough people watch it for the Democrats to always want to do a response to the damn thing. Pelosi does not want Trump getting a national forum. Pelosi does not want Trump having a national bully pulpit in the form of a State of the Union. I mean, she can t stop him from doing press conferences or rallies or any of that, but  She s losing this thing. This is what s hard to see about this, and the reason it s hard, folks (and I know some of you are gonna think I m nuts) is you cannot see what s literally going on on the Democrat side of things because the media is simply not gonna tell you.The AP has a story today which is Malpractice 101. It is a story about the near total unity on the Democrat side of the aisle. There isn t total unity, and each day there are more and more Democrats in the House who are starting to express misgivings about this. They re upset about two things. They don t like the fact that their speaker is intolerant of any view that is not hers. They don t like the idea that their party is acting in a way  It s not a lot of them, now, but they re there, and they re not being reported. You re not being told about them.They are concerned that their party is going to be seen as intransigent and uncooperative and denying the president of the United States a duly appointed, constitutional task   the State of the Union   and then also in the mix, they re worried about the issue. They re worried about immigration. They re worried about how it s gonna, in the long run, impact them   this intransigence on a wall, this lack of any desire to stop the massive flow of illegals across the border. We ve even got the Washington Post Something s going on. The Washington Post is fact-checking Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez again today, and they re giving her three or four  Pinocchios.  In other words, they re calling her a just flat-out liar. This is the Jeff Bezos, Amazon newspaper. Oh, speaking of which, BuzzFeed has laid off or is laying off 15% of its staff. Did you see that? Do you know what ? I feel very bad about forgetting to mention this because I ve known it, and it just didn t occur to me. BuzzFeed s owned by NBC.Comcast Universal owns BuzzFeed. They re a major investor in it, along with a venture capital outfit out in Silicon Valley, Andreessen Horowitz. They re owned and operated by a bunch of classic leftist socialists. But the interesting aspect about NBC owning BuzzFeed is that BuzzFeed  You have to look at it as NBC but without NBC in the name. So BuzzFeed being owned by NBC allows BuzzFeed to do what NBC wants without NBC s name on it, and then it allows NBC to double-dip by then reporting what BuzzFeed is saying, when BuzzFeed and NBC are basically the same thing.So BuzzFeed is the acknowledged radical left-wing extension of what NBC hopes to portray as the moderate, mainstream journalist, objective business   and they re all the same people. They are all the same mind-set. They re all the same objective. So it s not going well. BuzzFeed is laying off 15% of its workforce, which I think is  I ll double-check it here. I think it s a couple hundred people. Just like is happening in the newspaper print business throughout the country. But, anyway, my point here is that Trump just needs to continue hanging in. Let s go back to the audio sound bites January 16th on this program. This is what I said, just to remind you RUSH ARCHIVE: I m just gonna tell you, folks, if President Trump can hang in there   if he can hang in there and not go wobbly   he can win this. It s gonna be a few more weeks. There are gonna be a lot of risks. There are gonna be a lot of temptations to drop the ball and cave. I don t mean cave. There s gonna be a lot of temptation to make a deal. But he can win this if he just hangs in there.RUSH: Now, it s worth playing that again because it s gonna get tougher. It s gonna get harder. They re gonna throw bad poll numbers at him. They re gonna try to tell him he s losing his shirt on this, that he s putting at risk his reelection in 2020, but he s got to hang in there. They re also gonna push for something   and he s already made a deal. This is another thing that has some Democrats unhappy. Trump is seen as willing to talk to people. He s willing to negotiate.This is one of the objectives of the deal, by the way. I should tell you: Nobody in the White House thinks that this deal is gonna pass the Senate. It would need seven Democrats. There s only 53 Republicans in there. Need 60 votes. The point of proposing this was to show movement, was to show willingness, was to show the, uh, moderates and all the other so-called objectives of our politics that we re willing to talk, that we re willing to chat, that we re willing to cross the aisle, that we re willing to seek common ground, that we re willing to cooperate and show that government can work   all this happy horse malarkey.It s designed to show the Democrats are the ones that are not willing to talk, not willing to negotiate   and it s doing that! You just don t see it because the media doesn t report it! Just like the media lied through their teeth and are still trying to lie through their teeth about the Covington High School kids and Nathan Phillips. They re still lying about that. They re still trying to make the case that what we know, we don t really know. What we know is not true. The kids really are a bunch of creeps. They re racists, sexists, bigots, homophobes, hate Indians.They re still trying to make that case ever so subtly, using adjuncts like BuzzFeed rather than NBC saying it. By the same token, we re not seeing the friction and the fracturing on the Democrat side. But the deal is out there. We ll hold firm on the DACA kids and then we ll do the TPS arrangement. The Democrats are gonna come back with something like,  Well, how about a pathway to citizenship?  No, nothing can be added to this. There s no way this thing is gonna pass. It s not even its express purpose. I mean, even from the White House side.So right on schedule, exactly as predicted, the Drive-By Media is gleefully reporting that Trump is getting creamed in the polls, that his approval numbers are plummeting. There s even a Fox News poll out there. Let s see. What is it? The Fox News poll says that people are more upset with the shutdown than they are with illegal immigration. Sorry, folks. Not buying it. That s what they re saying. But it s all designed to put pressure on Trump. Here is a montage from yesterday and last night about the polling data. When this happens, my theory is this is when Trump is winning. When we get this predictable media montage focused on polling data showing how Trump is losing, it s because that s what they want. Polling data is being used to create a mind-set.Here s the example of it ABBY PHILLIP: (whispering) New polls show the president may be on shaky ground.BRIANNA KEILAR: Recent polls show a majority Americans blame President Trump.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: New polls show he s bearing more of the blame. His approval rating going down.SUSAN PAGE: The president s taking it on the chin and polls consistently show him down.CHRIS MATTHEWS: Trump loves polls. How s he living with the fact he s down?GWENDA BLAIR: The polls are showing people don t want him to do this.YAMICHE ALCINDOR: His approval ratings are really taking a hit.KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON: His job approval has slid.KAREN FINNEY: Each week he s hurting in the polls.SABRINA SIDDIQUI: A series of polls that show the majority of the public still blames President Trump.WOLF BLITZER: Look at the polls: Job approval number only 37%! That s pretty pitiful.RUSH: Uh, what poll is that? The poll I saw yesterday had Trump holding steady at 45%. I think it was Rasmussen I saw. Network morning shows today, a little preview of what s gonna happen, I think, if there is a cave on the shutdown. These are the network morning shows rejoicing in the breaking news of Trump caving on the State of the Union.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: (bouncy music) Good morning, America! Breaking overnight: President Trump backs down in that State of the Union show down.NORAH O DONNELL: (bouncy music) Breaking overnight: President Trump agrees to delay next week s State of the Union address after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says he won t be invited.HODA KOTB: (bouncy music) Breaking overnight: Trump folds!RUSH: This is a preview of what s gonna happen if there is any kind of an acquiescence on the shutdown   and we know Trump, and Trump doesn t cave. Trump repositions. We just have to wait and see what s going on here. Here. Here s Pelosi. She s also doing a victory lap. This morning in Washington while she was cogent. I mean, she had brain freezes and everything during this, but here s this.PELOSI: As you know, last night the president accepted the fact that the State of the Union should be at a time when government is not shut down. I m glad we could get that off table.   It is so unimportant in the lives of the American people in terms of especially those who are victims of the shutdown, hostages to the president s applause line in a campaign speech. Thank goodness we put that matter to rest.   We urge the president once again: Thank you for recognizing that it s inappropriate to have a State of the Union address for people working hard, very hard to protect all of us in that room and not getting paid for it.RUSH: Oh. So that s it? We can t do the State of the Union because the security staff would not be getting paid, and that would be immoral? When did these people become the arbiters of morality? But they have. I mean, they re the ones that get to define it under terms of racism and identity politics now. So she s gloating. You can imagine what it would be if there is any kind of a  I don t like the word  cave.   Folding  is another term. But this is what it would be. This is a foreshadow of how the Drive-Bys would be acting. Last night on CNN s Fredo Prime Time, Fredo Cuomo, the Democrat strategist Paul  The Forehead  Begala had this to say about Pelosi s decision to cancel the State of the Union  til after the government shutdown BEGALA: The frustration thing here is that just a few weeks ago, Donald Trump agreed to a bill that the Senate passed   every single Republican voted for it   that funds the government and then we can go debate a wall or a barrier, a fence in the regular order. Then what changed? Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh started attacking him, and the guy just folded like a cheap suit. I-i-it s just embarrassing. There s something about this guy: Hillary Clinton, Ann Coulter, Nancy Pelosi. He just folds when women take him on.RUSH: (chuckles) When did he fold to Hillary Clinton? Can somebody explain to me when that happened? When did Donald Trump fold to Hillary Clinton? By the way, Trump s holding steady 45%. Harvard-Harris poll, 45%. I don t know what Wolf Blitzed is talking about 37%. Probably one of their doctored CNN polls. When did Trump ever fold to Pelosi? When did Trump ever fold to Clinton? Anyway, they continue this myth that Trump was all ready to sign this until I went bonkers on the radio.It s the exact opposite. He wasn t gonna sign it. He wasn t in the process of signing it. There were news stories to the effect that he was, and I was reacting to them, and that s when I got the message,  Don t worry. The president s not signing this thing,  and the media s off and running with the counter-story. Here s Senator Sherrod Brown last night on a comedy show on NBC. Seth Meyers:  You can t give in to the president on what he s asking for because he ll continue to do it if you cave and give him money for this,  meaning for the wall.BROWN: We passed a bill unanimously in the Senate to keep the government open. After the sort of Rush Limbaugh types came out against it, the president changed his mind off promising to sign it, and the government closed fundamentally. And this is probably a 25 to 30 billion project to build the wall. We vote five billion, now the president six months from now will shut the government down again to get the next five billion.RUSH: (laughing) You see how they re moving the goalposts and changing the essence of the story. One more. Joe Lockhart. This was CNN this morning with Alisyn Camerota.  What do you hear, Joe ?  He s a former Clinton spokesman. I think Clinton. Obama? Hell, I can t remember. I know he was a spokesman for the NFL, and he left the NFL once the kneeling and the protests ended up and he rented a house to Obama in the Kalorama section of Washington. But I can t remember who he worked for. It doesn t matter. Alisyn Camerota said,  What do you here in the fact that the president is the person who conceded this point? LOCKHART: I think it was just a concession to reality. I think they re looking very closely at the numbers. Uhh, and when the president falls below 39, 38% in job approval, which he has now, that means his base is starting to leave. Uh, so I think it was a tactical retreat.RUSH: Oh, so the reason Trump caved on the State of the Union is because you are abandoning him out there. That s right. You want Trump to get this government back up and running. You think Trump s been making a big blunder here, big mistake. So you are leaving. You are abandoning Trump and Trump s finally seen the evidence of that, and so he had no choice but than to relent on the State of the Union otherwise he would lose you. That s the media story. That s what they re sticking to.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/17/whats-the-penalty-for-rigging-the-news-these-days/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 17, 2019RUSH: All right. Let me see if I understand this right. Rudy Giuliani said (paraphrasing),  Wait a minute. I never said there wasn t any collusion with the Russians. I said there wasn t any collusion by Trump with the Russians. I never said there wasn t any campaign collusion with the Russians.  So what s going on here? Man, oh, man, I tell you.Greetings, my friends. Welcome. Great to have you. Rush Limbaugh, here behind the Golden EIB Microphone once again for three busy broadcast hours of excellence. 800-282-2882 if you want to be on the program, and the email address, ElRushbo@eibnet.us.The lead headline at the Drudge Report. Have you seen it, Dawn? So you don t know about this. Okay, wait  til you hear this.  Did Trump Bribe the Drudge Poll?  This is a Wall Street Journal story that says the rat, Michael Cohen, was rigging a bunch of online polls for Trump, in Trump s favor of, at the request of Trump and was paying an IT specialist from Liberty University to do it. And it was online polls even before Trump had started his campaign even in 2015 and some online polls during the campaign.The story makes it clear that Trump s obsessed with popularity, was obsessed with online polls, not the so-called scientific polls, the Pew Center, the Gallup and all. These are online polls. You go to a website and you take a poll. And the story is that Cohen was rigging these, finding a way to rig these polls in favor of Trump and was paying people bags of cash.And Cohen s out there admitting it now, says he did it. He did it. He did it because Trump asked him to do it, and he s begging forgiveness. He s asking for everybody to not think so poorly of him. He regrets ever working for such a reprobate as Donald Trump. And the Drive-Bys are all over this, although not in ways that you would think predictable. They re actually analyzing this rather than just chalking it up to more of what they think Trump is.Now, I want to try to put some of this in perspective just sharing with you my initial reaction to this. Here s the headline to the story. This is the Wall Street Journal. This is the main story and then there are a bunch of people, like some clown at the Washington Post, other people have written their own stories based on this.The headline:  Cohen Hired IT Firm to Rig Early CNBC, Drudge Polls to Favor Trump   Behind the scenes, Michael Cohen hired RedFinch Solutions, then allegedly stiffed it   and his boss.  Apparently, he owed 50 grand and put in a Walmart bag $18,000 and a boxing glove from some boxing champion in Brazil that was said to be worth $38,000. Of course, the guy receiving the boxing glove didn t think it was worth $38,000 and demanded more money. Supposedly, Trump knew all about this, and Cohen was only doing it because Trump wanted to do it.And some of these polls that were rigged, Trump did not win  em. He was not leading these polls. Some of the polls that he did win, he didn t tout them as he normally does. So I got to thinking. I think that this is entertaining and eye-opening in its own way. What is the penalty for rigging Google searches? There s a news story out just today that Google is actually using human beings, not algorithms, but human beings to taint Google searches and to send people to obviously pro-liberal, pro-Democrat sites whenever they can for any search term. What s the penalty for doing that?Google had an office, for Eric Schmidt, who was at the time the Google CEO, nearly had an office in the West Wing. That s how often he was there to visit Obama. And Google was the IT specialist   information technology, computer people   experts for Obama. What s the penalty for that? What s the penalty for Obama sidling up to Google and having Google use their entire infrastructure to help you win polls, to help you win public approval for whatever crazy legislation you have? What s the penalty for that?Nobody has denied that any of this happened, and there wasn t any outrage when we learned about it. I mean, not from the people today who are outraged at Trump and Cohen for rigging some online polls. See, the theory is that if Trump had not gone to the trouble to rig these online polls, he d have never gotten the Republican nomination because he would have never shown as this popular. In other words, he was never this popular. It was just that they rigged the online polls, Trump was made to look like he was steamrolling the Republican field, and that brought people on board because everybody wants to be with a winner.That s where they re gonna be taking this, that there s nothing legitimate about Trump s win because, remember, that s what every objective of the mainstream media, Democrat Party has been since Election Day 2016. Trump s illegitimate. Didn t really win, stole, cheated, worked with the Russians, what have you. Now the online poll controversy that Trump and Cohen rigged a bunch of  em to create the illusion that Trump was popular when he really wasn t.What is the penalty for rigging news stories with false information? How many of those have we had to deal with here just in the past two years or if you want to go back further and include even the two years of the presidential campaign, how much BS in the news did we have to put up with? What kind of penalty is there for rigging news stories?I would submit to you that the entire Drive-By Media has been rigged intensely since the election of 2016 and the entire Drive-By Media has been rigged with stories replete with allegations that Trump colluded with Russia, even though there has never been any evidence and even though every one of these news stories said at some point way down deep in the story via one line,  As of now, no evidence of these allegations has surfaced. No evidence of these allegations has been found, but nevertheless, anonymous sources and experts say it s very bad out there. Well, what s the penalty for that? What s the penalty for rigging a CNN debate? How about Donna Brazile sending questions to Hillary Clinton in advance of a town hall and a debate and being forced to leave the Democrat National Committee when this information surfaced? What s the penalty for that?What is the penalty for creating a phony intelligence document that is really nothing more than political opposition research and then going and getting a legitimate FISA court warrant to spy on a presidential candidate and campaign? What is the penalty for that?What was the penalty for Dan Rather making up a bunch of garbage about George W. Bush and the Texas Air National Guard? Well, in that case Rather got canned after an in-depth investigation by CBS News. But that didn t last long because Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings circled the wagons, gathered the troops, and created a brand-new journalism award that they gave to Rather at some big dinner because they couldn t allow the hit to journalism and liberalism in general based on what Rather did.What is the penalty for rigging Facebook news feeds? My point is, who knows what s real out there anymore and what isn t no matter what you turn on? No matter what you read? How much of it s really real? I have contended for the longest time that there isn t any news anymore. That what there is essentially is the advancement of the leftist Democrat agenda that s presented under the guise of news. And it is the presentation of that agenda, the furthering of that agenda that then permits the daily never-ending attacks on Donald Trump.And I could go on with this question,  what s the penalty for?  Facebook, Google rigging news stories, helping Hillary Clinton with CNN debate prep. It s actually kind of comical when you read the story. I mean, if you have the ability to put it in context, you see this Cohen guy running around with bags of cash and boxing gloves paying off some IT specialist at Liberty University to somehow rig online polls. One of them supposedly an online poll at CNBC. CNBC canceled it because speculation in the story is that they recognized that something was not right about it.How would you rig an online poll? It wouldn t be hard, would it? I know IT guys that can tell me   I don t want to give up any secrets here. Just trust me that this can be done. No, I don t even take online polls  cause I don t think there s anything scientific about  em anyway. I think they re nothing but click bait. But that s not my point. There are people that can run around and find servers and computers and make them look like tens of thousands of people. What do you think the Stop Rush movement was? The Stop Rush movement was 10 people on Twitter who were able to send out emails in the tens of thousands and made them look like they were from individuals.You want to talk about rigging, how about all of the bogus supposed advertiser boycotts on conservative media? None of that s real. None of the outrage is real. I mean, the outrage among the public, you know, something controversial will happen on Fox News, and the next day advertisers are being swarmed and they announce they re canceling their buys. None of it s real. Those advertisers are not hearing from actual legitimate customers. They re hearing from algorithm created emails and texts and in some cases phone calls ginned up by people like Media Matters and people that work for them and others on the left.So when you start breaking this down, what is real? Isn t that the point? Isn t that what we re fighting against every day here? Trying to ferret out the BS and slog our way through it each and every day, and trying to do our best here to at least help people understand what s true and what isn t and the stuff that isn t true, how it s done, how it happens, how do the lies happen, how do they get in?The Steele dossier and the FBI, DOJ investigation into Trump is just a sitting duck in terms of the instruction opportunity it offers, the teachable moment that it is about the corruption of so-called intelligence communities, corruption of law enforcement, the corruption, by virtue of politicization, of everything.I mean, isn t one of the reasons that people have so much trouble is they don t trust anything anymore? They don t trust government institutions there, don t trust the media over there, don t even trust some corporate entities. It s a plague. And it s legitimate. I mean, there are legitimate reasons for some people not to trust these institutions that for the longest time had moral authority. And the primary reason for that is that so many of these institutions have literally been taken over and corrupted by liberals. And, by definition, liberals corrupt as they politicize things.So we ll see what this ends up being. It s gonna be used to add to the pressure column on Trump to cave on the wall, to cave on the government shutdown, about which we are very prepped and ready to go.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: At the beginning of the program I had some fun with a headline story at Drudge, a Wall Street Journal story that Michael Cohen, the rat, Trump s former lawyer, slash, fixer, hired an IT firm run by a guy that works at Liberty University to rig early polls on CNBC and Drudge to favor Trump, even polls before Trump came down the escalator and announced his candidacy.The story is all about how Cohen paid off people who would go out there and start rigging these online polls to make it look like Trump was winning and was massively popular and overtaking everybody, inexplicably so, which led me to ask a series of questions.What is the penalty for Google rigging search results to promote left-wing corruption and perversion, what is the penalty for Google rigging Google searches that penalize, besmirch, and impugn conservatives and Republicans? What s the penalty for rigging news stories with false information? What s the penalty for rigging a CNN debate? This is Donna Brazile, and who knows how many times this happened, funneling questions from a town hall and a debate to Hillary Clinton in advance.What is the penalty for rigging an entire network against a sitting president, as in CNN against Trump? What s the penalty for Facebook rigging its news feed to do just what Google is doing to promote the left and to tarnish the right under the guise of not doing any of these things?My point is that you d have to look long and hard where people on the left are not rigging things. In fact, folks, I m gonna tell you something. I honestly believe that   let me construct a scenario. You wake up one day, and there s some news story out there about something that s just perverted in our culture that is being made to look like it s normal and everybody supports it and everybody agrees with it, and you feel like,  My God. They re overrunning my minority. I m a minority and I believe in the rules, I believe in God.  I believe all that crap is rigged. I believe the Democrats and the media rig all kinds of things to make it look like a minority of screwballs in this country has become the majority.I think a classic example of it is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I think another classic example of it is that Camera Hogg kid from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school down in Ft. Lauderdale. They made this kid look like he had captured the hearts of the entire freaking country. I just don t believe it happened. I think that s the result of rigging. Well! It turns out   and I don t mean to be yelling, but when I get passionate about this stuff I actually get agitated, so I have to work real hard at dialing it back.This is a Breitbart story, and the headline:  Google Manipulated YouTube Search Results for Abortion, Maxine Waters, David Hogg.  Camera Hogg, the kid from the school that had the shooting. Now, essentially when Google manipulates the search results it s made to look like   so this little kid Camera Hogg comes out, makes some statement after the school shooting about gun control and it s made to look like the whole country is fascinated with the kid! Like the whole country can t get enough of the kid.When Maxine Waters was running around, Auntie Maxine doing her personal appearances in front of half dead people. YouTube is portraying all the videos of Maxine s speeches as though the country has been captivated and Maxine Waters has all of a sudden vaulted to the number one sought personality in the subject of impeaching Donald Trump. The same thing for abortion. In sworn testimony, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told Congress last month that his company does not  manually intervene  on any particular search result.  I m sorry, Sundar, I don t believe this. I don t believe it for a moment. Apple has this thing called Apple News. Humans curate it. It s not put together by algorithm. They hired a bunch of journalists and editors, and Apple News, which is part of every iPhone and iPad, it s there by default, it s there free of charge, if you want Apple news all you gotta do is tap on the icon.It s nothing but a bunch of full-fledged left-wing liberal agenda moving advocates shaping the news, determining what s popular and what isn t, and you ll have to look long and hard to find a conservative news source that looks like anybody s reading it. And that s done by human beings, and they re bragging about that. They re using it as a sales point that human beings are curating it, not algorithms.Google says no, we re not using human beings. Our search results are genuine based on actual public interest. Sorry. Not buying it. Not when Google pretty much had an office in the Obama West Wing. Anyway, the Google CEO, Sundar Pichai,  told Congress last month that his company does not  manually intervene  on any particular search result. Yet an internal discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News reveals Google regularly intervenes in search results on its YouTube video platform ñ including a recent intervention that pushed pro-life videos out of the top ten search results for  abortion.  In other words, search abortion on YouTube, and the top 10 videos would have been pro-life. Google didn t like that, so they moved  em out of there. I don t have any doubt that that happens. Because there isn t anybody on the left who s not political! That s, by definition! By definition liberalism is entirely political. And it s political in the sense of forcing what they believe on everybody.It s not just a point of view in the public arena being debated where they re trying to persuade people. That s the last thing they re trying to do. They re trying to force it down everybody s throat. They re forcing everybody to believe it. And in achieving that objective, they re denying the presence of any opposing view. It s exactly what liberalism is. There s nothing democratic about liberalism.Furthermore, on YouTube, owned by Google,  the term  abortion  was added to a  blacklist  file for  controversial YouTube queries,  which contains a list of search terms that the company considers sensitive. According to the leak, these include some of these search terms related to: abortion, abortions, the Irish abortion referendum, Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and anti-gun activist David Hogg. The existence of the blacklist was revealed in an internal Google discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News by a source inside the company who wishes to remain anonymous. A partial list of blacklisted terms was also leaked to Breitbart by another Google source. There are conservatives at Google, and they re scared to death to speak up. One of them did. One of them wrote a   what would you call it? An essay on the unfairness extended to conservative employees at Google and the intimidation against them and the pressure to stay silent if you re conservative. And the guy got canned. Guy got fired. And Google then ran around saying,  None of what he wrote is true! We don t tolerate this kind of insolence!  So the guy s gone. I forget his name off the top of my head, but he became a cause celebre at the time. In the leaked discussion thread, a Google site reliability engineer hinted at the existence of more search blacklists, according to the source.  Folks, I have no doubt, I have no doubt that this is true because I know liberals like the back of my hand. I know liberals like every square inch of my glorious naked body. And I m telling you they don t trust public opinion to genuine public opinion. They maneuver, they influence and they doctor it at every opportunity they get. The idea that Google is some disinterested collection of search results and that whatever is being searched for the most is what you see at the top of the list is a crock.So here we have Cohen out there, he s talking about how he s out there rigging a bunch of online polls for Trump. Didn t all the presidential polls have Hillary Clinton winning in a landslide? Isn t that my memory? My memory is that every poll had her winning in a landslide. One of the reasons they all had a conniption fit is they all believed those polls. Now, these are online polls they re talking about in the story about the rat. Like a Drudge poll is an online poll. Drudge will pose a question, yes or no, Trump, Hillary, whatever, you vote on it however many times you want.Online polls are not scientific in the sense that the serious pollsters would have you believe theirs are. So you have to head this stuff off at the pass every time it rears its head. It s no accident that this   James Damore was the engineer who was fired after writing his little manifesto at Google. He was writing about the bias at Google, and he got canned.A great example is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. We re all sitting here thinking that she has become the biggest thing in the Democrat Party. Not with members of Congress. The average, ordinary American Democrat voter, that she s the Twitter king. And in fact there s a story that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is running Twitter education seminars for other House Democrats to show them how to use it because she is being touted as the queen of Twitter. Nobody s ever been better at using Twitter than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.And how much of that is hype? How much of that is us just being told this woman has captivated the leftist portions of this country? I don t deny that she gets a lot of face time, but the idea that she has become the face of the Democrat Party, I think there s so much of this hype. I think there s so much illegitimacy of serious disinsincerity by the Democrat Party on the leftist side that I think you have to be suspicious and wary of it.That s why, by the way, one of their tactics, the Drive-Bys especially, one of their tactics when they get on some subject that they re supposedly doing news stories about, there is an aura around the coverage that makes it look like anybody with a common-sense brain believes this. My best example, the one that first comes to my mind is the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Pence was the governor. He signs it. The media was outraged because what the Religious Freedom Restoration Act did was basically say that Christians can t be punished for doing things because of their religious beliefs.They had been refusing to bake cakes for gay weddings and receptions or refusing to be photographers. Of course, that s a setup, too, because the gays getting married could have found somebody to bake their cake that was willing to do it. But they hunt these things, these Christian-owned places purposely to call  em out and sue  em.So the media runs to Indiana, starts covering this stuff as though everybody in America is outraged at Indiana and outraged at Christians. And that s just the aura with which this stuff is covered. Same thing with Camera Hogg, same thing with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. What they make it look like is that what you think and the people you believe in are such a tiny minority that you don t even matter anymore.They try to make you think that you ve already lost. You re being overrun. You ve lost your country. You ve lost your culture. Don t even think about it. Just give up. That s the objective.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/31/trump-responds-to-intel-chiefs-pelosi/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 31, 2019RUSH: Okay. We re gonna move on to presidential politics here for a second. We ve pretty much devoted most of the program (first hour intensely) to the subject of what used to be called abortion in America. But let s start here with audio sound bite No. 1. Nancy Pelosi. This morning at her weekly press briefing, a reporter said (impression),  You said the committee should be left to a consensus of its own devices. Are you committed to allowing a floor vote, whatever conference agreement that they have? Even if it includes border wall money? Now, I want to set this up. You know, Trump reopens the government and gives everybody three weeks to start negotiating  cause that s what the Democrats said. The Democrats said,  Open the government, Mr. Trump, and we can talk! Open the government and we can talk.  Nobody in their right mind thought the Democrats were gonna start negotiating, and they re not, and Trump knew this as well. So it s been a week, pretty much. Last Friday the shutdown ended. It s Day 7 today. So the people are asking Pelosi: So how are you doing in talks? Are you talking about a wall? Is there going to be a wall?PELOSI: There s not gonna be any wall money in the legislation. However, if they have some suggestions about certain localities, technology, some infrastructure   as I said   about the ports of entry. We might need more ports of entry. That s part of the negotiation. It is not a negotiation for the president to say  What did he say today?  It doesn t matter what Congress does.  (unintelligible) I knew that he wanted it all to himself. I mean, oh, really? (snickering) The president who wants to have Congress be completely irrelevant in how we meet the needs of the American people? Noooo. Come on.RUSH: I don t know. More and more, I don t know what this woman is talking about. But it s safe to say that she s admitting there s never gonna be any money for a wall in anything she has anything to do with. And this is not a mystery. It s who she is. There won t be any money for a wall no matter what. So the pressure is being brought to bear on Trump. He has responded to this, and also   we didn t get to it yesterday, but   there was a hearing up on Capitol Hill with a bunch of intelligence chiefs, and they re out saying a bunch of various things about things, and Trump basically said,  They re naive. They don t know what they re talking about,  which just caused Washington to have a conniption. And it has caused Chuck Schumer to say that it s time for the intel leaders to  stage an intervention  with Trump. Last night, Schumer sent a letter to the  intelligence chiefs to  stage an intervention  with President Trump just hours after the president called them  naive  in a tweet.   Schumer asked that [Dan] Coats   along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Christopher [ Smirkful ] Wray   set up a meeting with Trump to give him a reality check.  You cannot allow the president s ill-advised and unwarranted comments today to stand,  Schumer wrote.  What do you call this? I mean, here you have the Senate minority leader getting hold of intelligence chiefs (which are in the executive branch) and telling them they need to go do an  intervention  with Trump! Now, the kicker is, Trump was absolutely right to call them naive about Iran.These people have been telling us for years that Iran was not building a nuke! Look . (sigh) The  intelligence community,  quote-unquote, has had a lot of misses. They totally blew, apparently, weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. They totally blew the Iranian quest for a nuclear military device, a missile and other means of delivery for that nuclear weapon. They ve been telling everybody that the Iranians are not engaged in such a plan, and that even if they did turn the switch to start trying to create one, it would be years and years and years.I mean, Dan Coats earlier had told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the intelligence community found that Iran is not seeking to develop a nuclear weapon. Trump pointed out in his Wednesday morning tweet that Iran is testing rockets and more   and he added, correctly,  Perhaps intelligence ought to go back to school. The intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong.  Well, that just, once again, blew up the swamp.So then Pelosi s press conference comes.  Is there gonna be anything on the wall or any of that?  She says,  No, of course not.  So let s jump forward to Trump sound bites this afternoon. Actually, this was around middle of the day. Trump is meeting with reporters in Washington and a reporter said,  Do you still have confidence in Gina Haspel,  CIA,  and Dan Coats to give you good advice? I mean, if you re tweeting that they re being naive, do you have confidence in them? THE PRESIDENT: I disagree with certain things that they said. I think I m right. But time will prove me right, probably. I think Iran is a threat. I think it s a very big threat. I disagree very much on that. I also think   and you ll be seeing something next week,  cause you look at what s happened in Syria with respect to ISIS and the caliphate. We took over a lot of area in the last two weeks. We ve done tremendous in the last couple of weeks. I think we re doing so well on a foreign policy basis. You look at North Korea. Many of you are gonna be traveling with us to North Korea. We made tremendous progress with North Korea.   I have great respect for a lot of people, but I don t always agree with everybody.RUSH: Look  (sigh) There s no great mystery what s going on here. Intelligence chiefs, intelligence agencies, intelligence experts. Who are the people who have been the lying sources for all of this Trump-Russia collusion crap for the last 2-1/2 years? These very people! I mean, maybe not these express, same people, but their agencies. To the point that their objective is to nullify and render incompetent and irrelevant Donald Trump. So they re called up there to testify, and they re swamp dwellers to the T, just like the people querying them on Capitol Hill are swamp dwellers to the T.Of course, they re all unified that Trump poses an existential threat to life as they ve known it in Washington.  Trump is a boob! He s an incompetent!  It s not unusual that they would hang tough. It s very Trump-like that he s not gonna back down from these people, and saying that he s gonna be proved right on all of these threats. But you can argue whether it would make more sense publicly for Trump to endorse them (I mean, they are his intel chiefs, his administration) and then privately do what he has to do dealing with them behind the scenes.But Trump chooses to make it public because he doesn t see the need to hide anything of his true thoughts on these people. It s another one of these times we re not used to seeing this kind of thing things. It kind of makes some people nervous; others applaud it. But there s no mystery. There s no doubt here that all of the CIA, DIA, FBI   you name it, all the acronyms of all these different agencies   would just as soon find a way to get rid of Trump as work with him. Now, here s Trump answering questions about Pelosi A reporter said,  Pelosi said this morning there s not gonna be a wall in this deal. She did say she d be open to other kinds of barriers, but not a wall. Would you accept that? THE PRESIDENT: No, because if there s no wall it doesn t work. She s just playing games. So if there s no wall, it doesn t work   and we re building the wall right now. I mean, we re finishing up design on certain areas. The most important area is the Rio Grande area and others. We are building a lot of wall. You know, I m not waiting for this committee, and I ve told a lot of people,  I don t expect much coming out of the committee,  because I keep hearing the words that,  We ll give you what you want but we re not gonna give you a wall.  And the problem is, if they don t give us a wall, it doesn t work. Without a wall, it doesn t work.RUSH: Right. So he knows they lied to him.  End the shut down and we ll start talking.  Nobody fell for that. Don t think that there s some surprise. (chuckles) Well, there might be some surprised Republicans or Never Trumpers somewhere who still take Democrats and liberals at their word.But anybody with half a brain knew that Pelosi and Schumer, none of these people were gonna actually start talking about a wall after they got the government reopened. I mean, the government reopening is their victory, and there s no reason, as far as they re concerned, strategically or politically, to negotiate with Trump on a wall. They re not gonna permit it. If legislation s involved, there will never be a wall, even though that s the way Trump wants it. Now, Trump said he d like to see what would happen if he removed the wall that is in Tijuana.THE PRESIDENT: By the way, if you go to Tijuana and you take down that wall, you will have so many people coming into our country that Nancy Pelosi will be begging for a wall. She ll be begging for a wall. She will say,  Mr. President, please, please give us a wall.  It would be very interesting. Some people have suggested, let me take the wall along California, let s move it to Arizona, let s move it to Texas.RUSH: His point is that they already have a wall in California. It s at Tijuana, and California s already benefiting from it. So let s move it! Let s see what happens. I guess he s being facetious. I don t ever see a circumstance where Pelosi would beg anybody to build a wall. Do you? Well, okay, around her house, but that wall s already there. I can t imagine Pelosi ever having a problem with open borders and massive numbers of people crossing into the country illegally.I can t imagine Nancy Pelosi, while Donald Trump is president, ever standing for a wall. I know these people have all authorized the building of a wall in the past. They ve all authorized 10 times the amount of money for the wall that Trump has asked. I know all that. I mean, deep down they know that it works. They re just not gonna let Trump have it. One final bite here. Reporter said,  Mr. President, you ve said the wall is basically being held hostage for political reasons by Democrats. Is there anything you would have done differently? THE PRESIDENT: I think by having the shutdown, we ve set the table for where we are now. If I didn t do the shutdown, people wouldn t know, they wouldn t understand the subject. Now they understand the subject. They realize what a humanitarian crisis it is. It s called, like in deal-making, setting the table or, you know, setting the stage. We ve set the stage for what s gonna happen on the 15th of February. I don t think they re gonna make a deal. I see what s happening. They re all saying,  Oh, let s do this, but we re not giving one dime for the wall.  That s okay. But if they re not gonna give money for the wall it s not gonna work and if it s not gonna work then the politicians are really wasting a lot of time.RUSH: They are. And he told Republicans that you re wasting time negotiating with these Democrats if you think they re gonna get a wall. And the Republicans are tweeting   it s kind of amazing. Some Republicans are tweeting out,  Well, we ve been trying to talk to  em for a week but they still won t come to ñ  Really? You re surprised at this? And, by the way, the idea that we can flood the news with the fact that the Democrats are not negotiating in good faith and somehow create negative attitudes about the Democrats, that isn t gonna work, either!That s not the dynamic here.  But, Rush, but, Rush, the majority of the American people are for a wall and they must know, they ve gotta be told the Democrats are against it.  They already know this. But tweeting out or trying to explain how the Democrats are not even negotiating in good faith, that s not gonna create a single vote against the Democrats. But by the same token it s no different than when Ocasio-Cortez or any of these other loco weeds come along and promise free everything and we say  how you gonna pay for that? We don t have the money.  That does not dissuade people from supporting it, a point that I ve been trying to make intently for the past couple of weeks.So the idea the Democrats aren t negotiating, yeah. I maintain to you that when the president offered a deal, 300,000 DACA, 200,000 TPS, whatever it is, we ll give you Democrats a lot of what you want for $5.7 billion for the wall. He knew they were gonna reject it. He knew it. The bill was proposed to be rejected, I m convinced. I think the president also knew last Friday when he gave them 15 days to negotiate or else he was gonna do a national emergency. He knew that they re not gonna sit down and talk, and he knew that there s no way that Pelosi s gonna ever authorize any House legislation money for a wall while he s president.So there s something else that is in the pipeline, whether it s a national emergency declaration or whatever. But the president, he s not naive. He s not part of the crowd that thinks the Republicans were gonna be negotiated with by the Democrats and now the Democrats aren t. He s not. Nobody expected. Opening the government is their victory. Why water anything down beyond that? That s not who they are.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Half my brain tied behind my back just to make it fair. By the way, I got my show prep all out of whack here. Here it is. There s a new poll out. This is Breitbart s story. The poll is from some outfit called Ear to the Ground. You ready for this? 2700 Trump voters, poll claims that Trump will lose 43% of his base of support if a border wall is not built. Now, this polling outfit, Ear to the Ground Polling is a new company as of 2017, and they are led by the Sorock Research Group. Its head is a woman named Anne Sorock. She s written pieces for the Daily Signal.The poll claims that only 43% of Trump voters consider the conclusion of the partial government shutdown a victory for Trump even though 60% approved of ending it. The poll claims that Trump supporters support Trump building the border wall by declaring a national emergency by 95%. That s a humongous number for a poll to produce. Ninety-five percent? Ninety-five percent of Trump supporters support declaring a national emergency.Anyway, the article goes on to point out that this poll shows why the Democrats and the media are adamantly opposed to funding the wall. And it makes perfect sense politically. From the beginning of the Trump presidency, even during the transition, the objective has been to separate Trump s base voters from him. The Russia collusion story, the never-ending stories of Trump-Russia collusion have all been oriented toward causing Trump supporters to doubt their decision to vote for him. And what this poll is showing is that 43% of Trump s voters will abandon him if there is no wall.Now, if you re Nancy Pelosi or Chuck You Schumer and you re looking at this and you believe the poll, what are you gonna do? You re gonna make sure that there s never any wall built with any of your assistance or any federal money whatsoever. Now, I don t think Pelosi and the Democrats even need this poll to buttress their position. They aren t gonna give the wall simply  cause they re not gonna have Trump win anything, especially in the two years now leading up to the presidential election. There s simply no way.So however this is gonna get done, it is not gonna happen bipartisanly, it s not gonna happen with cooperation, it s not gonna happen with the parties proving they can work together for the benefit of the American people. None of that. It s going to have to happen some other way.TheHill.com, get this.  Democrats Give Themselves From Wiggle Room In Border Talks.  Now, this is an article on the negotiations that just began over the funding of the Department of Homeland Security. As usual, this headline is completely misleading because the quotes in this story from Democrat leaders all show that they are completely opposed to any funding for a wall. But the Drive-Bys know full well that the headline is what 95% of people see when they read the news and so the people,  Oh, the Democrats, they re participating, some wiggle room, maybe the Democrats are ñ  And then when there s no wall built it won t be because the Democrats weren t helpful. I mean, it s journalistic malpractice yet again over and over and over.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/21/the-truth-about-the-maga-hat-kids-and-the-native-american-vet/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 21, 2019RUSH: I have a story here from the archives of the Fox News affiliate in Detroit, Fox News, Eyeball News 5. The headline:  Native American Claims Racial Harassment by EMU Students Dressed as Indians.  Now, who do you think this story s about? This story is about our old buddy, the war drummer, Nathan Phillips. Essentially what the story says  I love paraphrasing these things rather than read the whole thing to you. Nine years ago, this same  Indian activist,  quote-unquote, Nathan Phillips claimed he was just walked along the street one day minding his own business I don t know if he s beating the drum or not. He s walking along the street and he saw a fraternity house throwing an Indian party. How often does that happen to you? You re walking down the street and there s a fraternity right there throwing an Indian party? Why, it happens all the time. How many of you in college will be walking down the street and there s an Indian party at the nearby frat house? Well, that s what happened here.He was walking along the street, saw a frat house throwing an Indian party, and rather than just walk on, he approached them, and he demanded that they explain themselves. Nathan Phillips claimed they called him racial epithets like  Indian.  He claimed that the frat boys hit him. He says he called the cops, but by the time the cops arrived all the frat guys had disappeared and there was no evidence of an Indian party.Yeah, like there had never been a party, which makes me wonder if it all wasn t in Mr. Phillips  imagination.By the way, the article mentions that the mascot for Eastern Michigan University   which is where the frat house is, Eastern Michigan University   used to be the Huron Indian. But they got rid of it some 20 years ago, and Phillips says he s still fighting that battle even though they got rid of the mascot. Nathan Phillips says there was  a lot of hate behind  EMU, Eastern Michigan University, picking an Indian as a mascot. Why would a school choose a mascot of something they hate? This is something I ve never understood about all these people claiming that these mascots are inherently racist or bigoted.Why are they choosing names of things they hate? They re not. It s quite the opposite. At any rate, the guy is not as he is portrayed in the media. Like all left-wing mobsters are portrayed   by  mobster,  I mean rent-a-mob protesters. None of them are innocent and just happen to be walking by, minding their own business while white Christians do something to tick  em off. It s not it at all. But that s how they re always portrayed, be they Indian protesters or African-American protesters or women s protestors.And, by the way, there was a women s march over the weekend, too, and you talk about a bomb? Madonna didn t show up and talk about blowing up the White House again. And what s her name, Ashley Judd, didn t show up and say (shouting),  I am an angry woman!  She didn t do any of that. Nobody showed up. It was a gigantic bomb actually, the Women s March. It doesn t matter. The media will report all those things as though they were massively attended ñand reflected, by the way, the majority thinking of the United States.I was finally  Kyle Smith in the New York Post had a good one yesterday. You know, one of my big bugaboos has always been how the media gets on some story involving the fringe left and something they re ticked off about and they then cover that event or story as though all of America is as outraged as the fringe element doing the protesting is. Kyle Smith wrote about this phenomenon yesterday in the New York Post titled something like,  Why We Are All Outraged All the Time. And that is the objective of the media. There are just constant enemies, bad guys. No matter if they re the bad guys or not, and that s why  It s so common and it happens so frequently, that why it s not immediately spotted by people on our side for what it is, is beyond frustrating to me. Because, folks, this is the sum total of the battle. But of course the Never Trumpers on our side don t even think there s a battle! They were gonna vote for Hillary Clinton!That s how little they believe our country is in crisis, all because they wanted to maintain the respect of the Washington establishment and the Washington media.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We go to St. Petersburg, Florida. This is Johnna and it s great to have you. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Thank you so much for taking my call.RUSH: You bet.CALLER: Rush, I just want to tell you. I was so frustrated this morning. I went to church this morning, and my priest at the beginning of his hominy, he started chastising these Covington students, right? So I was, like, trying to keep my patience, and I listened to him give misinformed information about what happened. So I had to call him on the carpet. I asked him. I said,  Where did you get your news source from?  He said,  Some U.K. news story.  So I said,  If you would do me a favor, go to the YouTube video and look at the whole video, and then I m gonna ask you about it tomorrow, and I want to know exactly what you think.  So I m gonna follow up with him, but I wanted to let him know that he was misinformed about that video.RUSH: Wait a minute. Is this a Catholic priest?CALLER: Yes.RUSH: Catholic priest. Does he know what YouTube is?CALLER: Yes, he does. He does.RUSH: He knows how to navigate. He knows how to find what you want him to see on YouTube.CALLER: I said,  Are you familiar with the internet?  He said,  Yes.  I said,  Well, do you know about YouTube?  He said,  Yes.  I said,  Go there and look at the whole video, and then this I would like to discuss it with you tomorrow, because what I witnessed is that Nathan Phillips guy, that activist? He was the aggressor. Those young men were there for a pro-life movement, and we should not be chastising them. We should be defending them. RUSH: Hey, look, it wasn t  Let me tell you something, Johnna. It s not just your priest. Are you ready for this? The kids  own school condemned  em! Without a moment of investigation, without a moment of looking into it   in a pure, knee-jerk reaction   their own school threw them overboard and then under the bus. Their own school!That s how afraid (snort!) their own school is. That s how afraid all of so many people on the right seem to be of the mainstream media and of the left and the Democrat Party. This hurry, this rush to be seen as condemning rather than take a moment and maybe realize the kids at your own school didn t do what s being reported. I don t know. This stuff  I pull my hair out over all this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: It occurs to me that it might be helpful to run through what exactly happened here   kind of like with a timeline   regarding the Covington school kids in Washington. This is Covington, Kentucky, by the way. Partial video footage   the initial footage that the Drive-Bys showed and from which still shots were culled   showed the students from a Catholic high school allegedly harassing an old, feeble, scrawny, Native-American veteran after the anti-abortion March for Life rally in Washington over the weekend quickly went viral.The video was viral. This caused widespread condemnation of the kids and then a whole lot of media people piled on, and then the cesspool of Twitter called for them to be  doxed,  which means their names, addresses, as much personal information about them as possible be made public. Then they demanded that they be shamed and punished. School administrators at the kids  school said they would consider kicking them out of school!This crap has gone on for way too long, and it always happens one way! It s always targeted at Republicans and conservatives! And the people   adults   who are supposed to be protective, pile on without even taking a moment to figure out what actually happened. It s one thing for an uninformed priest in St. Petersburg, Florida, to pile on. But for these kids  own school district to threaten to expel them just to satisfy the mob, just to satisfy Twitter, just to satisfy the media and social media?So it was really just the seconds that everybody has seen. The kid is sitting there and he s smiling as the scrawny, aging and elderly Indian Vietnam War vet is pounding on his war drum   and there were stories about how the kid was smirking and was a smart ass and was taunting. His real crime was that he was white, and his second real crime was that he was wearing a  Make America Great Again  red cap. Well, it turns out that there was hours of video, not just the 30 seconds or so that was originally seen.There s two hours of additional video that shows conclusively what happened before and after the encounter with the frail but valiant Indian protester. Far from engaging in racially motivated harassment, this group of kids from Covington remained calm and restrained. They are the ones that didn t do anything! They didn t even hurl any insults! They did not react! They behaved as well-mannered teenagers should. They re the ones that had class in this whole thing.And, as such, I would think the Never Trumpers would be their biggest champions! Why do the Never Trumpers hate Trump? Because he s got no manners, because he s gauche, because he s impolitic, he s impolite, he s a boor! Well, these kids were models of composure. They were models of restraint. They were polite. They were respectful. They were everything the Never Trumpers say Trump isn t, everything that we need in leadership   and they re being thrown overboard.And they re the ones who deserve the accolades in this whole encounter. They re the ones who were well-mannered! They re the ones we hope become future leaders in this country, not this ragtag bunch of protesters surrounding  em. They were subjected  I don t know how many people know this. These teenagers were subjected to some of the most vile, racist, homophobic verbal abuse that you can imagine. They were called the F-word. (You know, slang for homosexual.) They were called murderers. It was said they are what s wrong with life. You should have been aborted,   cause they were at a pro-life rally. And the people throwing all of these insults around was a group called the Black Hebrew Israelites. The Black Hebrew Israelites. You know, I first encountered these people at Times Square. You may have forgotten this, but in the early days of this program I actually did a television commercial for the New York Times, and it had me arriving in the back of a cab somewhere on 42nd Street reading the Times, and I said something, you know, clever and funny out the window.We showed up to film this thing, and these Black Hebrew Israelites were down there raising hell. They re there every day. It wasn t because I was there for that. They were just there all the time. I remember asking,  Who the hell is that?   Ah, that s just the Black Hebrew Israelites.  Well, I d never heard of  em. But they ve been around since the nineteenth century. They are a cult. They are a cult of black nationalists, and here s what they believe.They believe that they are descendants of the ancient Israelites of Moses. They always condemn white people. They condemn Christians. They HATE homosexuals. There s a big group of  em in Washington. The D.C. organization of the Black Hebrew Israelites are known to spout particularly vile bigotry, and they are just assaulting these kids from Covington with every despicable insult that you can imagine.So in the midst of all this, here comes the frail, aging, wonderful Vietnam veteran Indian leader, Nathan Phillips, banging his war drum   and he s doing some kind of a chant. In the video that I saw, your first reaction is maybe the Indian group is coming over as allies of the kids because the Black Hebrew Israelites are out of control here. I mean, they re shouting  It s vile stuff. So Nathan Phillips and the Indians, they put themselves between the Covington teenagers and the Black Hebrew Israelites chanting and pounding that drum, and then the confusion set in.The teenagers couldn t quite decide whether the Indian was on their side or not. But they then started their own school cheer, and it was a chant. So the Indians were chanting and the kids are doing a school cheer, and the media said,  My God! These kids are now mocking the aging Indian hero. My God! He s over there pounding his drum and he s chanting, and now the kids are making fun of him.  I mean, it was outrageous what these people reported.One student did not get out of way of the aging and frail Indian leader as he marched pounding his drum, and that s the kid that you ve seen smiling. It was being reported,  He stood his ground and he stared down the harmless, lovable, aging Indian leader!  His smile was said to be  creepy, insulting and taunting   as though this white kid knew he was better than the Indian old man.  This is how this garbage was reported!It was that moment where this kid standing there smiling, not saying anything aw Nathan Phillips was pounding the war drum and chanting and getting closer to his face  This teenager was called the product of a hate factory. He was likened to school shooters. Yeah, the Black Hebrew Israelites were shouting,  You re school shooters! You re future school shooters. You re from the Klan! You re members of the Klan!  They were shouting all kinds of vile stuff.The Indian guys come up and join all this, and then Phillips   the aging Vietnam veteran, frail, Indian leader   walked away after a few minutes. And the Black Hebrew Israelites continued to insult the crowd, and nothing else happened. From all that, everybody started dumping on these kids   including their own school, including much of the conservative media world   because they were so intent that the media not think ill of them. (sigh) Now, there is a continuation of this, because what s happening now Since the truth of this has finally been revealed with independent evidence (i.e., two hours of video)  After the Drive-Bys drove around these kids and the Indians to promote yet another fake news hoax following on the BuzzFeed hoax, CNN is now attempting to do PR damage by shifting the subject. This is from Breitbart: Headline:  CNN s Dave Briggs: Catholic Student Doesn t Look  Considerate  of Native American Culture   CNN Early Start co-host Dave Briggs said Monday that Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann does not appear  appreciative  or  considerate  of Native American culture  So even after the truth is known, CNN is still trying to report that the kid in the video is an absolute creep who does not respect Indians, does not respect elders, does not respect Nathan Phillips, does not respect an Indian guy standing in his face pounding a drum at him! (translation)  So even if we got the original story wrong, we can still see that this kid is a racist, bigot, white supremacist.  They gotta do damage control somehow.You know, the modern era of all this began with the Trayvon Martin story, that whole incident, and it s just continued to descend. Some of you might say it started prior to that. But everybody on our side ought to be condemning these people in the media and the school where these kids go. These kids were the model of proper parenting. They behaved impeccably properly. They were respectful. They were not confrontational. Everything they did was designed to lower the temperature of this entire thing.They didn t do one thing provocative, and yet that s what the media s now trying to say.  Oh, that kid might not have done anything, but looks at that face! That s the face of a white supremacist bigot who doesn t respect Indian culture.  (Snort!) People think this way! People who have been poisoned by a combination of exposure to American education and American media, and it is they who harbor all the hate. It s they who harbor all the bad manners. It is they, them, who are incapable of even being concerned with finding the truth.Now, you can say that a lot of this is due to their personal disgust and hatred with Donald Trump, and it s true. But this predates Trump. The fuse for all this stuff was lit long ago. Trump may just be the explosion. These people on the left have been trending this way for I don t know long how long. We ve been laughing at it most of the time thinking nobody s gonna ever fall for this kind of belief or philosophy. But, sadly, we were wrong  cause there s a bunch of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez dingbats running around who ve fallen for it hook, line, and sinker.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I checked email during the break.  Rush, you ve been very critical of conservative media for jumping on these kids. What do you mean? I haven t seen any.  Okay. I m glad you ax d me. Slate.com. Now, Slate.com is not necessarily conservative. In fact, it is never conservative. But I just want to share with you what was said about the teenager that you ve all seen now in the video who s just standing there smiling while the frail and gaunt, valiant Vietnam War vet Indian activist, Nathan Phillips, is pounding on his war drum and chanting right in this kid s face.Slate.com said that the student had  the face of self-satisfaction and certitude, of edginess expressed as cruelty.  The kid was smiling. He was not trying to be provocative. He was trying to tone down the circumstance. He was trying to lower the temperature of things. He was smiling rather than glowering. For this, he s called self-satisfied. He looked too certain of himself. What the hell is a crime in being certain of yourself? What, is confidence now a crime to the left? And it is.One of the primary objections to me, from the get-go, is nobody is that sure of themselves. I m not  I don t often express enough vulnerability or insecurity, folks, so I can t be a real person. It was especially female criticism from the early days.  Nobody is that sure. He just thinks he knows everything.  Well, I do! Anyway, Slate then went on to link this teenager to Donald Trump s criticism of Elizabeth Warren, calling her Pocahontas. Well, she s the one lying to the world about having 1/1024 Indian blood coursing through her ice veins.She s the one claiming to be a person of color until she was exposed. We re not allowed to make fun of liberal frauds? Trump calls her Pocahontas. We call her Fauxcahontas, F-a-u-x-ahontas. For crying out loud. Bill Kristol tweeted that Donald Trump should condemn the school. A writer at National Review declared that the students might as well have spit on the cross. I think that story has now been deleted at National Review.I mean, they re all over the place, examples like this of how the conservative media just cannot wait. The conservative, Washington media just can t wait to pile on to make sure   they have to make damn sure   that nobody s gonna confuse them with Trump, to make sure nobody is gonna mistake the conservative media for these vile kids. Gutless, gutless wonders. People who would just as soon lose gracefully than actually engage in this battle.Now, here, listen to Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie was in Columbia, South Carolina, the annual Martin Luther King Day. This is another thing that irritates me today: All of these people on the left running around co-opting Martin Luther King. They ve got nothing in common with Martin Luther King. The  content of your character  being that which speaks for you? Not to today s left. Today s left is pure identity politics. You are no different, no better than your skin color or your sexual orientation or your gender or which bathroom you want to use.That determines whether or not you are credible as far as the left is concerned. Content of character? If content of character mattered, these kids from Covington would be heroes today! You have all these leftists running around claiming solidarity with Martin Luther King! That poor man has had his legacy hijacked and redirected into something that it never was. I m dead serious about that.What these people have done to the legacy of Martin Luther King, claiming it themselves  We have all these people out there running around trying to convince African-Americans that they should continue to support the Democrats because they respect you and your heroes and so forth   and, meanwhile, their lives never improve. Their lives never substantively improve unless somebody like Donald Trump comes along.Here s Crazy Bernie at the Martin Luther King Day rally in Columbia South Carolina SANDERS: Today we talk about justice and today we talk about racism   and I must tell you, it gives me no pleasure to tell you that we now have a president of the United States who is a racist.RUSH: Damn you, Crazy Bernie, because that is an out-and-out lie. It s a character assassination. It s insulting. There is no modern American president who has done more to lift up African-Americans and Hispanics than Donald J. Trump! In fact, did you see the polling data over the weekend? Trump s approval rating among Hispanics during the government shutdown is up 19 points. His approval rating among Hispanics is up 19 points. Black unemployment, all-time record low! Hispanic unemployment, all-time record low!Not during Bill Clinton.Not during Lyndon Johnson.Not during JFK.Not during Barack Hussein O.No, they didn t even get close to record-low Hispanic or African-American unemployment, but records have now been set under the presidency of Donald J. Trump who (impression),  I have no pleasure in telling you that we have a president of the United States who is a racist.  The racism in this country, I firmly believe, is the exclusive possession and providence of the American left. After all, they openly advocate identity politics!If that s not racism, I don t know what is!You are who you are based on your skin color. You are who you are based on what bathroom you want to use. You are who you are because of your sexual orientation. You are who you are because you wear a vagina hat or not. You are who you are because you support open borders and let the country be flooded with people who are not interested in becoming Americans. Somehow, you claim to hold the moral high ground? Sorry. Not here.All right. Here is, ladies and gentlemen, the president s proposal. (interruption) No, I didn t make that up. The National Review article said what these kids did to that poor Indian guy was the equivalent of spitting on the cross, and it s gone now. It was deleted or erased or what have you. (interruption) No, I don t know who wrote it   and if I did, I wouldn t embarrass whoever it is by mentioning them. But I guarantee you, they re a Never Trumper. I will guaran-damn-tee you they are a Never Trumper.I guarantee you they have written vile, hateful stuff about Donald Trump from the supposed pedestal of moral superiority and preening. Guarantee you! They probably fell for the BuzzFeed story, too, because they wanted it to be true! They want it to be true that Trump lied to Cohen and told Cohen to lie to Congress and so forth. They want this collusion stuff to be true, even though they know it s not!  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/21/a-golden-opportunity-for-republicans/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 21, 2018RUSH: So I checked the email again during the break, and I have to tell you, there s a lot of people asking,  Rush, all right. We know what s going on. What do you think should happen? What do you think is gonna happen? What do you think? We know what s happening out there, Rush! We re paying attention. What do you think?  Okay. All right. If that s what you want.JOHNNY DONOVAN: And now, from sunny south Florida, it s Open Line Friday!RUSH. And we re gonna be getting to your phone calls maybe in this segment. I don t know. I feel bad, I didn t get to any in the first hour. I want to get started on that since this is Open Line Friday, and the number is 800-282-2882. Okay, here s my take on all of this based on where we are right now. Now, some of this I didn t specifically say in the first hour because I assume that so many things are understood, especially among and by you in the audience. And that s actually a mistake.I shouldn t assume that just because you re here and you know me and you have a many, multiple-year history of listening that you can figure out where I am on this even if you don t say it per se, that you can get it. But I need to say it, per se, I guess, more often than I do. Taking things in order, I think it is absolutely fabulous that this bill passed the House. For all of the reasons: That it put Chuck and Nancy back on their heels, that they re out there saying that Trump couldn t get the votes, that the House Nancy doesn t even run the House yet, and she s out there saying Trump couldn t get the votes   and he did, and it was because of Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan and the Freedom Caucus. They did their special order earlier this week and they let the president that know they would have his back. It d be easy for the president to think that he s isolated, but it was I think a very important thing that they did to make it a point to go to the floor of the House and special orders to make sure that everybody knew   not just the president   that they, significant number of Republicans in the House, would have his back.So I think it s great. I don t think there s anything wrong yet. I think it s fabulous they passed this bill. Now the Senate is in a position they don t want to be in. The Senate never wants to be in this position. They are the great deliberative body. But they have to take it up now, and here s what has to happen now. Regardless how this ends, we need to get every senator on the Republican side on record here. They re all talking about how they don t have 60 votes.Fine. If I don t have 60 votes, then go ahead and vote for it. If you re worried about this, I don t care if you re retiring senator, if you re Corker, if you re Flake   and I may be (sigh) wasting my breath here hoping that these guys would do something that would be seen as pro-Trump. But I think on this issue   the border, the wall, border security, saving the American culture. I think every senator that we can get on record we need to get. They need to be flushed out.I think despite how you and I know the Democrats hate Trump, we cannot assume that other people who don t pay as close attention as we do understand this. Remember people that get most of their news from the Drive-By Media, they re watching it and they re absorbing it but they re not seeing perhaps the degree of literal hatred for Trump that we know they have. Now, you might think,  How could they miss it?  Because they re not watching it from the same perspective.These people turn on the news expecting to hear the news   and like it or not, we have to admit that a lot of consumers of news do not question it. I know their reputation is way down. But even if I m wrong on this, I still think that we need every Republican in the Senate voting for this thing to show that it is the Democrats who are opposed to border security. It s the Democrats who are opposed to border security. It s the Democrats who are opposed to border security. It s the Democrats who are opposed to shoring up the border.It s the Democrats who do not want to fix this! It s the Democrats who are saying,  No!  It s the Democrats who are the obstacle. It s the Democrats who are stopping things. It s the Democrats who won t cooperate. It s the Democrats who won t cross the aisle. It s the Democrats who won t compromise. It s the Democrats who are acting like children. It s the Democrats acting like spoiled brats. This is what needs to be illustrated, and with every Republican signing on to this, that objective is furthered.Every senator that opposes this, it s because of the fact that they hate Trump and that that s why they oppose this. That they are willing to damage the country rather than support Trump. That they are willing to put the country in great peril because of refusing to shore up the border! This needs to be demonstrated. This is such a golden opportunity to me. I don t look at these things as chaotic. I don t look at these things as,  Oh, no, it isn t going our way.  This is such a great opportunity, a teachable moment, whatever you want to call it.It s the opportunity to demonstrate to everybody that it is the Democrats who are engaging in political malpractice, that it s the Democrats who will not compromise, that it s the Democrats who are not interested in doing anything if it helps Donald Trump, including something that would really benefit the country. We cannot be harmed by taking action that would cause this to be seen by more and more Americans. But every senator on the Republican side needs to be flushed out and needs to vote for this   and they ve got cover.They can tell themselves it isn t gonna pass because they don t have 60 votes. Some of them are leaving anyway. But there are some Republicans that hate Trump so much that they won t compromise for the good of America, either. That needs to be flushed out! But primarily the opportunity here to demonstrate   not because we say it, but because they show it   that the Democrats hate Donald Trump so much that they will not do what they demand he does: compromise, respect process. They re unwilling to cross the aisle.They are unwilling to engage in this precious process. They are unwilling to spend five billion measly dollars to protect their own country because they hate Donald Trump so much. They would just as soon damage the country as help Trump. That s the message that needs to get out. That s how you sell this. That s how you push this. You continue to push back. Trump is showing the way. He s got  em on their heels. You continue the attack! You blame them. Get rid of this idea that government shutdowns are Republicans  fault.Get rid of this idea that it s we who have to explain things. We don t have to explain anything other than we are trying to save America. We are protecting America. We are attempting to shore up the border! We are attempting to gain and secure border security. It s the Democrats who don t want any part of it! This is the opportunity that we ve got. The Democrats have supported measures with more wall funding than this one! They just never went anywhere. This isn t about the wall, as far as the Democrats are concerned.This is about humiliating Trump and delaying all of this until they get control of the House so that none of this can ever come up and have a legitimate chance the next two years. Because they don t want border security. They do not want illegal immigration flows to stop. This must be demonstrated! Mitch McConnell and whoever it is that s gonna walk to Republican microphones and address the press, has got to say,  It is the Democrats who are unwilling to compromise. It s the Democrats who are willing to help us secure the border. This is gonna require these Republicans to stand firmly, solidly with Trump. He is taking the lead. He s willing to stick his neck out on this. He needs more than Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan saying they will have his back. He needs a bunch of senators who are not retiring and not leaving to join this chorus that they support the president, they support security of the border, they support protecting America s borders and America itself, and that it s the Democrats who don t, that it s the Democrats who are not interested in it.Democrats are so obsessed with Trump hatred that they are unwilling to compromise and even do one thing to help America. It s not a difficult message, because it s actually the truth. It s actually what s happening. But somebody besides the  tyranny of talk radio  needs to say it. They need to say it. They need to say it as the explanation for what they re doing. Why are they voting for this? Because they want to protect the border. They don t have to use the word  wall.  They just have to say,  Protect the border,   border security,  what have you.Enforce that it s $5 billion, that the Democrats have authorized even more for this in previous legislation that never went anywhere  cause it started the focus. There have been other efforts to get this money. It s been denied Trump every time he s tried. This is his last best effort for it. It s not this is the first time he s tried. He s tried this back in 2017, and the same thing happened. Back then all he wanted was $1 billion, and they wouldn t even give that.It is time for everybody in that town that calls themselves a Republican, especially if they re in the Senate, to stride to those microphones right now and start saying,  We re there. We just need some Democrats to help us protect the border. But the Democrats are so obsessed with Donald Trump and attempting to see that he does not succeed at anything, they re willing to put their own nation at risk.  Just keep putting  em on the defensive! There s no need for us to be! We re not doing anything wrong here.We re simply using legislative tactics. We re using The Art of the Deal. We re doing whatever is necessary, the president is, to try to get an objective (that was a campaign promise) accomplished. He cannot do it alone. We ve got 51 or 52 senators, depending on how you count Flake and Corker and some of the others that are retiring or got beat. But the message here is very simple:  We aren t the problem. What we want is not the problem. What we want is not damaging or bad. We want border security! We want, finally, to do something about the never-ending flow of illegal immigration into our country. You hit the cameras and microphones all afternoon if you re a Republican in the Senate, and you put the onus right on Chuck Schumer and the rest of his buddies on the Democrat side who don t want any part of this and are unwilling to even talk about $5 billion   and I ll grant a concession. If there looks like there could be success on this, then maybe somebody proposes a-24-hour, 18-hour, 12-hour continuing resolution while all this is going on, to keep the precious government running to show good faith.But it s just 12 hours. It s just another 12 hours or so. If it looks like there s a possibility for movement here. You do not end it. You do not take the shutdown off the table, but you offer to keep the government open  cause that s what they re so obsessed with. The bottom line is, Donald Trump, President Trump needs the support of his party. He s got you. He s got you who voted for him, and he knows it. He needs the support of elected Republicans in Washington. He needs to be encouraged. He needs to be praised for pushing this issue in the first place at this time.He needs applause. It never hurts anybody. I don t care how big a self-starter anybody is, and I don t care how confident they are. Everybody needs encouragement. Everybody needs to know at times of crisis and chaos that they have people behind them who have their back willing to support them. The House Republicans need to be praised for passing this in the first place and then turning around and encouraging the Senate GOP to vote for it and hang tight.  Cause if this doesn t happen, folks, we re  I don t want to use the word  screwed. But if this doesn t happen, the chances of it down the road with Pelosi taking over the House in a couple of short weeks? The chances reduce. I talked about the encouragement and the need for it in my short little remarks of 35 minutes last night at the Turning Point USA celebrations that arrived. I received an award. I don t care who you are, encouragement never hurts, and a lot of people don t get encouragement who need it  cause everybody thinks they don t need to it.  They re secure, they re powerful, they don t need it! (muttering) They can take care of themselves. It helps.Right now, there s one guy making all this happen, and he needs to be assured that he has support. That s what I think should happen. That s what I think the Republicans in the Senate s objective here has to be. Put all of this on the Democrats and put it all on the Democrats. Everything they think is important. Willing to compromise? They re not willing. Willing to do process? They re not willing. Willing to walk across the aisle, shake hands and show government can work? They re not willing. Protect the border, border security, five billion measly dollars? They aren t willing.Screw the media!Just say it and keep saying it.That s my idea.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The president just had a little press gaggle at the White House to talk about the passage of the criminal justice reform bill. When he started thanking people, he mentioned Ivanka and Mike Pence. When he mentioned Jared Kushner s name, prolonged applause. Jared Kushner was one of the prime movers of that legislation, and do you know why? It was personal for him. His father was convicted and was in jail, and the family thought for way longer than was justified and maybe should not have even had any jail time at all.You can argue that. That s not the point. It was personal for him. This bill has been something that Democrats, Obama and others have been trying to pass for who knows how long, and they just never got anything done on it. But here it did get done with Trump, and 87 votes in the Senate? I mean, the essence of bipartisanship, and they don t want to talk about it. They don t want to talk about it. And normally they would because, in their view, the beneficiaries here are their voters!Because Democrats don t believe in prisons   and I am not exaggerating this, folks. The Democrat Party today is not what you have thought it was or is as it used to be 30-40 years ago. They used to be a law and order bunch to an extent. But, you know, go back to  88 with Dukakis letting all these people out of jail on furloughs and so forth. Their base, their base voters require them to assume the position that most people in jail are there as the result of prosecutorial misconduct or a biased and racist judicial system and that most people in jail  Especially on drug charges.(impression)  There are so many people that don t even need to be in jail at all! They should be let out.  This has been a big Democrat move to open up prisons and let people out, and it s accompanied by their drive to have the felon vote restored. Look, the Democrats need as many of those kinds of people that can t support themselves or have great trouble doing so. That s the ideal Democrat voter, and Democrats look at prison populations, and they see a great potential there. People who are gonna have trouble getting hired? People that have shown a difficulty in holding a job, getting a high-paying job?Made to order!But they can t vote if they re in prison. But they re not talking about this, because that would mean they would have to thank or credit Donald Trump, and they just can t, and they just won t. Which is, again, why I say every Republican in the Senate needs to be walking to microphones today and blaming all this on the Democrats and their unwillingness to protect the border, to secure the border, their unwillingness to engage in process, their unwillingness to engage in compromise, their unwillingness to cross the aisle and meet people halfway on $5 billion. And because they hate Trump. They are willing to subject the country to great risk simply because they hate Donald Trump.That s the message needs to get out.Here s what Trump said to the press gaggle about where we are right now THE PRESIDENT: We just had a meeting with some of our great senators, Republicans, and it lasted a long time, tremendous enthusiasm for border security. When Nancy Pelosi said,  You ll never get the votes in the House,  we got  em and we got  em by a big margin, 217 to 185. So now it s up to the Democrats as to whether or not we have a shutdown tonight. I hope we don t, but we re totally prepared for a very long shutdown, and this is our only chance that we ll ever have, in our opinion   because of the world and the way it breaks out   to get great border security.RUSH: Mitch McConnell tweeted   and this is positive. McConnell tweeted,  Let s not end this year the way it began, another shutdown over the issue of illegal immigration because the Democrats are unwilling to support common sense measures.  This is good! This is good! The Turtle then went on to say,  I am proud to vote for the additional border security that the House added to government funding legislation.  So that s good! That s exactly the kind of stuff that needs to be said!The Senate majority leader. Again, here s Mitch McConnell s tweet.  Let s not end this year the way it began: another shutdown over the issue of illegal immigration.  He s talking about Chuck Schumer s shutdown over DACA back in January.   another shutdown over the issue of illegal immigration because the Democrats are unwilling to support common sense measures. I m proud to vote for the additional border security the House added to government funding legislation.  Now, this meeting, I want to add some things   just a few things   to this.The president was talking about what a great night it was for Republicans last night because of the vote in the House, and he said that he had never seen the spirit they had in actually doing what they promised to do. He said he saw  a great sense of achievement and accomplishment.  Yu know, I can believe it. Ask yourself to remember experiences in your own life. How do you feel when you actually achieve something? I don t care what it s been. Get a good score on a test, finishing a homework project, something at work.You do feel good, especially if you ve been phoning it in, especially if you didn t think you could do it. Trump said he noticed a difference in the overall attitude of Republicans. Finally, they felt like they had done something   and this is something they had promised to do. This is how he chose to thank them. So he said the Senate s looking at it now. He just had a long meeting with them. He said that in the meeting with Republican senators he detected a lot of enthusiasm on for border security, that they want safety for our country. He mentioned some drugs, mentioned human trafficking.You know, the actual human results of all of this and what it means when this isn t shut down. The things the Democrats are for! Keep pounding what the Democrats are for. Keep pounding what the Democrats are perfectly fine with continuing to happen. Then he said,  The wall is gonna pay for itself,  and he admitted, the president did, that there s a good chance it won t pass the Senate, that it s up to the Democrats if there s a shutdown tonight   and you heard him say that if there s a shutdown, it s gonna be very long, signaling that he s not gonna be the one to cave on this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here s Jim in Clarksville, Virginia. I m glad you waited, sir. You are up. Hi.CALLER: Thank you, Rush. Thank you for taking my call. I m not Vietnam veteran, longtime listener, been listening since Moby Dick was a minnow.RUSH: Ha! (chuckling)CALLER: What I d like to talk to you about is Democrat liberals use language control. You won t hear them say  illegal alien  or  illegal immigrant.  They say  undocumented.  You won t hear them say once they get here that they  go on welfare.  They get  entitlements.  And then you have these illegal alien children that been here for years. Those are  DACA.  Now, what President Trump needs to do is take the word  wall  out of this and focus on  national border security,   securing the border,   taking care of our people that are here now,  and just keep drilling on that, because that s what s gonna get through. You think that s okay?RUSH: Yeah. In fact, I ve been doing that myself, and I think the president has too. That s why I ve always said the wall   and I ve gotten in trouble with Trumpists for this. But I ve always said the wall is essentially on symbolic, because it stands for exactly what you say, border security, however we get there. A wall would be great, don t misunderstand. But we can have border security, too, if we don t get a wall. It s not the only way to have it. It d be the best. But a wall and a wall alone is too big a target to destroy, too big a target to make fun of   even though they work, and anybody who wants to protect something of theirs puts it behind a wall.You know, go to any enclave of any city where the wealthy live and see if you can just walk in. There s a gate, and most of them have people at that gate. There are walls of one kind or another. Some of them are actual brick-and-mortar walls. Others are landscaping walls. But there s simply no way you can just walk in! The Vatican has one of the biggest walls you ve ever seen   and it works   and so does Israel. That s the point. They do work, and that s why the Democrats are opposed to it. But in terms of selling it, that s why I keep focusing on  border security  here and accusing the Democrats of not caring about it.It needs to continue.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Inside-the-Beltway media people, even those who would appear to be on our side, are saying,  None of this is real. It s all just a game. There aren t 60 votes in the Senate and there are never gonna be 60 votes in the Senate, and there aren t even 51 votes to do the nuclear option or get rid of the filibuster.  Inside-the-Beltway media is saying,  This is all a joke. It s all a game. Nothing can happen. Trump is gonna lose! There isn t gonna be a wall. There isn t gonna be money for the wall. It s all a joke! JOHNNY DONOVAN: And now, from sunny south Florida, it s Open Line Friday!RUSH: Yeah, this is what they said before the House vote too. You know, the cynicism, the cynicism and the cynics that are in that town! Cynicism itself is paralysis, and it s amazing to watch know-it-alls continually get flummoxed and still resort to their know-it-all status.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here s Major Garrett. He was on CBS today. He s a Washington correspondent, and here s his take with Gayle King on CBS This Morning about the possible shutdown KING: What are they gonna say to the workers now who will be without a job possibly?GARRETT: Uh, one thing  KING: What do you possibly say to all these people?GARRETT: One thing to look at because you have a weekend coming up, some federal workers work but not many. The president s declared Christmas Eve a federal holiday. Christmas is a holiday. This may go until after Christmas but the actual disruption because of that unique scenario may be less than it would be in previous partial government shutdowns or full government shutdowns.RUSH: I just  Look, I need to say again: Can anybody remember any government shutdown? You probably didn t remember any of the details of the most recent one, which was January, practically a year ago. You didn t remember what it was about, and the reason you don t remember it is because nothing happened. Nobody lost their jobs! Nobody lost their paychecks. No recipient of any government check didn t get the check.Literally nothing happens. The deal of this game, the extent to which this game is played over and over and over again is remarkable, because nothing ever happens. I mean, nothing destructive, permanently destructive, nothing even damaging ever happens. Federal employees don t lose their jobs. They don t lose paychecks. In fact, if they do, they re made up. They don t lose a dime because the government gets shut down. It s always made up retroactively, whatever is lost.There isn t any permanent damage or temporary damage that anybody can ever remember from any government shutdown. So what is it about a shutdown that frightens people?  Well, I don t know. Is it safe to get out of bed when the government s not operating?  But see, the government s operating. The White House is open. When Congress isn t, thank your lucky stars. That means they re not passing new laws or regulations or whatever.But the idea that Supreme Court may not be functioning or that some government agency here or there? The idea that life can t go on? The idea that somehow life is punitive? Life is riskier? It s more dangerous, it s all BS. And, you know, it s a testament to just how it was like people have been in portraying government as something nobody can do without. Government s more important than anything, and if it s not there, and if it s not functioning   if you don t think it s functioning but the government s open   why, people end up being afraid, but they don t know why.Even all these people that get some kind of government check   and it s a lot of people. It s over half the country get some kind of government assistance. But it never ends. It doesn t stop, and nobody can remember a time that it did. The biggest government shutdown of my life was 1995, that budget teal. Even then the most noteworthy paying for was felt by the guy that ran the sleigh ride concession at Yellowstone National Park.He was on Larry King every night whining and moaning about how he had no customers  cause he couldn t open because he was part of the interior department, and the interior department was shut down and so there was no sleigh ride concession. So we got stories about (sobbing),  Little kids were in tears! They wanted to go on a sleigh ride! They wanted to see the animals and they couldn t, and it was all because the mean Republicans don t care about kids and hate kids.  That s the extent of it.Now, don t misunderstand. I m not saying that there s no immediate political impact. It just frustrates me that there is. Major Garrett s right. This shutdown, if it happens, the first three or four days of it are at a period of time where nobody s gonna be doing anything and nobody s in Washington right now anyway. Even the Senate! A lot of the reason the vote is being a little delayed here is because senators are having to hot trot it back to D.C. to vote.They re not even there! I mean, in one sense you could say that the government already is shut down. Let s see. F. Chuck Todd this morning on the Today show. Willie Geist said,  Hey, Chuck, the clock is ticking here to a potential shutdown at midnight. Do you think the government will be open at midnight tonight, Chuck? And if so, Chuck ?  Okay, great illustration. If the government s open at midnight, then what? What are you gonna be doing at midnight tonight that you won t do if the government s shut down?I would venture to say that a lot of people by midnight are in bed. Are you not gonna go to sleep tonight if the government is shut down? Are you gonna have to stay awake and post guards at the front and back doors  cause the government s shut down? Are you gonna have to draw the drapes, keep the windows closed and make sure that the Neighborhood Watch is on full alert because the government s shut down? How s it gonna change? If the government s not open at midnight, how does that affect you at midnight?And if the government s not open tomorrow, say you re slated to wrap Christmas presents tomorrow morning. If the government shut down, how is that going to affect what your plans are for Saturday morning? I am scheduled to play golf in the morning, and if the government shuts down, I m going to be playing golf. If it doesn t shut down, I m going to be playing golf. It won t matter a hill of beans   and it won t matter a hill of beans to anyone. But what about, Rush, the 400,000 federal workers that won t  that won t get paychecks and can t buy Christmas presents?  They ve already been paid with the money they were going to use to buy Christmas presents, which has been put on their credit cards anyway. They re not gonna have to make payments on whatever presents they buy until next year anyway. So tell me: How does that change anything? It doesn t change diddly-squat here. But, Rush, but, Rush, we can t just shut down the government. It s to important. Why?You can t tell me the last time it was shut down and how it ruined your day. Oh, there might be some people out there that depend on some trash hauler showing up that s got a government contract to do it that might be temporarily suspended, but we re not talking about permanent, life-altering events that destroyed life-made decisions here. Anyway, Chuck Todd was asked this question.  Hey, Chuck, do you think the government will be open at midnight tonight? And if it is, does the president get the wall or does he get some version of the wall? TODD: Right now, it doesn t look like it is. I think that on December 21st everybody feels as if they can dig in their heels. Let s see what happens on Monday morning when it s December 24th and the reality that these folks realize that they re not gonna be where they promised they would be, the president is tired of this crummy weather. He may be fine not going to Mar-a-Lago tonight. I ll be curious where he is in 48 hours.RUSH: Okaaay. I get it. So the president has said he s not gonna go to Mar-a-Lago while the government is shut down, just like George W. Bush said,  I m not gonna play golf while the troops are on the battlefield.  Trump said he s not gonna go to Mar-a-Lago. Here s F. Chuck Todd. (summarized)  Well, that s easy to say on Friday, December 21st. But let s say it s Christmas Eve, December 24th, and Trump is stuck in the weather of Washington. You think he might want to end the government shutdown so he can go to Mar-a-Lago? This is how these people think. Washington will be so insufferable on Christmas Eve, Trump would have to get out. Not understanding his commitment or his resolve. He can go to Mar-a-Lago any time he wants, no matter if the government s shut down or not and no matter what he says he s gonna do. Where are gonna be on Christmas Eve, Chuck? Gonna be on standby in case the Today show needs you for some late breaking news? Where are you gonna be on Chirstmas?You gonna leave Washington, Chuck? Where you gonna be? Wherever you re gonna be, are you gonna have a camera nearby in case duty calls? Hey, Chuck, if the government shut down, are you gonna be able to go on TV? Are you gonna be able to report on the government shut down if the government is shut down? Or not? It s not gonna change Chuck s day or change Chuck s life. Nor is it gonna change anything for Wolf Blitzer at CNN.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/12/21/stephen-miller-calls-out-wolf-blitzer/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Dec 21, 2018RUSH: Stephen Miller, who is a senior adviser to President Trump on immigration and related issues in the White House, was on CNN s Situation Room with Wolf Blitzed last night, and the whole thing went 20 minutes. Wolf Blitzer came off as a Democrat Party activist, and I don t think he knew it when it was happening, and Stephen Miller finally called him out on it. You know, Wolf is saying,  Well, well, the Democrats are for border security! They just don t want to spend five billion wasteful dollars for a wall. Stephen Miller says,  Can you cite for me one example of Democrats being in favor of border security?  And Wolf Blitzed (stammering),  Well, uh, they do! They love it! (sputtering)  So we have relevant excerpts from this exchange, and here is the first one.MILLER: The Democrats, all they need to do is support border security and the government will be funded.BLITZER: The Democrats support border security!MILLER: Could you ?BLITZER: They don t support $5 billions to build a wall.MILLER: Could you identify, Wolf, for me some of the kinds of border security you re saying the Democrats are saying they re gonna support?BLITZER: (crosstalk) The Democrats all say they support border security.MILLER: But they re like what?BLITZER: But building the wall  MILLER: They voted against case law. They voted against ending sanctuary cities. They voting against deporting MS-13 gang members. They voted against deporting violent criminals. They voted time and time again against a physical border wall to stop illegal entry. Where is the evidence that you keep asserting they re for border security? They haven t been! They oppose closing loopholes for asylum. I m just saying, I believe government will be funded as long as Democrats make good on their rhetoric you cite.RUSH: See, Wolf doesn t even realize how he s coming off here. He s speaking for the Democrats. He s speaking as an advocate for the Democrats.  Well, the Democrats support border security, but they don t support $5 billion for a wall.  He might as well have said  we  instead of  they.  So Miller asks him to give an example of the kind of border security that he says Democrats are for, and Blitzer says,  Well, the Democrats all say they except border security. Is that all you need, Wolf?The Democrats just say  X  and that makes it so? The Democrats say they support border security. They don t! That s the point of all this, and that s the point that needs to be driven home exactly like Steve Miller here did it and the Senate Republicans need to do keep doing. They don t support border security. They are opposed to it. They re standing in the way of it. They are blocking it. They are blocking every aspect of border security, over five billion measly dollars, because they hate Donald Trump and they cannot allow him to have anything that would constitute a win.The Democrats are against compromise. The Democrats don t believe in process. The Democrats are unwilling to  cross the aisle and show that we can work together to make government work.  They re the ones that are the roadblocks here, and that needs to be pounded   and kudos to Stephen Miller for drawing them out on this. There s one more to this,  cause Miller was on a roll. He kept going and wolf finally figured out he might be a little trapped.MILLER:   and agree to help with border security.BLITZER: (talking over the guest) Well, what if there s no $5 billion in the legislation between now and tomorrow night?MILLER: We ll see what happens, Wolf.BLITZER: You know, when you say,  We ll see what happens,  is that a good enough answer for the nearly one million federal workers, many of them law-enforcement types, who are not gonna get a paycheck after midnight tomorrow night?MILLER: That s a question for the Senate Democrats and especially for Chuck Schumer, who apparently   at Nancy Pelosi s bidding   rescinded their support for a bill that funds border security.RUSH: That s it! It s exactly right! It s onus time on the Democrats now! But you notice whether it s Wolf Blitzer or Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer,  Well, what about the federal workers, many of them law-enforcement types, who are not gonna get a paycheck?  Wolf, you know as well as I do they ve already gotten paychecks for the period of time that they re working. Over Christmas, the government may shut down.Christmas presents have been purchased with credit cards. This is a nonstarter. But you see (sobbing),  The Republicans are putting people out of work at Christmastime! The Republicans are causing misery at family Christmas trees and Republicans   Wolf Blitzer, acting like a good loyal Democrat hack, is right in the middle of it   and Stephen Miller shut him down.

 defiance of God?CALLER: I believe it, Rush. And I ll tell you, another one of my pet peeves is our leaders, they ll get up, they ll give their speeches, and it always ends with,  God bless America.  You know, it doesn t work that way. If you re not gonna give God his rightful in place  You know, America is an exceptional country. We were founded like no other country.  One nation under God. RUSH: They don t care about any of that. They have no appreciation for that. They have no understanding of it, no appreciation. They ve got no ties to it, in their minds. You re talking about stuff that codified slavery and racism and bigotry and homophobia, anti-transgenderism, anti-binary kids, anti-cisgender contrarianism. They ve got no ties to the founding. There s nothing romantic about it. There s nothing historically wonderful about it.To them, it was a period of pure evil that they re finally getting their hands on and rolling back. But that s another answer. My answer  I have my answer to your question. I just want to hear what other people think  cause this is  I could ask the question a number of ways. Why are they so celebratory over now the freedom to kill? Why is the freedom to kill such an important political objective? Why do they want to do this? What is the benefit they derive from this?I m sure everybody s got a legitimate answer to it. I have mine. I m just curious what other people think,  cause I think that s how you have to look at this. I mean, what is it really? What is it that s happening here? And they re doing standing ovations after they passed the law, so..? Why? What in the world has been achieved here," in their minds? What is the reason for the happiness and the celebration?  Cause you and I can t relate to it. But clearly it s making them deliriously happy. There is an answer.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/23/nick-sandmann-stares-down-savannah-guthrie/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 23, 2019RUSH: Okay. We ll try again here on the phones. Blaine in Charleston, South Carolina. Welcome, sir. Great to have you here.CALLER: Thanks, Rush. Just a quick comment about the Savannah Guthrie interview with the young boy. Asking him about wearing the red hat causing all that? Isn t that akin to, like, a rape victim getting asked if because of the way she was dressed is the reason she was assaulted?
RUSH: Yeah, exactly. I made the point yesterday when it was discovered that the MAGA hat was the trigger, and we had the Catholic priest say they had no right to be wearing the cap. The Catholic priest   Father Beck something or other was his name   said they had no right to be wearing the cap! No right to be wearing the cap? From their own diocese, I think. So I asked a simple question: Now, wait a minute. When women are targeted for abuse, sexual abuse, rape and so forth, if you dare say that they were dressed provocatively, you were shouted down.You were told to shut up. Women cannot be blamed because of their attire, because of their manner. There s no excuse whatsoever. Here we have a situation where the Catholic priest  He s a CNN commentator. We played the sound bite of the guy talking about this.  They have no right to wear a Make America Great Again hat!  Now, imagine, imagine anybody on CNN saying to a woman who has been raped or molested that was on TV,  You ve got no right to be wearing those short shorts! You have no right to be wearing dresses with cleavage like that. Imagine the reaction to it! Here s the thing. The  Make America Great Again  hat was a trigger. It was a trigger for these people on our side who had a conniption over this. All they saw  All they saw was a bunch of kids that support Trump   and since they hate Trump, they hated the kids. Let me ask you this, folks. Do you think we would even be talking about this if that kid, Nick Sandmann, had not been wearing a MAGA hat? I ve had people tell me that.  If he hadn t a worn that hat, this would have never become a story.  The video would have been uninteresting,  and there may be something to it. But I don t think that does anything but indict further the bigots! What is this? We re supposed to worry about triggering the media? We re supposed to worry about triggering the left? So don t wear the  Make America Great Again  hat? And that s what s gonna be happening.  Look, let s not wear the hat. We don t want to become targets. We have to hide what we believe. We have to hide what we support so that we don t become targets, so we don t get the media defaming us. That s where this is gonna go. There are elements of conservatism that already advocate this kind of thing for people.  Don t make yourself a target.  What it results in is a bunch of conservatives going silent and not voicing anything anywhere because they don t want to be targeted like this kid has been targeted, like these kids have been targeted. So it s another form of censorship. It s another form of politically correct censorship that we cave into and let people get away with.What do you mean, being triggered by a cap? Even so-called conservative intellectuals on our side, and Savannah Guthrie  Let s get to the audio sound bites of the interview. We have them here. I ve been waiting for the proper transition. It was on the Today show today. Now, when I first discovered that the Sandmann family had decided to do their interview with the Today show, I said,  Okay, who s advising them here?  By the way, you know what? That brings up a whole other can of worms.There are people out there now starting to criticize this family for going and getting a PR firm.  They have no right! They re getting a PR firm? A PR firm is purposely to spin and not tell the truth!  Now they re getting ripped for getting a PR firm. Sandra Fluke had a PR firm. Do you know that? The whole thing was staged and orchestrated like everything on the left is! PR firms are among the first people Democrat campaigns hire. I said,  Why are they doing the Today show?  But then it didn t matter. I thought Mr. Sandmann held his own, was pretty good. Let s go to these sound bites. This was this morning, and these are in somewhat chronological order.Here s Savannah Guthrie with the first question GUTHRIE: Do you feel from this experience that you owe anybody an apology? Do you see your own fault in any way?SANDMANN: As far as standing there, I had every right to do so. I don t  My position is that I was not disrespectful to Mr. Phillips. I respect him. I d like to talk to him. I mean, in hindsight, I wish we could have walked away and avoided the whole thing. But I can t say that I m sorry for listening to him and standing there.RUSH: Now, did you notice this question? (impression)  Did you feel from this experience ?  What are we listening to, Christine Blasey Ford? What s happening to these women in journalism? Do they feel like we re talking to an infant here, or they want us to think they re talking to somebody with a single brain cell, an amoeba?  Do you feel from this experience that you owe anybody an apology?  Do we not by now know what happened? He doesn t owe anybody an apology!He is owed the apology by you in the media and by Nathan Phillips and by the Black Israelite Confederates or whatever they are and the Drive-By Media at large! He doesn t owe anybody an apology! Apologize for wearing the cap? Apologizing for smiling? Well, what does he have to apologize for? And, by the way, I have to give Mr. Sandmann here a bunch of attaboys, because he did what few would. Most would say (hysterical crying),  I do! I want to apologize! (sobbing) I m soooo sorry! I didn t mean to be wearing the cap! God, if I could take it back! Oh ho-ho-hooooo!  (wailing)That s what most Republicans would do. They would cave in the face of this heat from the Drive-By Media. But Nick Sandmann says,  As far as standing there, I had every right to do so. My position is I was not disrespectful to Mr. Phillips. I respect him. I d like to talk to him. I wish we d have walked away,   cause who wants to be in this kind of imbroglio? But I have nothing to apologize for. What is this question,  Do you feel from this experience you owe anybody an apology? That s the question you ask before you learn the truth of this, Ms. Guthrie! All right. What s next? The question from Savannah Guthrie (impression),  Do you think it was a good idea to start chanting back at the protesters?  They weren t chanting back. You know what they did? They did their school song. They were getting in on the zeitgeist, the spirit of the times. So the Indian s out there banging the war drum and doing his chant. The Congressional Black Israelites are over there shouting their profane invectives. So the kids said,  Hey, let s get in on this. (impression)  Do you think it was a good idea to start ?  So she is hell-bent on still portraying these kids as the provocateurs, and here is what Nicholas Sandmann said in reply SANDMANN: In hindsight, I wish we had just found another spot to wait for our buses. But at the time, being positive seemed better than letting them slander us with all of these things. So, I wish we could have walked away.GUTHRIE: Did anyone shout any insults back or any racial slurs back at the group?RUSH: Ah, come on! What is that?SANDMANN: We re a Catholic school and it s not tolerated. They don t tolerate racism, and none of my classmates are racist people.RUSH: I can t believe this! All right. (impression)  Do you think it was a good idea to start chanting back at the protesters?  Anything to try to make sure somebody, anybody sees the kids as guilty. Then he has another great answer.  I wish we had found another spot to wait for the buses.  Who wants to be part of this circus?  But at the time, being positive seemed better than letting them slander us with all of these things. In other words,  Why should we have to sit there and take being insulted verbally the way we were?  And then her next question: (impression)  Did anyone, uh, shout insults back or any racial slurs back at them?  So the Congressional Black Israelites or whatever, they can say whatever they want, and she s not questioning it. But she wants to dig.  Did you dastardly kids act like racists and insult them back?  So in her mind, the kids are guilty, and the objective here is to entrap them and to demonstrate that.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We have two more bites here. The next question from Savannah Guthrie, The center of the firestorm is what critics characterize as a  smirk  on your face. Some say it was an attempt to stare down  the beloved Indian chief and Vietnam War vet, the frail, barely able to walk and stand up man of nature beating on his drum smack-dab in your face. What do you think that looks like,  your smirk, your whiteness, your MAGA hat, your sarcasm, your whiteness and your MAGA cap?  What do you think that looks like  to people, you jerk kid?SANDMANN: I see it as a smile saying that this is the best you re going to get out of me. You won t get any further reaction of aggression, and I m willing to stand here as long as you want to hit this drum in my face.GUTHRIE: What some people see is a young kid with a smirk on his face!SANDMANN: Mmm-hmm.GUTHRIE: What would you say for people who see that and are making a judgment about who you are?SANDMANN: Well, people have judged me based off one expression, which I wasn t smirking but people have assumed that s what I have, and they ve gone from there to titling me and labeling me as a racist person, someone that s disrespectful to adults, which they ve had to assume so many things to get there without consulting anyone that can give them the opposite story.RUSH: Nick, they re not interested in the opposite story, and they re not interested in the truth, as this line of questioning.  So some say   Some? Who?  Some say it was .  You think, Savannah! Don t use this ploy where,  Some say.  You take yourself out  You tell him to his face,  It looks to me like, you kid, that you re smirking there as you stare down the beloved Indian chief! What do you think that looks like?  That s what she s asking.  Some say   That s like  if true.   If it s true    Some say   Like on Twitter, or at Bill Kristol s new magazine?Where?Where is this being said?It s the Drive-By Freaking Media is where it s being said. So he answers it and says, (impression)  What some people see as a young kid with a smirk on his face. What would you say for people who see that and are making a judgment for who you are?  Journalist:  That s a fair question, Mr. Limbaugh, you are misrepresenting what journalism is about. It s a fair question because that attitude is out there. It may be a fair question, but there s also a tone in the way this thing is asked, this is an accusation, and it s browbeating. It s what would be objected to in court  cause you re asking the question over and over again, and you re not happy with the answer that you re getting.So up next is Savannah Guthrie asking Nick Sandmann about his standing his ground in front of the brave but frail barely able to walk and stand Native American war hero beating a drum right in front of his eyes.GUTHRIE: There s something aggressive about standing there, standing your ground. You both stood your ground. And it was like a stare down. What do you think of that now when you think about that moment?SANDMANN: Mr. Phillips had his right to come up to me. I had my right to stay there. Our school was slandered by the African-Americans who had called us all sorts of things.GUTHRIE: Do you think if you weren t wearing that has had, this might not have happened or it might have been different?SANDMANN: That s possible but I would have to assume what Mr. Phillips was thinking, and I d rather let him speak for why he came up to us. I have the utmost respect for Mr. Phillips, and I want to thank him for his military service as well. And I d certainly like to speak with him.RUSH: Right. So  I mean, you can t do it any better than that, trying to disarm the situation here. Mr. Phillips had every right  There s no question about that, in my mind. I mean, what gives you the right to start going up and intimidating people? The kids didn t approach anybody. But boy, the frail Indian sure able scooted up there pretty quickly, didn t he, beating on the war drum?  Our school was slandered by the African-Americans who d called us all sorts of things.  (impression)  You think if you weren t wearing that hat, this might not have happened, or it might have been different? His answer s right on the money.(summarized)  Well, maybe, but he would have to assume what that cap means I m thinking at the moment, just like I would have to assume what Mr. Phillips was thinking, beating on his war drum and getting involved in war chants while we re being assaulted here by the Congressional Black Israelites.  Jeez! So this was an effort here to cause a stumble. Mr. Sandmann was supposed to stumble here. He was supposed to trip and provide a sound bite that would allow the media to say,  See? See? This kid, this kid is vicious  This is viscous racism.  That s what they wanted out of this. He didn t give it to  em. Congratulations.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. Back to the phones we go. This is L. Z. in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Great to have you. Hi.CALLER: How are you doing today?RUSH: Fine, sir. Thank you.CALLER: I just wanted to start off and tell you I m a strong Trump supporter and I love your show. I ve been watching this thing with the Native American, and I ve kind of been twisted on it. I   I   I don t understand. Maybe these kids haven t been taught their history or anything of what these Indians went through in the past. But I think both groups were in the wrong. I think the kids should have stepped aside and let these guys have five minutes, because we pushed these guys all the way across American  They ve almost been to the extinction. I mean, just five minutes.They could have a bigger person. I mean, they   and they chose to stand face to face. I could see the kids in the background jumping around and acting like idiots. A lot of people are rushing judgment on both sides. But, I mean, I   I just  It just breaks my heart that these people are Americans. Well, all of us, are Americans. We gotta do this. I always thought this was one nation for the people, by the people. But it seems like two nations not by the people and not for the people. And I think until we can get that together (muttering) and people better dig back in our history and just look at things.RUSH: Well, who are the two nations? If we re not one nation anymore, we re two nations, what are the two factions that make up the nation now? What are the two nations?CALLER: Well, you got a really sad Democrat Party that just doesn t want to work with our president. And, you know, they put the government on a shutdown. I think Nancy and Schumer and all these people, maybe they should go without pay. Maybe they  If they want there illegals over here, maybe they should put  em in their house. I mean, I don t understand why we can t take the drug money and use that to build the wall. I mean, God daggone, I m an American! I ve lived here all my life, and I ve watched people get things taken away from  em and handed to these illegals. I   I   I just don t understand it. The whole country just upsets me.RUSH: Well, you know, the ancestors of these illegals were here before we were just like the Indians.CALLER: Well  RUSH: The Mexicans used to own California, Texas, and Arizona.CALLER: (crosstalk)RUSH: We took it back. And, you know, we re not only just staring down the illegals, we re sending  em back.CALLER: Oh, no, we re terrible people. Not only have we taken out the Indians, we came over here  We wanted Texas. We took Texas away from the Mexicans. We took California.RUSH: Right.CALLER: (garbled)   wasn t giving back. We take and we take and we take. I mean, and it s sad,  cause I love America, and sometimes I m just so ashamed of their path. But you gotta look at the (crosstalk).RUSH: Ah, it s a tough thing to have to deal with, I know. I know.CALLER: (crosstalk)RUSH: Some days I can t get out of bed thinking how bad America s been.CALLER: I mean, they just want to blame everything else and don t want to fest up to it.RUSH: Who did we take the state of Washington from? Wasn t that the Eskimos? Hadn t they migrated down from Alaska? We kicked them back up to Alaska. We didn t want Alaska at the time, so we kicked  em back up to igloos.CALLER: (mewling)RUSH: And Hawaii! Look what we did to Hawaii. We stormed all the way across the Pacific Ocean to take Hawaii from those people. (Snort!) Man.CALLER: Well, we took Alaska and took the Eskimos and made all their land National Parks. They didn t like that, but  RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: Better than being wrong  RUSH: Not to mention the snail darter! We start building Walmarts where the snail darter habitat is.CALLER: Yes. Yes. (crosstalk)RUSH: Let me ask you, back to the Native American-Catholic kid controversy. If the kids had backed off like you asked that they do  CALLER: Sure.RUSH:   what do you think would have happened?CALLER: I don t know. I really don t know. I wasn t there. I just wish  RUSH: You want me to tell you what would have happened?CALLER: What would?RUSH: I ll be more than happy to tell you what happened. By the way, folks, what I have just shown here is how easy it has been to shame. I mean, he agreed with me that we re so evil, that we took California and all away from Mexico. But anyway, that s how easy it is. But I m gonna tell you what would have happened here, L. Z.. If Nick Sandmann and his buddies from Covington High had backed off, Nathan Phillips would have followed. Nathan Phillips and his band of Indian marauders would have followed, and he would have continued to chant.He would have continued to beat on the war drum. He would have sensed victory, and he would have kept approaching the kid no matter where they went! If the kids had backed off and tried to diffuse the confrontation   which is what they were doing! It s what this kid was doing by smiling and standing his ground, non-provocatively. Had he backed off, he would have ended up in the clutches of the congressional Black Israelites,  cause that s where they were. So if they would have stepped back and then to the side, Nathan Phillips and his gang would have just followed them.They would have sensed weakness.They would have sensed victory over the kids and they would have kept following  em and following  em until the kids got on the bus and left!
The objective was to get those kids out of there!The indigenous peoples and the Congressional Black Israelites owned that area, and they were not gonna let a bunch of pro-life Catholic kids come in there and take over their protest. So no matter what those kids would have done, Nathan Phillips would have used all the tactics he learned as a veteran from Vietnam (ahem, ahem) and tracked those kids all the way back to their bus. If you re thinking that Nathan Phillips would have brought out the peace pipe and that the kids and the Indians would have been smoking the peace pipe and sharing recipes for how to skin salmon, it wasn t going to happen.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: It was either yesterday or today on The View, the all-girl chat show on ABC in the morning, that Whoopi Goldberg was expressing frustration. It was about the contretemps at the Lincoln Memorial between the Covington kids, the Indigenous People s March, and the Congressional Black Israelites. She was saying, (paraphrased)  Why does this always happen? Why is the first reaction always wrong and then people have to apologize and take back what they ve said? Why can t we just wait?  And Joy  Maude  Behar had an answer for her. She said (paraphrased),  Whoopi, the reason is that we want to get Trump out of office! That s why. That s why we don t wait. Anything that looks like we might get Trump out of office, we re gonna pick it and up we re gonna run with it.  I m paraphrasing what she said, but that s pretty much it. So she was being praised today by various left-wing outlets for bringing honesty to broadcasting. In fact, do I have the sound of this? There was another bite. Sunny Hostin  I ll look at my roster here. I either  No. Then it s a news story I ve got somewhere in it. But she was honest. At least, at least we get honesty.She saw an opportunity to get rid of Trump, and so these kids equaled an opportunity to get rid of Trump and that s why they took out after  em. And that is true. That is true. That is why the knee-jerk reaction happened and why they don t walk these things back. They re still trying to hold on to this, some of these networks are.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Rich in Ithaca in New York, it s great to have you on the program, sir. Hello.CALLER: Hey, Rush, good to talk to you.RUSH: Thank you.CALLER: Just a comment about the Savannah Guthrie interview and the comment the priest made about the young man not being able to or not having the right to wear his  Make America Great Again  hat. That would be like me telling the priest that he has no right to wear his collar or his priestly clerics because his priestly wardrobe offends me.RUSH: You know, that s a good point. The militant gays could easily say,  You know what? Your Catholic priest uniform, it triggers me  cause I know you oppose me. You are making me   That s a good point. He shouldn t be allowed. He shouldn t be allowed to wear his Catholic priest uniform in public. Only in church, right? That s your point.CALLER: Well, yeah, it s kind of the point. And, you know, I don t know when that hat went against any uniform policy for the Catholic school and maybe that s what his point was but it sounded more like a general thing like he didn t even have a right to wear that  RUSH: That wasn t his point. The guy is a Never Trumper. That was purely political. There s no question about that. Look. A lot of people, a lot of people think that the hat is a trigger and if the kids hadn t been wearing it a bunch of things that had happened wouldn t have happened. What if that s true? What if that s true? You can t just isolate these incidents  cause that becomes one, then, of many. So the message is,  You conservatives have got to stop public displays of what you believe. You re causing too many people go crazy. So you can t  You can t wear a Trump for president button, can t wear a  Make America Great Again  hat.  We re getting to the point where the American flag is a trigger. Only have certain  (impression)  That flag makes me think of slavery! That flag makes me think of stress and  That flag   If we don t shut this garbage kind of thinking down at some point, we re dealing with a bunch of kids specially, immature, childlike people who need to be told to grow up and stood up to.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/15/dont-cave-on-the-shutdown-mr-president/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 15, 2019RUSH: What s that? (interruption) Shutdown? Yeah, next hour I ll get to the Shutdown Stack. I ve got all kinds of stuff. In fact, there s a great piece here from The Daily Caller written by an unnamed senior Trump official. The headline:  I m a Senior Trump Official, and I Hope a Long Shutdown Smokes Out the Resistance.  I don t know who this is, but the person says he s being hurt by this in a number of ways financially.But he hopes Trump doesn t cave. He hopes this thing goes on and on and on and on and on and a whole bunch of people get smoked out. He says there are just too many career leftists; there are too many saboteurs. He said in this piece, you d be amazed  I wouldn t, but he says you would be amazed at the number of people still in the Trump administration actively working on a daily basis to undermine Trump and his agenda.I wouldn t be surprised by that at all. This guy says he hopes Trump doesn t cave. The best thing that s happening here is for people to see how much redundancy there is in the federal government, and despite this shutdown going on and on and on that life goes on. There are a couple little disruptions here, disappointments there amplified by the media. But he thinks it s a golden opportunity, and I have always thought this.Trump is assuring everybody he s not gonna cave on this, and I hope he doesn t. I think the long-term prospects of this are totally up. I think a lot of people are afraid of it. The Republicans, traditionally, are afraid of being blamed pour shutdowns. The Never Trumper conservatives are apoplectic here over the fact that government s being interrupted and so forth. I think it s a great, great, great opportunity. There are so  We don t get opportunities like this one presents, and I just  I hope he sticks to it.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This piece that I referenced. (shuffling papers) I ll betcha I put it at the bottom of the Stack. Yeah,  I m a Senior Trump Official, and I Hope a Long Shutdown Smokes Out the Resistance   President Trump can end this abuse. Senior officials can reprioritize during an extended shutdown, focus on valuable results and weed out the saboteurs. We do not want most employees to return, because we are working better without them. This is somebody close to the Trump administration talking about the impact of the shutdown. A bunch of saboteurs have been furloughed. President Trump has created more jobs in the private sector than the furloughed federal workforce. Now that we are shut down, not only are we identifying and eliminating much of the sabotage and waste, but we are finally working on the president s agenda.   This is a chance to effect real change, and his leverage grows stronger every day the shutdown lasts. The article makes reference to the number of people actually in the Trump administration that are still trying to undermine Trump and the agenda and that the shutdown is doing a great service in getting rid of furloughing a bunch of them. It s an advocacy piece to keep the shutdown going.He says all this  is more than a battle over a wall. It is an opportunity to strip wasteful government agencies for good. On an average day, roughly 15 percent of the employees around me are exceptional patriots serving their country. I wish I could give competitive salaries to them and no one else. But 80 percent feel no pressure to produce results. If they don t feel like doing what they are told, they don t. If they don t feel like showing up, they don t.  Why would they? We can t fire them. They avoid attention, plan their weekend, schedule vacation, their second job, their next position   some do this in the same position for more than a decade. It s a long answer. But do any of you see any evidence that anybody that Trump would name AG is gonna go in there and start the investigation to the people that really need to be investigated? Starting with Obama, starting with Hillary, starting with Brennan, starting with Clapper, starting with Fusion GPS, including all of these people in the FBI that worked to undermine Trump s campaign and undermine Trump s transition, they continue to try to undermine his presidency.And I m telling you, if you could watch this, every Democrat question can be boiled down to this essence: Are you gonna make sure that Robert Mueller gets rid of Trump? Are you gonna stand in the way of Robert Mueller getting rid of Trump? Are you gonna do what you can to suppress Mueller s results that would get rid of Trump or are you gonna let Mueller release them? Are you gonna release these investigatory details to the public so everybody knows why we have to get rid of Trump?They re not adding  to get rid of Trump.  But that s what they re asking. They are convinced that Mueller is gonna have the goods on Trump and he s gonna go. And so they re paranoid that this guy s gonna shut down the investigation or let Trump fire Mueller. So every question is basically, are you gonna stand aside and let Mueller do his job and get rid of Trump?And Barr is saying,  Yes, yes. Of course. Absolutely within the rules and the context of the guidelines, absolutely, Senator.  That s what all the Democrats are asking. Because despite what we all know, they re convinced that Mueller s got the goods. And they re convinced Mueller s not gonna stop until he gets the goods. Anyway, I wish I had a different answer for you, but I don t. And I d love to be wrong.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/23/did-you-think-democrats-would-take-control-and-do-this/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 23, 2019RUSH: You know, during the midterm elections everybody was pondering,  Gee, what s gonna happen if the Democrats win the House?  We all guessed correctly that they would just do nothing but investigations. In fact, you want to hear this? Pencil Neck Adam Schiff! When the BuzzFeed story came out last Friday and it was simmering out there   it was kind of exploding, actually, all day long   and then finally the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, Esq., debunked the story and said that it wasn t true.And the Drive-By Media had a collective depression and all of their acolytes had a collective depression. (laughing) And so now Adam Schiff and some of these other Democrat committee chairmen in the House said,  You know what?  I need to add one thing. Who was it? Jonathan Karl of ABC News said that he had heard that people had better be prepared for a report from Mueller that is anti-climactic. Meaning: It ain t gonna be what everybody s hoping. Meaning: It isn t gonna have evidence in there that Trump needs to go.So I have detected that there is more and more of this sentiment that whatever Mueller ends up reporting, it isn t gonna be bombshell. It isn t gonna be blockbuster. And, of course, if it was always based on the evidence, we could have told you that from before the day Mueller started. The question here is whether this has ever been about evidence or not, because actually it hasn t. There wasn t any collusion. You know the drill on that.So the Democrats, now (in further evidence that they are afraid Mueller s got nothing) are announcing new investigations, even additional investigations from what we know that they ve said they re gonna do. Adam Schiff has said that if the Mueller report is unsatisfying, they re just gonna start it themselves. They re gonna start their own investigation all over again. They re telegraphing that if Mueller doesn t have anything, that s not gonna be the end of it, that they re going to impanel new committees.I m trying to think. What more do they think they will be able to get than the CIA can get, than the FBI can get, than the DOJ can get, than MI5 and MI6 can get? I mean, they ve turned this earth upside down looking for evidence that Trump colluded with the Russians, and there isn t any evidence of it. And these people have gotten so accustomed, their expectations are so high, that if now  They re being asked point-blank,  Well, what if Mueller s report doesn t have anything? (sputtering)  Well   well   well that   that   that just means that we re gonna have to kick in our own investigations here,  and the assumption is that Trump will have done something to bottle this up or what have you. I mean, it s pure irrationality on parade, and if they do this after the Mueller report, no matter what it is? If they re unsatisfied with it and then double down and start process all over again, I m guaranteeing you that more Americans than you can possibly calculate are gonna throw up their hands in frustration and totally oppose it.I mean, the lunatic Democrat base will be all for it. But the point is, we knew this is what they re gonna do. I m just trying to tell you that you re gonna do even more. They re gonna do even more investigations depending on what Mueller does have and comes up with. But in all of our prognosticating, in all of our forecasting, in all of the imagining what the Democrats would do, how many of you ever assumed that after they won the House, that they would shut down the government and then try to prevent Trump from giving the State of the Union address?I didn t! Those two things never crossed my radar. But here we are, and so now Trump has made a proposal to The Turtle, Mitch McConnell, the leader in the Senate, of ways to get the government back up and running and get the wall built. He s offered Democrats much of what they have claimed to have wanted, but it contains money for the wall. The Democrats are saying, led by Pelosi, they re not even gonna talk to him. So now there s some breakage in the ranks.There are a couple of prominent Democrats who are saying,  Come on! Just give him the money and let s open the government back up!  Other Democrats   and they re freshmen   say,  Come on! You ve got talk to him. Get in the room and talk to him!  But Pelosi is intractable. Pelosi will not budge. Steny Hoyer has broken away from her yet again on all of this, and I just find it fascinating. You know, Hillary Clinton was talking about once the Democrats get back in charge it s gonna be the  return to civility. Ha! Return to civility?Now, she may have been talking about once they win the White House again. But they ve won the House, and there isn t any pretense of civility happening out there. Not on their side of the aisle. We have a continued disintegration of our culture, continuing disintegration of our society, a culture war started by them and continually waged by them. They re never happy.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/15/toensing-and-digenova-on-coup-against-trump/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 15, 2019RUSH: Okay.  The brazen plot against Trump by the Obama-era FBI and DOJ continues, enabled by a complicit media.  This is an op-ed written by Victoria Toensing and her husband, Joe diGenova. And it basically rehashes things that we have talked about for months and months here about the deep state, about this conspiracy, about the objective to overturn the presidential election results of 2016. The corruption of the Department of Justice and the FBI by Obama-era employees.I m watching the Barr confirmation hearings, and every one of these Democrat senators is essentially asking Barr, they dress the questions up, but the questions are basically this: Are you gonna make sure Mueller gets Trump? Are you gonna stand aside and let Mueller get Trump? Are you gonna interrupt Mueller as he tries to get Trump? Are you gonna make sure that Mueller won t be fired? Are you gonna make sure that Trump can t stop Mueller from getting him thrown out of office? Are you gonna stand aside and let Mueller finish his job, and are you gonna let everybody know what Mueller said and are you gonna make sure that Trump gets hurt by it? That s what every Democrat s asking. I don t care what the question is, that s what it really is.Barr is saying,  Uhhh, yes. Rules and whatever? Yes. I  (sputtering) Yes, I   I   I will not  Witch hunts? I don t believe in witch hunts. Mueller knows how to do a witch hunt.  So these questions are so obvious. I don t care which Democrat   Dianne Feinstein, you name it.  Are you gonna stand aside and let Mueller finish? Are you gonna let Mueller do whatever he wants to do? Are you gonna tell Mueller he s got continued free rein? Are you gonna let Rosenstein continue to let Mueller do what he does? Are you gonna make sure that Mueller finishes this? Are you gonna make sure that if Mueller gets Trump, that Trump s gonna go? Are you gonna stand in for Trump? Are you gonna make sure that Trump does not get hurt? Are you gonna help Trump fire Mueller?  That s all it is, and it offends the hell out of me the presumption on the part of these Democrats that Mueller s got the goods is gonna have the goods and it s only a matter of time before Mueller announces that Trump colluded with Russia, when there isn t any evidence for this whatsoever.The real question should be,  When are you gonna go in and stop this charade? When are you gonna shut down in witch hunt? When are you gonna get rid of this? When are you gonna reinstitute the rule of law?  Of course, the Republicans would never ask those questions and Barr would not answer, but that s what the hell s at stake here if you ask me. So Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova. Let me give you a couple of pull quotes here.  The New York Times story was created to obfuscate  This is the story that we had last week that Trump is a Russian agent and that the FBI and the DOJ knew that Trump was a Russian agent and started to counter intel   you know, the thing we discussed it yesterday.  The New York Times story was created to obfuscate the real criminal conspiracy: violation of Title 18 of U.S. Code Section 242, which prohibits any person under color of law   to deprive another of  rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution.  In other words, they are saying what I ve said here, that this Mueller investigation is a cover-up and a distraction from the real criminal behavior that took place on the Hillary side, on the DNC side, and the Christopher Steele dossier side of things. They write,  The brazen plot against President Trump by the Obama-era FBI and DOJ continues, enabled by a complicit media. The odor of corruption has long been noxious. But the Democrats and media hold their collective noses. The criminal clique, via the New York Times, has announced to the world,  Catch me if you can.   I got an email from a frustrated listener who read this story and agrees with it.  Dear Mr. Limbaugh: Even someone like me who has followed this and read everything for the last two years   and listened to Fox News every night for a year. Even somebody like I, like me, cannot keep up with the complexity. My eyes cloud over. Your listeners do not get it, Mr. Limbaugh. Trust me. But the bottom line is that Obama, Biden, Brennan, Comey and many others who we trusted conspired in a brazen plot to destroy Trump   and they are still doing it. I know you ve said it. I ve heard you. But it isn t sticking. It s not going into the brains of even people who support Trump. It is so frustrating to me. I don t know how to get this across to people. It just points out to me that the media really do hold all the power in the country. Damn them to hell. This is somebody frustrated that no matter what is learned, no matter how many people learn it   this letter writer/emailer, still thinks   you don t get the full impact of what s happening here and that most people don t because the media is reporting literally none of the truth on this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let s see. Here s Mickey, Mickey in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. Hi. You re next.CALLER: (static throughout) Hey, greetings from Pennsylvania.RUSH: Thank you.CALLER: May the blessings of creation shower upon you, my friend. I have a quick prediction and then I have a question. My sources tell me that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is going to propose a bill that will give everyone free fast food and razor blades for life.RUSH: (laughing) Fat chance.CALLER: My sources tell me that.RUSH: What s the question?CALLER: Okay. The question is, the Mueller probe aside, who will ever charge Comey, McCabe, Strzok, and the rest of them for the crimes that they committed? Will it be the new attorney general?RUSH: I have to tell you, I m glad that I got this question. I m glad you called and asked this question. I have to tell you, folks   and I don t want to be, you know, Donnie Downer here. But I just don t see it, and I can t tell you how frustrating it is. This whole cabal, it s not enough that most of them have been fired. They re still out there wreaking havoc. They re on television. They re poisoning the public mind. Comey, Strzok Strzok, Page, they ve all had their shots.What they did was corrupt, but if you go after them you ve gotta keep going, and the reason this is not gonna happen is because you would reach Barack Obama. Nothing of this happens without his okay. This kind of stuff that went on, and everybody thinks these are a bunch of rogue people. But I guarantee you the tone is set by the person at the top, and much of this Mueller investigation is done is to shield Obama. Folks, do you know how much of anti-Trump agenda in the media and the Democrat Party is aimed at saving Barack Obama?The perception of his legacy, the perception of his success at president, the insulation of the criminal activity of his subordinates, all of this is saving Obama   and Hillary. It s all about that. The swamp is the swamp, and people that are in that swamp are in a fraternity. Some of them are Republicans and Democrats, but that s a dividing line for public consumption only. One of the reasons why the Republicans are so acquiescent and really don t traditionally fight back and push back is that that would be pushing back against that which they are a member of.They re just not gonna do it. It s why Republicans don t shut down the government. It s why we had to send somebody there who s not part of this. Nothing like any of the good things that are happening now would have ever happened with a traditional Republican or Democrat presidential candidate who won. If Mitt Romney had won, it would have made no different to what Obama did. Maybe if Ted Cruz had won the nomination, we d have similar circumstances here, but there s nobody who would have gotten even close to what Trump has done agenda-wise.And there s nobody that would have taken the crap that he gets every day. They would have not been able to handle this for a week, and done whatever they could to stop it. So I  (sigh) And this guy Barr is  I ve heard all the accolades, and they all come from swamp people. I don t know him. I know him by reputation. That s all I have to go on. But if nobody s taking any action yet against Comey and the rest of these people   and it s not just Comey. It s Clapper. It s Brennan. I mean, every top-level official in the Obama administration politicized their department.That means they corrupted it, including the Department of Justice! Everything that happened to Trump here is because of the politicization, the Obama politicization of the Department of Justice. They turned it into a political weaponized agency, and they turned it into an enemy of Trump and therefore Republicans, and it became a weapon for the Democrat Party. And it incorporated ammo provided by the Democrats: The stupid dossier! This stupid dossier is the foundational building block for everything that happened, whether they believed it or not.And I don t think they ever did believe it. They re not that stupid. They used it. They defrauded the FISA court, but we don t know to what extend the FISA court was defrauded or winking and nodding and in on it. So you politicize the Department of Justice and then the weaponry is the DOJ, and the ammo was provided by Hillary and Fusion GPS and that Perkins Coie law firm. (However you pronounce that name.)I mean, they re implanting spies in the Trump campaign not to ferret out Russian meddling and whatnot, but to create it! They re putting spies in the Trump campaign so that later, they can be said to have been spies for Russia or what have you. After all of this time, there isn t anything even close to approaching the original allegation and contention for empowering the special prosecutor. There was no Russian collusion, the was no Russian tampering, and there was no Russian effect on any vote or election.This whole thing is a waste of time. It s a smoke screen. It is a hoax.I don t care what adjective you want to attach to it, but it s incredibly damaging to the fabric of the Department of Justice and the overall perception of fairness in the Department of Justice.Once it becomes politicized, it becomes corrupted, and that s what Obama did. He politicized virtually every agency in the federal government, and it remains that way.  "

All right. I ll hurry up. Atlanta is the airport where they re having a shortage issue and the wait times are around two hours plus. But what s happening next month, early next month in Atlanta?

The teams arrive at the Super Bowl on Sunday and Monday, and then the fan base overpaying for everything will start arriving on Monday and through the week and they gotta get Atlanta open and operating with full TSA to be able to process all those people getting into Atlanta. There s stories today that LaGuardia is pulling back on flights because of shortages of personnel and air traffic control.And the way CNN s reporting that is,  Yeah, if you had your own jet like a lot of these rich Trump supporters do and you re unable to get into New York, you re damn well gonna demand that the shutdown end.  You may be on to something out there, Nick. So we reopen things and we pay people long enough to get people into the Super Bowl (laughing) and then we shut down again until it s time to get  em out of Atlanta. We ll see.

We ll do that starting in Jacksonville, Florida, with Mike. You re first. It s great to have you, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hey. How you doing, Rush? I want to wish you and your wife a Merry Christmas and the best of 2019.RUSH: Thank you. Same to you, sir.CALLER: Thank you. I called because I know how to solve the shutdown problem and this immigration they ve got. They talk about the spirit of partisanship on both sides, so each side has to give up something. And what I suggest is President Trump and Republicans come to Pelosi and Schumer and say,  We can work together, okay? We re gonna take your $1.6 billion for your border security. And even though I tried, I m letting my base know I tried to stop this shutdown, we ll take the 1.6 bill, okay? That s what we re gonna accept.  But the Democrats, what they re gonna have to accept, which you know as well as I do they won t, but they will be exposed when they vote against it by  no.  What the Democrats will give up is, we re gonna put a processing center on Mexico s side. And as these people come in we ll process  em and vet  em, make sure they re not criminals, we ll check  em for diseases, whatnot. And the children and the parents, they can  RUSH: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold it a minute. Hold it. Are you suggesting that we propose an immigration processing center on the Mexican side of the border and that s where everybody would be run through? Is that your idea to  CALLER: Yes.RUSH:   make them agree to that in exchange for taking the $1.7 billion?CALLER: No, no, no, I ain t done yet, okay? I ain t done yet. That s only just to process  em through. And as they come through they re allowed to work and pay taxes. They don t get no aid, okay? They don t get no Medicaid. They don t get no health care or whatnot. They re put behind in the back of the list.RUSH: Okay, let me just stop you. The Democrats are not gonna go for that. In fact, right now I don t think the Democrats are even offering $1.6 billion. It may be theoretically there because it used to exist, but a processing center in Mexico would require the cooperation of the Mexican government. But none of what you re doing is going to lead to what Trump s objective is, which is border security.Your way still admits people into the country but doesn t give them any benefits, no health care, no Medicaid, no this. And they re put in the back of the list, but they re still here. And that means the Democrats can still reach them. You re oriented on both sides giving something up to make a deal, which is how negotiations usually happen, but we re way beyond that on this. Although there will be a solution. It will end.There is gonna be an end, and that s what we all have to be prepared for. But if your deal allows people who somehow survive a processing center to get into the country, and that takes them from illegal to legal, I don t know how that s solving anything per se. Then you ve gotta involve the Mexican government to go along with the processing center and then you ve gotta deal with the federal court system which anything like that that happens that the courts and the left thinks the Democrats didn t get a good deal on they ll try to stop, which is part and parcel of getting anything done. But I appreciate the call. Always do.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This is Obi in Sanger, California. Great to have you, Obi. Hi.CALLER: Dr. Rush, thank you so much for working today.RUSH: Well, my pleasure. I enjoy it. I was actually looking forward to it. I made the decision yesterday afternoon and from that point on I was looking forward to it.CALLER: Well, you don t know how happy it made me. I thought I was gonna have a guest host this morning. I do love your guest hosts, but it s always good to have the real thing. Anyway, some quick comments for you. First on the stock market drop, and then I want to do a little follow-up quick one on the wall and on that $150 billion. On the stock market, all the news people and the pundits, even the Fox people refer to it as being caused by, you know, this big drop we ve had in the last few months by maybe interest rate fears or trade issues and other things.The one observation none of them seem to make is that it s coincided with the Democrats taking the House. And to me clearly that is because both the public and industry realize that the Democrats are gonna do nothing but frustrate Trump economic plans, and that s why they are losing confidence in the stock market right now. So that s my first comment. Do you want to respond to that before I make a quick one?RUSH: No, go ahead because I ve only got 45 seconds. I don t want to take it away from you.CALLER: Quick one on the wall. About eight months ago I sent a letter to the president and to Don Jr. saying that he should use the Army Corps of Engineers and Pentagon money and he responded to that. I mean, he came out shortly thereafter and said that s something he s thinking about doing. And I hope he does do it. He should do that. Finally, on the 150, that was frozen assets after the embassy fall, the United States froze $150 billion of Iranian assets.RUSH: When was that?CALLER: After the embassy fall back under the Carter administration.RUSH: Oh, no, no, no. I m not thinking 150 bill back that far. It s part of this current deal. I m gonna track it down. As far as the market plunge, it is clear the president, with all of his tweeting, is trying to focus all of this on the Federal Reserve and their raising rates and their promise to keep raising rates in 2019. I think there are structural reasons that this is happening as well.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I think where I m getting this $150 billion figure running around my head is that I think Obama lifted sanctions on frozen assets in Iran and since 1973 there were like $150 billion   the caller may have had a point   $150 billion of frozen assets that Obama then made available to them as part of the deal. I think that s what it was. "

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/08/the-president-has-the-authority-to-declare-a-national-emergency/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 8, 2019RUSH: TheHill.com, there s a poll:  Poll: Only Die-Hard Trump Fans Oppose Compromise On Border Wall Shutdown Dispute.  This reminds me, we gotta go back in the audio sound bites, need to go back and grab number 3 and number 4, I think. I think they may be applicable. Have  em standing by. Aside from that, we will stick with number 10. President Trump has said that shutting down the federal government in support of his demand for a southern border wall is a  total winner  for him politically, but according to a new poll, the only people who oppose compromise on the issue are his strongest backers. Okay. Compromise. What has compromise always been in Washington? And I say this with no exaggeration, no hyperbole, just straight-up fact. Compromise has always been Republicans caving. Compromise has always been Republicans giving up, which can then be reported as such. Republicans have caved, realizing that they held a losing hand. Republicans have caved after pouncing originally, realizing that they were holding an untenable position, or some such BS way of reporting it.The fact of the matter is, 93% of the American people think that open borders and illegal immigration is a serious problem. So now you go from that poll   this is a Hill-HarrisX poll. Seventy percent of registered voters, they say,  said they want Trump and Congress to reach some sort of compromise, compared to just 30 percent who say that sticking to principles is more important than ending the partial shutdown. We get this at every shutdown! We get this whether there s a shutdown or not! We always get a poll: the American people want Republicans and Democrats to work together, the American people want compromise, the American people want people reaching across the aisle and shaking hands and cooperating, blah, blah, blah, blah, BS. It is yet part of the concerted effort to weaken the resolve not just of Trump, but of his supporters as well. And it happens whatever the issue is, in this case it s a wall or immigration, whether it was a budget deal, I don t care what it was, there s always a poll on the eve of some major event happening or being negotiated. We got commentators, we got pollsters and everybody saying they want compromise on political issues.Okay. So the way I always dealt with this, pick your subject and then say where s the middle ground? Where is anything that we have in-common on it? Take abortion. What do we have in common on it? Not much. What do we have in common here on the wall? Where s the middle ground between the Democrats and Trump on the wall? The Democrats starting point is zero money for the wall. Trump, $5.7 billion. Trump says,  Okay. If you re not gonna give me that, then I m just gonna go get it somewhere else. I m gonna declare a national emergency. I m gonna have the military build it.  Where s the compromise here?They re not talking about compromise. Once again they re talking about Republicans caving. That is the whole point of this poll, it s the whole point of the story is to apply pressure. The only way out now for Republicans is to cave, to realize the mistake that they ve made and try to get out of it as quickly as possible to limit the damage. And it always involves Republicans caving on principle! How do you compromise on principle? How do you take a little of your principle and throw the rest away? With the Democrats, it s not nearly as tough a question  cause they re not guided by principle in most cases. They re guided by political victory.Now, we got the pope, the pope is weighing in too.  Pope Francis compared today s emergence of populist and nationalist movements to the days of Nazi Germany in an address to a group of diplomats accredited to the Holy See Monday.The upcoming year will mark the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the League of Nations, the pope said in his annual address, which represented  the beginning of modern multilateral diplomacy, by which states try to remove mutual relations from the logic of oppression that leads to war.  What? The League of Nations died. And it was replaced by the United Nations.  The pope went on to put forward his belief that globalist organizations are key to the maintenance of peace and international stability.  Yeah. We can t return power to ordinary people, whatever. And here comes Pope Francis joining the side of people who do not believe that returning power to ordinary people is just and is proper and instead that power should be overridden, superseded, taken away from ordinary people and given to globalist governments.I mean, they re everywhere. They literally are out there everywhere attacking and doing what they can to destroy what is seen as the common-sense sentiment. I really think that s what s got everybody all exercised tonight about this national address.Here s the thing about this. If Trump really is the buffoon and the idiot that they say he is, and if he s really so factually incorrect, then why not get out of the way and let him make a fool of himself? I mean, that s the old standard. If you re in an argument with a fool, don t join it, because after a while nobody s gonna be able to tell who s the fool and who isn t. If somebody s in the business of destroying themselves, get out of the way and let it happen. Do not join in and end up destroying yourself.So we ve had sound bite after sound bite, news story after news story, about how Trump is a lying sack of you-know-what. He s factually incorrect. He doesn t know what he s talking about. He s dangerously incompetent. He s stupid, uninformed, and he s gonna be lying through his teeth  cause all Trump wants is chaos. If Trump is that bad, then put it on display. There should not have been even any delay in deciding whether or not to televise this nationally. If Trump wants to go be a buffoon on TV, shouldn t these people be happy about it?Shouldn t they be eager to stand aside and let it happen and then just point it all out when it s over? No! What are they doing? They are instead of promising to distort this thing from the moment it begins! They re scared to death of what Trump s gonna say! They re scared to death of what Trump is gonna propose and they re scared to death of what Trump is gonna do! And they must be really worried that Trump is gonna end up being highly persuasive!Because everything they ve announced that they re gonna do is designed to destroy the ability of Trump to get his message out! Why? If they re so cocksure that it is destructive and wrong and embarrassing, why wouldn t they want to let Trump do this self-destruct? These people are really worried about it this, and the reason  They ve actually carved out for themselves an indefensible position. They somehow have to defend and promote the concept of no border controls.They have to somehow come up with ways to promote the idea that anybody wanting in the country should be let in, that somehow the United States owes it to the world to let anybody in the country who wants to come in, that it s unjust and immoral for us to say no! They ve gotta somehow come up with a way to promote this in such a way that a majority of Americans are gonna end up supporting them on it? When they start with two strikes against them, 93% of the American people say illegal immigration, the southern border, all of that, is big problem.If they had the American people on their side, if everything about this tonight was a guaranteed win for them, and all that had to happen was for Trump to make his speech, why not get out of the way and let it happen and then pick up the pieces and say,  See? We told you this guy s unqualified. We told you this guy s dangerous. We told you he s a buffoon. We told you he s stupid. We told you he s unsophisticated. We told you he doesn t know what he s talking about. They could do all this in their response to this country, go out and explain why Trump poses a great threat, and then make the case for open borders! Because that s what they re effectively giving themselves. That s the position they re taking here. If they re gonna oppose Trump on border security and on a wall  (interruption) Hang on. My watch thinks that I have fallen. No, I didn t fall and I m okay. I get wildly gesticulative here as I get impassioned and in making, points and sometimes when I pound the table (tapping) with the wrist wearing the watch, the watch thinks that I have taken a dive.I mean, it s good that it does this. It s good that it gives the opportunity to say,  Nope, I m fine. I didn t fall. Leave me alone.  Anyway, I think it s rather obvious here that rather than a winning hand they ve been dealt, they are worried to death about this, and I think this promise of theirs to fact check it as it goes and to correct Trump s mistakes as it goes with all these graphics on TV? I think they are hell-bent on disrupting this. Their objective is to make sure that Trump s message does not get out, that it does not appear coherent or cohesive.They must be scared to death of this,  cause I m just  Folks, I m just telling you from practical experience: When somebody is making your case for you about how incompetent or foolish they are, it s a golden opportunity when they re gonna demonstrate it themselves and you don t have to tell anybody. You just say,  Watch,  and that s all they would have to do tonight. But they can t allow that. They simply cannot permit it. Now, there may be another factor, and that is that Trump just so offends their sensibilities about proper behavior in the swamp.I don t think that s the big reason why they are so panicked, and you can t escape that that s what they are. They are panicked, and they are paranoid, and they re scared to death about this. They ve even ginned up this debate over whether or not Trump has the power to declare a national emergency, and this is not the even arguable. I mentioned this in the first hour of today s busy broadcast. The National Emergencies Act of 1976, an act of Congress in the post-Watergate era.The reason that s important is this act gives the president powers that I m sure many of you don t know that he has. The president of the United States can seize property if he wants. In fact, you know, you d be amazed to learn what Abraham Lincoln did in World War II to maintain the unity of the nation. You would be shocked and stunned at the people  (interruption) Civil War. The Civil War. The things he did, the people he fired, the individual liberties he suspended including habeas corpus? You d be shocked.The Executive Emergencies Act was passed by Congress because they were very, very certain that the Democrats were gonna be holding the White House, the Oval Office, for quite a long time after Nixon and Watergate. And so they empowered the executive branch with the National Emergencies Act. He can confiscate private businesses if he wants. All he has to do is declare it a national emergency and he can go out and confiscate Planned Parenthood if he wanted to.He could confiscate Apple (hee-hee-hee-hee) until they start making iPhones in America. Oh, they would raise Cain. I mean, no question about it. But when you look at border, immigration is already established as a federal government issue, a federal government prerogative. National emergency. The border is wide open, unprotected. If they want to get into some academic discussion about it just for the fun of showing people how smart they are, fine. But there s nothing that says he can t do it.There are even a couple of guys in USA Today in an op-ed who have written that he can.  President Trump Could Declare a National Emergency. But Would That Get Him Funds for a Wall?  Presidents have the power to defend the country, and this National Emergencies Act is pretty broad and pretty encompassing.  So does the president have the authority to declare a national emergency and direct resources to the border?  Yeeeep!  Trump can surely test [it],  said Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor at Princeton University s Center for Human Values.  Can you get a major in that at Princeton? I wonder. A major in human values, a major in human rights, a major in civil rights.  The National Emergencies Act allows him to declare a state of emergency without approval from anyone else, but then he has to stay within congressionally delegated emergency powers,  which are specified in, again, the 1976 National Emergencies Act.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  By the way, folks, there is an excellent piece at ConservativeReview.com that explains the Emergency Powers Act of 1976.  Daniel Horowitz has written it. It s a really great piece.  So we will link to it at RushLimbaugh.com to facilitate your finding it.   "

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/10/conventional-wisdom-trump-will-cave-and-declare-emergency/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 10, 2019RUSH: President Trump is saying that he will sign and declare a national emergency for the wall. In fact, the conventional wisdom inside the Beltway is this, that eventually Trump is gonna realize that Chuck and Nancy are not gonna budge. That Chuck and Nancy are not gonna budge, they re not gonna authorize a single penny, much less a dollar, much less $5 billion. The shutdown s gonna go on and on and on. I s gonna start damaging and being harmful, so will say the media, and a solution will be required, that it can t go on in perpetuity.And the conventional wisdom is that Chuck and Nancy are not gonna cave; that Chuck and Nancy hold all the cards; that Trump is the guy with no hand or a weak hand. Trump s gonna be the one to have to cave. The way it s gonna happen is that Trump will not oppose signing the continuing resolution with no money for the wall and then will declare the national emergency to build it, that that will be the solution.The Drive-Bys are suggesting, and I m sure this is with some input from nervous Republicans,  cause there s always, you know, Lisa Murkowskis out there, there s always gonna be some nervous Republicans that think this is gonna be ultimately harmful to them and they ll be urging Trump to fix this. And so the conventional wisdom is that Trump will cave.But then, to hide the cave, to hide the fact that Trump has given in, he will declare a national emergency, go get money from somewhere to build a wall, at which point the Democrats will go to a friendly court and judge and shut him down like they do on everything, and then the wall will not get built. And Trump will let it die because he will consider himself to have succeeded in showing his base that he was willing to go to the mat, willing to do everything, including declare a national emergency, but look! The courts have shut us down again.That is what the Drive-By Media is suggesting is on tap. That is how the Drive-By Media are reporting. I guarantee you that they ve got input from Democrats and Republicans on this. This is how it s gonna end. That Chuck and Nancy will win because Trump will cave. To hide the cave, Trump will declare a national emergency. Trump s fans and his base will cheer loudly in support,  Way to go. Should have done this at first. Then here comes a friendly judge   find one in Hawaii again or American Samoa, wherever they have to go to find a judge to shut down Trump and his emergency, saying it s unconstitutional, he can t do it. And then that ll have to go to the Supreme Court to be overturned. It will take a number of months for that to happen. Meanwhile, nothing changes on the wall, but Trump will declare victory anyway, despite no wall being built after a national emergency. So just keep a sharp eye because that s what they re circulating here as the eventual end to this thing.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Paula in Salem, Missouri. Welcome. Great to have you here. How are you doing?CALLER: I m doing well. Thank you, Rush. Love ya. I appreciate your program so much for many, many years. I guess I m calling to ask for maybe a clarification of your opinion of what you believe, the conventional wisdom that you were talking about last hour, do you believe that the president will lose in the courts if he goes the national emergency route?RUSH: No. In all of that, I was not telling you what I think about anything. I was telling you what the media has established along with their pals in the Democrat Party as the conventional wisdom. And you can find out who they re spreading it to by reading various blogs. I picked this up on a couple of blogs. So when you find bloggers reporting what they think is gonna happen, you can bank on the fact that somebody s feeding them this.And what is being fed is   and this has to be coming from Democrats through the Drive-By Media, then it spreads from there   that eventually this is gonna end with Trump caving. In other words, there is going to be a bill signed that spends money that reopens the government that will not have a penny in it for the wall or border security. That Trump will then declare, or maybe before this all happens, but it ll happen very near to each other chronologically, that Trump will declare the national emergency and say he s going to start building the wall with money from various places in the federal budget.At which point the Democrats will go find a judge, they ll find a court and they will sue to stop Trump s declaration of an emergency on the grounds that he doesn t have the constitutional power to do it. That they will find a judge to agree with them because they found a judge in every single instance   the travel ban, the revised travel ban. Anything Trump has done, the Democrats have gone and found some commie left-wing judge to shut him down. And they think that what s gonna happen here is exactly what I just said.There will not be a penny from the Congress for the wall. Trump will then declare emergency and declare victory. He said that he will win. And they say he s setting the stage for it already by saying it s very likely he s going to be declaring a national emergency. The point they re making is that Pelosi and Schumer are gonna win. They re not gonna cave. And Trump s gonna have no choice, he will not get a negotiated deal, he will not be able to show that he can negotiate with Chuck and Nancy, no Art of the Deal claim for him. They ll shut him down and shut him out.So he ll declare an emergency, he ll claim victory at that point, claiming that he s gonna do what Chuck and Nancy don t want him to do, and then they re gonna go get a judge to shut it all down. None of this is me. I m telling you what is being spread around by obvious Democrats and friends in the media as predictions for how this is all gonna end.CALLER: Well, I think it could go that way, except that I see it as a win for him. That s just how I see it. I guess they see it as a false victory or   because Nancy and Chuck held the line, that s a victory for them. But as long as we get that wall, I honestly think the president wins.RUSH: No, wait.CALLER: I would never interpret that as a loss.RUSH: Wait. In this scenario, he doesn t get the wall because his declaration of emergency is declared unconstitutional, and therefore the money is not permitted to be spent by a judge that the Democrats go find. And that will require Trump and his team to then challenge that judge in the appellate system, which would then, as did the travel ban, go all the way to the Supreme Court, if the Supreme Court decides to hear it. The point is it would delay any work on a wall for months.CALLER: I agree. It would. I think this scenario is very possible. I really do. But I don t believe   I read Turley s piece the other day or day before  RUSH: Quickly.CALLER:   and I think that he s right, that the president will win. Not only does he have the right to declare the national emergency  RUSH: Wait. Okay. Look. I m sorry. I ve gotta take a break. I just don t have time. I ll clean this up when we get back.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, let me  I get real frustrated when I fail to communicate. So I m gonna give this a third shot here. Now, with our last caller she said,  Well, I agree with all that, but I read Turley, and Turley said the president can build a wall   can declare an emergency and use the money   that it s legal.  I m not saying that he can t. All I m telling you is what I think, based on a couple things I ve read  Look, I could be wrong, but I don t think so.Look, folks, I know where to go to find out who s telling who what, and I know where to go to find out a bunch of snark about Trump. I know where to go to find out people that hate Trump and think that he s headed for another imminent defeat, when he isn t. So I go there. I go there to keep up. I go there to try to stay ahead of what I think is gonna be the next seminal attack on Trump. So here it is again.This is not my opinion of what s going to happen. This is my opinion of what s gonna be reported as having happened. This, in fact, is what I think is really nothing more than the Democrats  strategy. It is this. Chuck and Nancy will hold out forever. They will not authorize a penny. They will never do a deal with Trump. They will never how Trump to say he did a deal with them. They will never allow Trump to say he beat them in a deal.They will never allow Trump to call back on The Art of the Deal, what a great negotiator he is, that he knew if he just hung tough that Chuck and Nancy would cave. That s the last thing Chuck and Nancy are ever going to allow, even if it means the GDP of the country losing half its value. They re never gonna do it! So what will be the solution? At some point Trump is going to realize this, and this shutdown is going to have to end at some point.I don t know when. I m making no prediction on that. But the way it s going to end   according to this little prognostication in various media   is that Trump will agree to sign whatever it is that reopens the government and authorizes the expenditure of money, the continuing resolution, with not a penny for border security in it. At that point, Chuck and Nancy claim victory.They stared Trump down and Trump lost, and the media reports that! Forget what reality is here. I m telling you what they re all setting up, what they want to happen. The media will be able to report that Chuck and Nancy   the two morticians   they hung in there and they stared Trump down, and he s no great negotiator and he s no pillar of strength, none of this. It was easiest thing they ve ever done to beat Donald Trump.This is gonna be what s in the media.Trump then will declare the national emergency and claim that he s gonna build a wall anyway, to hell with Chuck and Nancy, that he didn t lose, because he was always gonna do this as a last resort. In fact, he s already talking about it. He s making it sound imminent that he s going to declare a national emergency. Just yesterday afternoon he was talking about it. So what happens when he declares the national emergency and goes and gets the money from elsewhere in the federal budget to build the wall?Chuck and Nancy and the Democrats and the media go find a judge, and they sue to stop Trump s declaration of a national emergency claiming that there isn t one and that he has no constitutional authority to do any of this since the Congress hasn t authorized it and that they will find the judge who says,  Yep! That s exactly right. I love the Democrats; I hate Trump,  and stop Trump from building the wall.At that point, the Trump administration would then have to go back to court like they ve had to do at every one of these things   the travel ban, the travel ban revision. There have been three or four of these things. Trump ends up winning them all, but it takes nine months, eight months to do. Now, none of this is to say that the judge is right. I m not saying that Trump can t do this. I m telling you what I have detected is going to happen.I think I know what the Democrat strategy here is.When I say Democrat strategy, it s media strategy as well. Now, Jonathan Turley can write all he wants and anybody else, too, about how,  Well, Trump has the authority.  There are already national emergencies that are still in existence that have been declared since FDR, since Harry Truman. And that s true. There s no question that Trump can declare a national emergency.There s no question that Trump can go get money from the defense department or anywhere else to build a wall. No question about it. That s not what I m saying. I m saying the Democrats are gonna do everything they can to stop that, including going to court and finding a judge to issue an injunction against Trump building the wall and getting money to do it by declaring an emergency.Now, when this happens, you had better be prepared for the media to be nonstop, 24/7 with stories about how Chuck and Nancy outlasted and outsmarted Trump and Trump had no recourse but than to declare a national emergency but not anybody with a brain really thinks there s an emergency. It was the last gasp, last-ditch effort and a sensible federal judge thankfully had the foresight to stop the president once again from his This is what s gonna be in the news. Now, the way Trump reacts and deals with this? I haven t gone far enough to predict that. But in telling you, I m just trying to give you a heads-up on what s coming media-wise. I m not predicting what the outcome of all this is gonna be. What I ve just portrayed for you is the dream case scenario for the media and the Democrats, because I m telling you right now, they are dug in. They re not gonna give in. They don t think Trump has any leverage on them.They don t think, folks, that they re gonna be hurt politically even if they are seen as responsible for constant flows of illegal aliens coming into the country and wreaking havoc and creating crime. They don t think it s gonna hurt  em. They don t think there s gonna be political fallout negative to them whatsoever, and they don t care. The only thing they care about is stopping Trump. The only thing that s guiding them is hatred for Trump.The only thing they care about is getting rid of Donald Trump, either via impeachment or making sure he s not reelected in 2020. Part and parcel of that is making sure he doesn t win diddly-squat when his job intersects theirs. Meaning when they have to negotiate things   legislation or things like the wall   they are not give him anything. They re not gonna do anything that will allow Trump to claim victory over them.Now, it doesn t mean Trump can t claim victory, and at some point I think if, you know, one of these scenarios where a federal judge is found to issue an injunction  I think the day is coming where Trump is gonna say (raspberry) to the judge. He s been patient with this stuff ever since the first day in office, the first week when they declared his travel ban unconstitutional, when it wasn t. Nothing that he s done has been unconstitutional, but they found federal judges   Democrats, Clinton appointees, Obama appointees   to shut it down, and it s their modus operandi.So I m just  This is not a comment on whether Trump can declare a national emergency legally. He can. It s not a comment on whether he can or cannot legally build the wall after declaring a national emergency. He can do all that. I m just telling you what the media and the Democrats are gonna do to try to stop it, while at the same time claiming that they shellacked Trump in the negotiations   and you ll know if this is true.It won t be very long, because there will be no way that Trump would declare a national emergency unless negotiations with the morticians have totally broken down   and I would say that they have. I mean, look what they tried yesterday. Trump goes up to meet  em, and they tell him pointblank,  I don t even know where you re here. We re not gonna give you anything! There s nothing to say. There will not be any money for wall. Pelosi says with gigantic eyes,  There will not be any money for a wall. So Trump gets up and leaves.  Okay, fine. He passes out some candy, gets up, and leaves. What did they tell the media?That Trump threw a childlike temper tantrum. And what did the media do, reported it. It s all over the place that Trump stormed out like a spoiled brat kid. He thought he was gonna go up and really take Chuck and Nancy for a tour around the table. He was gonna win the day and they sent him packing and crying like a stuck little kid. That s what they reported. Mike Pence in the room, Kevin McCarthy in the room. Didn t happen. This didn t happen. Doesn t matter, New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, all saying that it did.Now, for me I think Trump is gonna end up skunking these people before all is said and done, and I think what they re doing is gonna come back and bite  em big, because they do not have a majority of the American people with them on this position. And the more people to whom this is explained properly, the more people are gonna abandon the Democrat position. Pretty much the people that support the Democrats on this are doing this for one reason, one reason only, they also hate Trump.This is not even about the issue. It s not about the money. It s not about the issue. It s not about the border. It s not about security. It s they hate Trump.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay, here s a deal. Here is a deal being bandied about, and apparently there are six Republican senators behind this deal and if what I m hearing is correct, they ve gone to Jared Kushner with this, and they re trying to get this to Trump.Here s the deal. And it may be Kushner s for all I know. I m not sure where this started and who s talking to who. But the details are Trump would get $5.7 billion for the wall, but there would be no asylum reform, there would be no E-Verify. We would not expand available detention space for people demanding asylum. There would be no end to sanctuary cities or states.In exchange, there would be amnesty for the DREAMers and amnesty for TPS immigrants, H2B. So Trump would get $5.7 billion for the wall and give up amnesty for DREAMers and more H2B visas, but there would be no reform and asylum applications and grants. There would be no end to sanctuary cities. Basically Trump gets the wall and has to give amnesty to DREAMers.I don t think this is new. I think this has been floating around for a long time. Chuck and Nancy are wedded to 0.0 for the wall, i.e., no wall. But some Republican senators are trying to come with a solution. Now, here s Trump this afternoon in McAllen, Texas. Listen to this.THE PRESIDENT: I even hear certain members of Congress, the Democrats are saying we better get this thing going, this isn t working out too well for us because nobody s gonna win the battle of strong borders and no crime as opposed to open borders and crime doesn t matter,  cause that s what they re saying, crime doesn t matter.RUSH: It sounds like he s not hip to any of these deals here that are being bandied about. Sounds like he s in this for the long game.  " 
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2019/01/11/running-through-national-emergency-scenarios/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Jan 11, 2019RUSH: Jim in San Francisco. Jim, great to have you. How are you doing, sir?CALLER: Hey, really good, Rush. Happy birthday from your only fan out here in San Francisco.RUSH: No, no, no, no, no. We have many more. I mean, I m not trying to diminish you, but our audience ratings out there are quite high. There s a lot of hidden   yeah, you re not alone out there.CALLER: I am unbound and I am not diminished in San Francisco. So but, anyway, Rush, what I wanted to point out was going back to the beginning of the show when we were talking about national emergencies and Republicans. I just think that we need to fight like warriors, you know, cynical warriors, like the Democrats do. And I was gonna give two ideas, and I hope anybody from the administration or anybody that has access to the administration passes these two ideas up the flagpole, but here we go. So idea one is, we know as sure as the sun shines that if Trump declares a national emergency, that an injunction will be issued by the Ninth Circuit out in the western states. And why the Ninth Circuit? Because they re reliably liberal judges, and  RUSH: Well, no, no. It can t first go to the Ninth Circuit. They re an appellate court. They ll have to find   we discussed this earlier in the week. I m gonna have to hold you through the break because it s coming up here. They ll find a federal judge somewhere Hawaii or Washington or Oregon that will declare an injunction.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  Okay back now to Jim in San Francisco.  So, Jim, what they d do is they d find a federal judge and he would issue a stay or an injunction.CALLER: Right, right. Yes, yes.RUSH: The Trump administration would appeal it and they ll find a judge where the appeal would be to the Ninth Circus. So they would be the second court to get it.CALLER:  Rush? Rush, let me continue.  The reason why it s always the Ninth Circuit is because Republicans always sit around with thumbs up their noses waiting for a liberal to file it in the Ninth Circuit.  What I suggest is that what we do is that we know that Trump s gonna do this, that literally one second after he declares a national emergency, we file for an injunction in the 5th, the 8th, or 11th Districts and let them take it because you can t have all these different districts fighting the same battle.  Whoever comes first  In this case would be the 5th down in Texas would be hearing the case and when the 9th District starts stamping like Rumpelstiltskin saying,  We want it! We want it!  they re gonna have to defer to the federal district court in Texas that took it up first.RUSH:  Okay let me just see if I understand what you re saying.  The second that Trump   and this is all coordinated.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: So Trump declares the emergency.  A Trump ally files a stay of execution, an injunction in what you think is a friendly circuit.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: So the federal judge will still issue a stay, an injunction against Trump s order that will then be appealed to what you think is a friendly circuit court that will overturn the injunction and the emergency will be on?CALLER:  Yes.  You end-run the liberals.  You end-run them by getting ahead of them in a more friendly court.  Okay, let me give you my second idea and that s this.  A national emergency allows the president to use different pots of money to pay for, in this case, a wall.  What I suggest that the administration do when they declare a national emergency, along with building the wall is to pay for all the federal workers right now. Float them loans, give them their normal paychecks, and let the Democrats argue against why that shouldn t happen.RUSH:  Well, now you got me caught up here in trying to analyze this whether or not it is legal for the president to include in the money that he s going to allocate for the national emergency   i.e., the building the wall   that he s then gonna take some additional money and repay furloughed federal employees.  I don t know that that would qualify as   that federal employees not being paid over a pay period or two would qualify as   a national emergency.Still, your ideas the Democrats would try to get that stopped (chuckles), which would put them on the side of making sure federal workers remain payless.  I like it overall.  The thing is, it s just risky.  You think certain appellate districts would be friendly. But there are liberal judges everywhere on every one of these circuit courts or these appellate courts.  You never know what three judges you re gonna get to start out with   and then if you lose with that three-judge panel, then you can request en banc, which means the entire bunch of  em on the court.It s a risky strategy for the Republicans to try to be the first to declare the state of emergency unconstitutional. (chuckling) But I understand your thinking.  You want to beat the Democrats to the punch and make sure that they don t get to use their friendly courts, and I like that. If some mechanism could be found    Cause that is the pattern, and everybody knows that it s gonna happen.  In fact, there s  Let me find it. Yeah.  Here s a story from TheHill.com.  It s exactly about this.  Get this headline: Democrats Warm to Idea of Emergency Declaration to Reopen Government.   This is from TheHill.com.  I should add that Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina just tweeted that he had met with the president, and it is without doubt   there is no question   that the Democrats hate Donald Trump and are never, ever gonna agree to anything that he wants for whatever reason, no matter what harm comes to them.  That their sole agenda is to destroy Donald Trump, to do everything they can to see to it that he doesn t get reelected in 2020   and, even better, maybe get impeached!There is literally no way.  Graham is saying there s no way.  The only thing, therefore   Senator Graham is saying   is for Trump to declare the emergency now, that there is no point in waiting because the Democrats are never gonna talk. They re never gonna agree. They re never gonna budge. They re never gonna do anything.  Now, Trump is on record as saying he would prefer this get solved in a bipartisan way.  He s also acknowledged that it s pretty likely that he ll be declaring the national emergency.If I m Trump   and this is not a comment on anybody. If I m Trump, I m gonna be very careful about listening to a bunch of different voices advocating things, because if I m Donald Trump, I ve gotta make sure that some of these voices are not trying to sabotage me into doing things that are gonna end up making what I want to accomplish here (i.e., get the wall and get border security) impossible.  So I don t think  It s not a legal question.  He clearly has the constitutional authority and legislative authority.The congress has passed the National Emergencies Act in 1976.  There s no way he can t do this.  But that doesn t mean they re not gonna try to stop him in the courts.  Declaring a national emergency, Senator Graham says, is the only way that this is gonna get done. So now the Democrats are warming to the idea of this.  Why?  Before we get to that, I mentioned earlier that there are cracks in the Democrat coalition even now, that more and more Democrats are beginning to acknowledge the need for fencing and areas where a wall would be built.Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat, Oregon:  Some fencing has uses.  Some barriers are useful.   Representative Cheri Bustos, Democrat, Illinois:  If we have a partial wall, if we have fence, if we have technology used to keep our border safe, all of that s fine.   Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat, New York:  There are areas along the border where there are currently fences that are put up or barriers that are put up that need to be enhanced. Senator Ben Cardin, Democrat, Maryland:   Certainly you need barriers, and we support barriers.   Senator John Sarbanes, Democrat, Maryland:  Certain physical barriers can make sense along the border, and a lot of places you already have that.   Representative Katherine Clark, Democrat, Massachusetts:  I think there are parts of border that would benefit from repairing fencing and other barricades that already exist there.  So let s see. One two..three..four..five  six Democrats now are acknowledging the usefulness and need for a wall.  So it s not total unity on the Democrat side.And a lot of Democrats that won in November did so in Trump districts. There are people in those districts that voted for Trump who still want Trump to succeed even though they may have voted for a Democrat in the House race. So now the back to the Hill story.  Democrats Warm to Idea of Emergency Declaration to Reopen Government. Now, it says here:  The supportive Democrats are quick to emphasize they don t believe the president has the legal authority to declare such an emergency, predicting the maneuver would quickly lead to lawsuits that they themselves would support.  A-ha! So the Hill gives up the game. They want the president to declare an emergency  cause they don t think he can and they want him shut down in the courts.I mentioned this is a rumor floating around yesterday. Democrats want Trump to go the emergency route, knowing it s gonna be blocked by a judge. Once that happens the legal process begins to go the speed of a turtle. And this thing could take longer than the remainder of Trump s presidential term in office.I ve even heard   you want to hear the next rumor? You re not gonna like this one. I ve heard it speculated that Trump really doesn t care. He just wants to keep his base happy, so he will declare a national emergency, and if the Democrats stop him in court, no big deal, he has fulfilled his promise, he did everything he could. If the Democrats then stand in the way and a bunch of judges, well, he did his best.There s so much poisonous stuff out there that you have to weed through. They re doing everything they can to try to convince Trump voters that they re wasting their time supporting him. And in this instance, they re trying to tell Trump voters that they re being fooled, that Trump doesn t really care about this. Look at the Maggie Haberman leak. Trump didn t even want to do the national address.And then the next leak, Trump didn t even want to go to the border. He didn t think any of it was gonna make a difference, but his staff made him do it, so he did it, but he didn t want to do it. Now they re saying, Trump doesn t even really care. He ll declare emergency status and then he knows the courts will shut it down and that ll be that. And he can say he kept his promise. So keep a sharp eye  cause there s all kinds of stuff lurking around out there, effervescing up, designed to get you to question your support for Trump.And now the time is marching on.  "
