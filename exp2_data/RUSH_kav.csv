She had to wait ’til the segment ended to ask me. She said, “Look, Kanye says ‘balls.’ Do you…?” I said, “Yeah, leave it in. Let her rip!” Not gonna edit that stuff out. So we have that, we have that coming up.RUSH: Judge Kavanaugh — Justice Kavanaugh — is already outraging the left. Los Angeles Times headline: “Kavanaugh Backs Trump Administration on Jailing and Deporting Immigrants for Crimes Committed Years Earlier.” They’re so ticked off! Kavanaugh is already doing Trump’s bidding! Trump is already making Kavanaugh be mean to sweet, little illegal alien gifts of love who just happen to have criminal convictions. This is the ACLU. “The ACLU is claiming the law that mandates all illegal aliens who commit crimes be deported be limited to one day after they’re released from jail. (laughing)Kavanaugh says, “Screw that!”I just… There’s this thing: Sweet justice.“Kavanaugh Backs Trump Administration on Jailing and Deporting” Criminals! and, “Justice Kavanaugh Unlikely to Heed Calls for Recusal.” The left is demanding Kavanaugh recuse himself from everything because of the Blasey Ford situation and his sordid past, his drunkardness, his sexual abuse, all these… (laughing) It is desperation, when you get right down to it. And that goes with people who are suffering from psychological disorders and anxiety. I mean, take a what? Take a squirrel on an airplane as your emotional support animal?  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/09/cnn-poll-trump-approval-spikes-after-kavanaugh-fight/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 9, 2018RUSH: CNN is not happy. They have a poll out showing Trump’s approval ratings have spiked and gone up at the conclusion of the Kavanaugh confirmation fight. Not cool. Also, independents disapprove of the Democrats’ handling of the Kavanaugh nomination by a 28-point margin in the CNN poll. That’s not how it was supposed to be. That’s not what people were supposed to conclude. People were supposed to conclude that Kavanaugh is unfit!That Kavanaugh has no business being a judge anywhere, much less the Supreme Court! That Kavanaugh needs to be destroyed, justifiably so! That’s what people were supposed to realize, and that’s what midterm voters were supposed to agree to: To punish anybody who would try to foist a despicable miscreant like Kavanaugh on the country. But it didn’t work out that way. More on this, of course, but let’s go to the phones. We’ll start in the nation’s capital, Washington, D.C. This is Sandy. I’m glad you called. Hi.CALLER: I am so pleased to talk to you, Rush. Thanks for taking my call. I watched the president and Nikki Haley this morning. I think Nikki Haley did tell the president a few months ago of her plans. I think today was deliberate on the heels of Kavanaugh. I think he’s got somebody in mind. He’s gonna announce that person before the election, and what are the Drive-Bys and the Democrats gonna do? They’re gonna start fighting. “Oh, we can’t have this person. Oh, this is terrible. Da-da-da,” and then what’s gonna happen with the election? People are gonna say, “It’s not gonna stop.” We can’t allow the Democrats back in, hopefully.RUSH: It isn’t going to stop whether the Democrats win or lose. This is the point. You’re right, but it isn’t ever going to stop until these people are so soundly defeated and become such a very small group of people… Even then, they’re not gonna stop. The Kavanaugh thing is not the end of anything. The Kavanaugh thing — as far as most people are concerned — the way you need to look at it is this is the beginning. This is the beginning of the way it’s gonna be for as long as we allow it to be done to us.CALLER: That’s right.RUSH: And, you’re right. They’re gonna try to poke holes into whoever Trump’s nominee for U.N. ambassador is. I haven’t heard any names. I haven’t played close enough attention to know who the names being bandied about might be. But they’re gonna do it on principle. They’re gonna do it because they think it’ll be a political advantage headed into the midterms, showing once again that the world, the country doesn’t think Trump is justified and qualified to be naming anybody to this position.“He doesn’t deserve to be president. We need to get rid of him!” This is the whole foundation for which they’re gonna behave anyway. The question is, does this hurt them or help them? And not with their base. I mean, we know their base is driving this. But with others, as all this never-ending obstruction and personal destruction of nominee after nominee after nominee. We’ll see. I appreciate the call, Sandy. You talk about being outnumbered: One of us living in Washington, the 10% of the population that’s not Democrat.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Morgan Stanley says that belief in American exceptionalism has never been higher among international investors.

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/09/kavanaugh-swearing-in-ceremony-demonstrated-donald-trumps-irreplaceable-value/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 9, 2018RUSH: There was quite an event at the White House last night — the ceremonial swearing-in of Judge Kavanaugh — and, once again, last night, Donald Trump demonstrated his irreplaceable value. He demonstrated why he is a champion to the majority of people in this country. He violated another set of no-no’s. He did something you’re not supposed to do in a ceremony like this at the White House.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Last night the ceremonial swearing-in Brett Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court was there, including Ruth “Buzzi” Ginsburg, who… Well, never mind. (interruption) Yeah, she was awake. You know, she’s admitted that she shows up at States of the Union speeches having consumed a little wine to get through the night. It’s why she is seen falling asleep. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with that. Elena Kagan was there, the Harvard Law School dean, who way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard.Elena Kagan, who now says, “I don’t think he should be on the court. I — I’m not sure that this is going to do the court any good.” Justice Thomas was there. A whole bunch of people. Anthony Kennedy, who Kavanaugh’s replacing. Here is the president of the United States. We’re starting here at audio sound bite No. 7. He is apologizing to Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation.THE PRESIDENT: I would like to begin tonight’s proceeding differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude. On behalf of our nation, I want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure. Those who stepped step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation, not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception.RUSH: Just calling them out! Trump is right: This is not done. Normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing-in, you follow the script and all of that is in the past. It’s not to be referenced again. The fight is over; everybody acknowledges that the result is the result and we’re moving forward. Except that’s not the way it is anymore! The Democrats are not stopping. The fight’s not over to them. The Democrats are openly promising to impeach Kavanaugh. They’re openly promising to continue to investigate Kavanaugh.They are openly talking about the packing the court if they win the House of Representatives, to the power Kavanaugh has as the fifth so-called conservative justice on the court. They’re not pulling back at all. This isn’t anywhere over, and so Trump is calling them out. And I’m telling you, folks, this is crucial. I can’t think of any former president that would ever do anything like this. In defense of his nominee, in defense of his principles, I can’t think of one who would do it.It’s just as important that Trump do this as it was important when Trump, at a rally, explained to the American people what the American media had not told them, when he recited the essence of her testimony. When the Drive-Bys said that he was mocking Dr. Blasey Ford, he wasn’t mocking. He was simply informing the American people what the media was holding from them: She couldn’t tell anybody where it happened! She couldn’t tell them when it happened; she wasn’t sure where the house was.She didn’t know how she got home and she didn’t know who took her, and she didn’t know what she said after the event, that the only thing she remembered is that she had one beer — that the four people she said were there in the house all denied it. The press had told nobody that. The American people that only consume what we call mainstream media had no idea of all of these holes in her testimony until Donald Trump told everybody at his rally, and he was doing the same thing with the same principle in this apology last night at the White House.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, folks, a little heads-up here. I’m going to continue today my attempt at explaining the divide that exists in the country, specifically by explaining just who the left is, what they’ve become, what we’re up against. To me, it is the seminal issue that we all face. We’re talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it. I mean, America’s always gonna be here; don’t misunderstand. But this country surviving as founded.We are under assault; it has never been worse.Maybe the Civil War, but those were different circumstances. That was a specific argument about cultural things regarding slavery that, in the end, nobody of any reasoned attitude could ever support. We find ourselves here in a multilayered, multifaceted, all-out assault on the entire concept of America as founded. Some people sense it. Some people are not aware of it. And I’ve just sort of evolved here into a position where I feel compelled to try to explain this, sound some warning bells and maybe present some solutions.I have to be very careful I don’t overdo this. I don’t want to… You know me, I’m the nation’s No. 1 natural optimist, and I don’t want to sound overly pessimistic. But at the same time I’m still searching for the best way, the perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats that we face are. So that’s coming up as the program unfolds. Back, however, to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president.First off, apologizing to the nation, apologizing to Kavanaugh on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him, for what happened to him! And the Kavanaugh episode codifies exactly what I think we are up against. And it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding. We’re not in a battle of ideas. The left is not interested in our ideas. We’re battling people who do not want us to exist. They have no desire to coexist with us.They have no desire for the ongoing political arguments over the best way to do things for a majority of people. That’s not their interest. Their interest is the elimination of opposition, however it can happen. They have no limits on how low they will go, on how depraved and perverted they will be in seeking their reality. It all, I am convinced, started on American college campus… Well, tracing where it started, I mean, go back to the twenties and Soviet influence, communist influence.But for the purposes of my being able to explain this, the most recent starting point would be the most compelling, and I think best way to get people’s attention with it. Because most people’s historical perspective begins with the day they were born. So ancient history is… If they’ve not been taught it, they don’t know it. So the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems, the more effective persuasion will be. It’s always been my feeling on this, my thought.But they don’t… Folks, we are not legitimate in their eyes. Our ideas are not legitimate; our existence is not legitimate, and not even worthy of discussing or acknowledgment. In fact, they don’t even look at the United States the way we do. They don’t accept the founding of the country, the principles in our founding documents. They accept none of that. None of that is relevant. All of that is part of the discrimination that was founded as part of this country, as far as they’re concerned.And it was all on display in the Kavanaugh hearings, everything that we are up against. The absence of presumption of innocence? Kavanaugh was guilty because he’s a conservative. Kavanaugh was guilty, not because they had any evidence. Kavanaugh was guilty because, in their minds, he’s got no business being a judge! And he’s got no business being a judge because he’s not one of them. It’s no more complicated than that. How they get rid of him? That’s another story.But his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he’s not on their team, that he’s not one of them. So anything that can get rid of him and derail him, in their world, is entirely not just permissible, but it’s required. If you have to deny him the presumption of innocence, then that’s what we’ll do. If you bring forward a woman who can’t prove what she says but is believable saying it, then that’s fine; that’s what we’ll do.If it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for months coming up with this, then that’s what we’ll do. It has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn’t them and he, therefore, doesn’t deserve to be on the Supreme Court. The rest of it — the histrionics, the childlike wailing and immaturity — is the result of the liberal-socialist mind-set. People, young people, immature children that don’t get their way are already suffering psychological disorders of one kind or another.Like the video. That video of these kids on Saturday afternoon literally clawing at the doors of the Supreme Court to get in, to try to stop the real swearing in! They were literally clawing at the doors! There wasn’t any humanity in this. This was just raw hatred and fear coupled with massive psych disorders. All of it promoted, not denounced — all of it promoted and encouraged — by the powers that be in the media and the Democrat Party and the citadels of the left. As I’ve been saying, what do decent people do in response to this?Decent people, we’re not gonna become them. They have, as an objective, ruination and total human destruction of their opponents. That’s us. Do not doubt me on this. That may sound a little extreme to those of you that are here on the periphery. Do not doubt me. That is their objective: total destruction and ruination. Well, how do we fight that? Decent people are not gonna try to ruin their political opponents. They’re gonna try to beat them. But we’re not gonna become who they are.We don’t have it in us to become who they are. So, given that, how are they stopped? It’s a serious question. If they are willing to do anything, including de facto career and life political murder to stop things they don’t want, to stop people that they don’t want, how do you oppose them? How do you beat that back? Do you do it with decency? Do you do it with politeness? Do you do it with manners? Sorry, it isn’t gonna cut it.Sorry, Never Trumpers, but the right manners and comportment and so forth isn’t going to cut it. Some people might say, “Rush, the church. The church is rock solid. The church is where enduring values live.” Not anymore. The churches are like every other institution, sucking up to the people they think hold power. Everybody needs money. Churches need money. All kinds of people need money. And if the people who are gonna give you money demand you be a certain way and be open to certain things, then you’re gonna do it!This is happening.Take a look at Il Papa and what’s even happening to the Catholic Church in places. We have a serious, serious problem when talking about the preservation of what I call our way of life underneath the umbrella of decency. So we’re very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against it from the highest levels of power in the country. Donald Trump fearlessly pushes back on it, calls them out, identifies them. They’re not used to this. They don’t know how to react to it.The media is the greatest illustration of that, not knowing how to react to be called out for what they really are. I mean, everybody’s accused the media of being biased over the years. But nobody accuses them of fake, making it up, participating in the open and wanton ruination of people. Nobody ever accuses them of that. I mean, we may here. But at the highest levels of government, it’s never happened before. There’s Donald Trump doing it — and from the East Room of the White House!Here is more Trump last night. This really triggered ’em, when he declared Kavanaugh innocent…THE PRESIDENT: What happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness, decency, and due process. In our country, a man or a woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.CROWD: (applause)THE PRESIDENT: And with that, I must state that you, sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent. Thank you.RUSH: Oh, did that…? That ripped ’em a new one right there. That just… That ha to —THE PRESIDENT: Margaret and Liza, your father is a great man. He’s a man of decency, character, kindness, and courage who has devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens.RUSH: You know what that is? I’m sorry, Never Trumpers, but that’s just pure class. To take the time to look at those two little girls and tell him that their father is a great man? In the midst of all of this, the president of the United States taking time out to tell those two young daughters of Brett and Ashley Kavanaugh that your father is a great man? Every father wants to hear that. Every father loves having his children told that he’s a great man. Few ever are afforded that opportunity, but Trump did it last night.Then proclaiming Kavanaugh’s innocence. I mean, that is akin to taking all the poison arrows that every Democrat launched at Kavanaugh the past two weeks and firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat senator on the Judiciary Committee and every member of the media that tried to ruin Kavanaugh. To openly proclaim him innocent! “He can’t do that! That wasn’t a court of law. He can’t know.” But they had him guilty, did they?He was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation. I want to say one more time: I don’t believe anything that we went through the past two weeks, starting with the realization that Christine Blasey Ford had written a letter to Dianne Feinstein. I don’t think any of it was spontaneous and I don’t think any of it was happenstance. I think every bit of was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October Surprise in politics is. I think the Democrats were in on it.I don’t know whether Blasey Ford’s privacy was violated. I don’t know if she was in on it or if she was also a stooge. But somebody suggested she write that letter: Monica McLean, her buddy, who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara (who hates Trump, the SDNY United States attorney), as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump-Russia collusion. I don’t think they ever expected it to get as far as it did.They thought Trump would pull back, withdraw the nomination or that Kavanaugh would pull out, and they would never get as far as it got. It was clearly illustrated she had no evidence, no corroboration, no nothing. In their strategizing of this event, they never thought it would go that far. One of the reasons is they’re used to Republican presidents caving. A Nominee gets in big trouble? Pull the nomination. Presidents don’t want the grief.It starts to reflect poorly on them, so they go to the nominee. “Look… (big sigh) It won’t work, Nominee. We can’t sustain this. You gotta pull out.” The nominee says, “Ah, damn! It’s my one chance!” “Sorry, Nominee, I’m pulling support.” The nominee and the president get together for the good of the country, blah, blah, blah, and the nominee pulls out. It didn’t happen here. Trump refused to pull out, withdraw; ditto Kavanaugh. That’s where they gummed up the works.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/08/kavanaugh-weekend-deranged-democrats-on-full-display-for-america-to-see/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 8, 2018RUSH: Hey, how is everybody? Everybody doing okay out there? What a great weekend, eh? Everybody go out there and celebrate by having a beer in Justice Kavanaugh’s honor? I certainly hope so. (interruption) No, no, no. Not in a Solo Cup but right out of the can or right out of the bottle. You don’t pour beer in a Solo Cup.Greetings, my friends, and welcome. Here we are ready, willing, and able to kick off yet another brand-new week of broadcast excellence. Our telephone number, if you want to be on the program, 800-282-2882.What do you bet after this brouhaha…? This vote ended up being 50-48. What do you bet after all of this brouhaha, after all the angst, after all the character and life assassination the Democrats tried on Kavanaugh, what do you bet that the vote would have turned out exactly the same regardless what the Democrats did? The Democrats didn’t sway one vote. They gave it everything they had but they did not sway one vote.Murkowski even at the end of the day ended up canceling out her “no” vote by pairing her “present” with Senator Daines who couldn’t be there because of his daughter’s marriage. I mean, all of this — and the vote was not — I could make the case that the vote would have been probably the same. It would have been along party lines, and none of that had any effect on the outcome. But it did have an impact on much else. And, as we get into the program today, gonna be examining some impacts of the activities of the Democrats.I’m a little conflicted about this because I’m not sure — I’m pretty sure but I’m not quite sure of something. I’ve got a tweet here that got me started thinking about this. I have a tweet from our old buddy Nate Silver, and wouldn’t you know it? I’ve put it out of order from where I… He makes the point here… Here it is: “The football-spiking after Kavanaugh was confirmed this weekend was one such example. There’s always *some* of that after a big policy/electoral win, but there’s also usually a fair amount of magnanimity and reaching out to the losing side. Not so this time.”This tweet of Nate Silver’s is totally absent… It ignores the infantile screaming. Did any of you watch the vote on Saturday? Did you hear the infantile, baby-like shouting and screaming from those women up in the gallery? J. Christian Adams has written about it and has expressed it almost exactly as I would say it. I mean, this was just guttural immaturity, scary psychological disorder. I mean, it was embarrassing; it was frightening in the sense that that’s who the base of the Democrat Party is. And I really wonder…There’s a part of me that wonders — and it’s a very small part. I wonder if the Democrats at large ignore that and do not think that that behavior is tied to them. They don’t do anything to stop it. And, in fact, they encourage it! Maxine Waters is out there encouraging it. Mazie Hirono is out there. Did you hear what Mazie Hirono said? Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes and forcing them out because they’re white racists.They’re white supremacists. They’re totally, totally justified. So there’s a part of me that knows the Democrats are promoting this. There’s another part who thinks some Democrats do not think that this deranged psychological upset is tied to them. Let me put it this way. If we had people on our side behaving like this, it would worry me to death. It would worry me to death that voters are gonna think that conservatism is made up of deranged lunatics like this! The Democrats don’t seem to be concerned about that at all.Some of them, like Nate Silver here, don’t even think that that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats. And I wonder if that’s true, and if it is true, how can they be so obtuse? If it isn’t true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it, then the question becomes this: When you get into turnout for the November elections and the midterms… By the way, you know what people are now saying, Mr. Snerdley?The Democrats, some of the people on TV are saying, “Well, I don’t think that we know yet what issues are ignore turn the vote in November.” (chuckles) I wonder where they heard that? I wonder where they heard that idea. Well, we don’t actually know the issues that are gonna turn the turnout of the election yet. We have still a month to go before the election. It is an interesting question, though. Will any of the passion fade away on either or both sides of this?On the Democrat side, it’s not gonna fade away, and I think everybody needs to know this. On the Democrat side, this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today’s Democrat Party and the American left. You have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of 2016. They have been mad, insane, crazy, percolating, compounding, compressing all of this ever since then. They have been loaded for bear ever since Election Day and the day after, 2016.Then this Kavanaugh situation comes up. And I don’t think, on the Democrat side, they can get any more hysterical. And I don’t think they can get any more motivated than they are. I think they are at their peak right now. I mean, they’re still talking about investigating Kavanaugh further. Pelosi wants to see the FBI documents released. She wants a full-fledged investigation of Kavanaugh. The Democrats are talking about Jerrold Nadler — the House Judiciary Committee ranking member of the Democrats — promising if the Democrats win the House, that they’re gonna impeach Kavanaugh, gonna investigate him, get him thrown off the court.They’re not gonna let this subside. This Kavanaugh thing is not over, and they’re gonna continue to rile their side up and motivate them and courage them to continue engaging in what you and I would call this massive civil disobedience, also it’s more than that. It’s genuine childlike… It’s not even childlike. We’re dealing with a complete emotional breakdown and a group of people… I don’t care whether they’re paid or not, folks. I don’t want to fall back on that to suggest that this anger they feel is not legitimate.It’s legitimate, whether they’re being paid or not. I don’t think that means that the real enthusiasm of Democrat voters is less than what we think it is, just because some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff. I don’t think that they look would sit around and do nothing and twiddle their thumbs all weekend long if they weren’t being paid. I think the Democrat rage is real, and it’s been real since election night 2016. They thought they were gonna win; they thought they were gonna win in a landslide.They haven’t been able to come to grips with that. The Kavanaugh thing is just further evidence that elections have consequences. They sense themselves losing control and losing and losing, and they can’t deal with it. They simply cannot deal with it. And rather than do what’s necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning enterprise, they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it.Rather than do what’s necessary to reach a broad swath and majority of the American people — which they cannot do in their current makeup. Which is why I ask over and over if the Democrats at large, elected Democrats, really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them when these are mad, insane, disgusting Democrat protesters, they are identified with the Democrat Party. And I don’t know if some elected Democrats really get that. I could be all wet. They could totally get it, and they could be promoting it, which is probably closer to the truth than not.But for those that don’t get it, it amazes me that it is possible that these professional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative of the party at large. Here’s J. Christian Adams writing at PJ Media. “Kavanaugh Foes Fill Senate Gallery with Sounds of the Insane.” “If there was any doubt that the opposition to Kavanaugh was unhinged, uncivil, disruptive, rude, and borderline nuts, my experience in the gallery made it clear.” “I have visited…” This is Chris Adams writing.“I have visited hospitals for the seriously mentally ill, and the shrieks from this woman were as odd and unearthly as anything I ever heard inside a mental hospital. They echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery in decreasing but astonishing amplitude. Then the roll was called, and it sounded like the gates of hell opened up. Nearly a dozen women erupted in unison, shouting, howling, screaming, in an unrecognizable venomous wail. They wouldn’t stop. There was fury, rage, hate, poison in the noise.“It wasn’t prose. It wasn’t song. It was a swarming, shrill, swirling noise. … They were the sounds of irrational, unhinged, and unmoored lunatics. These were the people who opposed Kavanaugh’s nomination. They were an embarrassment to themselves,” and, he writes, “Pay attention, that’s what the Left sounds like.” Yeah, it is, and the Democrat Party doesn’t seem to the least bit concerned about it. The Democrat Party doesn’t seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it. The Democrat Party at large doesn’t seem to worry at all that this kind of discordant madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections.In fact, they may think the opposite. They may think that this is what’s going to further inspire more discordant madness, which will result in massive turnout. They believe it’s going to frighten Republicans into not confronting them and basically letting them have their way, because who wants to deal with lunatics and the insane face-to-face. But what it means to me is I don’t know that they can get more rabid. I don’t know that there’s anything else that can happen that get them more fired up than they are.Stephen Colbert has a writer on his staff. That show couldn’t occur without writers. I’m very proud to say here no writers on the Rush Limbaugh program. Every time I see this, I don’t care if it’s Carson… Carson had writers. Letterman had writers. The Daily Show had writers. A lot of them, 12 to 14 of the ’em out there. Every one of these late-night shows has writers. We don’t have any writers here. Now, granted, we don’t do monologue, stand-up jokes here, but we do delve into exquisite comedy and humor here frequently. But there aren’t any writers here.It’s just a professional thing with me. How much credit should these hosts get when they don’t even write most of their own material? And the people who do write are not ever supposed to be known. They’re supposed to dutifully, willingly be invisible, stand or sit in the background and never let it be said that they provide the material for the host of any of these late-night shows. Well, there are no producers here, and there are no writers here, and there are no segments here. There are no story boards. There’s no segment layout or any of that.This show just happens. But one of the writers on the Colbert show is named Ariel Dumas. (Maybe she pronounces it Dumas. Who knows?) One of her tweets — which was deleted but many people screenshotted it so that it survives. “Whatever happens,” she tweeted, “I’m just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh’s life.” “Whatever happens, I’m just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh’s life.” Never Trumpers were siding with these kind of people a year ago.We’ve reached a point where I think any assault or crime committed against a Republican by a Democrat should be investigated as a hate crime. I mean, this hate is visceral. It consumes them. It is dangerous bigotry. And the Democrats believe this is going to win elections. The Democrats think that this is gonna inspire turnout, that it’s going to inspire all kinds of enthusiasm. But what else might it be doing? There are a lot of people, folks, who are not immersed and absorbed daily in the ebb and flow of politics.And these people largely believe that Democrats are silent and quiet and reasonable and tolerant and carrying and compassionate and look out in the little guy, you know all the old cliches.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, I am reliably told that correct pronunciation of Stephen Colbert’s writer’s last name is “dumbass,” Ariel “Dumbass,” not “Doo-mahs,” and I’m sorry for getting it wrong. You know, her account included several other anti-Kavanaugh tweets. Quote, “Brett Kavanaugh 100% gonna ask Justice Sotomayor to fetch him coffee.” This was a Saturday tweet. I don’t think… Does she know how stupid these people are? Do you know that the freshman, the newly arrived justice does that? The newly arrived justice gets that kind of grunt duty.You would think that kind of thing wouldn’t exist on the Supreme Court, but it does. The newly arrived justice has to do all that kind of stuff. It’s part of the initiation, and it lasts for a while. Not until the next justice shows up, but it lasts for a while. But Sotomayor is not gonna be getting him his coffee and he’s not gonna be demanding it. In fact, he named his law clerks. Do you know he’s the only Supreme Court justice ever with four female law clerks? And of course do you think that is garnering him any credit with the left?No, it’s the exact opposite. They say, “Well, he wants easy pickings.” (interruption) Well, that is. That’s how they’re reacting to it. “He wants easy pickings. He’s not an idiot. We all know who Kavanaugh is! He abuses women, and he wants four of them right there nearby.” That’s how they’re reacting to that. Ariel Dumbass also criticized Kavanaugh for stroking his family in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. She wrote, “It’s not automatically a moral achievement to be a son, a husband, a dad. It’s biology. A legal decision and biology again. Plenty…”I can’t read what she says in a family show. And then she admitted she was emotionally shattered by the current state of affairs, which just proves the theory the Democrats are mentally disturbed people who project their mental problems onto the public, onto politics. It is exactly what is happening here. Do not underestimate that. And don’t think that I’m being flippant or exaggerational to make a point. I really do believe that we’re talking about mainstream mental and psychological disorders becoming standard operating procedure politics, the American left…There’s no other way to explain this. Now, folks, to show you how deranged this is, I have in the stack today, I have two, maybe three what I would call teachable moment things. They are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both today and over the weekend. They are related to Kavanaugh, but they… The pieces attempt to say what all of this means for America and, of course, for the Democrats. And much of it is just so dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this that it stuns me that people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and react to them!They continue to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel. And these are some of the standard-bearers of American journalism on the left. One of them is John Harris at Politico, one of the founders. “Democrats fear they are the wet rag party.” You know what this piece is about? This piece is about how the Democrats get their rear ends handed to ’em every time because the Democrats are a bunch of cowards. The Democrats have no guts. The Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers. The Democrats let Republicans walk all over ’em.Now, how many of you think it’s the exact opposite? This is pretty common too. There are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side is a bunch of wusses. But I don’t know how anybody paying attention on the left can think that their side’s a bunch of wusses, but the fact that they do is fascinating to me. Now, here’s another such piece. And we have cited this woman once before. I don’t remember specifically when. Her name is Alexis Grenell. She has “written on gender and politics for the New York Daily News, the Washington Post, and other outlets.”She had a piece on Saturday in the New York Times. It may have been actually published on Sunday and released on the Web on Saturday night. The date’s October 6th. Since I don’t read the paper anymore, I don’t know when this stuff actually shows up in the print edition. So my guess is this thing was released Saturday night on the Web to be published in the Sunday paper but it could have been in the Saturday paper as well. Doesn’t matter. “White Women, Come Get Your People.” I don’t even know where women whose thoughts are this convoluted… And you’re gonna hear.I don’t know where they come from.I don’t know who’s responsible for creating them, molding them. I think it’s gender studies. I think it’s a combination of feminism and gender studies that literally corrupt young minds. In fact there’s another lengthy piece today that describes a hoax, three self-described leftists ran on academe. In a nutshell, three academics, self-described left-wingers are doing a kind of Project Veritas-like expose of how left-wing journals accept crazy studies, as long as they contain the right buzzwords and support leftist doctrine.They’ve gotten journals of higher learning in applied disciplines of the academy to accept utter nonsense! One example of this is a feminist journal in academia accepted an anti-male rewrite of Mein Kampf. These hoaxters rewrote a 3,000-word essay of Mein Kampf and tooled it as anti-male, pro-woman feminism, and this journal accepted it! So basically they accepted a piece, an excerpt from Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf, “retooled” to have terms that would be buzzwords and knee-jerk reaction causes to them. And they ended up falling for it on the left, hook, line, and sinker.The reason why left-wingers are doing this is because they’re worried that the disciplines that they trust and believe in are being shattered by a bunch of absolute gobbledygook insanity. And so they have prepared a series of hoax essays and papers and presented for peer review to journals of higher learning in the academy. They’re obvious hoaxes to anybody who knows anything about the originals of the papers that serve as the basis. In this case, Mein Kampf.But this group of women accepted an essay right out of Mein Kampf with just a couple or three words or terms changed to make it look like it was an anti-male, pro-feminist piece. Utterly embarrassing. The details of this are long and detailed and in the weeds. But it is that kind of thinking that makes me wonder, or makes me realize, where people like Alexis Grenell come from. “White Women: Come Get Your People.” Let me give you just a sample pull quote to give you an idea what I’m talking about.“[W]hite women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their whiteness to monopolize resources for mutual gain. In return they’re placed on a pedestal to be ‘cherished and revered,’ as Speaker Paul D. Ryan has said about women, but all the while denied basic rights.” Does anybody have any idea what that is? Did that make any sense? When you heard me read that, did you go, “Oh, yeah! Yeah! Totally agree with that!” No. You’re shaking your head, saying, “What?” Let me read it again. “”[W]hite women benefit from patriarchy…”For those of you in Rio Linda, “patriarchy” means like where you live, women are subjugated by the men; men run your house, right? That’s what this means, patriarchy. “[W]hite women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their whiteness to monopolize resources for mutual gain.” In other words, they trade on their “whiteness” to find rich white guys to marry. They sell out the sisterhood, they sell themselves out, all to be placed on pedestals. But in doing so, they are denied basic rights by the patriarchy, and women who do this are sellouts and are not happy.So every one of you white women who’s married, loves your husband, loves your family, you’re a sellout. Now, this has roots traceable back to the origin of militant feminism in the late 60s. But then you have to stop and grab yourself and say she, Alexis Grenell, really believes this, and the New York Times must because they published it. “After a confirmation process where women all but slit their wrists, letting their stories of sexual trauma run like rivers of blood through the Capitol, the Senate still voted to confirm Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.“With the exception of Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, all the women in the Republican conference caved, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who held out until the bitter end.” (Repeating) “[W]omen all but slit their wrists, letting their stories of sexual trauma run like rivers of blood through the Capitol.” I guess she’s talking about Blasey Ford, some of the others that bared it all except Blasey Ford didn’t bare anything. We don’t still know where, what happened, and we don’t know who did it!Anyway, next paragraph: “These women are gender traitors, to borrow a term from the dystopian TV series The Handmaid’s Tale. They’ve made standing by the patriarchy a full-time job. The women who support them show up at the Capitol wearing ‘Women for Kavanaugh’ T-shirts, but also probably tell their daughters to put on less revealing clothes when they go out. They’re more sympathetic to Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who actually shooed away a crowd of women and told them to ‘grow up.’“Or Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, whose response to a woman telling him she was raped was: ‘I’m sorry. Call the cops.’ These are the kind of women who think that being falsely accused of rape is almost as bad as being raped. The kind of women who agree with President Trump that ‘it’s a very scary time for young men in America,’ which he said during a news conference on Tuesday. But the people who scare me the most,” writes Alexis Grenell, “are the mothers, sisters and wives of those young men, because my stupid uterus still holds out some insane hope of solidarity.”You women who love your husband have gotten married, have had families, including sons, who supported Kavanaugh, you are selling out your utter fellow uteruses out there, and this Alexis Grenell is fit be over it! Because you’re being tricked by the patriarchy. You’re thinking you’re happy and having a good time but you’re not, you’re miserable, your rights are being denied, you’re being mocked and laughed at by people like Donald Trump who think you’re nothing more than a uterus!“We’re talking about white women,” she writes. “The same 53% who put their racial privilege ahead of their second-class gender status in 2016 by voting to uphold a system that values only their whiteness, just as they have for decades. Since 1952, white women have broken for Democratic presidential candidates only twice: in the 1964 and 1996 elections, according to an analysis by Jane Junn, a political scientist at the University of Southern California.”“[W]hite women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their whiteness…” Does anybody know what this means? This is what your daughters are being taught! This stuff is enraging your daughter, making your daughter mad. Your daughters. This is the reaction to Kavanaugh being confirmed to the Supreme Court. Folks, it’s not intellectual. It’s not scholarship. This is certainly not above average intellect. This is just plain incomprehensible drivel, disguised as learned education and discourse in 2018, and this is how women can end up going and can taught by other women like this and end up coming out of school raging and angry over they don’t even know what.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: And this Alexis Grenell is not the only woman writing this way. Liberal writers and activists are attacking “white women” all over the media today. “White women” are to blame for standing by, supporting Kavanaugh, helping him get confirmed. Alexis Grenell, in her piece, writes, “This blood pact between white men and white women is at issue in the November midterms. President Trump knows it, and at that Tuesday news conference, he signaled to white women to hold the line: ‘The people that have complained to me about it the most about what’s happening are women.“‘Women are very angry,’ he said. ‘I have men that don’t like it, but I have women that are incensed at what’s going on.'” Everybody knows women who are incensed going on because they have husbands that they love and sons that they’re worried about. And these leftist women think those other women — you mothers of sons — are sellouts and traitors, including with your uteruses. This is sick! It is downright sick! It is not even based in a common sense with even a community of understanding. And the Democrats think this kind of thing is what’s going to generate a massive blue wave in the House. I… (sigh) Well, I’ll have more on that. I’m gonna get started on the phones. We’re gonna go to Denver. This is David. David, thank you for calling. You are first. It’s great to have you with us. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Reformed Android user dittos. How are you?RUSH: Thank you, sir. Thanks very much.CALLER: I wish I could be excited about this Justice Kavanaugh getting appointed to the — or finally rising to the — Supreme Court. But the level of vitriol, the outright rage that they threw at this, this whole entire — and you’ve kind of alluded to this already. Reason has been thrown out the window with the left, and we are a nation… As has been said a number of times, “We are a nation of laws,” and they seem to be lawless. They seem to be willing to do anything to undermine or remove somebody from consideration to the nation’s highest court because that’s their last bastion of hope. Heaven forbid these individuals go into power this fall. You know, there’s… I don’t believe in the blue wave, either. But if they do, our country is based upon a very fragile tension, almost.RUSH: Oh, I agree with you totally. His point… I’m only taking over here ’cause I got 20 seconds and I’m a communications specialist. I’ll say it in as few words as possible. David here is worried that despite victory here, the left has gotten so deranged that they threaten the very structure of America with that rage — and with violence and bullying intent — they intend to basically strip away everything democratically elected simply because they don’t like it, using violence and bullying. And it’s a legitimate concern. That’s why they have to be defeated at the ballot box to start with!  "

Great to have you, sir. Hello.CALLER: Thank you, Rush, so much. Super huge mega, big, big dittos, my friend.RUSH: Thank you, sir.CALLER: Longtime listener. Probably 1993 was when I started listening daily, and was actually lucky enough to see you in Philadelphia at the Kimmel Center when you auctioned off your Harry Reid letter.RUSH: Oh, that was awesome! That was on the campus of the university. What a great hall that was. That was one of the nicest venues I’ve ever had a public appearance in.CALLER: And it was one of our funnest nights ever. My brother, Joe, got the tickets. I was lucky enough to tag along with a few other family members, and it was quite memorable. You told the best Hillary Clinton joke I’ve ever heard in my life.RUSH: (chuckles) Was that the elevator joke?CALLER: Yeah!RUSH: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. (laughing)CALLER: Hey, Rush?RUSH: (laughing)CALLER: I’ll get right to the point.RUSH: (laughing) Now you got me in a situation everybody wants to hear the joke since you brought it up. I don’t want to encroach on your time. What was it that you called about?CALLER: You know, Rush, the left is fully aware that there are things behind the scenes that the public will never know. We call it the deep state, but that’s their standard operating procedure. So you were talking earlier about things we wouldn’t know or that American citizens wouldn’t know behind the scenes that had the Democrats stone faced yesterday and why they know that Kavanaugh’s gonna be confirmed. You know, our only hope, my family’s only hope is that their hatred of Kavanaugh means he really is that good.RUSH: Oh, he is, in that sense.CALLER: Yeah?RUSH: There’s a rap on Kavanaugh too. You know what the rap on Kavanaugh is? That he’s a Bush establishment guy. I mean, he is the staff secretary for George W. Bush in the first term. The rap on him is he’s not a deep stater, but that he is a swamp dweller. And there are some people who think that there could have been a more conservative choice, Amy Coney Barrett.CALLER: I like her a lot.RUSH: But he is good. Don’t believe any of that. This guy threatens the Democrats as much as if Antonin Scalia were back alive and were up for reconfirmation.CALLER: Good. You know, as much as they’ve tried and thrown at this guy, I mean, they… I really think that their only purpose behind the continued FBI investigation was to try to make it like Mueller. You know, dig for everything until you find something.RUSH: Oh! There’s no question. Delay, delay, delay and get lucky and find something that you could make people believe or find something that really existed. No, you’re absolutely right about everything so far.CALLER: (chuckles) Well, they take advantage of the fact that people like me — even though I’ve been listening since ’93 — you know, work every day. I’ve got seven kids. What we do every day. We don’t have time to tune in to every little morsel. So what happens, unfortunately, to the rest of the country that doesn’t listen to Rush Limbaugh — there’s not that many. (chuckles) But the ones that don’t, they get these tidbits on the evening news from the Drive-By Media. They have notice clue what the real news of the day or the news of the week is.RUSH: Oh, tell me. Tell me about it. Look, there are two big developments that the people that only watch Drive-By Media do not know. They do not know that know Blasey Ford’s lawyer has been out there suborning perjury, that they tried to get Leland Keyser to change her testimony to say, “Oh, yeah! You know what? I do remember being at the house when Kavanaugh attacked Christine!”They actively tried to get her to change her testimony, and there’s one other thing slipping my mind. But neither of these two stories have been reported! Nobody in America outside conservative media knows any of that. That’s exactly right. I wish I could remember. I’m having a mental clock on what the second story is. It’s related. It’s all related to Blasey Ford. There are two things here that the Drive-By Media… (interruption)Oh, yeah, the boyfriend letter! The boyfriend letter claiming that Blasey lied, that she does teach people how to beat polygraphs, that she’s an expert at it. The boyfriend’s letter has not been reported on by the Drive-By Media. A six-year ex-boyfriend of Blasey Ford basically said that most everything she said here is not true, and then he added (paraphrased), “The woman is a credit card fraudster to boot.“She continued to use my credit card even after I took her name off it after we broke up and continued to charge things. Oh, and she never had any fear of flying at all and that she never had any claustrophobia. She lived for a while in a very small apartment, 500 square feet. She didn’t need a second door or any other remedy to get past the trauma of having been attacked by Kavanaugh.”He said, “None of what she’s saying has she ever said to me. She never mentioned Kavanaugh’s name.” That letter that the boyfriend wrote has yet to be reported on by ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, New York Times, Associated Press, USA Today, Pravda, Russia Today, the Algore News Network. None of ’em have run a syllable of that story or of the attempt to get Leland Keyser to change her story.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: One other thing, again along the lines of what are the Democrats gonna do if Kavanaugh gets confirmed? I told you. They’re gonna double down and they’re gonna keep harassing and they’re not gonna stop trying to get rid of this guy. I have just a little bit of anecdotal evidence to back it up.I have a tweet here, actually two, from a woman who works at The Nation. She is… I don’t know if she’s a journalist. I don’t know what she does there. But The Nation is an uber-left magazine. Her tweet… Her name is Annie Shields. I’ll go ahead and make her famous. “I am starting a National @DemSocialists working group to follow Jeff Flake around to every restaurant, cafe, store, etc. he goes to for the rest of his life and yell at him.”You ought to see the mob outside Susan Collins’ office right now in the Senate building where her office is, and then Annie Shields’ next tweet: “If they knew they would get yelled at for the rest of their lives maybe they would act right.” She sounds like everybody’s first ex-wife. “If they knew they would get yelled at for the rest of their lives maybe they would act right.” These people are gonna get hounded… I think they’re gonna get hounded no matter what they do, if they’re not Democrats, they’re gonna get hounded no matter what they do.Man up.

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/05/salena-zitos-analysis-of-the-trump-electorate/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 5, 2018RUSH: I got an email last night from Salena Zito, who has made a name for herself by traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of 2016. She went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump.And she learned everything about these people she could. She took them seriously. She went and met them and talked to them, learned about them. Nobody else in the Drive-By Media has done anything like this. But she wanted to find out who they are. She lives in Pittsburgh. She had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn’t see, and rather than guess, she actually wanted to find out who these people are.She went to a lot of small towns, medium size towns, spent serious time there getting to know these people. She has stayed in touch with them ever since the election. She has written a book about it. If the Democrats and the media wanted to know who it is that voted for Donald Trump, all they’d have to do is go get her book. They haven’t. They don’t read it. They don’t care to know who the Trump voters are. They’re not interested in appealing to them.They’re trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls. They want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves, but they’re not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them to Never Trumpers or anti-Trumpers. It’s an amazing display of arrogance. And, by the way, the same can be said of Republican political consultants. They don’t care who the Trump voters are. All that matters is that they are laughed at, impugned, and made fun of.So I get a note from her last night, and she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant and what has happened out there in these areas she has studied. She made, essentially, two points. One, that something has needed to happen after the 2016 election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together. Now, a lot of us have assumed that if people voted for Trump in 2016, that they did so for very specific reasons, among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment, that Trump is alone in pushing back against Democrats and the so-called Washington conventional wisdom.And then the assumption is that if people knew that in 2016, that they would not forget that and that they would realize the need to continue to vote in ways that would continue to support and enable Trump to be successful! And she makes the point that it doesn’t work that way, sadly, that after a single election with the known result, something needs to happen besides just another election of party members where Trump is not on the ballot. Something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in 2016.And that is the Kavanaugh circumstance, in her mind. “The conservative-populist coalition that elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms.” In other words, in her study of things, just continuing to vote for a party — Republicans — to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get ’em out there. I don’t know why. I would think it would be. But she says it’s not.“Kavanaugh, however, has provided the catalyst, because of how Trump voters — and specifically the conservative-populist coalition — perceive the way he has been treated. Not just by Democrats, but by the media and by Hollywood. That the Trump conservative-populist coalition is tired and worn out the way they and things they believe in are treated by Democrats, the media, and Hollywood. And her point is that the targets of rage had somewhat diminished until Kavanaugh came along and reawakened these people and fired them back up.So she says, “This is what I see in a nutshell: What happened to Kavanaugh has served as a reminder and a highlight to the people that voted for Trump, why he’s successful, that it’s all about being strong. It helped remind voters why they supported him. Any other Republican president would have walked away from Kavanaugh by now. Energy would have been lost. But it’s not. Energy is high.”Now, again, that’s Salena Zito and her analysis of the electorate today heading into the 2018 midterms. Now, where I… Look, she knows what she’s talking about. I find it strange that people who… I think the people that voted for Trump are deeply involved in things. Now, maybe there are some exceptions and you had some people that voted for Trump who were just fed up with Republicans and Democrats and found Trump interesting.But for the most part, I am of the opinion that Trump voters did so for very, very, very specific reasons related to Trump’s agenda, which he pounded every day, multiple times a day. Donald Trump told everybody was he was gonna do: Trade deals, the wall, immigration, rebuild the military, bring back the economy. I would think people that voted for Trump knew that that’s what he’s gonna do, and I would also think that people voted for Trump would realize that he needed more than two years to do it.But it’s her insistence, no, that kind of stuff; it evaporates and wanes.You know, people’s lives go on, the news changes, but that this Kavanaugh circus “has reignited the coalition that elected Trump, and this is to the detriment of the Democrats who don’t see this happening.” She says the Senate could indeed see a red wave. The House, she’s not so sure of. I found it interesting analysis, and I wanted to share it with you. She points out the Democrats spending money in House races out there like we’ve never seen before, and the Republicans aren’t.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I meant to mention something earlier in my sharing with you the information Salena Zito shared with me in an email last night about how the Kavanaugh situation has revitalized the Trump populist coalition. It was the Trump populist coalition that was assumed to be not all that enthusiastic about voting ’cause they did that in 2016 and Trump won. But now Kavanaugh and this whole thing has reinvigorated ’em.In her note to me, she said, “There could well be a red wave in the Senate. The House, it’s too soon to say. The Democrats could win the House, Rush.” And she said, “Because they’re spending money like you can’t believe in these local races. The Republicans outraise them, but when you get into local district House races, the Republicans in many of these races’ districts are being dwarfed, and it made me stop and realize something.How many of you…? Let me just ask you something. How many of you have ever made up your mind on who to vote for based on a TV ad? I never have! Now, I don’t watch local TV that much, but I know that I am not a good example of a cross section of the country. A lot of people watch local TV and, as such, are inundated with political ads. And we keep hearing that people are tired of them.But they keep running ’em because the political consultants believe that they work. But this is an area where I don’t have a lot in common with the people in this regard. And it leads to being a constant frustration for me. I am never influenced by the money spent on a campaign, particularly campaign ads. It doesn’t affect me. I know who I’m gonna vote for before I see an ad. And there’s not an ad in the world that’s gonna make me the change my mind.But I have to keep in mind how rare that is. Most people watch local TV, they can’t avoid all those ads, and a lot of people are not immersed in this stuff like I am and maybe you, too, and so they are influenced by these ads. I have to keep reminding mess that these ads and the spending of voluminous amounts of money does matter. I just have a tough time seeing how people who pay attention to things could even think about voting Democrat right now.Folks, I really mean it. I think, given what we’ve seen since Trump was elected, the Democrat Party and the deep state deserve the biggest electoral landslide loss ever. This country needs to rise up and reject these people. I know their voters are not gonna reject ’em, but I don’t believe they’re the majority. I think these people need to be skunked. Their behavior is, in terms of decency, common decency, these people must not be rewarded for what they’re doing!Destroying people, destroying institutions, destroying concepts in our rule of law. I shudder to think of them being rewarded for this stuff. You know, it used to be that you knew the economy was great just by living through it. But now you apparently have to be told that it’s good. You have to be watching TV and then somebody on TV has to tell you the economy is good, then you have to believe it.Well, I remember a time where when the economy was roaring along and people were doing well, you didn’t need to be told. You knew it. But now we’ve got the Democrat Party out there saying it’s not a great economy, tax cuts are ruining everything. And some dummkopfs believe this stuff! You reject what you’re living and believe what you’re being told by people. So I just, I have yet to be influenced by a political ad.Now, I realize I’m very firm in my convictions, and I know what I believe, and there’s not an ad in the world that’s gonna change my mind about a candidate.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Also, the money Democrats are spending is being spent on people to go door-to-door to pretend to be neighbors and say, “Man, we really like such-and-such.  You gotta join us.” They may be spending more on that than they are TV ads.    "

I appreciate it.RUSH: You bet.CALLER: So I just wanted to express, first of all, my political affiliation is I’ve never been too involved in the political scene until these last couple years. I’ve always seen the argument on both sides of the table a lot of times. But recently in the past few years, I’ve had just absolute disgust of what the left is doing and their tactics. And I’ve never registered to vote. I’ve never really had too strong of an opinion. But literally seconds after I saw Kavanaugh’s opening statement, I went straight to register to vote.RUSH: You know, I find this fascinating. I always try to make it a point to understand that not everybody is into this like I am. I find it hard to do that sometimes because it seems that since all of this is about so much of how we’re going to live in this country, that I wish more people did pay attention to it and learned a little bit more about it, and it’s one of the purposes for this show. You’re a classic… This is a great anecdotal example.You’re a guy out there; you’re living your life. This stuff is on the periphery to you, probably because it irritates you when could you pay attention to it. But something caused you to get over the hump. Something caused you — in this case, the Kavanaugh testimony in the hearing caused you — to say, “You know, this is worth my attention. This is worth my getting involved.” Is that right? Is that pretty much it?CALLER: A hundred percent. I think it’s a maturity thing as well, understanding, like you’re saying, that our votes have implications and that it does matter, and this just disgusted me to my core, you know. I got emotional listening to him, I’m sure, as millions of — not just people, but — men my age especially did listening to that. And, you know, it’s just amazing to me to see the tactics that’s going on in this country right now.RUSH: So you’re gonna go register to vote?CALLER: I already did. I did it instantly. Yes, sir, online.RUSH: Well, welcome.CALLER: I’ll be voting in the midterms, especially, and I guarantee you I’m not the only person in this country that’s doing that, and I think the media’s gonna get it wrong — way wrong — again, because this silent majority is real, and it’s out there for sure.RUSH: I think that there are probably a lot of people like you. It’s hard to know scientifically or statistically. That’s why we have to treat your conversion here as an anecdotal, one-time example. But I think the Democrats are worried about this. I really think that they constantly misjudge and believe that they represent the majority of thinking in this country. I think they really believe that a majority of Americans hate conservatives and everything about them and conservatism.And I think they think they’re relating to a majority of Americans. When they’re hit with the reality that that may not be the case — and I think they’re seeing that now — then it’s time to circle the wagons and try to limit the damage. The real key for them is gonna be polling data on suburban women. If they’re having similar kind of backlash to you, then that’s gonna scare the wits out of ’em, and I think that is happening too.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here is Pat in Evansville, Indiana, as we head back to the phones. It’s great to have you. Hi.CALLER: Thanks, Rush. I just want to say I don’t believe, I have not believed Dr. Ford. I don’t think she’s ever been telling the truth. To me, she’s no different than the two ladies that confronted —RUSH: Oh, by the way, let me interrupt you. I need —CALLER: (crosstalk)RUSH: Hold it. Let me interrupt you. I need to remind people of one thing. Do you remember the letter written by the ex-boyfriend of six years claiming that she never talked about this, that she never had a fear of flying, that she’s not claustrophobic? None of the things she said is true and that she illegally used his credit card long after he took her name away. Do you remember that letter that was announced yesterday?CALLER: Yes.RUSH: Do you realize CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, New York Times, Washington Post have not reported it? Not a single network has reported it. Not a single newspaper, I don’t believe, has published it or talked about it. It’s just it’s totally on ice. Nobody knows that her ex-boyfriend… If you watch Drive-By Media, nobody knows about that ex-boyfriend’s letter.CALLER: Oh, yeah, I was really surprised I didn’t see it on ABC last night. You know, I was really shocked. You know, we know how that goes, Rush. They’re not gonna report anything that doesn’t work in their narrative. And did not Dr. Ford perjure herself, if it could be proven that she indeed did coach or advise folks on how to pass a lie detector test, and she said in her testimony that she didn’t —RUSH: Yeah. That’s what the boyfriend said in the letter. And that’s why Ms. Mitchell, the Republican prosecutor, if you will, during the hearings last Thursday was zeroing in on her, I think to create the fact that she established that she was committing perjury. Yeah. So you think she’s getting off too easy here in this?CALLER: I do. I really do. If you watch her testimony or a recording of her testimony, it was full of holes. Not only the ones that were documented, but undocumented. When the prosecutor asked her about the encounter with Mark Judge, she said that during that six- to eight-week window before she saw Mark Judge at Safeco that they were friendly with each other. With that kind of behavior from a man like that, why would you ever be friendly with him? And I’m surprised that the prosecutor didn’t push her on that, say, “Please explain those encounters that you say were friendly.” What could her answer have been with the —RUSH: Well —CALLER: — remember —RUSH: (unintelligible)… Do this.CALLER: — know why they were friendly, I don’t remember.RUSH: But that’s… We now know in hindsight that’s not what the purpose of the prosecutor was. The prosecutor was documenting perjury, was documenting variances and differences in her story for perhaps some other use at some other time. I don’t know. But it’s clear that Blasey Ford was not going to be challenged on anything she said. She was going to be encouraged to say different things, tell different stories, as I say, for whatever purpose.CALLER: I see. That does makes sense. Just give her more rope. I understand that. It makes sense.RUSH: Give her more rope, but if you don’t do anything with the rope, what good is that? I don’t know how they intended to use it. I still think this. I think a lot of people agree with you, that this woman has gotten away and not been thoroughly investigated. She got away with an anonymous letter that she didn’t want made public, supposedly. Does anybody really believe that, either? Does this woman act irritated that she’s been made to go public with this? She doesn’t act irritated about that to me. She wants to be helpful while she’s terrified.I just… I think in this climate, to tell you the truth out there, Pat, to try to poke holes in her story and to succeed, if the Republicans had succeeded in exposing her as a liar, I think the Democrats would have lost it. I think they would have gone batty, at the Republicans. Not at her. I think they would have accused the Republicans of browbeating her and making her say different things because they’re all on record as having said they believed her before they even met her.Before they even talked to her. They said they believed her. In fact, I don’t even know why the Democrats need to see the FBI report! Because they’ve said they believe her from the get-go. They’re not even open to the possibility that she’s telling a story that cannot be corroborated and hasn’t been. This is Louis in Los Angeles as we stay with the phones. Hi, Louis. Great to have you here. Hello.CALLER: Hey. How you doing, Rush? This is my first year listening. I started listening to you, Sean Hannity, everybody, and I just want to thank you for basically yelling what I want to yell out so loud all the time. You know, you guys say it, and I’m thinking it, and my first year… I’ve never really been into politics, I’ve never really cared, in the sense of just kind of like, hey, they’re just gonna vote, whatever. But this was really bad. This was something that changed people’s minds.I have a lot of sons, I have a big family, and it was like: How can you just try and destroy someone with no kind of corroboration, no kind of proof, no kind of evidence? And then Trump said it yesterday and I’ll say it like this. He basically yelled out what I said. It was like, everything she was saying was, I don’t know, well, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. So it’s like, well, what happened? What went down? What’s going on here?You’re saying these allegations, but you don’t know certain things that are very important, like who took you home. This should have been traumatizing for you. If something like that happened you would have been like, hey, Mom, pick me up, hey, call somebody, get to a pay phone. Something. So, just after that, just how they destroyed that man and tried to… It just changed me. And basically it was just like, “I gotta vote. I gotta vote for our rights. I gotta vote for conservatism, for justice, God, our values in this country, which are being torn apart.RUSH: Really? This has awakened you that much?CALLER: Yes. You know, not that women can’t be believed, but, folks, men and women can lie. To say that, oh, a certain nobody can’t lie, a woman can’t…RUSH: No, no. You said it earlier. You nailed what this is about earlier. You correctly identified that the United States Senate was attempting to destroy this guy.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: You didn’t know who he was from pile of coal. But you saw a guy trying to be destroyed, his life, his career, his future destroyed, and nobody had any corroborating evidence for all of this that was gonna destroy him! That’s what got you in gear.CALLER: Yeah. It’s the same thing like the gentleman before. I went out and said… I was even talking to me wife, we watched it together. She’s like, “Wait a minute. Like, it just did not add up. I’m sorry.” When two plus two is four and this was like two plus, you know, something else. It wasn’t… You know what I mean? It just didn’t add up, the story —RUSH: All right. Here we have… Louis, thanks for the call. We’ve got another anecdotal story, but it dovetails with what we’re seeing in the polling data. We’re seeing the generic ballot advantage the Democrats had now gone in the latest Marist/NPR poll. We’ve got a 12-point advantage is now two points, which is statistically tied. That’s the margin of error. In all these other generic ballot polls, which I think are…I don’t think the Republicans have ever led in one of these, and the Republicans win Congress all the time. Since 1994, anyway. Do you people realize when the Republicans won in ’94 it was the first time in 40 years that they ran or controlled the House? Since then, they’ve lost control and want control back. But I don’t think there’s ever been a generic ballot poll ever that shows the Republicans ahead! I could be wrong. I doubt it. I don’t recall ever having seen one. But now we’re seeing voter enthusiasm shifts to the Republicans.Democrats are losing some. And, believe me, if this all is real, if this polling data’s accurate, if it’s the same stuff the Democrats are seeing, it’s affecting them. Then there’s this from The Atlantic. Now, The Atlantic is a left-wing publication, as is most U.S. media. The headline of this story: “Conservative Women Are Angry About Kavanaugh — And They Think Other Voters Are, Too.” Here’s a pull quote: “In the two weeks since the claims against Kavanaugh first emerged, many feminist groups have called on senators and the American public to believe women who come forward with allegations.“Kamala Harris, the progressive Democrat senator from California, captured this sentiment when she questioned Ford during the hearing, ‘I believe you. And I believe many Americans across the country believe you.'” But the writer of this story, whose name is Emma Green, said, “The women I interviewed, however, resented the notion that people’s accusations should be believed on the basis of their identity alone.”“‘That makes me furious, because I think that’s taking advantage for the worst purposes of something that is real in our culture,’ [a woman] said, ‘Women are not a monolithic bloc. Most of us … (are) not going to take to the streets with pitchforks and torches… That said, there’s a large, large percentage of us who feel very, very strongly about the way this process has played out.'” Headline: “Conservative Women Are Angry About Kavanaugh — And They Think Other Voters Are, Too.” Do conservative women live in suburbs?The reason I ask that is because the Democrats claim to have a hold on college-educated suburban women. Well, they may be losing that hold too, if some of this polling data is correct. Let me just say this. If everything were just, and it isn’t, and I know it. But if everything were sane, the Democrats would be destroying themselves right now, as they did back in 2002 when they did the Wellstone memorial.The Democrat Party is, in a sane world, the Democrat Party is engaging in self-immolation right now with the treatment of Kavanaugh, the backing of a woman who’s got no evidence, hasn’t had any evidence corroborated. And thanks to Donald Trump now, more Americans than ever know the truth of her story. And the truth of her story is that it’s full of holes! If Trump hadn’t went on his rant, gone on his rant on Monday night, the Drive-Bys would have never reported that because they had not reported it.Democrats are not the majority. They did not win the Senate. They did not win the House. The advice and consent role does not give them the right to determine who goes on the court and who doesn’t. That’s for the winners! But the behavior the Democrats have engaged in here, the public political murder of a highly achieved, brilliant guy who never did anything to anybody anywhere near the way he’s being described. People bringing forth BS allegations like this with BS lies and no evidence to back it up in, a sane world would be paying a price so high, they wouldn’t even engage in this kind of behavior.But the Democrats think they speak for a majority of Americans because they have the media on their side. And they think that they have succeeded in making the majority of Americans hate Brett Kavanaugh and hate conservatives and Republicans as well. Well, we don’t live in a sane world. We don’t live in a sane country right now. But it’s still possible for the Democrats to pay a huge, huge price for this. Given the standard, time-tested American moral code and our sense and set of values, the Democrats should be halfway finished with their self-destruction in the middle of this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Back to the phones! To Lake Mary, Florida. This is Paula. Great to have you with us. You’re up. You’re next. Hello.CALLER: Hi! Thank you, Rush, and thanks to your staff as well for all that you guys do. I just… This is really coincidental, but I just happened to have been watching a report on Fox this morning and Steny Hoyer made a comment about how the Democrat voters are all hyped up and they’re excited and they’re coming out en masse to vote. And then there’s reports about, “Yeah, the Republicans are kind of excited, too. But, you know, we’re not really worried about that.” And all I could think of is… Now taking into consideration I was a sex abuse victim years and years ago — as a child, as a matter of fact — women that I’ve talked to, people I’ve talked to are so fired up and the majority of the fired up people are women who have been either sexually abused or assaulted at some point in their lives —RUSH: Do they have sons?CALLER: (crosstalk)RUSH: Do they have sons? Are they married? Do they have men in their lives they love?CALLER: Oh, absolutely. I’ve got a daughter, but the injustice of what’s been done to this man under the falsehood of sexual abuse — and that’s not even what’s making women and other people angry but women in particular. It’s the fact that you would do something to an innocent person under the guise of one of the most horrific crimes in the world and think that we’re buying what you’re selling. And everything… Having been a victim, keeping this in mind —RUSH: Now, that is interesting. The women you know are insulted. Their intelligence is insulted to think that a woman can come across with a 36-year-old story and destroy a guy because you’re stupid enough to go along with it?CALLER: Absolutely! That’s it.RUSH: That’s an interesting take: An insult to the intelligence. Other people may have portrayed it that way, but that connects with me. That makes total sense to me. This idea that women are monolithic and all women are gonna have the same opinion, the same rage, the same anger simply because the Democrat Party brings one forward who’s got these baseless claims that women are so universal. Excellent point. I’m glad you called, Paula. I’m sorry I ran out of time, but I have. It’s great to talk to you. Thank you very much.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Dina in Wilburn, Georgia, you’re next. Welcome to the EIB Network. Hi.CALLER: Hi.RUSH: Hey.CALLER: The reason I’m calling is because I believe that if the Democrats keep complaining that the investigation, the FBI investigation is not thorough enough, that they may be right. The investigation needs to investigate Dr. Ford. The reason being is that we don’t know anything about Dr. Ford. Was she taking drugs, by any chance?RUSH: We do too! The Democrats believe her. That’s all anybody would need to know.CALLER: Well, was she taking drugs? Has she ever done this before? What are her affiliations with Democratic Party and Democratic members, big-time members? Also, there’s two people who are on the scene, and that’s her and Kavanaugh. One of them is lying. One of them is committing perjury. We know nothing about her, and we need to know more about her, if they keep complaining about this. We know everything we need to know about Kavanaugh. He’s had 150 people talk to seven investigations and nothing about her.RUSH: I can’t dispute any of that. In fact, that’s a great point. That is an absolutely great point. We don’t know a thing about her. Nobody’s investigating her because the Democrats say that you have to believe her, Dina.CALLER: We can, but was she on drugs? I mean, you know, what’s going on here? You know, there’s all kinds of things —RUSH: What’s going on here is here trying to railroad a guy so that they don’t lose control of the Supreme Court, in their mind!CALLER: I know, but nobody is responding to them appropriately, which means you gotta put it back on them, you know?RUSH: Well —CALLER: You want an investigation? Investigate Ford! We don’t know anything.RUSH: I agree with that, but the one big response throwing it right back at them will be the vote to confirm. I mean, that will be the gigantic avocado they’ve gotta swallow without any butter or mayonnaise. "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/04/npr-generic-ballot-in-dead-heat-because-of-kavanaugh-and-me/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 4, 2018RUSH: Everything that we predicted is coming to pass on the Democrat side. Now, as to the blue wave, purple wave, red wave, and this kind of thing, NPR has a poll out there. “Just over a month away from critical elections across the [fruited plain], the wide Democratic enthusiasm advantage that has defined the 2018 campaign up to this point has disappeared, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.”Now, for this to be true then it also has to be true that the previous polls were accurate. What did you tell me before the program, that Cruz is now up seven or Beto O’Rourke and that…? (interruption) You seem surprised by that. Why? (interruption) Two or three weeks ago, Cruz was tied with Beto O’Rourke. What if they never were tied? What if that was just polling data flimflam? What if that was nothing more than polling data flummery? What if Cruz never has trailed? You know my theory about polling.They use it to shape public opinion, and you get close to the election, they have to start changing it to have it close to accurate so that when the election’s over, they’re not totally discredited. None of this polling data surprises me. I have never thought the Democrats had a 12-point advantage in the generic ballot in House races but everybody goes with it ’cause that’s the only polling data you have. The point is in the NPR poll, NPR/Marist/PBS NewsHour, the Democrat generic ballot advantage has gone from 12% to 2%.That’s in the margin of error. That is a wash. The Democrats have lost two points in this poll, and it is related to Kavanaugh. There is a backlash happening against Kavanaugh. There is a backlash happening against the behavior of the Democrats. But more importantly, a backlash against these really insane, lunatic protester supporters they have harassing people, doxing people. A former intern for Sheila Jackson Lee and Feinstein and one other… This guy, he’s 27 years old, and he works for all women.He’s the guy that revealed all the public information — names, addresses, phone numbers — of Republican senators so that protesters could harass them. And the protesters did indeed harass them. One of them even showed up and beat up Rand Paul in his front door, attacking him from the rear. Well, let’s go to the audio sound bites on this NPR business. We’ll start here at the top, No. 1.NPR is back translating me for their audience. This is last night, All Things Considered, a portion of a report by the NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith about Trump’s comments expressing concerns about allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Kavanaugh and other men. And I’ve got a point about that to make again. Here we go.RUSH ARCHIVE: I think it’s hatred of men, and I said this!KEITH: Rush Limbaugh has been railing against so-called feminazis for decades to much commercial success.RUSH ARCHIVE: We’re so out of balance here. Women — activist, feminazi women — can demand all kinds of investigations into men. Men cannot require or demand investigations into women. Can you imagine if somebody tried that?KEITH: That was from his show today.RUSH ARCHIVE: Men are under investigation in this country, be it through Kavanaugh or through Trump or whoever.KEITH: The idea being that men are under siege, as women have taken more prominent roles in the workplace, as demographic and cultural shifts have changed the rules.RUSH: So next, they went over to Frank Luntz, the king of focus group research, to ask and have him explain how and why all of this is firing up the GOP base.KEITH: It’s something President Trump tapped into as a candidate with his talk of forgotten men and political correctness run amok, says Frank Luntz.LUNTZ: … the idea that you can’t say things that you believe to be true, that you can’t think the way you once thought 10 or 20 years ago because there’s something wrong with it…KEITH: And now as Trump tweeted today there is an anger among some at how Kavanaugh has been treated. Luntz notes that partisans seek to gain advantage from the open wound that was the Kavanaugh hearing.LUNTZ: It has been used by some to try to energize the white, conservative male to say, “Hey look. Now, you’re the victim.”RUSH: Okay. So here’s NPR doing a report, starting out railing against me and my comments, predictions about feminazis. And then they go to Frank Luntz, and Frank Luntz explains to them why there might be a little backlash occurring, not just among men but among people on the right in general. And now here is the payoff. NPR went out, they polled it themselves, and the found that exactly what I have been saying has come to pass. The Kavanaugh hearings are backfiring big time to the Democrats.KEITH: An NPR/PBS NewsHour Marist poll out today found a big swing in public opinion among men following the hearing, with a 10-point increase in those saying they plan to support a Republican candidate in the upcoming midterm elections.RUSH: Right. So this is happening, and the only primary change or difference here has been the Kavanaugh hearings and the left’s reaction to it. I’ve even seen stories today among Never Trumper conservatives that this whole thing may actually reunite the conservative movement. Well, we will see about that. But clearly there is a reaction to it, and it’s root level simple. This is so easily understood. It is the worst smear campaign many people have ever seen in their lives. Many people…You know, even as Lindsey Graham found out the other day there are a lot of people today that have no idea that Hillary Clinton ran an operation to destroy women who surfaced saying that her husband, Bill Clinton, had abused them or raped them or mistreated them or what have you. Lindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said, “When you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park,” and he got booed because the Millennials in the crowd had no idea that that’s who Hillary Clinton was.By the same token, those people have not lived through Robert Bork, and many of them were not old enough to remember what happened with Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. So this was their first, and that means it is the worst smear campaign ever that they’ve seen. Could anyone be smeared more? Can anybody be smeared more than Brett Kavanaugh has been smeared? We think that it can’t get worse, but the left will always make it worse.Kavanaugh has been smeared unlike anybody since Clarence Thomas, but he’s been vindicated too. He’s vindicated by facts. He’s been vindicated by evidence. He’s been vindicated by witness corroboration. Seven different FBI investigations! He is vindicated by a life well lived. When you boil all this down, I think it’s gonna be really hard for any Republican to vote against the guy.In fact, I don’t know this, but I wouldn’t be surprised if some Democrats, Senate Democrats are privately, behind the scenes, urging recalcitrant Republicans to go ahead and vote for Kavanaugh ’cause the way this is backfiring on ’em. Don’t know that. It’s a wild guess, and only time will tell when we get to the vote. But the FBI investigation that the Democrats wanted appears to have provided cover for both Susan Collins and Jeff Flake. We don’t know where Murkowski is on any of this yet. And of course, there are some red state Democrat senators that now have a big decision to make.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/04/democrats-sense-theyve-lost-on-kavanaugh/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 4, 2018RUSH: So the FBI report was delivered to Chuck Grassley. Grassley said, “Hey, there’s nothing new in this. Everything in this we knew,” which is eminently predictable. They still haven’t… The FBI was unable to corroborate anything any of the witnesses have said, folks, any of the allegations that witnesses have made. They haven’t been able to corroborate Blasey Ford’s testimony. They weren’t able to corroborate Ramirez. They weren’t able to corroborate Swetnick. They weren’t able to corroborate any of it.This is now the seventh FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh and the left is out there saying, “But they didn’t talk to Dr. Ford and they didn’t talk to Kavanaugh!” That’s right. That’s not part of the deal. They testified under oath! What more can the FBI learn? Do you think the FBI really thinks that these people are gonna change their stories from what they testified to under oath? Besides that, Dr. Ford’s testimony changed anyway in terms of the timeline.But the reason the FBI didn’t talk to Ford or Kavanaugh is ’cause they’ve talked to Kavanaugh for how many times over how many years? But they testified under oath. And so the thinking is there’s no reason to talk to them. You go out and talk to people they claim can corroborate what they’re saying. The FBI couldn’t find any. So I’m watching CNN today. I’ve got CNN and Fox on here, and it was probably 10 minutes ago, 10 minutes before the program started, and I began to get the impression that the Democrats think they’ve lost.Because a little CNN reporter (well, he looks little to me) was describing Jeff Flake. Jeff Flake said, “This is very thorough. This investigation’s very, very satisfying to me.” And the CNN reporter said, “Jeff Flake today actually sounded like a Republican, and that presents a problem. Jeff Flake is sounding like a Republican. Last Friday, he sounded like a Democrat but today he’s sounding like a Republican.” Then he went to Susan Collins. Susan Collins says, “Hey, you know, I look at this and I’m very satisfied.“This is a very thorough report and investigation.” So it looks like Flake and Collins are in line. Vote has been called. Cloture vote was filed last night by the turtle who was on fire again today just moments ago on the floor of the Senate. For him, he was on fire. We have the audio sound bites of this coming up. I’m stale waiting for James Comey. Has anybody heard from James Comey praising the FBI on their investigation here?You know another way we know this is over? Trump-Russia collusion news is back. Yeah. Yesterday… (chuckling) Yesterday there was some other story that surfaced. Oh, Trump’s tax returns! Trump’s tax returns. That told me that the Drive-Bys thought they were near the end of their abilities on Kavanaugh.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I’ve got Feinstein and Schumer at the microphones. The funny thing to me is Schumer… (laughing) Schumer didn’t hang around for questions. He wanted to make three points. Feinstein’s out there talking, and Chuck Schumer’s chomping at the bit standing right next to her. He just wants to sweep her off the stage, get to the microphones, say what he wants to say, and get out of there. You know what point he tried to make?‘Cause McConnell, the Turtle, during his floor speech today really chastised the Democrats for knees needless details. And Schumer said (haltingly), “We didn’t delay, Madam President. We didn’t delay. Any delay that has happened here has been because either the chairman of the committee or the leader of the Republicans has wanted a delay. But we’re not responsible, because we don’t run the committee and we don’t run the Senate and so we can’t have been responsible for any delay.”Of course, they are responsible for the delay. Ultimately, Schumer’s right. I mean, the Republicans could have told them to go pound sand each and every time that they demanded another week. But everything’s falling into place. Everything as predicted. We predicted that the Democrats wouldn’t be satisfied with what they asked for. They asked for an additional week of FBI investigation; they got it. Immediately after getting it, they said a week wouldn’t be long enough. Then we predicted that whatever the FBI comes back and says, the Democrats are gonna say it’s tainted because they didn’t do a thorough enough investigation.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: An NPR reporter just tweeted that Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are “all filing out of Schumer’s office. All stone faced.” The meaning is they’re coming out and they’re depressed. There are no expressions on their faces. They’re not happy. They’re “stone faced.” They’re shell-shocked. They’re something or other. Now, why would that be? Why? Well, did the Democrats on that committee actually believe Christine Blasey Ford? Did they really believe what she was saying? See, I don’t know how anybody could.Honestly, folks, without… I’m not even being partisan when I say this. She can’t remember where, when, why. The people she says were there weren’t there, and yet these Democrats all believe her? Further, did the Democrats in that committee really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days was going to somehow produce corroborating evidence that would wipe out the Kavanaugh nomination? They really thought that? Because my thinking all along has been they’ve known that this is nothing other than delay.This is all this has been. It’s all they’ve got. If they really thought that this FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations and countless other interviews and written questions hadn’t produced, well, that is shocking. Honest to God. I know I’m sometimes naive, but I thought this has been a scam from the get-go and that they’re all in on the scam and that the scam was delay. Hence, the late release of Dr. Ford’s letter detailing all of this.So they walk out of Schumer’s office, and they’re all “stone faced.” Maybe they thought that they had Flake, and maybe they thought they were gonna get Collins. But Collins and Flake have come out and what they have said so far… Remember, the vote’s not gonna be ’til Saturday now. So anything can change. Do not think the Democrats have scraped the bottom of the barrel or the gutter in efforts to thwart this. They’ve still got ’til Saturday. But they walk out of there “stone faced.” Maybe they actually thought they were gonna stop this with an additional FBI investigation.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  As we knew would happen, the FBI report has begun to leak now, And we find out that the FBI really focused on the last five days on just the latest allegations that had come forward, which makes sense.  Everything prior to that had already been vetted, and it turns out that they did interview Mark Judge for three hours.  Some in the media were saying that the FBI wasn’t even gonna try to talk to Mark Judge.  He is the guy that the Democrats on the committee thought they could turn.  They thought they could get to Mark Judge and get him to admit that he and Kavanaugh did indeed do whatever they supposedly did to Blasey Ford.  They interviewed him for three hours.  He did not corroborate anything she said.  They talked to Ramirez, but she’s upset they didn’t talk to her enough.  They talked to people over the last few days regarding I think something like five or six of the most recent allegations.  They found nothing corroborating.  Their report goes up to the Senate, and a lot of Republicans look at it and think, “Man, this is really thorough, because of the people that were talked to, the people that were interviewed.”  And there wasn’t anything corroborating!  There wasn’t a thing.  I still haven’t heard from James Comey praising this particular FBI investigation.  We’re still waiting for that.  We have the news that the Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats walked out of Senator Schumer’s office “stone faced.”  Maybe he had polling data for ’em!  Maybe he showed ’em the NPR poll.  Maybe he showed ’em some Democrat internal polling.  This isn’t working out the way the Democrats had planned!  You know, they live and die by their own polling!  They believe it.  It’s a Bible to them.  Even to the extent that they know how it’s rigged and used.  They believe it, because they believe polling is always done in their favor.  And to see this generic ballot advantage vanish in a Marist poll with NPR?  To go from plus 12 to plus 2, which is statistical margin of error?They have been, in their minds… And this is crucial to understand it. In their minds, they have been running the House.  It’s all but formal.  All we need is to have the election.  Pelosi is telling herself she’s speaker again.  She’s out there telling everybody she’s gonna be speaker.  Every other Democrat thinks they’re gonna run the House.  It’s just a matter of time passing.  Just like, just a matter of time, just gotta get to the election, the election day itself, and Hillary Clinton’s gonna be president.  They’re in the same mind-set again.  And then they’re brought into Schumer’s office, and they see something that conflicts with this wonderful story they’ve been telling themselves, and they walk out stone faced.  It’s also possible the stone face is an act.  It’s also stone faced is an act designed to create a certain false reaction amongst observers watching.  But I don’t know.  In this case, I think they’ve been so convinced that they were gonna get rid of Kavanaugh when they got that one week additional FBI investigation. I think that alone they thought was gonna make sure that Collins and Flake did not vote for Kavanaugh, maybe Murkowski.  And if that could happen, then they wouldn’t need any of their red state Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh, be at risk, but it looks like there’s this pretty big backlash out there against Democrats.  And now guess what?  There’s this massive protest going on at the U.S. District Court, the court of appeals where Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge, a massive anti-Kavanaugh protest.  And guess who one of the leaders of it is? Does the name Linda Sarsour ring a bell?  Linda Sarsour is a PLO activist in the United States.  She is a far left activist.  She dabbles in women’s rights as well and she’s one of the leaders.  I think Norman Lear is there and some other celebrities.  But it’s not gonna be doing them any good to have a PLO activist appearing to lead this protest against Kavanaugh.    "

For those of you watching on the Dittocam, I want to show you something. For those of you not watching on the Dittocam, we’re gonna post what I’m gonna show on the Dittocam at RushLimbaugh.com. You’ll be able to see it there. But first, before I show you this… There are two cartoons I want to show you. Scott, grab the cartoon of the fireman carrying the baby and put it in the switcher. Let’s use that one first. Go ahead and take that one live.This cartoon, ladies and gentlemen, was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City Bombing, after President Clinton said that “angry voices on the right” were speaking out against him. There was only one voice on the right. In 1995, I was it. There were some local talk shows, but CNN’s the only cable out there. There’s no Fox News. There’s no blogosphere. There’s no alternative media. There aren’t really any conservative websites.Everything’s starting to blossom at that point, but this program nationally was still it four years after our founding. Clinton had blamed “angry voices on the right” for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the building in Oklahoma City, the federal building. Of course, I was livid. I was not gonna accept that. We challenged the White House on it, and they issued a “correction,” claiming, “No, we were talking about the Michigan militia short-wave radio.”Michigan militia short-wave radio?“Yeah, Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan militia short-wave radio!”By the way, this is more evidence of why you should have no doubt I know what I’m talking about here. I have been subjecting to this liberal machine and the way it operates a number of times. I know them. I know how they lie and make things up and strategize. I know their techniques, their strategies and everything better than they do. So a cartoonist by the name of Chris Britt, I think was his name, drew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby.There was actually a cover of TIME magazine. This picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on TIME magazine. This artist did his cartoonish interpretation of it, and the fireman is thinking as he’s carrying the dead baby, “Damn right-wing radio.” Well, one of the local hosts at the time, John Carlson, on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman and had him on the air. He wanted to know if that’s what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties at the Oklahoma City Bombing.The fireman said, “No, no, no, no. We all love Rush Limbaugh. We listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse.” Well, that cartoonist is back. Do you remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his 10-year-old daughter was praying, suggested the family pray for “the woman,” meaning Dr. Ford. Judge Kavanaugh was starting to break down and tear up at that point, talking about the wisdom of his 10-year-old daughter.The same cartoonist is back in some publication, the Illinois something, Illinois Journal or some such thing. The cartoon has now gone viral all over the web and on Twitter and some parts Facebook they love it. Switch that. Show that to people watching on the Dittocam. This is the cartoon. It has Kavanaugh’s daughter praying at her bedside. The description in the upper left-hand corner: “Kavanaugh’s Daughter Says Another Prayer.”In the speech bubble in the cartoon, Kavanaugh’s daughter says, “Dear God, forgive my angry, lying, alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr. Ford.” Now, as I say, if you’re not watching the program on the Dittocam — which you can do as a member at RushLimbaugh.com — we’ll have the cartoon eventually at RushLimbaugh.com. You don’t have to be a member. You don’t have to to see it. I’m not doing this as a come-on for membership. We have the ability to show these things rather than describe them.It’s the same cartoonist, 1995 to today. It’s just vile. It’s filthy. It’s dirty. It’s disgusting. It’s despicable. And it’s sick. And, of course, it has accomplished its objective! It’s gone viral, and people have seen it. People are reacting to it. I weighed whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets, and I decided to go ahead and do it. In my never-ending quest to have people understand who liberals are — how sick and demented they are — this is what passes for humor on the left.This is what passes for comedy. This is the kind of stuff that makes sure they laugh. “Kavanaugh’s Daughter Says Another Prayer: ‘Dear God, forgive my angry, lying, alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr. Ford.'” Not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true, and it’s just… It flies in the face of decency. You know, you run out of descriptive adjectives when trying to describe this kind of thing.It’s why I have settled on the fact that we’re really dealing with a bunch of people who, at some point in their lives, have suffered psychological events that have led to psychological disorders, and they found themselves now at the mainstream of the Democrat Party and the American left. Psychological disorders have become the identifying issues and characteristics of this party, and they are attempting to become the majority on the basis of these psychological disorders, which are always somebody else’s fault!The disorders they suffer are simply said to be their political positions, and their anger is at the country or specific groups, like (summarized) “white men who need to die so that feminists can castrate the corpses and feed them to pigs.” That’s Georgetown University professor Dr. Christine Fair. These people are clearly not all there. Okay. You can now take that off of the switcher and return me to the Dittocam.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/02/kavanaugh-smear-on-thin-ice-backfiring-on-democrats/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 2, 2018RUSH: Now let’s go to further news that buttresses some of this. From TheHill.com: “Red State Democrats Face Nightmare Scenario on Kavanaugh.” This article shows beyond a doubt the Democrats have brought up all of these unfounded sexual allegations and now Kavanaugh… Do you realize the latest defense? The New York Times has run a story saying that Brett Kavanaugh threw ice on a fellow bar patron back in his days at Yale. (paraphrased) “He threw ice! This goes to show just how unfit to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is.Of course, the New York Times when learning that Bill Clinton told Juanita Broaddrick, “Put a little ice on your lip,” while walking out of the room after allegedly raping her, they thought that was not worthy of being published or printed. There wasn’t enough to that. “I mean, put some ice on that lip, babe”? Ah, no news there! But Kavanaugh throwing ice, allegedly, on a bar patron? “Stop the presses! The guy is evil. He is not qualified.” So all these unfounded sexual allegations, they hope ultimately will work. What all this has been about is they’re hoping to force Kavanaugh to drop out.That’s what they have… Just like the Mueller investigation. The Mueller investigation was designed to depress Trump’s approval numbers so that Trump would have to resign because of total loss of support in Washington by Republicans. If they could get his approval numbers down to the twenties because they succeeded in making everybody think that Trump cheated with the Russians, then Trump would lose all support (as Nixon did in the Watergate era) and have to resign. That was the objective.Because there’s no way they were gonna impeach Trump. There no way the Mueller investigation is gonna lead to Trump being indicted. The only hope they had was to drive public approval for Trump way down to twenties and be done with him. What they’re trying to do here is force Kavanaugh to resign from the nomination, withdraw, or to force Trump to withdraw. That and delay. They still hope that they can force Kavanaugh out. “A second Democrat…” This from the article here at TheHill.com.“A second Democratic senator said there’s widespread disbelief in the caucus that Kavanaugh is holding on. ‘I just had a conversation with a colleague who said they couldn’t believe he hasn’t dropped out yet,’ the second lawmaker said Monday evening.” That’s a quote from an unnamed senator in the story at TheHill.com. This isn’t going well. David French at National Review, a Never Trumper — maybe the leader of the Never Trumpers — nevertheless has a piece claiming the Kavanaugh case is collapsing.“The Case Against Kavanaugh Is Collapsing,” because the witnesses don’t have any evidence! They’ve got no proof of anything! Swetnick? Ramirez? Ford? Add it all up and there’s zero corroboration — and one of these women appears to be not all there. The Swetnick babe… Details forthcoming. So hoping Kavanaugh would withdraw — hoping Trump would pull the nomination — has been one of the objectives here, along with delay, delay, delay.The story from TheHill.com: “Senate Democrats up for reelection this year in deep-red states face a nightmare decision on how to handle Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Vulnerable Democrats are hoping Republicans will force him to withdraw his nomination, allowing them to avoid politically divisive votes.” This an important point. It has not been stressed enough. The Democrats thought that by running with every disgusting allegation they could find no matter how unsubstantiated, they would be able to force Kavanaugh to drop out or force Trump to withdraw his name.It hasn’t worked.Kavanaugh won’t cave, and the number of arrows they have in their quiver is dwindling. “The Democrats in the toughest position are Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (North Dakota), Joe Donnelly (Indiana) and Joe Manchin (West Virginia). Heitkamp and Manchin are undecided, and both are seeking another six-year term in states that Trump won by double digits in 2016.” I’m back to the crowds that Trump is drawing: 92,000 requests for tickets Johnson City, Tennessee, and 20,000 people show up.People line up two days in advance to hope to get in. It kind of flies in the face of Trump’s losing his luster out there. So Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin. Now, you might say, well, equalize Susan Collins? Susan Collins is saying, “I — I — I want the FBI to investigate the gang rape allegation.” They have been! The babe Swetnick is… She’s not withdrawing it but she’s saying, “Well, maybe Kavanaugh wasn’t raping. He was standing outside. This is too big a coincidence.”So she’s pulling back on the allegation that he started and organized and then participated in the gang rapes. What more do you need, Ms. Collins? She doesn’t have any evidence! She’s backing off of it. Avenatti’s doing damage control now. “Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill Falls Behind GOP Opponent After Opposing Kavanaugh.”Polling data doesn’t suggest any of this is gonna happen. Republican candidate in Missouri, Josh Hawley leads. McCaskill is now far behind. One poll shows her far behind Hawley. “According to The Federalist, the new poll by Remington Research Group … ‘48% said they were planning to vote for … Hawley while 46% said they planned to vote for McCaskill.'” That is way below how McCaskill has been performing.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The Drive-By Media, ladies and gentlemen, continuing to trying to make this investigation that’s supposed to be over in a week as confusing as possible. President Trump said back on Friday that he was leaving all this to the Senate. Totally backed away from it.It’s their problem, their issue. Let them handle it. But now the New York Times and the Washington Post, the rest of the Drive-Bys are claiming the White House is calling the shots behind the scenes and expanding the scope of the FBI’s inquiry. Made this point yesterday. New York Times could not wait to run the story, White House expanding inquiry. It came the same day we had a leak from Fox News that the FBI said they’re ready to wrap up today. A lot of people reacting to that, by the way.Now, I have an article here at TheHill.com that says the White House is denying everything. They’re denying that they’re calling the shots, and they’re denying expanding the scope. Trump did not expand the scope. He simply reacted at a rally to what the media is saying. He got a little suckered in by NBC News reporting a bunch of fake news that the White House was limiting the scope. Trump’s, “I’m not limiting anything.” That became, “White House expands scope,” which is what the Democrats want. A whole bunch of fake news in this that we will straighten out today.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: From Breitbart News: Mazie Hirono, senator for Hawaii: “FBI Needs to Investigate if Kavanaugh Was a Very Belligerent, Aggressive Drunk.” Andrea Mitchell, NBC News, Washington, says “Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) said the expanded FBI investigation into Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh should include whether Kavanaugh was ‘a very belligerent, aggressive drunk’ in his youth.'” Of course, we’re supposed to ignore that Obama was a practicing, bragging-rights member of “the Choom Gang” when he was in school.You know what the Choom Gang was; right?It was a bunch of people got together to blow a little weed, passing the Doobies around. That was cool, see? Yeah, that was all cool ’cause Obama’s cool. So whatever Obama did, that was cool. Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton, you know? All that stuff? No, none of what they did disqualifies them because they were lions of the Democrat Party. So now they’re focusing on him being “a very belligerent drunk,” throwing ice. Dianne Feinstein is saying, “We need to reexamine his positions on women’s reproductive health and assault weapons.”BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, Trump just left the White House. He was on the lawn on the way to the helicopter. He stopped and talked to the press, as he always does. CNN focused on one thing that Trump said, and then Trump said, “Well, yeah, if Kavanaugh is discovered to have lied to the committee, yeah, then he’s done. That’s not news. But the press… Trump said much else, but that’s all they focused on which, of course is a no-brainer. So now they’re out trying to find where Kavanaugh’s committed perjury and that’s why they’re focusing on belligerent drunkenness and throwing ice at people and so forth.But (sigh) all these background checks of Kavanaugh has undergone over him the years? They’ve got a dry hole, and they know it. What else did Trump say? Trump said to the press that he is blown away by all the support for Kavanaugh at all of these rallies, and he gave a shout-out to his buddy Lindsey Graham. He’s been his real close buddy since McCain passed away. Lindsey Graham is… He’s not a new guy, but he’s definitely changed direction, changing tack in a very great way.But Trump made it clear that he’s upbeat and positive about Kavanaugh, thinks he’s gonna get confirmed, waiting for the investigative report, doesn’t want to interrupt the process. But he made the point of talking about how popular Kavanaugh is at all of these rallies. I tuned in and I just happened to see Gloria Borger at CNN talking about this in a very worried tone. She said, “Yes, Trump is right, and this is amazing. All of these Republicans showing up are really fired up for Kavanaugh.”Now, the reason why that’s a big deal, folks, is because these people in the media… Do not doubt me. They think they’re talking you out of Kavanaugh. Schumer, he made a speech on the floor of the Senate following McConnell today, and every point he made he follow with, “And I think all Americans agree with that, and I think most Americans agree with that. And I think many Americans — a great majority — agree with me on this.” It’s part and parcel of what they do and what the media does, to try to make it look like all they’re doing is reflecting and articulating positions that a majority of Americans have.And it isn’t true! So when Trump points out how overwhelmingly popular Kavanaugh is at Trump rallies, it made means that the Drive-Bys are failing (that’s how they hear it, anyway) in their efforts to destroy Kavanaugh! Because in their minds, what ought to be happening is people should be telling Trump to drop Kavanaugh. If the media were succeeding here, people at these rallies would be urging Trump to drop Kavanaugh for the sake of the party and the sake of Trump’s presidency. It’s the exact opposite. So do not doubt me on this.I’m telling you, these people on in the media who have so much invested in their power, in their self-esteem related to their power that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say, it hurts ’em to the quick. It disturbs them. Any time you can demonstrate to them that what they’re trying to make you think isn’t working, you will succeed in upsetting them — and you might even get lucky enough to hear ’em talk about it, as I just did on CNN.NBC News is desperately trying to convict Kavanaugh at the same time they’ve been trying to convict Trump colluding with Russia.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We had a drive-by caller here couldn’t hang on with a question.  “You know, everybody’s looking for Kavanaugh’s friends to corroborate all these allegations.  Everybody’s trying to find Swetnick’s friends that she’s name to validate all this and they can’t find anybody.”  The four people that Dr. Ford mentioned are denying it, including one of her good friends, Bob Beckel’s ex-wife. Keyser is her name.  At any rate, the Drive-By caller wanted to know where are… I don’t know make it inspire something here, but where are all of the character witnesses for Dr. Ford?  Where are all of her buddies now saying, “Oh, yes, I know, this is entirely possible! She told me about it.” Where are all those people?  But you do know that her social media was scrubbed shortly before she arrived in Washington. Her social media, all of it was deleted somehow, scrubbed, erased, whatever was done with it.    "

Greetings, and welcome back. Great to have you. It’s 800-282-2882 if you want to be on the program. the Trump sound bites are coming up. Hang on. Jeff Flake… There’s an audience there. I don’t know what this event is. It looks like it’s a… (sigh) I thought I saw banners in the backgrounds said “Forbes.” I don’t know what this is. Doesn’t matter.Flake said (summarized), ‘The reason I supported an FBI investigation is it’s good for everybody. We need more information, not less.” We do not have a shortage of information. I can blow up — I can nuclearize — everything they say that they think substantiates and backs up more investigations. How much more is necessary? Why didn’t they they do this when Feinstein got the letter? Why hold it in reserve? She doesn’t have anything to tell anybody unless she now commits perjury.She doesn’t know where. She doesn’t know when. The people she says were in the room all deny it. What is there to investigate it? What more is there to learn? “Kavanaugh’s a drunk.” Oh! Six FBI investigations haven’t shown that? “Kavanaugh, he’s not got the right judicial temperament. Look at the way he behaved at the committee.” What about the years he’s served as a judge? Why don’t you look at that, instead of a guy naturally, properly outraged at being destroyed by the Democrat Party!His attitude made perfect sense! More information is better than less? Nobody is talking about less information here. Nobody is trying to suppress information here. Nobody’s been trying to suppress anything. Kavanaugh has answered more questions, more written questions than all Supreme Court nominees combined! There is not a shortage of information! There has not been a short shrifting of any investigation. But there’s another thing, maybe not the thing, but this is another thing that really grates on me.Jeff Flake just said — and he’s not the only one. There are a lot of people saying this. (paraphrase) “After Christine Blasey Ford’s credibility testimony, I’m getting calls from women all over America who’ve been inspired to come forward because of her brave and courageous testimony.” Well, now, wait a minute. Didn’t Anita Hill cause women to come forward in droves? And what about the #MeToo movement itself? Didn’t Harvey Weinstein cause women to start calling in and coming through in droves saying, “Yes, it’s happened to me”?And then every other person named. Matt Lauer, Les Moonves — NBC, CBS — all of these #MeToo guys that have been named and called out. Why didn’t that inspire women all over America to call Congress and say, “Yeah, it happened to me, too”? In other words, they’re asking us to believe that women are out there suffering alone, suffering in private, suffering in anonymity, and it was Christine Blasey Ford and her testimony which is causing women to call Congress in droves.Well, what have women been doing all during the #MeToo movement? Don’t misunderstand me. I’m saying that she’s a late arrival to this. The idea of men abusing women and the #MeToo movement… I mean truthful stories of it. Don’t misunderstand me here. She’s by no means the first. Women have been coming out of the woodwork claiming Hollywood this, Hollywood that abused me. This guy mistreated me, raped me, whatever. How about the University of Virginia Rolling Stone story?How about Lena Dunham talking about all the horrible things that have happened to her? Haven’t all of these stories caused women to feel newly emancipated to come forward with their stories? And yet, on the tail end of the #MeToo movement — after Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill and so forth — Christine Blasey Ford goes and testifies and Flake says, “I’m hearing from so many women who are saying…” (interruption) Well, no, my point is that I think anybody can say that.But we don’t know who’s calling these people, and we don’t even know if the people calling him are not Democrat activists to begin with just to create the phone traffic. My contention to you is that the #MeToo movement alone has no doubt inspired a lot of women to courageously step up and accuse guys that have mistreated them. It’s not a new phenomenon. It’s not something for which she deserves all kinds of credit because this is at the tail end of this new awareness and sensitivity.And yet it’s being spoken of — Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony and her inspiration is being spoken of — as though it’s a standalone and it’s never happened before. And that adds to her credibility, don’t you see? And I think we’re all being played. Oh, yeah. I do. (interruption) No. I’m not accusing… I’m not saying women aren’t coming forward. I’m saying it’s not a new thing that they are. Believe me. (chuckles) Talk… (chuckles) Go ask Harvey Weinstein, go ask Matt Lauer, and go talk to Les Moonves and ask them if they think this is something relatively new here that started happening because of Christine Ford.It isn’t. It’s all part of the plan to make this particular incident revolutionary, new, and so important because this brave, courageous woman is causing other women to be brave in ways they’ve never felt like being before. And I think that’s not right. I think the sensitivity, the consciousness raising has been going on since Weinstein or even before that. But every time there’s a public incident like this involving male abuse or alleged male abuse, part and parcel of it is, “I’m hearing from women all over America who are so thankful to Dr. Ford because she has given me the courage.”Well, did the #MeToo movement not work on ’em? Did the #MeToo movement not give them courage? I just think we’re being played here, folks. Of course, it gives Flake cover for what he’s done. He can make himself out to be a hero. “Yeah, we need more information. We need more information. Yeah, what’s wrong with more information?” What’s wrong with more information is not the question. Why do we need to give the Democrats more time to make up a bunch of other information, ought to be the suspicion here.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Well, Jeff Flake just lost it. It’s the Forbes something for under 30 summit meeting. It’s in Boston, and he just lost it. He said, “I’m a man without a country. I can’t support Donald Trump. I can’t vote for Donald Trump. Look what he said about John McCain. Look what he said about Mexicans. I can’t support him,” and that’s what this is all about. Like I said in the first hour of this program, this really… When you strip this down to what it’s really about, it’s not about Kavanaugh.That makes this an even bigger shame because he’s gonna be destroyed as the Democrats attempt to get rid of Trump. That’s what this all is, and the reason they targeted Flake is ’cause then that Flake hates Trump. Flake can’t get reelected in Arizona because of Trump. Flake despises Trump; he has for I don’t know how long. He is eager to screw Trump while making it look like that he is standings in solidarity with the abused women of America. But that’s not what this is about.From the Democrats to Flake to the media, this is about raw hatred of Donald Trump and making sure he is denied this court seat or any other court seat and making sure that Trump doesn’t get anything substantively done. This is about getting rid of Donald Trump. This about making sure that Trump is paralyzed (and his administration) following the midterms in November. If anything — if anything — ought to be inspiring Republicans to vote, it is that.It is that the Democrats and the Republican-conservative Never Trumpers are trying to destroy the presidency that was duly elected by the people in 2016. That’s what needs to be used to generate turnout for Republicans — House candidates, Senate candidates, and all over the country — in November, because that’s what this really is. And Kavanaugh is caught in this crossfire. Make no mistake. I mean, they’re happy to take him out because of who he is and what he represents, but it’s Trump they’re aiming at.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/01/dems-kavanaugh-strategy-delay-delay-delay/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 1, 2018RUSH: Now, the Drive-Bys… Trump had a simple ask here: No questions about Kavanaugh during the NAFTA thing. An infobabe from the Drive-By Media persisted in trying to start questions about Kavanaugh, which has led to a discussion about it. Trump is now talking about the FBI investigation, and I have to tell you… You know, I’m jumping the gun a little bit on this comment, but from Friday afternoon, the minute…The minute we learned that the FBI was gonna be called on to do another week’s worth of investigating, it was abundantly clear to me what all of this is. It’s simply about one word, folks. It’s about delay, delay and delay — and with each new revelation, the need to continue to delay. It’s secondarily about Kavanaugh. (interruption) Yeah, oh, they’re still targeting Kavanaugh for total nuclear destruction. That’s part and parcel of this too. The way it works is very simple.You have Jeff Flake saying that he and [Sen. Chris] Coons have struck a deal that there will be a one-week FBI investigation of the claims made by Christine Blasey Ford. Never mind the fact that she doesn’t have any evidence to back up her claim. Never mind that she is not credible! It’s another thing that’s grating on me, hearing everybody in the Drive-By Media talk about, “She’s credible, a credible allegation! It’s a credible…” No, it’s not credible.But she’s being automatically supported and described as credible, and of course Kavanaugh is not. Kavanaugh is not credible. She is suspect she has no evidence to back this up or corroboration at all. So the FBI says, “Okay. We’ll do this for a week,” and immediately, before sundown on Friday, a bunch of Democrats say, “Pfft! A week isn’t long enough! It’s silly to limit this.” Then Trump, right on cue, said (summarized), “I haven’t limited the FBI. NBC is lying about it.“I haven’t limited the FBI and their scope.” Meaning now Trump’s on record and everybody is that if this thing needs to go beyond a week, well, it’s gonna go beyond a week — and I guarantee you that is the objective here and that’s why new allegations about Kavanaugh being a wild, violent drunk? “We need to track that down!” Kavanaugh may be having committed perjury about his calendars and stuff.“Well, we gotta track that down.” Kavanaugh may not have the temperament to be on the court, given how enraged and angry he was during his testimony at the Judiciary Committee. “We’ve gotta track that down.” It’s delay, delay, delay, delay, delay, delay — and it’s gonna be tougher and tougher and tougher to hold to this Friday vote. The people on the Republican side are gonna have to get some steel for a backbone and shut this down at some point or it’s just gonna continue to be delayed, delayed, and delayed.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, I became aware yesterday of a transcript of a conference call that occurred last week among and between Democrat activists who were planning exactly what happened on Friday. It’s laid out in this thing. Now, unfortunately I can’t reproduce this and put it at RushLimbaugh.com, because I don’t legally have it. But I’ve got it.I’m not gonna mention any names, but the names of the Democrat front groups and organizations are here and the strategies that they used. It makes it crystal clear that they were going to target Jeff Flake! He was seen as the most malleable and the easiest to intimidate! The elevator incident, where it just happened that two nearly insane anti-Kavanaugh, pro-Democrat activists ended up there in Flake’s elevator with a CNN camera right there to catch what happened? They started shouting, and they started accusing, and they started pointing finger.He got scared to death. It was all part of the strategy to turn him. There was a three-point strategy. The Flake strategy was No. 3 if the other two had bombed out, and they made it work. They pulled it off. They did it! John Fund has a piece today at National Review: “Who Was Behind the Flake Setup? — ACORN’s tactics live on in the senator’s elevator confrontation with activists from a Soros-backed group.“On Friday morning, two women raced past reporters and security officers and blocked a senators-only elevator in the U.S. Capitol. They cornered Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who had just announced he was going to vote yes…” This is in the morning. It’s before the hearing began. He was on his way to the hearing. “They cornered Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who had just announced he was going to vote yes on moving Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination out of the Judiciary Committee and onto the Senate floor for a full debate.”“The women wouldn’t let Flake leave until they had yelled at him, face to face, for several minutes.” You could see him wilting, shrinking, shaking. “A CNN camera [happened to be there to] broadcast the event live, and from there it went viral.” There’s no doubt that CNN was in on this ambush. The ambush was planned. Jeff Flake was targeted as one of the three points of the strategy that left-wing activist groups… There might have been seven or eight of them on this conference call.“Ana Maria Archila and Maggie Gallagher were the two women who confronted Flake inside the elevator… Perhaps because the women expressed such raw emotion, few media outlets dug into their political activism.” They didn’t want to dig into their political activism! They just wanted to portray them as average, ordinary American women who just happened to get into the building. They didn’t want anybody to know they were Democrat activists! They knew they were Democrat activists!CNN knew this!Look, everybody’s in on this! This whole thing is a gigantic setup! The Democrats don’t care about another FBI investigation. That’s just a trick for more delay! Kavanaugh’s already undergone six! You think six background checks on Kavanaugh missed the fact that he was such a drunk he beat people up, which is the latest allegation. Somebody who knew him at Yale — the guy’s now a professor at North Carolina — has a piece in the Raleigh News & Observer that Kavanaugh got belligerently drunk, and he’s seen it.Well, nobody has any information on Kavanaugh and his drinking in the last 20 years. All that happened was that Kavanaugh ended up No. 1 in his class in high school, in college, and in law school. Somebody so drunk, so sloppy, planning his next gang rape? I guarantee you that kind of person does not become No. 1 in anything decent. But Kavanaugh was. He was No. 1 in his class in high school and college and in law school.Kavanaugh has achievements that 90% of us would never even bother to dream about, they are so daunting. Most of us won’t even attempt them. They have to go back to high school, have to go back to college to find evidence of binge drinking? If you do that you’re gonna find binge drinking on the part of a lot of people. You’re gonna find evidence like that today, because don’t you know…?Ladies and gentlemen don’t you know the stress of life in America is so, so bad — it’s so horrible — that there’s all kinds of self-medication going on. All kinds of people are drinking, and they make excuses for them because the pressure is so intense. But I don’t find anybody testifying that Kavanaugh’s been a fall-down, beat-’em-up drunk the last 25 or 30 years, do you, or even beyond that? Next, they say, “He may have committed perjury.“If he lied about the people on that calendar, if he lied about what those terms mean, if he’s committed perjury, he is gone. We need the FBI to look into that. We need the FBI to look into whether or not he beats people up on Yale’s campus, and we need to really track down this judicial temperament of his. Why, you see the way he acted on our committee hearing on Friday? He was yelling and screaming. That’s not the kind of temperament we want from a judge!”Well, my buddy Andy McCarthy makes a great point. If you want a test, if you want to see Kavanaugh’s judicial temperament, there’s a place you can go. It is called the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals where Kavanaugh has been serving for years, and all you have to do is go there and study his work, and then to the courts prior to that where he was a judge. All of this is delay, delay, delay. They hope to find new women, drag new women out with new allegations.They hope to come up with new charges. The minute one week’s additional one-week FBI investigation was agreed to, the Democrats started saying, “One week isn’t gonna be enough. We — we can’t stop!” Well, a weekend was enough for thousands and hundreds of thousands of Hillary Clinton emails. James Comey’s even gotten in on this! James Comey is now making no doubt about his partisanship in this and his Never Trumper, anti-Trump status, which is what all of this really is.If you boil all this down, what this is, folks, is hatred for Donald Trump by the Washington establishment, by the American left, and by the media. It’s unadulterated, undiluted, raw, poisonous hatred. Brett Kavanaugh is going to be destroyed in the process of damaging and getting rid of Donald Trump! They want to delay this beyond the midterms ’cause they are convinced they’re gonna win the Senate, the House and Senate. They can impeach Trump, and they can paralyze the rest of his administration.If Kavanaugh would happen to get on the court, they’re gonna impeach him too. Jerrold Nadler who runs on the Judiciary Committee for the Democrats in the House says it. He’s not even the chairman, he’s the ranking member, and he’s already promising to impeach Kavanaugh for perjury and whatever else that has occurred so far, if the Democrats win the House. They can’t stand it! They cannot stand that Donald Trump is president!They cannot stand that Donald Trump is putting a tremendous, absolutely great human being and conservative on the Supreme Court! It’s driving them hysterically crazy! So all of this — all these new charges, all these new suggestions for investigation, all these calls for more time — all it is is delay. The next time you hear, “Kavanaugh reportedly very frequently in college got drunk and hit people in the face!” substitute one word for that: Delay.This is all about continuing to delay it, which is why it is as it has always been: At some point the Republicans are gonna have to shut this down and call for a vote! Now, is anybody else like me, concerned? The FBI leadership — many of them are gone, but a lot are still there — has done its level best to screw Donald Trump, working with the intelligence agencies. We had that cabal conducting a silent coup to get rid of Trump during the campaign and then destroy his transition.They have been trying to destroy his presidency with this phony Russia collusion, the Mueller investigation and all that. Now that same agency — with James Comey with an email now encouraging them to dig deep. “Keep digging! Keep digging,” Comey says. (paraphrased) “There’s gotta be something there.” The same guy that exonerated Hillary Clinton without even an interview, the same guy that said they found new questionable emails on the laptop of Carlos Danger, and in a matter of three days reviewed a hundred thousand of them to find there was nothing there.So they can do whatever they’re gonna do in a day or two if they want to. But then, what happens if the FBI looks into all of this and reports… By the way, they reached no conclusions, and if they do (chuckles), then we’ll know a lot. But if, in the 302s — the forms and the results of interviews — they produce no evidence for Christine Blasey Ford, if they produce no evidence for any other allegation, if they cannot produce anything that says Kavanaugh did it, whatever “it” is…In other words, if this investigation clears Kavanaugh like every FBI investigation heretofore has, do you think the Democrats are gonn asay, “Oh, okay, good! We got our week; now we can vote!” You think that’s gonna be the case? Hell, no! They’re gonna say, “The investigation is not thorough. The investigation was stilted by Trump. The investigation was cheating. The investigation was not long enough!” Whatever! They’re not gonna accept anything here! At some point, they’re gonna have to be treated as the minority they are and all this just shut down and vote!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: There is some interesting polling data on Kavanaugh from Mark Penn, who runs the polling unit at Harvard University. There’s also Jeff Flake. Mollie Hemingway at The Federalist says that Flake said that he is a “yes” vote on Kavanaugh pending FBI review to allay others’ concern. So unless Kavanaugh’s revealed to be some serial rapist who hid successfully in six previous background checks, Flake is a “yes.” Can we trust Flake? He said he was a “yes” last Friday, too, and look where we are!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, folks, I was just taking a look here at the Fox Business Channel, and they just ran a chyron, a little graphic at the bottom of the screen. It was on the Fox Business Channel, not the Fox News Channel, although I’m sure it will show up at some point. The chyron says this: “Source to Fox: Kavanaugh FBI Probe Could Be Wrapped up by Tuesday.” That’s tomorrow. So Fox News is saying that the Kavanaugh FBI probe is gonna be wrapped up by.If it is? (sigh) You can expect the Democrats to go ballistic! They’re expecting at least a week! That’s what Flake was assured. I don’t know how… Fox is running it as a source they’ve got. There’s nothing to find. The FBI has looked at Kavanaugh! This will be the seventh time, folks! Christine Blasey Ford does not have any evidence for them to track down! She can’t even tell them where to look!She can’t tell them when to look unless she starts suddenly remembering it now, and I guess they would say that that’s credible. The trauma has awakened repressed memories! I put nothing past them. But she can’t remember when, not even the year. She’s not even sure of the house and where it is — and, by the way, how are you able to draw a floor plan of a house and not know where it was?She can’t tell anybody how she got home. She can’t tell anybody what she told anybody after the supposedly horrible event happened to her. Whatever else she is, she is not credible. The FBI has looked into this guy. This is the seventh time. If he were a binge drinker as an adult and beating people up and sending them to jail, that would be found long before now. So remember, none of this is about what it’s about. This is about delay, delay, delay, delay. That’s all the Democrats want here.So whenever the FBI produces its results and whatever the results are, the Democrats have an answer for it. If they exonerate Kavanaugh, the investigation was not thorough. Trump told the FBI to overlook a bunch of people. They can accuse Trump, us, Kavanaugh of anything and be confident the media will carry the water of that allegation. If the FBI finds corroborating evidence, well, people are gonna have to ask, “How come you missed it six previous times over who knows how many years you’ve been looking into this guy?“How could you find any evidence when she didn’t tell you where to go look?” Oh. “Well, and did you talk to Michael Avenatti? If the FBI didn’t talk to his client and didn’t talk…?” I’m telling you, no matter how this… If the FBI exonerates Kavanaugh, whenever they do it, do you really think the Democrats gonna are say, “Fine, we got what we wanted. Now we’re prepared to go vote.” Do you think that’s gonna be the result? It will not be.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/28/hillary-hack-tweets-threat-kavanaugh-wont-serve-for-life/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 28, 2018RUSH: As to the political nature of this, we mentioned the name Brian Fallon to you a couple of times in the past two days. Brian Fallon was a spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, her failed presidential campaign. Brian Fallon is an angry, vindictive, bitter, and very sore loser. He posted what many people say look like veiled threats to Kavanaugh last night. He called Kavanaugh an “attempted rapist” and vowed that Judge Kavanaugh, if confirmed, “will not serve for life.”Currently, Brian Fallon is the executive director of something called We Demand Justice. It is a front group for another liberal big-money group called the Democracy Alliance. He tweeted, “If Senate GOP ignores Dr. Blasey Ford and tries to muscle an attempted rapist onto the Supreme Court: 1. They will pay dearly this November. 2. Senators up in 2020 (Collins, Gardner et al) will feel intense heat for next two years. 3. Kavanaugh will not serve for life.” That is a veiled threat. He didn’t add any clarification. He “will not serve for life.”What’s a reasonable person’s initial reaction to that?I’ll bet you the initial reaction is not, “Yeah, we’re gonna impeach him. If we win the House and we win the Senate, we’re gonna impeach him. We’re gonna throw him off the court.” That’s not what people’s initial reaction is. When the social media universe sits there and sees, “Kavanaugh will not serve for life,” they think of something a little bit more dastardly. But this is not partisan, says Cory Booker. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! It’s not partisan. This is about the heroism of Dr. Ford. Cory Booker is still talking. He’s gone way beyond his limit. So I gotta find out what’s shaking here.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/28/kavanaugh-beat-back-the-smear/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 28, 2018RUSH: Yeah, so everybody went to bed last night and got up today thinking that the Senate committee was gonna vote at 9:30, vote the nomination out to the full Senate. Then we heard that Senator Flake decided to vote for Kavanaugh. That made it a done deal, 11-10, and then we find out the vote’s not gonna be ’til 1:30, and it’s clear that everybody wanted the biggest audience possible for it; so they waited to do it during my show.JOHNNY DONOVAN: And now, from sunny south Florida, it’s Open Line Friday!RUSH. And we are more than happy to accommodate them here, folks. If they want to conduct the the vote after four hours of speechifying Democrats, “Wah! Wah! Wah! We still want to complain about FBI more! Wah! Wah! Wah! Kavanaugh is a sloppy, fall-down drunk and I want to show pictures of his calendar, and I want to… Wah! Wah!” So Grassley said, “Well, okay.” So the vote’s gonna be at 1:30, after a bunch of speechifying here. Greetings and welcome. Rush Limbaugh at 800-282-2882 if you want to be on the program.The email address, ElRushbo@eibnet.us. And it is Open Line Friday; so if you’re tired of all of this and want to talk about something else, you can. That’s what Open Line Friday’s about. (interruption) Snerdley is shaking his head in there. Are you protesting to have…? (interruption) You…? (interruption) Let me tell you something. (interruption) Let me tell you something. There’s a lot of stories out there that have nothing to do with this.Do you know that the iPhone is now a misogynist device? The iPhone, the iPhone XS Max is said to be anti-woman because it’s too big. I’m not making this up. There are feminist groups disguised as Apple customers complaining that the big iPhone… Even though there’s all kinds of different sizes, the big iPhone is too big. It’s discriminatory because it doesn’t fit women’s hands. (interruption) Yeah, of course you can find it in your purse easier and you can see it better.(interruption) I’ve never heard of women complaining about something that they hold in their hand being too big, but they’re doing it about this. That’s my whole point. That news is out there. I’ve been holding that news. Anyway, I’m just saying if all of this has you frustrated and bored and you want to bring something else up, you can. That’s what Open Line Friday is all about. I don’t expect much of that. But if you want to, you can.In getting started, I want to go back to the very end of the program yesterday and I want to replay something I said. Rather than just tell you I said it, I want to go back to the program archives from yesterday and I want to play it. I got an email note from a journalist friend of mine. Actually, more than one. But at the time, I got this one. It frosted me. The email, very quickly, said, “Well, tell me what you think privately?“I think he’s toast. I think… I think he’s toast. I just do.” Internally, I just exploded. That kind of fatalism and defeatism is what I hate about politics. Kavanaugh had not testified yet. All we had had was Blasey Ford and her testimony and the Democrats’ reaction to it, and there are already people willing to give up. “I think he’s toast,” and I’d heard it throughout the day. Even before Blasey Ford’s testimony, I heard, “Kavanaugh’s toast,” and it just made me livid.Really. I can’t… I… It’s not that I can’t relate to it. Everybody can relate to fatalism, defeatism and that kind of thing if you get depressed about certain circumstances and how they’re unfolding. But this, to me, was no time to give up, and it’s certainly no time to lose faith in Kavanaugh. So this is pretty much how the program ended; therefore, many of you may not have heard it. So I want to replay it.BEGIN ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: I just got an email from a guy, a journalist friend. He said, “I think Kavanaugh’s toast, don’t you?” I wrote back, “No, I do not think Kavanaugh’s toast. We didn’t learn anything new! We still don’t know what, when, where, why.” The people involved that she named all deny it in a sworn affidavit!Brett Kavanaugh can deny all this with far more certitude than she can assert it! You know, not knowing where or when supposedly makes it tough for Kavanaugh to deny it because how do you say you were never at a place that she isn’t even able to name? You watch. If this were me under all these allegations, I’d be livid at this. I’d be livid that anybody believed it, given this many holes and given this lack of corroboration, this lack of evidence.“I don’t know where it happened. I don’t know how I got home. I don’t know when it was. I don’t know what I told people afterwards. I’ve got a bunch of Democrat lawyers offering their services to me for free.” We’ve got the Democrat Party running this operation! It’s a shame that the Republican prosecutor didn’t pull that off. That’s what she was trying to do. It didn’t work. So now it’s up to Kavanaugh, and it’s up to what two or three Republican senators think.I definitely believe he can beat this back. I don’t have any doubt that he can. Whether he will, you know, that’s a pressure-packed moment. But I think he can. Against this? Some say, “Well, Rush, it’d be a lot easier if she had named a place ’cause he could prove…” He could already prove he wasn’t in the general neighborhood with his calendars! “Well, that doesn’t prove it, Rush.” She doesn’t have any either is the whole point.Do you think Kavanaugh should cry? Noooo. Some people do. Ladies and gentlemen, despite — despite all — he can beat this back. I firmly believe that. I don’t think anything’s over yet. I’m a one of those people, I used to fall prey to my initial reactions of what I thought and felt after seeing something on TV. But I’m older and wiser and far more suspicious, and I live in a current set of beliefs that the American people are wiser than normal over what they see on television. I could be dead wrong about that. But I’ve got faith.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: That is why… If I may say so, that is why people listen to this program, ’cause when this program was over yesterday there are a lot of people who thought Kavanaugh was toast. Those intelligent, learned, experienced in following these kind of things thought he was toast. Everywhere in the Drive-By Media, they were pre-celebrating — Kavanaugh is toast — and I didn’t see it at all. I didn’t, and I knew that Kavanaugh could come back from this. So I simply said so. And what did we get when Kavanaugh sat down?KAVANAUGH: This has destroyed my family and my good name — a good name built up through decades of very hard work and public service at the highest levels of the American government. This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that’s been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups. This is a circus! The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades.RUSH: He unloaded on them! I don’t know what people thought, that he wasn’t gonna be able to or was not going to think it was the right thing to do, but he unloaded on them, and he happened to nail it right there. He told the world exactly what he was up against and what was going on. You know, the Senate Republicans decided not to vote on Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland. They just didn’t vote on him for a year using the Biden Rule that we don’t vote on nominees made by lame-duck presidents in the last year of their presidency.We didn’t try to destroy Merrick Garland. There was not an effort to ruin his life, his family, his reputation, his career, or his record. They just didn’t vote on the guy! Contrast that to way the Democrat Party has treated Brett Kavanaugh. They decided to ruin a man’s life. They’re still trying to do it today. They’re gonna keep trying until the full Senate vote is over, and they’re not gonna stop then. The stakes are simply too high for them. So I knew that Kavanaugh could come out roaring and this wasn’t over. Here’s one more example of Kavanaugh from yesterday.KAVANAUGH: I’m not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person, in some place, at some time. But I have never done this to her or to anyone. That’s not who I am and it’s not who I was. I am innocent of this charge. I intend no ill will to Dr. Ford and her family. The other night Ashley and my daughter Liza said their prayers and little Liza — all of 10 years old (voice breaking) — said to Ashley, “We should pray for the woman.” That’s a lot of wisdom from a 10-year-old.RUSH: Totally strange words for many Democrats on the committee. “Pray? Pray? What’s…? Oh, you mean a Christian thing? That’s another reason we hate the guy!” But that’s who he is and that’s what he said. Go back to the opening words of my comments replayed from yesterday. We still, at the end of the day yesterday… By the way, one of the things that I think was determinant in shifting some votes: Rachel Mitchell, who was the female prosecutor from Arizona hired by the Republicans met with the Republicans.They caucused — the Senate caucus last night, the Republican caucus — and she told them as a sex-crime prosecutor she didn’t hear a single thing that could even lead to a search warrant. That’s where Lindsey Graham got the line. It’s a great line. There’s not even enough to get a search warrant. There’s not enough to do any kind of examination. She doesn’t remember where or when specifically. How is Kavanaugh — how’s anybody — supposed to prove something where you can’t even be told where he supposedly was, when he supposedly was?And yet that was the test. I have had so many people ask me in emails since last night and in the run-up to today’s show, “Rush, what is all of this with the Democrats and the FBI?” Look, if you’re frustrated by that, I join you, and I welcome you to the club. The simple fact of the matter is, Dianne Feinstein had this letter from Blasey Ford. It’s either July 9th or July 30th, but sometime in July she the bottom that letter. They sat on that later. I’m not even gonna talk about who leaked it. We’ll get to that in a minute.She sat on that letter. She interviewed Kavanaugh personally in her office after having received that letter and never asked her anything about it. She told all of her buddies on the committee about the letter but she did not do anything with it. They didn’t call the FBI. They didn’t use Senate investigators. They didn’t pursue anything in Blasey Ford’s letter. Do you wonder why? I’ll tell you why. Because to them, it was too sketchy. To them, it didn’t have enough substance.It was not enough, by itself, to put in the mix of things they were going to use to try to destroy Kavanaugh in Phase 1 of the destruction. They set it aside. It became the Hail Mary tactic. They kept it in reserve in case everything else failed. They throw it out there, they engineer it being leaked… By the way, they’re talking about the leak as some sinister violation of secrecy and protocol. No, no, no, no! They wanted it leaked! Whoever wanted it leaked!There’s only certain people that saw this thing. DiFi and her staff, Anna Eshoo (Blasey Ford’s congresswoman), and her lawyers. Her lawyers are denying that it leaked. The Intercept, which is the website that first got it, says they did not get it from DiFi or her staff. Somebody wanted it leaked. Somebody wanted it out there. The Democrats didn’t want to put their name to it because they were gonna violate her privacy and secrecy, which she didn’t want.This was used in ways that supposedly Christine Blasey Ford did not want it used. They could have called the FBI in July. They could have called Blasey Ford. They could have called Kavanaugh in. They could have called all these witnesses — Mark Judge and everybody else. They could have called in Kaiser, who was the best friend of Blasey Ford. They could have done anything they wanted. They had the letter, and they could have gone the committee to investigate. They didn’t.So now on the last day where Kavanaugh and Ford are testifying, they throw out this FBI thing as though they have been denied a legitimate investigation because Kavanaugh won’t okay it, because Grassley won’t okay it. Despite Grassley and every Republican refuting this whole FBI thing, they keep pounding on it because their audience is Democrat voters who they’re trying to rile up for the midterms. This is a voter get-out-the-vote procedure, and there’s an ancillary hope that it might still derail a vote. There’s Dick Durbin sitting there talking to Kavanaugh, “Will you point…? Just take a look at Don McGahn, Trump’s lawyer in there.“You tell him you want an FBI investigation.” This was a… It was nothing. Folks, it’s a delay tactic is all it is. The Republicans have correctly identified and called all of these Democrats out on it. They know they’re not gonna get an FBI investigation. In fact, if Kavanaugh had said, “Okay, fine! Let’s get the FBI in here,” they would have been caught short. They don’t expect this. It’s a pipe dream. They know they’ve had the chance to do this and get it. They didn’t believe this woman when they got the letter.Nobody else is saying this. I don’t think anybody has got the courage to say it because there is a narrative around Dr. Ford, and that narrative is she is unchallengeable. She must be believed. Well, they didn’t believe her when they got the letter. They’ve now thrown and rolled the dice on Christine Ford being the weapon to get rid of Kavanaugh. If that was the case, they would have fired this weapon during regular confirmation hearings and interviews of Kavanaugh.They would have made him explain all this back then if they really thought this was sufficient to disrupt and delay and stall or maybe end his nomination. But they didn’t have that much faith. Because, look, anybody with half a brain — and some of these people still have half a brain — could look at this letter and say, “She doesn’t know where it happened. She doesn’t know when it happened. She cannot answer enough questions that would literally inspire a legitimate investigation, either by local police or the FBI or anybody else that wanted to look into it.”There’s nowhere to go with this investigation. She can’t tell ’em where it happened! So how the hell do you investigate this? All the people she claims were there are denying it. Yet they keep pounding this FBI thing and how they’ve been wronged and they’ve been treated cheated, the Democrats. They’ve been short changed. It’s nothing more than an attempt to the delay and make the American people think the Republicans are cheating. Amy Klobuchar, by the way, in her little speech before the vote was taken… This is a half hour ago.Amy Klobuchar, who was part of the effort yesterday to portray Kavanaugh as a falling-down drunk that can’t remember where he is every day when he gets up because he got drunk the night before. She let the cat out of the bag as to one of the things this is really all about. She essentially said that Kavanaugh’s not legit because of who nominated him: Trump. Trump, a misogynist! Trump, a woman hater! Trump, a woman abuser! Trump this and that. Trump, who believes in expanding federal power out the wazoo, and he says so does Kavanaugh. She said that Kavanaugh’s illegitimate, not qualified simply because of who picked him.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I thought it was brilliant of Kavanaugh to call ’em out, to say this was all an operation of political hacks. I’ll never forget Durbin and Cory Booker. “Are you saying…? Are you actually saying that Christine Ford is a Democrat operative and a Democrat hack and this is all part of a…?” “I wish her no ill will, Senator. But you, on the other hand, Senator?” He didn’t say this, but this was the unspoken (yet conveyed) message. “You are running this operation, and you are running her. She didn’t want any of this, and you brought her forward.”For somebody who didn’t want all of this, she sure seemed eager to do it at the end of the day, right? Do we even believe she didn’t want to do it? Look at what they’re asking us to believe here! But there is no question that this whole thing was a politically hatched idea. Everything from the… In fact, I’m not even sure that letter came in over the transom! I’m not sure that letter from her arrived without anybody’s foreknowledge that it was coming. Nothing they do like this is unscripted! I know these people!  "

He said (summarized), “Based on the information offered today, there’s not even enough evidence to get a search warrant, let alone an arrest warrant, nor a conviction. Did I find her credible? What I found was there’s no corroboration. There’s not even a time or place.”He’s reminding everybody of the facts here, pointing out that, after all of those hours, he doesn’t know when it happened, he doesn’t know where it happened, while all of those named deny it. I just got an email from a guy, a journalist friend. He said, “I think Kavanaugh’s toast, don’t you?” I wrote back, “No, I do not think Kavanaugh’s toast. We didn’t learn anything new!

I don’t have any doubt that he can. Whether he will, you know, that’s a pressure-packed moment. But I think he can. Against this? Some say, “Well, Rush, it’d be a lot easier if she had named a place ’cause he could prove…” He could already prove he wasn’t in the general neighborhood with his calendars! “Well, that doesn’t prove it, Rush.” She doesn’t have any either is the whole point.Do you think Kavanaugh should cry? Noooo Some people do. Ladies and gentlemen, despite — despite all — he can beat this back. I firmly believe that. I don’t think anything’s over yet. I’m a one of those people, I used to fall prey to my initial reactions of what I thought and felt after seeing something on TV. But I’m older and wiser and far more suspicious, and I live in a current set of beliefs that the American people are wiser than normal over what they see on television. I could be dead wrong about that. But I’ve got faith.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/26/democrats-planned-every-piece-of-the-kavanaugh-attack/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 26, 2018RUSH: Okay, folks, I think it’s gonna be very easily established at some point that this new babe, Julie Swetnick, has ties to Democrat social justice warriorism or Democrat activism or somewhere down the line. I don’t think they want any of this corroborated. Grab audio sound bite No. 27. Senator Grassley, the chairman of the committee, spoke to reporters outside the committee room today or outside his office, and a female reporter said, “Can you respond to these latest allegations that are popping up? We know that your committee’s been contacted by Julie Swetnick.”GRASSLEY: Obviously, with this one, we have a contact, and our lawyers are on it right now — our staff investigators — and I won’t have anything because I can’t say anything until they get done.RUSH: They’re turning this thing into an absolute abomination of an embarrassment! Anybody who comes forward with something that there’s no evidence of, no corroboration of, no nothing at the last minute and they’re gonna be off and investigating it. Are they gonna be able to finish their investigation in time for the hearing tomorrow? They don’t want any corroboration for this story because there won’t be any. The affidavit presented by Avenatti — and Avenatti is saying (summarized), “I’m not speaking beyond the affidavit. You can ask me whatever you want but I’m not answering.“It’s all there. It’s all in the affidavit. I’m not answering any questions about it.” Well, guess what’s not in the affidavit? No names! No names of anybody else at these parties. No names of victims. We don’t have the name of one victim who was, quote-unquote, “gang raped.” We don’t have the names of the gang rapists, and it’s important to point out that Kavanaugh is not being alleged to be a gang rapist. He is said to have been nearby, in the vicinity, and may have participated in the drugging of the women. But they don’t want any of this corroborated.That’s what this means. With nothing specific, with no names, with no specific dates! There were supposedly 10 of these, 10 of these parties in one year? This accuser, the latest one, Julie Swetnick, says that gang rape was “commonplace at parties.” Really? Why would she go back? Why did nobody call the cops? If the guys doin’ the gang rape are waiting politely in line for their turn, were they passing out numbers? I mean, none of this makes any sense. It doesn’t pass any kind of test — and this affidavit as well.It had to be happening at parents’ houses. Either the parents were there and were in on it or were not there or nobody told them about it or they did tell them and they didn’t care. Those are all valid questions too. Ten of them! “The latest accuser says that these gang rape parties were commonplace and that Kavanaugh and his friends with regularly drug women and violently assault them.” But she doesn’t specifically say Kavanaugh did that. Just that he was there. She alone went to 10 of these parties in one year.Why would you keep going to these things, particularly if you’re not one of the drugged and liquored-up women? If you’re there and you know what’s happening upstairs — if you know that a bunch of women have been drugged and prepared for gang rape upstairs, and you’re downstairs — you just go to the party and you party and you hang out and you don’t care any of this is going on upstairs or downstairs, wherever it was. But the fact that there are no names, the fact that there are no specifics tells me they don’t want this corroborated.They don’t want investigators to be able to find anything. They want to leave it at the seriousness of the charge, and they want to avoid the nature of the evidence. This is the same strategy (with slight alterations) that they used in suckering in poor old George Papadopoulos. They would tell Papadopoulos — FBI spies would tell Papadopoulos — that the Russians had Hillary Clinton emails. Well, Papadopoulos is a young guy on the periphery of the Trump campaigns, thinks he’s an insider now. Man, they like him! They trust him. They’re telling him this inside dope.So he starts telling other people, ’cause he wants to be seen as an insider! So he starts tellin’ people. So he goes to a bar with the ambassador from Australia. “Hey, you know, the Russians? We find… I’m in the Trump campaign. We know the Russians have a bunch of Hillary’s emails.” Well, he only knows that ’cause the FBI told him. The Australian ambassador calls the FBI.(laughing) “Hey, I got a guy here! He’s in the Trump campaign, and he says he knows that the Russians have Hillary’s emails.” The FBI says, “What? Well, we better go get a FISA warrant.” They plant it! They make sure it circulates! It comes back to them. Then they go to the judge and then the media gets wind of it and starts running it, and they get a warrant spy. That’s what this is. Somebody 12 years, 35 years after the fact says, “Yeah, you know what happened?” “Yeah, I know! I’ll sign a corroborating statement that she told me that it happened.”So you get a bunch of people saying, “Yeah, I heard about it.”“Were you there?”“No, no. I wasn’t there.”“Do you know where it happened?”“No, I’m just telling you she told me. She told me and I can corroborate that she told me.”“Oh, you can’t corroborate what she told you. I mean, you don’t know that it actually happened. You’re just corroborating that she told you that it did.”“Yeah, yeah. I can corroborate that.”So, folks, Snerdley can in here to me today and say that he overheard while he was in Washington two weeks ago Barack Obama admit that he ordered the FBI to spy on Trump. And when he told me that, I could corroborate it. I could corroborate it. I could come to you and say, “Snerdley told me that Obama ordered the FBI to spy on Trump. I’m a corroborating witness, not to the fact that Obama did that but to the fact that Snerdley told me.” This is the scam that they’re running, among many other things. Here’s another thing. It’s starting… The trickle is starting from conservative media. “Kavanaugh has got it pull out. Kavanaugh has got to withdraw. He cannot continue with this deluge. He just cannot continue. He cannot, because he will not be able to ever get out from underneath this cloud no matter what. We do not,” say our conservative brethren in the Never Trump community. “We do not want a great justice on the court forever clouded by these allegations where we’re gonna be always questioning every decision that he writes,” and that’s why we lose.We got people that want to cave, and that’s not how you deal with this stuff. Decent people are forever going to be treated indecently if they stand aside and allow it. I don’t know where Kavanaugh’s head is. My guess is that Kavanaugh no more wants to walk away from this than Clarence Thomas wanted to walk away from Anita Hill. Kavanaugh has put everything he’s got into this, his latest statement. Oh, this is another thing. There are people running around, I saw it on TV earlier today, “You know, I don’t know about Kavanaugh. He’s starting to equivocate.”Well, that perked my ears up. When did Kavanaugh “equivocate”? This person on TV said, “Yeah, he said, ‘Well, you know, I’m not perfect.'” He didn’t say that today! I was looking for that.” He said that on Fox News earlier this week in the midst of an interview! It wasn’t about this! It wasn’t in response to this specific allegation. Yet there are people running around today saying, “Ah, this is not a very strong response to say, ‘I’m not perfect.’ That’s not how you…” He didn’t say it! He called it the Twilight Zone.He said he doesn’t know this woman. This is absurd. It’s ridiculous. None of this ever happened. They can’t prove it. All they can do is find Democrat activists to conjure up stories and go to willing accomplices in the… Oh! Another thing. Remember the call we had yesterday from somebody who went to Yale with Kavanaugh. She was calling from Wyoming. She was in a residential college with Kavanaugh. She told us on this program yesterday that reporters from the Huffing and Puffington Post and other Drive-By outlets were hounding her throughout the summer for data, for information, tell-all on Kavanaugh.From the summer!From THE SUMMER!The media has been chasing down, tracking down anybody and everybody that might have gone to school with Kavanaugh! They’re calling them up and they’re interviewing them, in some cases browbeating them, and this caller yesterday said (summarized), “They’re clearly looking for certain angles, and I didn’t provide it to them, and they got irritated and pending ending the conversation.” Do you remember the caller’s first name? Doesn’t matter. But I asked her to hold over through the break, and we talked to her.There’s a story here today that this has been going on throughout the media throughout the summer. This is so obviously gotcha. This is a coordinated plan. It’s been planted and coordinated for months, and now we are in the execution phase of it, and it’s being made to look like all of these women coming forward are random. But Avenatti produced this woman today because Blasey Ford is bombing out and Ramirez isn’t gonna go anywhere because Ramirez doesn’t even want to testify. That’s the second woman.She doesn’t even want to testify before the committee. Blasey Ford I don’t think ever was, and I still don’t. They wanted to force Kavanaugh out simply with the allegations. They wanted Kavanaugh to conclude it be impossible to go on. They wanted Trump to conclude it’d be impossible to go on. That’s what they were trying to do. Kavanaugh refused to go away. So here comes Julie Swetnick after Avenatti telegraphs that it’s coming earlier this week, a couple days ago, Monday.We’re being led to believe is that Swetnick is so frustrated! (sobbing) “She didn’t want to come forward, but… but… but the fact that Blasey Ford is being mistreated and Ramirez is being mistreated and women are being mistreated and women are not being believed and I’ve got no choice to come forward and talk about the rape-train stories!” This has the potential of backfire — and I said that earlier this week — at the Democrat Party like you cannot believe. Okay. Let me take a brief time-out. I promise when we come back… I know you’re itching out there. I know you’re dying to get on the air.I know you want to tell everybody what you think about this so we will start… Oh. One more thing before the break. See… (Snort!) I go through the Stack, I’m ready to go to a break, and I turn what I just used and put it at the bottom of the Stack and I see what’s next up and say, “Oh, yeah! I remember that.” Headline: “Surprise: Democratic Operative Admits Derailing Kavanaugh is Really About ‘Saving’ the Supreme Court from Trump.” Guy Benson as Townhall has the story.It’s about Brian Fallon, former top spokesman for Hillary. This is not news. Anybody that’s paying attention to this for years knows that this is a scam that the Democrats are running, and it’s one that they have run many times before. Nothing new in this, other than the depth to which they are sinking. But it’s a strategy, and Brian Fallon has admitted it in an interview with the New York Times. He “unambiguously admits what the Brett Kavanaugh destruction project is [is] part of a high-stakes, two-step strategy to thwart Trump — via a former aide to Mitch McConnell.” A former aide to McConnell is confirming this.That’s all this is.Stop Trump.Stop Trump.Stop Kavanaugh.Stop conservatives.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here’s another thing. Remember we had the call by Jenny from Wyoming yesterday? She told us that she was getting called from media people throughout the summer because it had been learned that she attended a residential college at Yale at the same time Kavanaugh was there. She was at the same residential college. So she and other people had been tracked down by the media, and all summer long the Drive-Bys were calling anybody and everybody that they thought might have known Kavanaugh to try to dig up some dirt on the guy.‘Cause the Drive-Bys have been working with the Democrats to destroy every Republican nominee in your lifetime and mine. How come it is…? With the Drive-Bys scouring the earth, scorched-earth policy just in the past three or four months talking to all of these people that went to school with Kavanaugh, why did this never come up? If there’s anything to this one, why wasn’t this first? Why was Christine Blasey Ford first? Because all of these three are part of a structured Democrat plan.We have that from none other than Brian Fallon, “former top spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential campaign, a confidante to Sen. Chuck Schumer, and an-ex senior official in Eric Holder’s Justice Department. He’s also now the public face of a left-wing group devoted to defeating President Trump’s judicial nominees, with the most urgent priority being doing whatever is necessary to prevent Republicans from filling the current Supreme Court vacancy.“In an interview with the New York Times, Fallon unambiguously admits what the Brett Kavanaugh destruction project is part of a high-stakes, two-step strategy to thwart Trump — via a former aide to Mitch McConnell…” Headline: “Democratic Operative Admits Derailing Kavanaugh is Really About ‘Saving’ the Supreme Court from Trump.” It’s making sure that Trump doesn’t get to confirm any of his nominees to the Supreme Court.Here’s a pull quote from the story: “It is downright frightening that multiple United States senators, who’ve supposedly been specifically chosen to sit on this influential committee due to their legal acumen, are saying that a man accused of sexual misconduct more than [35 years] ago … is responsible for disproving” it! How can this happen? “It is downright frightening that multiple United States senators,” not just Democrats, Republicans too, who are on this “committee due to their legal acumen,” can sit there and claim that an out-of-the-blue allegation 35 years later has to be disproven by the accused!“These senators would never, ever accept any such thing for themselves, for anyone they love, or for a political ally. But so long as this (frankly un-American) demand, that flies in the face of centuries of Western jurisprudence and the bedrock presumption of innocence, is useful to achieve the ‘Democratic dream’ articulated so candidly by [Brian] Fallon, they’re going with it. It’s disgraceful. It really does seem like some of these bad actors do not care one whit about even feigning interest in discerning the truth. It’s all just a means to a desired partisan end, wherein principles and individuals can be embraced and discarded as necessary.”That’s the part of this that I’m having a tough time with. The open, wanton, entire destruction of a great and patriotic American life seems to bother none of these people. I don’t even hear too many Republicans talking about this from that angle. “It’s a political fight. We want to get Trump’s nominee confirmed, or maybe we don’t, but we want to get a Republican on the court, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.” But nobody’s talking about what’s happening here. Christine Ford’s life is not being destroyed.She’s gonna be a star and a heroine for the Democrat Party for the rest of her life like Anita Hill is. Brett Kavanaugh hasn’t done anything to anybody, and the wanton, open ruination of his life and his family and his career doesn’t seem to faze anybody involved in this. It’s just mind-boggling. This is a man of superior intellect and achievement. Within the confines of what this is about — having somebody really good and qualified on the Supreme Court — that seems to be the last thing in the list of considerations here.“So with a number of Republican and Democratic Senators still undecided on the nomination, and with highly-anticipated testimony slated for tomorrow, Mitch McConnell should make sure that every one of his members read the” New York Times piece where Brian Fallon of the Clinton campaign admits that this is a structured, strategic campaign to keep every Trump nominee off the Supreme Court. Every damn one of these Republicans ought to read it. They ought to not have to read this to know that!They ought not have to read this to know what the Democrat Party’s all about! Guy Benson says here, McConnell “should also make sure they’re all aware of the cynically-shifting standards being adopted by the Left, in a transparent effort to turn any good faith move Republicans make into a lose/lose proposition.” So much of this stuff is basic. The Republicans ought not have to read a newspaper story where a Clintonista admits what the Democrats are doing in order to understand what the Democrats are doing.Again in this New York Times story, Brian Fallon, the Clintonista, admits — without any doubt with great happiness and confidence — that the Kavanaugh destruction project is part and parcel of keeping any Trump nominee off the Supreme Court. Anyway, that’s where we are now, with Grassley suggesting that the Senate could be open to a second hearing after the Swetnick allegations have been made. That’s playing right into the Democrats hands. Another hearing is another delay. At the bare minimum, that’s what this is. At the bare minimum, it’s a delay. At the abject worst, it’s about the political murder of Brett Kavanaugh.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/26/prediction-revised-anger-over-latest-kavanaugh-smear-could-cause-massive-gop-turnout-no-matter-what-happens/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 26, 2018RUSH: Judge Kavanaugh has issued a statement in response to Julie Swetnick and the porn star lawyer, Michael Avenatti. Quote, “This is ridiculous and from The Twilight Zone. I don’t know who this is,” Julie Swetnick. “I don’t know who this is and this never happened.” It’s “ridiculous.” It’s “from the Twilight Zone.” Now, I mentioned moments ago that I may be on the verge of revising my prediction. The prediction — and it was very precise — was if the Republicans don’t confirm Kavanaugh, that there’s gonna be hell to pay and they could end up losing the Senate and the House.Because Republican voters would simply say, “What’s the point?” But now I may have to revise this because this latest pop-up, Julie Swetnick, put in combination with Blasey Ford and Ramirez and the way the Democrats are acting… I’m beginning to think now that this is going to create one of the biggest backlashes against Washington, and specifically the Democrats, if Kavanaugh’s not confirmed. My first prediction was predicated on the Republicans caving and refusing to defend and fight for Kavanaugh.My first prediction was based on that, and if that were the perception, if Republican voters think that if Republicans didn’t try and caved to Democrats — or the media, even worse — then they would have trouble in the midterms. But this changes that, or has the potential to change this because now this takes it out of the hands of the Republicans. This is just… This is a tsunami, and it is out of the Twilight Zone. Most Republicans are gonna sit out there and say, “Well… (Snort!)” They themselves are not gonna have suggested strategeries to push this back on this.The anger at this, I think, is going to dwarf whatever anger might have happened. I’m talking about if this latest woman hadn’t shown up and if the Republicans caved and didn’t really try to push back. But this now, it could change that thinking. You’re frowning at me when you look at this. (interruption) Are you disagreeing with my…? (interruption) Well, it will screw these people up. They’ve been playing this sound bite of me for the past three days.Now they’ll have to revise it. “Rush Limbaugh has changed!” Well, we’ve got a new player in this. This bottom-of-the-gutter scum! We don’t have any direct testimony about Kavanaugh doing anything in approximately 1982? Approximately? Ballsy Ford can’t even place the year and now Swetnick can’t define specifically the year, and just says that she was told that Kavanaugh was hang around whether these “rape trains.” But in six FBI exams and everything leading up to this no evidence of “rape trains” was produced by anybody ever.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. So we’ve got these women in the room here that have been drugged and boozed up and there’s a line of guys waiting for their turn up. We’re talking about gang rape with a bunch of guys waiting in line. Does that make any sense? Does any of this make any sense? None of it does. Did anybody call the cops at all of these?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, ladies and gentlemen, on the bright side — and there is a bright side to this. We may have reached a tipping point. I have thought this on several occasions over the years, but this may be a tipping point. This may be one of those incidents where the vast majority of the American population — and I still believe that a majority of Americans are what I would classifying as decent people. I don’t believe the majority of our country is plagued by massive psychological disorders that have led to a deranged political activism. I don’t think that’s the majority of our country. I think it’s silent. It shows up and elects Trump now and then. You know, things like that happen.I think they’re livid. I think they’re outraged over this. I think the outrage originally was gonna be at Republicans for caving to all this. But now we’re past that, because one of the things I believe is truly happening is I think fence-sitters and casual news consumers — people that are not ideologically involved like you and I are, people who are not so-called news junkies. I think they’re watching this, and I think they’re just getting livid. I think they are angry as they can be at this, because this episode as obvious unfairness. It has obvious indecency to it.It is obviously so outside the bounds of what our normal politics are that people can’t escape this. In the process, the Drive-By Media is embarrassing itself — and it began that in earnest with their coverage being one-sided anti-Trump. But you add all of these things to the Mueller investigation. All of this time, “Trump colluded with Russia, but, no, there’s no evidence.” Every allegation the Democrat Party has made about political enemies for the last two years has had zero come to it. Nothing has come of it. The Russians didn’t cheat, didn’t help Trump.Trump didn’t cheat with the Russians. There isn’t any evidence of it. Now, the psychologically deranged left believes it, but I’m not talking about them. I still believe they are a minority. I think this episode — and particularly today, with now the “rape train” story. It’s the first time in 35 years. Nobody’s ever heard about this. We’re gonna bring a confirmation process to another screeching halt over an allegation that — like every allegation the Democrats and the media has made for two years — has nothing to it.Think about all of the stories since Trump won elected, just since then, with all of these anonymous deep state sources in the intelligence community, the law enforcement community, pretty much promising that evidence linking Trump and collusion with the Russians was immediately forthcoming. And none has been. And slowly and surely people are learning about the collusion within the FBI! They’re learning about the collusion of the FBI leadership with Hillary Clinton. This is a… To casual observers, it may hit them as a slow drip.We’ve gotten to the point where one too many slow drips is finally causing the faucet to be unleashed, because this is so far outside the bounds of what even our degraded politics has come to be in terms of normal. This is so even beyond that. This is so plain, flat-out indecent that these people can kiss their blue wave good-bye. I really do… I think that there is a simmering rage. Some of it might be at Republicans, but there is a simmering rage at Washington itself, and the Democrats are the focus of that rage. Every charge they make has nothing to it and is destroying people in the process. You wait and see if this doesn’t manifest itself somehow.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/25/female-yale-classmate-of-kavanaugh-calls-the-show/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 25, 2018RUSH: Jenny in Wyoming. Welcome. I’m glad you called.CALLER: (garbled cell) Hi, Rush. Thanks for all you do.RUSH: Thank you. Thank you very much.CALLER: So I thought it was important that I call in because just by coincidence I was at Yale the same year as Brett Kavanaugh, and I was even in the same residential college that he was a member of —RUSH: What year are we talking about here?CALLER: So from 1983 through 1987.RUSH: And you were in the same residential college?CALLER: Yes. So that —RUSH: What does that mean for us dropouts? What is a residential college?CALLER: (chuckles) They assign people to colleges. There’s twelve colleges at Yale, or now there’s one more. At the time there were twelve, and there’s about 120 at each college and it just subdivides the grouping of the students so that they know each other more closely. They live in the same dormitories —RUSH: Okay, residential. It’s where you live. Okay. I just wanted to make sure.CALLER: Yeah. They get to know each other fairly well.RUSH: Right. Okay.CALLER: So if I had to describe Brett Kavanaugh that I knew from 1983 through 1987, I would describe him with one word as “kind.” He is kind, he is gentle, he was gracious, he was thoughtful. He was never somebody I would ever think of as a quote “partier.” He was a good man, and I’m just offended that all of this coming out. I don’t associate that at all with the person that I knew.RUSH: Were you afraid of him?CALLER: He was very soft-spoken, very, very thoughtful.RUSH: Were you ever afraid of him?CALLER: Never. Never! He was gentle. A sweetheart.RUSH: Well, how…? You had to know him pretty well, I mean, to make a judgment that he was gentle and a sweetheart. You wouldn’t say that about somebody you would see walking on the quadrangle. I mean, you’d have to know them a little bit.CALLER: Right. No, we weren’t close friends or besties or anything like that. You know, he was just another person in this group of 120 that all kind of know each other. You’re the in dining hall together and —RUSH: Let me ask you this. Okay, 120 people. Were any of them, as you recall…? Was there any scuttlebutt, reputation, winks and nods, whispers, “Be careful of this Kavanaugh guy. The guy, he’s a snaky, sneaky, looks like this. But don’t be in a room alone with him”? Was there ever anything like that?CALLER: Absolutely not. And if there had been, I would have known because it was a small group of people. No! He was just a normal, nice guy.RUSH: So all of this that you’re hearing about him, it has to sound like nothing you experienced or knew. It has to sound strange and almost incomprehensible?CALLER: Exactly. I even had two reporters contact me. The Huffington Post called me yesterday and it’s so strange ’cause I live in Wyoming out in the middle of nowhere and reporters do not usually call me of all people. (giggling)RUSH: Right.CALLER: They’re trying to get dirt on him. I’ve had this happen once over the summer, and the person who called — the reporter — in the middle of the summer, when I wasn’t able to give her any dirt, she started to lead me, just like leading the witness. She started suggesting terrible things that I should say about him, and when I wasn’t able to do that she started leading me down the road. “Can I say anything negative about the groups that he participated in, you know, the clubs that he was a part of while he was at Yale?” Again, I wouldn’t say anything negative about them as well. I didn’t have anything negative to say but he was really offended. The reporters are calling me, of all people, to get negative things to come up with, and it really makes me suspicious that these women who are coming forward have had something similar to them done to them as well, that somebody’s leading them and spurring them on and urging them.RUSH: You said you had a call from the Huffing and Puffington Post yesterday?CALLER: I did.RUSH: Can you hang on? I gotta take an obscene profit break here. We’re a capitalist show. Can you hang on for a minute and we’ll come back?CALLER: (silence)RUSH: She just dropped off out there, but we get — whether you know it or not — your number. We have a deal with Google. So we’re gonna try to… I’m just kidding! I shouldn’t have said that. I just made that up. You know, I’m just trying to be flippant here with the news.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We’re back with Jenny in Wyoming, who was at Yale in residential college at the same time as Brett Kavanaugh for a number of years. Your call yesterday from the Huffing and Puffington Post, did they try the same thing yesterday? Did they try to lead you into answers they already had and were trying to get you to confirm?CALLER: Honestly, I sort of directed the conversation earlier than giving her a chance to do that. It was a very young girl. I did ask her age. She was 28 and I was thinking, “This girl doesn’t know anything. She wasn’t even around during the Clinton era. She (unintelligible) history here,” and when I talked with her about it I turned around all the questions back onto her and asked her (crosstalk) —RUSH: Give me an example of that. Give me an example of it.CALLER: So I talked about how the reporter who had called me in the summer had been very manipulative and was leading. I asked her, “What does it mean to be a journalist and are you trying to create the news that you want to hear or are you actually asking about it and wanting to learn something honest and true and what is true?” So I think I probably surprised her with some of that. But (crosstalk) —RUSH: What…? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What did she say when you asked her if she wanted to actually make news or actually learn something?CALLER: Well, the reply to that was that we have to protect these women and that they have rights, too, from the angle of defending the woman. I talked about how in my opinion Brett Kavanaugh is the victim. He is truly the one being victimized, and I asked her how it would feel if you had worked all of your life and been a good person and had been conscientious and had done the right thing and had done something, a certain moment in your career been attacked wrongly, wrongly accused and how that would make her feel. Her response was that (garbled), well, he would still have a good job anyway. (laughing)RUSH: Okay. You know what?CALLER: (unintelligible)RUSH: Jenny, thank you for letting us call you back. This has been eye-opening, and I appreciate it. Just to review, she went to Yale at the same time Brett Kavanaugh was there, same residential college. She knew him, not well or intimately, but knew him, and none of this that she’s hearing about him is anything she even thinks possible. She never saw one shred of evidence about any of it. Now, this little infobabe from the Huffing and Puffington Post calls.“What would you think?” she was asked. “What would you think if you led a great life, hadn’t done anything to anybody, and all of a sudden here comes somebody with an allegation that they can’t prove that you’ve done this.” “Well, I would still have a good job anyway, even if… if…” Well, this tells you how they’re thinking, how they’re justifying this to themselves! These reporters, particularly these young ones are saying, “Even if Kavanaugh’s kicked off the court he’s still got a great job. He’s still gonna be on the D.C. Circuit Court.”No, he’s not. This is one of the reasons Kavanaugh’s fighting so hard. Look, if it survives — if this outrage, if this perversion of truth, if this vile corruption survives — and if it is, at the end of this process, considered true that Kavanaugh is a sexual predator, how does a sexual predator stay on the D.C. Circuit? This is not just to keep him off the Supreme Court. They’re trying to ruin this man and destroy his life, reputation, career, family, and future, folks. That’s who we’re dealing with, and that’s why this vote has to happen and he has to be confirmed.This cannot go on like this!There’s way too much at stake!  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/25/the-president-endorses-my-comment-on-kavanaugh-and-the-midterms/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 25, 2018RUSH: Grab sound bite No. 33. This sound bite of me yesterday on the program talking about what’s gonna happen to the Republicans if they don’t confirm Kavanaugh was making the rounds of cable television all afternoon yesterday and now even into today, and the president even just tweeted it. The president just tweeted my comment, which means he endorses it. Look, I had no idea that it was going to be glommed onto by virtual every Drive-By Media outlet, but it has been.I said, “If Grassley waits long enough, the Democrats will come up with a woman claiming to be Kavanaugh’s secret Russian wife, that Trump paid Kavanaugh’s second wife to hire a bunch of prostitutes and urinate on the bed Obama slept in when he was in Moscow.” If they wait long enough, somebody’s gonna come up with that woman: Kavanaugh’s second wife who’s responsible for Trump prostitutes urinating on the bed in Moscow, from the dossier. Here’s CNN discussing it just moments ago on the noontime show hosted by John King…KING: You’re getting from the voice of Rush Limbaugh telling Republicans: Don’t be cowards, don’t blink.RUSH ARCHIVE: If the Republicans do not get this vote taken and have Kavanaugh confirmed, you can kiss the midterms goodbye. You can kiss goodbye holding the House and you can kiss goodbye holding the Senate. Because whatever the Democrats think of their base, the one thing I know that if you guys fold on this and cave and keep bending over backwards… You’ve done that enough. … If you guys don’t conduct this vote in defiance of all this and if Avenatti gets one foot in the door to a Senate committee to start telling his story, then you can kind of kiss good-bye Republican chances in the midterms in November.KING: A pretty honest, this-is-about-power description from Rush Limbaugh, that this is not — in the case of Professor Ford, at a minimum — about an accomplished person who has a credible allegation. Brett Kavanaugh denies it. They both deserve to be heard and treated fairly. But Rush Limbaugh’s not talking about that. He’s talking about, “You do this or else our voters won’t come out and you will lose power.”RUSH: How…? How can I be misunderstood here? This woman has had more than an opportunity to tell her story. There isn’t any evidence! (Gotta back off here.) She has no evidence! Nobody has any evidence; that used to matter! That used to be the determinant! She has no evidence! She can’t remember when! She can’t remember where! She can’t remember the people in the room and the number keeps changing! Originally, it was four people.And everybody that she’s named has denied it, including one of her friends! She doesn’t have the evidence. She doesn’t want to testify under oath! There is no reason to believe her! This is not about honesty and power. This is about the rule of law and how it’s being stood upside down in this instance because it’s been corrupted by politics since the left has injected their ideology into this. When the left gets involved in the rule of law, it changes to the accuser never has to prove anything.The accuser must be believed! The accused is automatically guilty and cannot exonerate himself no matter what he does. He should just go away and the Republicans should stop defending him. This isn’t about power, this is about politics, and it’s about the absolute bastardization of the rule of law. I also… They didn’t play it in the clip. I said as part of my statement yesterday, “Senator Grassley, you guys have done everything you could to show fairness!“You’ve offered to fly out to her when she said she was nervous about coming to Washington because she can’t fly.” Yet she somehow got to Hawaii! You have offered to have any number of ways for her to tell her story. You have made it abundantly clear you want to hear her story. You don’t have to do any more to prove your fairness and your openness. The fact of the matter is this woman was never going to testify. Her lawyers…The point is not what she has to say. It never has been. The point is to stop and derail and delay the process here, hopefully beyond the elections that the Democrats think they’re gonna win. So that then they can have a justifiable reason for not going forward with this, because they’re gonna control the House and Senate come January, and they would not confirm this guy anyway. That’s all this has ever been about is delaying and stopping.It only happens after the Democrats realized — after going through millions of pages of documents of Kavanaugh writings and utterings and sayings — that they have nothing on him. Only at the last minute did Dianne Feinstein leak this thing out, her letter, because they had exhausted every other attempt, legitimate attempt to get Kavanaugh. But he passed his own testimony with flying colors. He passed his exam.He passed six FBI background checks throughout the entire time he has been a federal judge. There is nothing that has been found to disqualify him. It’s quite the opposite. He is among the most qualified to ever be nominated for the United States Supreme Court, and that is the real problem, because he is a conservative. There is no justifiable reason to not go forward with this confirmation vote. The woman has been extended every opportunity and has failed to access and act on every I give you and opportunity.The Senate leadership has bent over and been flexible with all of the demands that her left-wing activist George Soros-funded lawyer have demanded. And after each supposed agreement, something happens, like a new accuser to make them say, “Well, wait a minute. This is becoming a circus and my client doesn’t feel safe. My client doesn’t feel secure.” Yeah, your client also didn’t want Kavanaugh in the room and wanted Kavanaugh to go first!That doesn’t happen in any decent legal proceeding or society! The accused gets his day in court. But only after he knows what he’s being accused of. And until she testifies to it, all the rest of this doesn’t mean anything. Do you think…? Let me ask you. This a logical question. Do you think Christine Blasey Ford will ever go under oath? Well, I’m just asking, because once you do that, that changes everything.If you go under oath… There’s a reason why it leaked out that she didn’t want to go under oath. You go under oath? Hello, lawyers. You go under oath and make these allegations that you can’t prove, that nobody can prove? I don’t think it has ever been the case that Christine Ford was going to testify. I don’t think they thought it would get to this point.I believe just like they thought that they would beat Trump and wipe Trump out… Just like they thought the Access Hollywood video would destroy Trump’s campaign… They thought all that they have done now with the Avenatti pile-on yesterday would force Kavanaugh for the sake of protecting his family and the rest of his life to say, “Screw this,” and withdraw his nomination. He hasn’t. He went on Fox last night and doubled down.He’s in it and he’s gonna fight it side by side with Donald Trump. That’s not supposed to happen. Kavanaugh-Trump are not behave according to the Kavanaugh script that they had dreamed of or imagined. So the idea that she hasn’t been treated fairly is not true. They have established deadlines and she has missed them, and they changed the deadline! They have given her how many additional days to show up and testify, and each deadline comes and goes and another excuse is offered as to why she can’t make it and another one is offered by Chairman Grassley.In my mind, the Republicans don’t have a thing to prove in terms of showing their fairness and their legitimate desire to hear her! The president has said it would be wonderful if she testified. The Republicans have made it abundantly clear they want to hear what she has to say. The only person who has availed themselves of the opportunities that have been offered is the doctor. Dr. Ford. For whom the red carpet has been rolled out!She refuses to even drive up to the carpet and get out of the car and show up, and I don’t think she ever intends to. Folks, she doesn’t have any evidence. That’s the one thing everybody’s forgetting. All we have here is an allegation or a series of them. The names that she’s given do not corroborate, people. She can’t remember enough specifics. We get excuses for that. “Well, that’s right, Mr. Limbaugh. She’s so traumatized, that she, uh… She, uh… You know, she worked so hard to forget this, didn’t ever want to remember it until Kavanaugh’s name was mentioned.”Well, how many years went by after Kavanaugh’s name was mentioned where this judge job and that job and so forth and she never came forward. She didn’t come forward. She wasn’t brought forward, however this happened, until the Democrats ran out of ammo. When the Democrats ran out of ammo, it’s, “Hey, DiFi, you still have that letter? This is the time to drop it,” and so it’s the Democrats who are the people that have put Christine Ford’s identity in the public domain.It is they who have made her feel unsafe and insecure. By the way, who sends a letter of allegations like this and says, “By the way, I don’t want you to do anything with this, and I don’t want you to mention my name, and I don’t want you moving this forward.” Who sends a letter like that? Do we even know, I dare ask, that she wrote this letter? Do we even know? How much do we really know? I’m asking that question not because I think anything.I’m just trying to focus everybody on how much do we know? The answer is zip! She doesn’t have any evidence. When it looked like her turn at bat wasn’t gonna produce a hit, here comes the Ramirez story from The New Yorker where we get the same thing! Nobody in that story can corroborate it. There’s not a single eyewitnesses for what Ramirez says happened! So here comes Avenatti with the “rape train” story and a promise that within 48 hours one of his victims is gonna show up and be a witness.In the midst of all of this, Republicans have demonstrated an overwhelming, inarguable opportunity after opportunity for Dr. Ford to be heard, and it is Dr. Ford who has not accepted the invitations and taken advantage of the opportunity. The Republicans have got to somehow escape the thinking that overwhelms or takes in everyone in Washington and realize how their voters are seeing this. They see this for what it is. It’s a setup. It’s been a setup from the get-go.We’ve seen it before! How many times have we seen this in one form or another? How many times have they run scams like this? Just yesterday, the news media told us for seven hours that Rosenstein was going to the White House to quit before he was fired. No. It was a regularly scheduled meeting. Rosenstein wasn’t fired, and now it might not be ’til Thursday. Now, Lisa Murkowski is starting to get wobbly out there.The Drive-Bys and the Democrats are still focusing on Susan Collins because it looks like now there’s not a single Democrat will vote for him. That’s another thing. There are a lot of Democrats that were gonna vote for Kavanaugh when this all ended. They’re from red states. They don’t want to anger the voters in those states who supported Trump by wide margins in the 2016 election. But they dredge this stuff all up, the Democrats thinking, “Hey, you know what? We’ve done so well that our red state Democrats don’t need to vote for this nominee in order to save themselves.”So now they’re focusing on Murkowski, and Murkowski… This was on CNN earlier today, one of their reporters, Manu Raju. He said, “I just asked Senator Murkowski, key Republican swing vote, if there should be a full FBI investigation into allegations from Kavanaugh’s past. Murkowski said, ‘Well, it would sure clear up all the questions, wouldn’t it?'” Uh, no. (sigh) What is there to investigate? She can’t remember where! She doesn’t know what!She doesn’t even remember the date. She’s not even sure of the year. We’re talking high school. We’re talking 35 years ago. What and how does the FBI investigate this? Anybody? (interruption) That’s right. Put Peter Strzok Smirk and Lisa Page on it and grab Andrew Weissmann from the Mueller team. By the way, I think, you know, this is not being widely commented upon, but I think that’s falling apart on ’em, too!I think the Mueller thing is about to fall apart; I think Mueller knows it! There’s nothing there! There wasn’t any collusion! Michael Flynn ought to have all of his charges dropped; he ought not spend a single day in jail. Every charge against him lying to the FBI, everything, all of that stuff should be lifted. They’re literally after all this time they’ve got nothing! The left has nothing on Trump! They’ve got nothing to Kavanaugh! And that’s not a wild guess.It is the state of play as we sit here today. Let me tell you something. If there were any evidence for this… When Kavanaugh goes on television and says, “I was a virgin all through high school and from…” Do you realize all it’s gonna take is some Democrat to find a woman who was in high school and Kavanaugh to say, “Oh, no, he wasn’t!” Don’t be surprised if they try that. (interruption)What, do you think they wouldn’t try that? (interruption) Well, the point is, why would Kavanaugh say it knowing it is so easily disproved? The Democrats go out and find anybody. What, “Drag a dollar bill through a trailer park,” James Carville said. So go to a trailer park, drag a dollar bill, and whoever takes it, bring ’em to Washington and have ’em say, “Oh no! I had sex with the guy. He was not a virgin!”BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Todd in Chapel Hill, Tennessee. I’m glad that you waited. Hi, sir. How are you?CALLER: Hey, Rush! Thank you for taking my call.RUSH: Yes, sir.CALLER: Hey, I just… I’m sure you already got it, but about 40 minutes ago President Trump tweeted your comments yesterday about Republicans can kiss the midterms good-bye.RUSH: I didn’t know that —CALLER: Oh, okay.RUSH: — until I saw your call here up on the board.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: And I started asking if what you were saying was accurate and it was. So they sent me the tweet and I now have it. So what was your reaction when you saw that?CALLER: Well, I mean, you’re exactly right. But what I wanted to ask your opinion about —RUSH: Yes.CALLER: — is do you think Republicans behind the scenes are trying to make a deal where they’ll say, “We’ll take Garland if you give us Kavanaugh in the near future”?RUSH: Where have you…? Now, what Republicans and behind what scene is this discussion happening?CALLER: Well, I’m just thinking myself because I know how Republicans are; they’re weak.RUSH: So you haven’t heard this. You conjured this up on your own?CALLER: Yes. (chuckles)RUSH: Okay. Well, the only thing I can say about it is the Republicans can talk about all this they want, but it’s the president that nominates people.CALLER: Right.RUSH: And unless he’s in on the talks… But the Democrats are… In this climate, I don’t see the Democrats going… Let me tell you the truth of something here. If Scalia had passed away in any year other than the year he did… In other words, if Obama had a Supreme Court nomination not in an election year, he would have never nominated Merrick Garland! The secret here is the Democrats would never put Merrick Garland up if there was a Supreme Court opening and it was outside an election year.If they had the White House and if they had the Senate, Merrick Garland would never be nominated by the Democrats. He’s too moderate. He’s too old. The reason Obama named Merrick Garland is because he was as close to a secret, hidden progressive as you could get that might be confirmed. The Democrats wanted Scalia’s seat! They thought Merrick Garland would pass muster with the Republicans. But the Republicans remembered the Biden Rule.See, the Democrats… The truth be known, the Democrats are having their rear ends bitten off by their own policies. Harry Reid nuked the filibuster so Supreme Court nominations can’t be filibustered. They used to be able to be filibustered, but Harry Reid blew up the filibuster so that Obama could pack the courts. Not just Supreme Court, but district courts, appellate courts, and so forth and so on. So that tool is gone, and then back when…I forget who was president. But it was a Republican was president, Supreme Court opening came up, and Joe Biden (who was at the time a senator and he might have been chairman of the Judiciary Committee at the time) said (summarized), “You can’t! A lame-duck president in the last year of his term can’t nominate Supreme Court nominees. That’s not right. That’s not right, because the people can’t vote on the president that’s gonna nominate him.”So Mitch McConnell and the boys said, “Hey, we’re simply invoked the Biden Rule here on Merrick Garland. Obama’s in his swan’s song year, and Joe Biden said way back when that you shouldn’t have a Supreme Court nomination and a confirmation battle during a presidential election year, and so the Republicans didn’t. The Democrats are fit to be tied. They think Merrick Garland was savaged and cheated out of a seat. They think they were cheated out of a seat.Republicans just used the Biden Rule, as in Joe Biden (nicknamed Joe Bite Me), the vice president for Obama. But the Democrats… This is another thing. They’re running around acting like all of this is to get even for what was done to Merrick Garland. “He was really savagely treated, unfairly treated. It was mean what the Republicans did. He was a decent guy, would have been great on the court, but the Republicans said no; so this is payback.” Well, I’m just telling you.If Obama had a chance and nominated somebody when it was not an election year, he would not have picked Merrick Garland. Merrick Garland was never gonna be on the Supreme Court. Obama would have picked somebody very young, very “progressive,” very liberal, very communist who was gonna be on that court for 40 years. It was never gonna be Merrick Garland. So don’t buy this crying over spilt milk over the savage, unfair deal that Merrick Garland got.The Republicans couldn’t make that deal anyway because Trump would have to pick Merrick Garland. You’d have to talk Trump into select Merrick Garland. The Democrats are not gonna sit by and let Kavanaugh get confirmed after all this. They’re gonna go down with the ship, whatever that means. The time to do this… I know that the Republicans are worried about Murkowski fading away and dropping off and maybe Susan Collins. But the Turtle has been pretty fired up lately. Mitch McConnell on the floor of the Senate?I mean, he reached five on the Richter scale. That’s when you and I just get up, our speed. His really fired up is how you and I feel just 30 seconds after waking up.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/25/democrats-didnt-expect-kavanaugh-to-fight-back/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 25, 2018RUSH: It gets more despicable, it gets more disgusting with the passing of each day. Judge Kavanaugh and his wife went on Fox News last night. I know there are different takes, different reactions to the interview that occurred, Martha MacCallum with Judge Kavanaugh and his wife. But I’m just gonna tell you: The fact that something like that even occurred with the subject matter that came up is itself despicable. It is just simply outrageous.It was uncomfortable to watch this. I knew exactly what was going on. And, by the way, it served a great purpose. Forget (sigh) whatever you thought of it. And I’m sure the reactions, the thoughts, the emotions to that run the gamut. But one thing that it did, I am a firm believer… Remember we had the story yesterday that this loose cannon, Avenatti, who is the lawyer for the stripper? What’s her name out there? (interruption) Stormy Daniels. Yeah, Stormy Daniels.Oh, by the way, there’s a link on the Drudge Report that says the judge in that case is ready to toss her lawsuit on Trump on the basis that Trump had every right to what he wanted to say; it can’t be actionable and so forth. The judge hasn’t thrown it out yet, but the story says that he’s on the verge of doing it. But Avenatti — as we so (sigh) disgustingly shared with you yesterday…Avenatti said that within 48 hours he was gonna produce a witness that would testify to the fact that Kavanaugh and his buddy Mark Judge got women drunk while in college. They got them drunk and gave them pills and started a “rape train” for their male buddies. He said he was gonna produce this witness in 48 hours. He was demanding to be heard by the committee. He was demanding to testify and so forth. Today, his Twitter account is locked.I’ll tell you what I think. I think much of what the left has been doing has been designed to get Kavanaugh to throw in the towel. I think they’ve wanted Kavanaugh to quit and I think they’ve been trying to get Trump to pull the nomination. So there’s Kavanaugh and his wife last night on Fox saying (summarized), “I was a virgin. I’m a good Catholic boy. I was a virgin long after high school. I didn’t do any of this stuff.” People watching this are saying, “Gee!”Oh, by the way, you know what else I’ve learned? Have you noticed (’cause I have)…? Have you noticed, watching all this, that the left and the Drive-Bys are using the word “penis” more and more and more whenever they’re discussing this kind of thing? Do know why? Apparently there’s polling data — and you women are gonna have to back this up because it’s just polling data, and you know what I think of polling data.Polling data is that women hate the word. They just despise the word, and they react negatively to the word. And that’s why this dildo story is all over the Ramirez story, Kavanaugh rubbing the dildo in the face, whatever. This is just… (Snort!) It’s so beneath… It is so beneath the so-called professed dignity and civility that the left is always demanding, and look where they’re taking us. Anyway, so I think, you know, Avenatti’s claim of a “rape train”?I think one of the purposes of that was to make and Kavanaugh’s team say, “For crying out loud, this isn’t worth it. Come on! Who are you kidding? I’m not gonna stand there and defend myself against this…” They wanted him to drop out. Now that he hasn’t — instead of dropping out, he goes on Fox and he does the interview and he spends all this time backing up his character and so forth — I don’t think that was what the left expected. I really think they thought that he was gonna bug out. They’re not in touch with reality.They really do believe — and I thought they believed — that Kavanaugh, they could make him quit and make Trump pull the nomination. I still don’t think that Christine Blasey Ford’s gonna testify Thursday. I don’t think she’s gonna ever testify. But people can disagree. But we’ve already got… You know, Feinstein is already talking about canceling the hearing on Thursday. Now they’re upset the Republicans have gone out and hired an independent female lawyer who is an expert in sexual abuse cases interviewing.The left says, “No, no, no, no! We… No, no, no, no, no. We want Republican senators doing it.” Of course they do. He want to set it up where these old white senators are berating and demeaning the and range of motion gutsy and ballsy Christine Ford, and so they’re balking. And I told you yesterday, “By the time we get there it’s gonna be ‘unsafe’ and not conducive to her testifying.” I think she’s still balking. She’s still trying to get it arranged so she wouldn’t have to go under oath and all that.Remember yesterday you couldn’t believe it when I said that I didn’t think she would testify? (interruption) You thought it was gonna happen. You still think it’s gonna happen? You just… (interruption) You just… (interruption) You just… (interruption) Yeah. Don’t doubt my track record. Don’t doubt my tract record. In the audio sound bites, my warning to Republicans that if they cave on this, that they can kiss the midterms good-bye. The Drive-Bys loved it. It was all over cable news yesterday afternoon and last night.Now, folks, before getting into any more specifics of this particular incident — and there are updates, of course — there are two pieces here that I want to share with you that are I think foundational in terms of helping to understand what we’re up against. What has become of the American left? Who is the American left? Why are they the way they are? I have opined recently that decent people just don’t have any idea how to deal with this.Decent people do not wallow in muck. Decent people do not sit around and try to anticipate what’s gonna come next from the indecent among us. They live their lives. They try to do the best they can. Everybody faces obstacles in life. They do their best at overcoming them. Some do well; some don’t. But decent people are not obsessed with what’s coming next week from the indecent side, and the indecent side is devoted to nothing but shock and awe as a means of forcing their indecency and perversion and all on society and having it accepted as normal.I have been back and forth in my mind trying to come up with ways to explain what I think the left is, who they are. And the closest I’ve come to it is my detailed and inarguable explanations and definitions of victimhood, victimology, and how we got there and what it means for society at large.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/24/the-threats-sent-to-the-kavanaugh-family-will-make-you-sick/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 24, 2018RUSH: I have here a screenshot of something I saw on Fox News.This would have been a couple/three days and nights ago, and it is a sample of emails that Amy Kavanaugh is receiving. The mainstream media is not reporting any of this. If it weren’t for Fox News, this would never have appeared on TV. There are three excerpts of three emails sent to Amy Kavanaugh, and I’m gonna read them to you. I’m gonna give you a countdown. I’m not gonna say the unmentionable words, but you’ll know what they are.But if you’re listening with young ears that you don’t want to hear, I’m gonna count down from five, and you should turn the radio off for, like, 45 seconds and come back. Ready? Five… Four… Remember, when I get to one, if you still listen and you find it objectionable and complain, it will fall on deaf ears because you have been warned. Ready? Three… Two… One… Email sent to Amy Kavanaugh: “Please tell your rapist, lying, cheating, corrupt b—h of a husband to put a bullet in his ugly f—–g skull.” Another email to Amy Kavanaugh: “Hey b—h, did you know your husband was a rapist before you married him?”Another email to Amy Kavanaugh: “YOUR HUSBAND IS A LIAR, THIEF, RAPIST AND PROBABLY A PEDOPHILE. BURN IN HELL…” What was the proudest day in the Kavanaugh family’s life was ruined by a circus of protesters welcomed into the hearing room by the Democrat Party. Remember the picture of Mr. and Mrs. Kavanaugh, the parents, with their heads buried in their hands? They were ashamed on the day that should have been one of the proudest days of their lives. The left: smile, with laughter and with glee. Kavanaugh’s young daughters were there and had to witness it as well, not to mention his wife.Now Democrat voters are sending this stuff to Brett Kavanaugh’s wife, and still they hang in for this nomination because Brett Kavanaugh is a patriot, in addition to being a brilliant scholar and legal mind. My point is exactly this: This is the Democrat base, and they are demanding this treatment of Kavanaugh. The Democrat Party expects to be rewarded by their base with massive turnout. They believe independents are so outraged at what Kavanaugh has done — they’re so mad at what Kavanaugh has gotten away with — they can’t wait to show up and vote against him.Everybody wants to vote against Kavanaugh really because everybody hates Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Donald Trump draws tens of thousands of people at every rally he attends with double that number outside unable to get in. Barack Obama can’t draw more than 700 people to his rallies, and I’m not making that up. It’s 700 people max. And then Michael Moore. Michael Moore has this new movie called Fahrenheit 11/9. I guess he’s run out of creativity.Fahrenheit 9/11 was his first movie, anti-Bush. It did well, got an Oscar for the thing. So time to go back to the drawing board, rework it for Trump. Fahrenheit 11/9. Guess what? Up there at the Toronto Film Festival, it’s voted the eighth or ninth best flick of all of those that were shown, and its opening weekend tanked at $3 million taken in with over a thousand screens. Now, does that add up to a big blue wave?I mean, you would think that these Democrats demanding this kind of depraved behavior from their elected Democrats, cannot wait to get out there and vote. Then why aren’t they showing up for Moore’s movie? And why aren’t more than 700 showing up for the great Obama as he embarks on whatever he’s doing? Yeah, Michelle Obama supposedly doing pretty well on the book tour. But note that Michelle Obama’s totally into Michelle Obama, not this other stuff. She’s out selling herself, not bashing Trump per se by design and by purpose. So I don’t know. Is there a backlash out there that’s waiting to be? Are decent women fed up with what the Democrats are doing or not?You hope, but you just don’t know.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Samantha. Samantha in Franklin, Tennessee. You’re next. It’s great to have you with us. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Rush. It’s really a pleasure to speak with you.RUSH: Thank you.CALLER: I agree completely that she will not be there Thursday because how can you go under oath and then the answer to every question be “I don’t know –”RUSH: Wait a minute.CALLER: “– I don’t know. I don’t remember.”RUSH: Wait, wait, wait, wait. You may be more informed than I — which on this, is possible ’cause I’ve gotten so ticked off at this story that their aspects of it I’m avoiding because I don’t think she gonna be there, either.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: Has she agreed to testify under oath? Remember her original conditions were not under oath, and she wanted to go last. She wanted Kavanaugh to go first, which again turns presumed innocence upside down.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: She had all these conditions, and one of them was not under oath. So do we know for sure that she has agreed to testify under oath?CALLER: Well, I guess not. (laughing) But how else can…? So here’s the thing with me. For a visual… So the reason why they don’t want a lawyer questioning here is they need the visual of the mean, vicious Republicans not believing her. You know, and something may well have happened to this woman. You know, I’m a woman. Stuff has happened to me. I get it. But there’s level of, at this point, they have pushed it to where we have to have that visual.RUSH: I agree with that.CALLER: Regular human beings (unintelligible).RUSH: They want to get even for Anita Hill, in addition to everything else.CALLER: Yes. Yes. But, see, I’m… You know, everything I read, which is all speculation, all of it, but when you start thinking about it, they have to have the visual know the visual of the mean Republican, old white men speaking to her. They have to have —RUSH: I don’t think they need it. I think in their minds, all they have to do is say, “You know, she’s not gonna show up. She can’t! Now that this has turned into a circus, she can’t. She knows she’d be mistreated by the Republicans.” It’s all they gotta say, in their minds. The press is off and running with it, reporting is as though it already happened. Look, I got to go because of time. I appreciate it. Amy Kavanaugh might be one of Kavanaugh’s daughters. I thought it was his wife. But the emails are still accurate.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Oh, by the way. Apparently, I erred, ladies and gentlemen. I assumed that Amy Kavanaugh was Kavanaugh’s wife, the recipient of those despicable, disgusting, insulting emails. Actually, Amy Kavanaugh must be one of his daughters, which makes it actually even worse. His wife’s name is Ashley.Of course, when I make a mistake… You know, it is so infrequent that when I make a mistake, people just jump all over it. They jump in there! They start pointing fingers. They tell everybody. Most people are allowed to learn from their mistakes. Not I. No, no. When I make ’em, it’s a serious, serious breach. I wouldn’t even call that a mistake. I mean, that was just an incorrect assumption. The substance, however, was not changed by whoever was sent those emails.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/24/kavanaughs-letter-to-the-committee-i-will-not-be-intimidated/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 24, 2018RUSH: In this letter that Kavanaugh has written — and the White House released this. So this is not Kavanaugh independently. The White House is standing by Kavanaugh.Trump is standing by Kavanaugh. In this letter to Grassley and Feinstein, Kavanaugh says, “I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out.” It begins, “Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: When I testified in front of the Senate three weeks ago, I explained my belief that fair process is foundational to justice and to our democracy.“At that time, I sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee for more than 31 hours and answered questions under oath. I then answered more questions at a confidential session. The following week, I responded to more than 1,200 written questions, more than have been submitted to all previous Supreme Court nominees combined.” Twelve hundred! One-thousand-two-hundred questions! That’s “more than have been submitted to all previous Supreme Court nominees combined.“Only after that exhaustive process was complete did I learn, through the news media, about a 36-year-old allegation from high school that had been asserted months earlier and withheld from me throughout the hearing process. First, it was an anonymous allegation that I categorically and unequivocally denied. Soon after the accuser was identified. I repeated my denial on the record and made clear that I wished to appear before the committee. I then repeated my denial to committee investigators — under criminal penalties for false statements.“I asked to testify before the committee again under oath as soon as possible, so that both Dr. Ford and I could both be heard. I thank Chairman Grassley for scheduling that hearing for Thursday. Last night, another false and uncorroborated accusation from 35 years ago was published. Once again, those alleged to have been witnesses to the event deny it ever happened. There is now a frenzy to come up with something — anything — that will block this process and a vote on my confirmation from occurring.“These are smears, pure and simple. And they debase our public discourse. But they are also a threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination — if allowed to succeed — will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service.” That’s right, and that’s exactly what the left wants. Make no mistake. The left would be happy if all decent people punted and said, “I want nothing to do with government.” Nothing would make them happier.Judge Kavanaugh is exactly right about that. He continues, “As I told the committee during my hearing, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. That is the kind of judge I will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out.“The last-minute character assassination will not succeed. I have devoted my career to serving the public and the cause of justice, and particularly to promoting the equality and dignity of women. Women from every phase of my life have come forward to attest to my character. I am grateful to them. I owe it to them, and to my family, to defend my integrity and my name. I look forward to answering questions from the Senate on Thursday. Sincerely, Brett M. Kavanaugh.”Well, he may be there, but he’ll be the only witness. Meaning, I don’t think Dr. Ford will show up — and particularly now. She’s got more reason not to show up. “Kavanaugh simply refuses to go away! Kavanaugh simply will not admit it. Therefore, I can’t! I can’t… I can’t… I don’t feel safe with him there. No, I can’t. I won’t. Especially since Kavanaugh gets to go last.” How about her stipulated conditions? (summarized) “Not under oath. Kavanaugh goes first. Kavanaugh can’t be in the room when I am.”Yeah, it was a demand! If they agreed to that… Well, they didn’t. They haven’t. (Ahem.) They didn’t. But that’s what I meant in the first hour. They are standing… I don’t know any other way to say it. America, the United States of America is an exceptional, different, and unique country for a host of reasons. At the top of the list of those reasons is our system of justice. The rule of law. The rule of law is what equalizes everybody in the eyes of justice — which are blind, by definition.And it is fundamental in our system that anybody accused is presumed innocent and the people doing the accusing have to prove it. In tinhorn dictatorships, in communist countries and totalitarian regimes, it is true that the accused is automatically guilty. This is what the left seeks, particularly in politicized events, and since they’ve politicized everything, this is what they seek. Once accused, a conservative is guilty and will be denied (if they can do it) a chance to prove innocence.But regardless, the accused is guilty. The accuser need not provide evidence. The accuser need not provide corroboration. The word of the accuser is all that is needed, particularly in politicized events involving men and women. That stands America on its head. If that ever became our rule of law, that would be the end of the rule of law. It’d be the end of America as you and I know it in the criminal justice system. It would be the end of any effort to exonerate oneself against any charge, false, legitimate, what have you.The burden has always been on the accuser, the prosecutor to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. What the left is angling for is outside of court, the establishment that in politicized events the accuser is always right because they are always going to be the accusers. It is part of their politics to accuse their opponents of crimes. Including, thinking differently is a crime. Being conservative has become a crime on the left — a prosecutable, punishable offense.Witness A for this is Brett Kavanaugh. Prior to him, it was Judge Bork. Then came Clarence Thomas. So the American justice system is in the process of being stood upside down, and it’s been taking place in our educational system. I don’t know how many generations. At least one. You know, a generation is 20 to 25 years. So maybe, maybe as many as two generations of young people have been taught today that the American system of justice is destroying conservatives.Conservatives equal old white men who need to shut up finally and go away and let everybody clean up the mess that they have made of the world! So the American system of justice, as taught to young skulls full of mush, is destroying conservatives, however and whenever. That is what young people have been taught justice is, and that’s why such treatment of Kavanaugh is applauded. It’s considered to be justice, because Kavanaugh’s guilty. He’s a conservative, and that means he did whatever the left thinks of all conservatives.“He did it because he’s conservative! Conservatives abuse women. Conservatives oppose women and minorities. Conservatives want you to suffer. Conservatives this and that.” This is what people have been taught. I want to ask some of you a question. I know you’ll never be able to answer it, but I just want you to see the answer for yourselves in your lives. I got a note recently from a new grandmother. A woman’s daughter has just given birth to twins, and the woman told me that her daughter’s friends — not her daughter ’cause her daughter’s twins were girls.She told me that young Millennial new mothers feel very bad that their children are boys in the age of Weinstein and all of these sexual abusers. Now, stop and think about that. They are disappointed that their child is a boy. Now, these are women who had the baby; so I know what you’re thinking. “Well, maybe they might start aborting.” Yeah, nothing would surprise me on that side of the score. But just the fact that because of media coverage of Weinstein representing all men… See, this is what the left does!Weinstein… Even though he’s a liberal Democrat, even though he’s a Clintonista, Weinstein has come to represent all men. Ditto, Leslie Moonves at CBS. They’re all liberal Democrats. Bill Clinton, liberal Democrat. These are all guys who did it! Bill Cosby, liberal Democrat! They’re all liberal Democrats. The guys who did it! Clarence Thomas didn’t do it. Kavanaugh didn’t do it. But because of the coverage of this by the Drive-Bys — and no doubt what these women were taught in women’s studies classes — they now feel remorseful that their child is a little boy.They were heard to say that they’re gonna have to work really hard to raise a good young man. This is how subtle it is. So young mothers think that they are raising young predators in waiting, and they’re frightened by it. Now, who could make that happen? Who could cause that kind of an attitude among young mothers? Yep! That’s right. The American left and the Drive-By Media. Anyway, as to Brett Kavanaugh, thank God for his spine. Thank God for his backbone and his stick-to-itiveness and his… Well, he likes himself.He’s not ashamed, he’s not embarrassed, he’s got nothing to apologize for — and he is a perfect nominee from Donald Trump in this regard. It will have no effect on the left, by the way. They will twist and turn his letter into confirmation that the allegations are true. “Why else would he be so panicked?” they will say. “Why else would he go to such great lengths to defend himself if it weren’t true?” they will say. I’ve been there. I’ve seen it. This is how they react.“Look! We got Kavanaugh! He wrote a letter. He’s now denying it. That means we got him,” and they’ll start on this new thing that Kavanaugh has now admitted his culpability with this flat-out denial. “He must be worried that people are believing it,” they will say. That’s how it all works. I understand also that Senator Orrin Hatch is really, really angry at all of this last-minute charade behavior going on by the accusers and their sponsors. I hope he’s not the only one.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/24/gop-must-confirm-kavanugh-or-kiss-midterms-goodbye/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 24, 2018RUSH: So Chairman Grassley has a job to do here, because, if he gives Democrats enough time, they’ll produce a woman claiming to be Kavanaugh’s secret Russian wife who Trump paid to urinate on that bed in Moscow. If Grassley waits long enough, the Democrats will come up with the woman claiming to be Kavanaugh’s secret Russian wife. — he’s a bigamist, too, don’t you know — and Trump paid Kavanaugh’s second wife to hire a bunch of prostitutes to urinate on the bed Obama slept in while in Moscow.If Grassley doesn’t get a handle on this and just do — and I’ll tell you something else, which everybody also knows. If the Republicans do not get this vote taken and have Kavanaugh confirmed, you can kiss the midterms goodbye. You can kiss goodbye holding the House and you can kiss goodbye holding the Senate. Because whatever the Democrats think of their base, the one thing I know that if you guys fold on this and cave and keep bending over backwards… You’ve done that enough. You’ve demonstrated that you don’t hate women.You’ve demonstrated that you’re open minded. You’ve demonstrated that you’re gonna hear from her. You’re never gonna hear from her! She’s never gonna show up. She’s not telling a story that can be verified, Senator Grassley. She’s not gonna show up. If you guys don’t conduct this vote in defiance of all this and if Avenatti gets one foot in the door to a Senate committee to start telling his story, then you can kind of kiss good-bye Republican chances in the midterms in November. Because people are gonna logically say, “What good does it do?”  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/20/trump-flipped-the-script-with-reaction-to-kavanaugh-accuser/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 20, 2018RUSH: So I’m just watching CNN. I want to be able to explain this to you exactly as I just heard this. So I’m watching an infobabe report from the White House to Wolf Blitzer at CNN. The thrust of her report is how shocked — get this, now — how shocked and stunned Trump’s aides are at how respectful he’s been to the accuser. Not the media and others, but the people that work for Trump. This infobabe said the people who work for Trump in the White House, Trump’s aides, have been blown away by how polite and accepting and gentle and nice he has been to the accuser.They were stunned by it. And then she said that Trump has noticed that the coverage he’s getting on this has been that much better precisely because he’s been a nice guy toward the accuser. So Trump aides told CNN that they now expect this to affect Trump in the long term, that he’s going to now try to be a nice guy as often as he can because he likes the media coverage. Then she said to Wolf Blitzer, “But, Wolf, the real reason the president is so happy is because he is not the accused.“The president is used to being the accused in these sexual harassment matters, and he’s just so grateful that he’s not the accused, that he is treating this in a responsible and reasonable way.” And then she said (chuckles) but this could all blow up on the president tonight because, Wolf, as we know, the president will be leaving in a short while for a rally in Las Vegas where he’s going to be stumping for a Senate candidate out there. And as you know, Wolf, at these rallies is where the president is unscripted and goes off message and has a tendency to be who he really is.Implying that all of this niceness and politeness to the accuser could go out the window tonight when Trump goes off script and he could once again start insulting everybody left and right. So we’ll just have to keep a sharp eye on it, Wolf. You know, the president gets in these rallies with his supporters, and they egg him on, and he loves it, and he likes saying things that gets them all worked up. I was laughing myself silly. I just broad smile on my face watching this. And Trump…You know, they talked about Obama — the left did and the media did — trying to tell us that Obama is so much smarter than everybody that we just can’t keep up, that if life is a game of chess, you know, he’s five or six moves ahead of everybody, that nobody can play in his league. We’re just lucky. We’re lucky to be among the countenance and the aura of Barack Hussein Obama. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you who’s five or six moves ahead of people, and that’s Trump. They are the ones shocked, not Trump’s aides.They are shocked at Trump’s behavior here — and I’ll bet you, I will bet you that part of the calculus here — because this accuser is not alone, folks. She didn’t come alone. She didn’t spring up alone. She didn’t decide to do this in a vacuum. Just like Anita Hill. There’s a silent group of people, an army behind the accuser who are helping and cajoling and directing and producing. I guarantee you — do not doubt me on this — that one of the things they thought they had going for them in having this woman come forward would be that Trump would savage her.I will guarantee you that’s what they thought. I will guarantee you that’s what they planned for. I will guarantee you that’s what they expected and hoped, that when this, ’cause Trump loves his nominees. He loves Kavanaugh. They were convinced that Trump would take this attack on his nominee personally as though it were an attack on him and he would lash out and he would start insulting via Twitter and anywhere else what he thinks of this woman.They figured that if they could get Trump to do that, it would further the objective of getting rid of Kavanaugh. ‘Cause I think they have been hoping that Trump or somebody close to him would start — for lack of a better word — trashing Christine Blasey Ford. I think they were expecting some Republicans to do that. And, by the way, I think we’ve been expecting some in the media to do that. (Ahem. Ahem. Ahem!) I think they have been openly monitoring — by the second — waiting for any even outrageously wrong example where anybody in conservative media could be said to be speaking disrespectfully, unseriously, insultingly, or whatever.I have no doubt, ’cause I know these people. I have no doubt that has been part of the calculus. So many things here that they counted on are not happening. The president is not ridiculing her. The president is not treating her with disrespect. The president is not insulting her and neither is anybody else. The Republicans have made it plain they’re eager to hear what she has to say. Trump himself has said her testifying would be wonderful; he wants to hear it. The president’s even said that if she’s credible, that his nominee would be in trouble.Grassley has tried every which way to cajole her into speaking, offered her behind closed doors, on the record, off the record. He even volunteered to go out to where she is. They bent over backwards to let her know they want to know what she has to say and that they will listen to it, and they’ve done so with tremendous respect for her. What’s it led to? It’s led to Mazie Hirono flipping out and starting to use curse words about the Republicans and men in general.Kirsten Gillibrand could barely keep it together. These Democrats are going bonkers ’cause they’re not getting the expected behavior they wanted from Trump or the Republicans in the Senate or some in the media. They were hoping people would jump all over this woman like some did Anita Hill, and it just isn’t happening. So the strategerizing that they did in their calculations of whether or not to do this?They really counted on a boorish, mean-spirited reaction to this woman from Republicans that they are not getting — and now the onus has flipped and the onus is now on Christine Blasey Ford to show up and start testify, and she won’t do it, and that’s why… Grab audio sound bite No. 6. David “Rodham” Gergen, he’ll be followed by Jeffrey Toobin last night on CNN. Gergen on with Erin Burnett talking about whether she should testify on Monday.GERGEN: I do think that she should come and testify under protest and to —COOPER: Mmmph!GERGEN: — lay out the case why it’s unfair, to ask for some more time, and then lay out her — her views. There are an awful lot of women this country who — who are pulling for her, and I think she has some… She’s taken on some responsibilities as a citizen to her fellow women to make the best case she can for why this is being railroaded through, why it was inappropriate, this wasn’t fair, why she did what she did. She could be a very sympathetic witness.RUSH: See? See. She has a duty… What is this? “She has a duty to her fellow women, as a citizen, responsibilities as a citizen to her fellow women.” It’s sad that we are becoming so segregated here by virtue of surface things — skin color, gender. Well, that’s not surface, but all this identity predicts stuff. We’re not unified. We’re going the exact opposite way and it’s assisted along by this kind of thinking. “Fellow women.”Letting down her fellow women? That’s the point. I guarantee you David “Rodham” Gergen wouldn’t be saying any of this if they had gotten the expected reaction they hoped from President Trump or from any Republican. Just a single, just one Republican senator, all one Republican senator they don’t come out and start questioning her honesty and all that and it would have been over. But they studiously avoided this. So the Democrats haven’t gotten what they wanted out of this so far, especially her testifying.There isn’t any testimony.All there is is a letter that Feinstein won’t even let Grassley see!Have you heard that? Grassley has been asking Feinstein to let him see her original letter, and she will not produce it for him. This is the ranking member of this committee! She’s got the letter that started all this, and she won’t let the other committee members on the Republican side see it! So we don’t have any testimony! We just have a letter that Grassley can’t even see because she won’t show it to him. Here’s Jeffrey Toobin last night with Anderson Cooper, who said, “Both sides clearly seem to be digging their heels in here, Jeffrey.”TOOBIN: That’s true! And I think there is a factual matter that is worth putting out on the table. If she refuses to testify on Monday, Kavanaugh is getting confirmed. If she, you know, maintains that this investigation is a sham and I’m not taking part, he is getting confirmed. Now, that may be unfair. That may not a good thing or bad thing. I think that’s just a factual thing. If she does testify, then he think all the cards are up in the air. He may well be confirmed anyway. But I think everybody should be clear about what the stakes are of her decision to come forward or not before the committee.RUSH: See? They’re starting to have doubts. Now they’re starting to talk about Kavanaugh. “He might be confirmed anyway!” This has not played out the way they thought it would. It has not played out the way they structured it. By the way, folks, do not doubt me on this. None of this that’s happening here is improv. Every bit of this was orchestrated with her original lawyer playing a central role, this Debra Katz. She’s a longtime Democrat activist and fundraiser, and all these people have ties that go way back to both the Clintons and Obama.None of this is improv. This woman did not write this letter without anybody knowing it was gonna happen, and Dianne Feinstein didn’t receive this letter not knowing it was coming and then when she got this letter kept it to herself. This is a plan that has… In fact, we had a caller earlier this week, and I actually have been thinking about this. I think that this whole thing here might actually have had its origins during the Romney presidential campaign when Romney was the first to mention Kavanaugh as a possible Supreme Court pick.And I think once his name surfaced officially in that regard, the Democrats get in gear and start laying the groundwork for their destruction campaign for any nominee that any Republican might name — and that would go back to 2012. Don’t believe that any of this is improv. Don’t believe it just happened. Very little of what happens on the left, particularly with media involvement, happens spontaneously or any kind of improvisationally.This is all part of a campaign. Everything they do is. So when Karen Tumulty says that it’s a long time between now and Monday, and there could be additional people that pop up. Like there could be further evidence of people speaking up for Kavanaugh. There could be other women between now and Monday who say that it happened to them. Let me ask you this. You think if the Democrats are gonna hatch this plan and they’ve strategized. They expect Trump to respond in a certain way, it’s gonna help them, and he hasn’t.They expect conservative media to respond a certain way to help ’em; we haven’t. They expect Republicans to somehow start trashing her. It hasn’t happened. Do you think that they don’t have somebody in the bullpen? Do you think they’ve always had somebody in the bullpen? ‘Cause, believe me, this… I don’t know how else to say it, but this is not a spontaneous thing that caught everybody by surprise. I mean, even the people on the left.So when you have a Drive-By Media specialist, a veteran who has been in there many, many moons talking about the possibility that there could be other women, it’s a pretty safe bet she already knows that they are. If there are, they are part of the plan too. Now, it could be that they’ve had to improvise since it hasn’t gone their way. They maybe have had to go find a couple in the past week or so. But now the Democrats and the media starting to get a little depressed here. She’s letting down her fellow women.She owes it to her fellow women as a citizen to come testify — and even if she does, Kavanaugh may be confirmed anyway, said David “Rodham” Gergen. No! That was Toobin. And one other bite. This is Fran Townsend, Fran Townsend national security adviser, defense specialist and so forth all the way back to the George W. Bush administration. She was on CBS today. She’s a counterterrorism adviser, and she was talking to Gayle King who said, “As a former federal prosecutor, Fran, would you put a witness on the stand without some type of investigation?”TOWNSEND: I’d take you back to the Anita Hill example; right?KING: Mmm-hmm!TOWNSEND: That’s an example where President George H. W. Bush did reopen the investigation based on her allegations, and look at how those 302s were used. It were used… It was a brutal, brutal cross-examination of her in public. I’m not sure that’s a model we’d really want to follow.KING: Are you saying an FBI investigation might actually not even be helpful to her at this point?TOWNSEND: That’s exactly right! Look, and I don’t think it’s helpful. You know, she’d asked for — she through her lawyer as asked for — this FBI investigation, and I think it makes her look political. I feel for her. It’s taken real courage for her to step up here. But I think she ought to tell her story.RUSH: “She ought to tell her story.” Yeah, what is this business of wanting the FBI to look into it? Could it be that people on the left now look at the FBI as simply another arm of their political operation and they see the FBI as a bunch of sympathetic supporters, and so calling for the FBI to investigate is like calling for Peter Strzok to start looking for spies in the Trump campaign after he’s planted them there?I wouldn’t doubt that, either, these people thinking they now own the FBI based on what we’ve all learned the FBI did trying to screw Trump. So if her advisers are of the opinion the FBI is on her side, then damn, yeah! Call for an FBI investigation. Fran Townsend said (summarized), “Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You just never know what’s gonna turn up in one of those things, and once the FBI starts poking around, you can’t say, ‘Ah, sorry! I really don’t want to talk to you,’ when you’re the one who asked for it.”  "

They believe their polls. They don’t have the slightest idea what a potential backlash they are creating with their behavior here and what they’re doing to Kavanaugh. They haven’t the slightest idea. They have no idea of the rage! They think the Democrats have all the motivation and inspiration, eagerness to vote?They have no idea what this is doing to Republican turnout. No idea at all. We saw a harbinger of it in a Texas special election last night where a Republican won a Democrat seat that the Democrats have held for 139 years, and the polls did not say this was gonna happen. Democrats think they’re in the process turning Texas blue, and yet this one seat that they’ve held in a district that went heavily for Hillary elected a Republican.They’re sitting there blind as a bat. They have no concept, they have no sense, because they’re not connected to the American people. They have no idea how their behavior here is revving up Republicans to vote in November like nothing else could! You wait. We’ll see.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Last night on the Fox News Channel The Ingraham Angle, the host, Laura Ingraham had pollster Frank Luntz on there asking him about the allegations against Kavanaugh and how is it gonna play in the midterms. Her question to Luntz, “From the people you’re talking to out there, Frank, how will it this Kavanaugh circus play out in midterms?”LUNTZ: It does appear she isn’t gonna testify. The American people believe in fairness and they believe that everyone deserves their day in court. They want to hear what she had to say. She leveled some very, uh, strong allegations. But I’ll tell you that one of the big questions among the men I talked to is how far back are you going to hold someone accountable for the behavior that they did? Is what someone did when you’re 17…? Is that applicable to what someone’s life will be when they’re in their fifties.RUSH: Yeah, it’s a great, great question. Remember Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill she was alleging activity that occurred 10 years prior. This is 36 priors when both are in high school, for crying out loud. The first thing that should have disqualified it, the first thing that should have. Anyway, Luntz says that he senses the American people out there really think all this is unfair and could bode poorly for the Democrats. Next thing, Ingram of The Ingraham Angle said, “You know, I think that word ‘fairness’ that you use, that cuts right to it. You can’t lob these allegations and expect that you won’t get any questions about yourself because people are being mean to you online!”LUNTZ: That’s why the Democrats have used Anita Hill, because they realized within 24 hours that this story was turning, that people were starting to wonder why is she backing off? Why? When you make a claim as significant of this, that you’re not willing to back it up at that hearing. What you could have is what happened to Donald Trump in 2016. You know he won a majority of white women — and everyone thought that because of what had happened during the campaign, he would crater. In this situation, you may see women angry that they’re being used, that they’re being scapegoated, that they’re being pulled into a political process that they want no part of. Make no mistake: Authenticity matters more than anything in 2016 [sic], and this doesn’t seem authentic right now.RUSH: And the reason for that is that she won’t show up and testify, and people don’t understand that. They can offer all excuses that they want. But she wrote… You know, she needs more time because she’s been trying to forget this? She wrote this in quite a detailed fashion in the Washington Post. See, this is where… I’m sorry. There’s a lot of this that I question. I question this idea that she’s been trying to forget it all of her life and is now being forced into remembering it.If anybody’s doing that, that process was started by Democrats — which is gonna be lost on everybody. But she’s been working on remembering this since the beginning of June! And if she didn’t to want remember it, if she didn’t want this, why send Feinstein the letter in the first place? There’s so much of this that doesn’t pass a smell test just in terms of common sense and believability.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, my friends, there’s one other thing that about this that flies in the face of my prediction of the Democrats creating a major backlash here and that is a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The Reuters/Ipsos poll says that the public support for Kavanaugh is at its all-time low, that the American people’s support for Kavanaugh is dwindling. Opposition to Kavanaugh is growing; his support is at an historic low.“A growing number of Americans said they opposed President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, as the candidate’s confirmation hearings took place and as he fended off a sexual assault claim… The September 11-17 poll found that 36% of adults surveyed did not want Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court, up 6 points from a similar poll conducted a month earlier. Only 31% of U.S. adults polled said they were in favor of Kavanaugh’s appointment.”Now, I want you to think about something. We’re talking here about one of the foremost legal scholars in the country, acknowledged by people from across the political spectrum. We’re talking about somebody with impeccable integrity and honor as testified to by everybody that knows him. We’re talking about an appellate court judge whose opinions are cited often by Supreme Court justices in their opinions. We’re talking about an appellate court judge whose clerks with hired by Supreme Court justices more than any other judge’s clerks.We’re talking about perhaps one of the judicial minds of a lifetime, a man who has led an unquestioned life of decency until this smear campaign started. Yet Reuters has a poll that says two-thirds of the country does not think he’s fit to be on the Supreme Court. Now, what does that mean? If we believe this poll, if this poll is accurate, all that is really shows… It doesn’t show what people know about Kavanaugh. What it shows is the power of the media over reality or it shows the power of the media and their ability to use polls to create news, to shape public opinion rather than reflect it. Only 31% of adults in the Reuters poll think Kavanaugh’s worth being on the court, 36% don’t, and in terms of the just textbook qualifications, there isn’t anybody better.  "

This is what I saw. I wasn’t able to hear any of it because it was happening while I was on the program. But they’re bringing out friends now of the accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, and CNN just had one of them up there. This woman’s name is Samantha Guerry (spelled G-u-e-r-r-y), an ex-classmate of Dr. Ford. Jim Acosta is Acosta-ing her in this particular appearance.He said, “What Dr. Ford is alleging, is this the first time you heard anything like that about Judge Kavanaugh?”GUERRY: It’s not the first time I’ve heard anything like that in terms of the community of women I know, and not regarding him but —ACOSTA: Those sorts of things went on?GUERRY: A lot… You know, one of the things that’s surprising to me as I’ve gotten involved in this in the last couple days is how many women of my class have come forward to me in this last few days and said, “I had similar experiences in high school,” and this hits me very deeply and it’s very —ACOSTA: Not with Brett Kavanaugh, but with other boys?GUERRY: Not with Brett Kavanaugh! But with other boys in our community, and we all feel that if we were in her shoes, we’d want (chuckles) to be taken seriously as well.RUSH: Not Brett Kavanaugh! But now a bunch of other nameless guys are on the verge of being dragged through the mud here. But not Brett Kavanaugh. This again is Samantha Guerry being interviewed on CNN. “Well, it’s not the first time I’ve heard anything like that in terms of the community of women that I know. Not regarding him, but — A lot… You know, those things went on and one of the things that’s been surprising to me as I’ve gotten involved in this is how many women of my class have come forward to me in this last few days and said, ‘I had similar experiences in high school.'”All right. You know, this one-way street business has gotta stop. Can I ask you guys a question? I’m not gonna get any answers. I’m not asking for phone calls. Well, if you want to call, you could try. I want to know something. You guys, all of you at some point — except you reprobates and dropouts. Everybody was in high school. I just want to ask: How many of you guys at a party or at any other time minding your own business found a girl’s hand in your crotch?How often did that happen? Once, twice? Did it? How often did you find yourself minding your own business and some girl comes sidling up to you and starts behaving in ways that made you feel uncomfortable? I’m seeing a lot of hands shoot up out there. And I would love to tell you the difference but not in this day and era. (chuckles) Dawn’s in there… (interruption) What are you shaking your head for? (interruption) You don’t think that’s very prevalent?You don’t think that’s very prevalent? You don’t think targeting junk and going for it is very prevalent in high school? Okay. All right. That just means you didn’t. But I’m just asking. You know, this one-way street business out here. Now we’ve got Samantha Guerry, who is saying, “Well, you know, one thing that’s been surprising to me as I’ve gotten involved in this in the community is how many women of my class have come forward to me and said, ‘I had similar experiences,’ and this hit me very deeply.“Uh, not Brett Kavanaugh! Other boys. (stammering) But — but — but — but — but — but — but not Brett Kavanaugh.” You notice here the friend, she doesn’t want get anywhere near naming Kavanaugh. Now, that’s what I take. Obviously, you have Samantha Guerry who wants to support her bud, her BFF, Christine Blasey Ford. But she’s not getting anywhere near naming Kavanaugh. You note? That’s the take-away here. In fact, she makes it very clear not Kavanaugh.When she has described all these other women who have experienced identical things: “Uh, uh, uh. Not Brett Kavanaugh!” She doesn’t know anything about that. Did Christine Blasey Ford not tell her with Kavanaugh, describe this stuff? Did Christine Blasey Ford not tell her anything and she’s now just learning as other women in the community come forward and say, “Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!” Okay. “But not with Brett Kavanaugh! Not with Brett Kavanaugh.” It would have been an ideal time to say, “Oh, yeah. Brett Kavanaugh was widely known.”But she didn’t, did she?She makes a point here.She wants to be perfectly clear she didn’t know a thing about Brett Kavanaugh even when she’s describing what this stuff that happened was, “Not Brett Kavanaugh. Not him.”  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/19/abortion-at-root-of-kavanaugh-attack/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 19, 2018RUSH: Let’s review something that I said because there are many reasons why this is happening, and some of them are coequals. The primary reason is to delay the confirmation because they don’t want Kavanaugh on the court because of his judicial qualifications and beliefs.They also don’t want any conservative on the court because they really want to be able to maintain control over a woman’s womb, and they want to be able to determine what happens to occupants of a woman’s womb. And they’re afraid that Kavanaugh’s gonna come along and overturn Roe v. Wade, which is not going to happen. But they can’t take the chance that it won’t. There are many reasons why this is happening. Yesterday on the program, I outlined one of them.RUSH ARCHIVE: What do you think the bull’s-eye really is here? What do you think has the Democrats so paranoid, so frightened, so agitated, so animated and motivated to stop this guy? What is it? (interruption) Well, yeah, but why? I know they don’t want him on the court. It’s one word. It begins with an A. This is all about abortion. It is about nothing else as far as the left is concerned. They want to be able to continue uninterrupted with their behavior when it comes to abortion. Sex without consequence, life without consequence. They are scared to death that a Republican or a conservative majority is going to overturn Roe vs. Wade.RUSH: But in addition to that (and this can’t be said enough) they really believe they’re gonna win the Senate, folks. They believe their polls. They don’t have the slightest idea what a potential backlash they are creating with their behavior here and what they’re doing to Kavanaugh. They haven’t the slightest idea. They have no idea of the rage! They think the Democrats have all the motivation and inspiration, eagerness to vote?They have no idea what this is doing to Republican turnout. No idea at all. We saw a harbinger in a Texas special election last night where a Republican won a Democrat seat that the Democrats have held for 139 years, and the polls did not say this was gonna happen. Democrats think they’re in the process turning Texas blue, and yet this one seat that they’ve held in a district that went heavily for Hillary elected a Republican.They’re sitting there blind as a bad. They have no concept, they have no sense, because they’re not connected to the American people. They have no idea how their behavior here is revving up Republicans to vote in November like nothing else could! You wait. We’ll see. Here’s David “Rodham” Gergen last night on Anderson Cooper 210. Cooper said, “This call from Democrats for an FBI investigation. It’s a delay tactic, some people say.”GERGEN: This vital last step about who’s going to investigate is crucial to the outcome. What’s most important for the country here, Anderson, is when this is all said and done, if Judge Kavanaugh’s going on the Supreme Court and it’s gonna tip the balance of the court for years to come, uh, it’s really essential that he go forward without a big cloud over him. To have Judge Kavanaugh go up there and join Clarence Thomas, you’re going to have two people who have been accused of sexual harassment on the court deciding whether Roe v. Wade should be sustained or not — precedent ought to rule — that is not a helpful situation.RUSH: Bingo! What did I tell you? You’ll “have two people on the court with the cloud of sexual harassment allegations hanging over them”? Why do those clouds exist? Because incredible, uncredible accusers came forth at the last minute to try to taint them. Neither Clarence Thomas nor Brett Kavanaugh were known as sexual anythings until the last days of their confirmation hearings. Folks, I’m telling you. I have such… I have lost all respect for any of these people on the left.It takes a lot of effort, really, to rein in the loathing I have for these people and what they are willing to do. Decent people… I said this Monday. Decent people do not know how to deal with this. Decent people do not focus on how to literally destroy the lives of people they disagree with, and that’s what we’re facing. The left is literally trying with great effort to destroy the lives and the careers and the reputations of anybody they don’t agree with.How can anybody respect these people? And they do it without any concern whatsoever. And all the while we have to sit here and listen to this drivel that they’re the ones with all the big hearts and they’re the ones with all the compassion, they’re the ones with caring, they’re the ones that are social justice warriors concerned about discrimination and unfairness! And they wantonly, eagerly, happily seek to personally destroy anybody who gets in their way!I mean ruin them!Wipe them out financially!Destroy their families!Ruin their reputations!Destroy their careers!Decent people don’t know how to deal with that. Decent people are just gonna avoid it. That’s why Trump was elected, and that’s why people that support Trump don’t care one whit what he says in a twit or a tweet. They don’t care one whit what he tweets. He is the lone person fighting back against any of this. He’s the only person that people that voted for him think has a chance of standing up to these people and stopping them. That’s why they supported him, that’s why they elected him, and that’s why they don’t abandon him now.    "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/19/the-kavanaugh-accusation-is-a-set-up/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 19, 2018RUSH: All right. It is obvious to me, but I guess not a whole lot of people can say it. But this is a setup. It’s a thorough, entire setup. It’s gotta be a setup, and the Senate ought to deal with it as though it’s a setup. If she doesn’t show up, then go ahead with the vote — and now the accuser is saying she can’t show up, she won’t show up until the FBI investigates. Ladies and gentlemen, the whole business of the FBI investigating something that’s 36 years old is dubious at best.
But beyond that, accusers don’t get to set the date of investigations. Accusers don’t get to set the terms of the investigation — unless they happen to be Hillary Clinton. I mean, Hillary Clinton was able to tell Comey when she would and wouldn’t sit for an interview from which she was gonna be exonerated anyway in her whole email situation. But, I mean, this is… It’s abundantly obvious what’s going on here. Let me ask you a question. Let me put it to you this way.What would happen, let’s say — I don’t know — in the last 10 years up to last week if any woman had walked into any FBI office in the country and said the following: “Hi. I’m here to report that I was abused 35 years ago. I was — I was — I was at a party. Uh, I was 15, a little bit to drink, and a 17-year-old guy pushed me down on top of a table and laid on top of me. And then — and then and then I think — I think — a friend came in and did something and anyway they left and I was left locked in the room. And I want to you to investigate.”Do you think if somebody shows up at an FBI office with that story, if they show up in person with that story, that the FBI is gonna give it any time whatsoever? The agents are gonna look at each other with kind of wary eyes and they’re gonna crack silent jokes to one another. I’m not kidding. You take this out of the realm of a letter to a crazed, partisan United States senator, Dianne Feinstein, and just move this into the victim walking into an FBI office, “It was 35 years, 34 years. I’m not sure where. But I know that when I was 15, I was at a party, and some guy jumped on top of me.”So let’s say the FBI agent decides to actually take this further and in a very respectful way says, “Well, Miss, were you raped or injured?”“Uh, no, not really.”“Did you report this or tell anyone at the time, 36, 35 years ago?”“Uh, no.”“What year was this, again, that this happened?”“Uhhh, I’m not — I’m not sure. I think it was 1982.”“Where did this happen?”“I don’t know! I don’t know. I was so traumatized; I don’t remember any of it. I just remember some guy jumping on me and I was drunk and — and I don’t know. But I want you to investigate it.”“Okay. Ma’am, were there any witnesses?”“Just the one friend of his that pushed him off, and then they left before he could do anything.”What would the FBI do with this, if that scenario happened in one of their field offices? I will tell you what they would do: Zip, zero, nada. And the reason for bringing it up this way is to try to shine some kind of a different light on this and try to put this kind of allegation in some kind of context. The president is handling this in a quite fascinating way. He’s saying, “I hope she shows up. I want to hear what she has to say. I really hope she shows up. I’m very interested in what she has to say. We all are. And if she shows up and if she’s credible, why, then we’re gonna have to do something about that.”Meaning he might have to turn Kavanaugh loose! So Trump’s out there allowing for the possibility that the woman is telling the truth and has a credible story that would be believable. And that if it is, then he might have no choice but than to jettison Kavanaugh and look for somebody else. Now, what do you think Trump’s doing there, Dawn? (interruption) You look disappointed. You’re not…? (interruption) What do you think Trump’s doing? Well, see, this woman is saying she’s not showing up until the FBI investigates.There’s nothing for any investigative agency to investigate! This is never gonna be anything more than “he said, she said.” That’s all it’s ever gonna be. The FBI can’t investigate. She doesn’t even remember where was it was. She doesn’t even remember to tell ’em where to go! She doesn’t even remember for sure what year it was! She doesn’t even remember how many people might have been in the room. How in the world is anybody gonna investigate this?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: There is a development here in the Kavanaugh-Blasey story, and that’s, as you know… What are we gonna call her, the accuser? Is that what? The accuser first started out saying a horrible thing that happened, couldn’t remember where, not sure the year, not sure the house and so forth, can’t corroborate anything. Kavanaugh can produce 200 people testifying to his character. Three or four people that were named that don’t even remember the event happening.This woman can’t produce any witnesses.Kavanaugh’s got a bunch.So the Senate said, “Okay. Well, you know what? We’ll delay our vote to Monday. We’ll even delay it beyond that. We’ll schedule a hearing on Monday where the accuser can come in and Kavanaugh can come in and their lawyers can query each other in the Senate. The Senator on the committee will get into the act.” The accuser said (stammering), “Ah, ah, ah, ah, I’m not… I — I — I — I’m not coming.” She didn’t respond to the invitation to show up.The people said, “Well, if she doesn’t show up after having been invited, then let’s go ahead and schedule the vote and do it tomorrow.” This prompted the accuser to say (paraphrased), “Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! No, I don’t think I’m coming until the FBI investigators. No.” I don’t care who you are, no accuser gets to determine the scope and the parameters of an investigation. The accuser doesn’t get to determine when and who investigates. In no circumstance in the country does that happen.Nowhere!The accuser doesn’t get to set the details of this. But that’s what she’s doing, she and her lawyer. So now the FBI’s gotta be brought into this. They don’t want to investigate. There’s nothing to investigate! He doesn’t remember where, when, why. She doesn’t remember what year. She doesn’t remember who was there. There’s nothing for people 36 years after the fact to investigate, beyond what is already happening.It’s always gonna come down to, he said, she said. Then the president got into a deal and said (summarized), “We really hope she shows up. We I really want to hear is what she has to say. I want to find out if she is credible. I really hope she accepts the invitation to the Senate and shows up on Monday — and, if she’s incredible, why, then we’re gonna have to perhaps jettison Judge Kavanaugh; pick somebody else.”Her lawyers say, “Nope. We’re not showing up Monday. We’re not showing up ever until the FBI investigates this.” It’s so obviously is a setup. So here is the latest development. Are you ready for this? Dadelut dadelut dadelut dadelut dadelut. Senator Grassley… This is according to CNN. CNN has an anonymous source claiming that Senator Grassley is now willing to go to California to interview the accuser.Now, does that mean the entire Senate Judiciary Committee would join Senator Grassley on the Senate charter flight to interview her where she is most comfortable? Would she accept this or would she continue to say, “I’m not doing anything until the FBI investigates”? Because it is so obvious that this is a setup. She doesn’t want to answer questions and I don’t think ever will. That isn’t the point of this.The point of this is to delay this nomination because they really think they’re gonna win the Senate. There are polls out there that say the Senate is now in play. I think that’s one of the reasons Feinstein released this, one of the reasons she held this. Nobody knew. I will guarantee you. Well, I can’t guarantee you, but my (sigh) intelligence guided by experience, I don’t think very many people believe this babe, and I don’t even think that’s the point.Now, don’t tell a lot of people I’m saying this ’cause it’ll get me in big trouble. But I don’t think too many people really believe her. That’s not the point. The option she provides is delay, delay, delay, delay. All her lawyer has to keep saying is, “I’m not I’m not bringing my client forward until the FBI investigates.” If the FBI investigates, she’ll say, “I think the CIA should take a look at it now!” Whatever other thing they can come up with to delay, they will.She’s not gonna show up and answer questions, and I think that’s what the president knows. When the president says, “I really hope she accepts the invitation. I really hope she shows up. I really want to hear what she has to say — and if she’s credible, ‘Bye-bye, Brett.'” Well, you know Trump doesn’t want to jettison Kavanaugh — and don’t say this too loudly, but it’s obvious some people on our side are trying to goad the babe into showing up.But I don’t want to say that to too many people. I could give it away. We want to continue to play the psychological game here. But I don’t think anybody believes her. I don’t think Feinstein… Feinstein even let the cat out of the bag that she can’t confirm that all of this is truthful. And then she had do damage control and walk that back. Did you hear about that? Oh. Grab audio sound bite No. 7. This is from yesterday on Capitol Hill. She really blew it on this and immediately had to start walking this back and doing damage control.FEINSTEIN: This is a woman — and I really believe — who’s been profoundly impacted by this. Now, I can’t say everything everything’s truthful; I don’t know.RUSH: Oh! Oh! “I can’t say everything’s truthful.” Man, you have not seen an 80-year-old woman do a 180 faster than Dianne Feinstein did yesterday except maybe Ruth “Buzzi” Ginsburg and her famous workout now that CNN televised. Man, oh, man, did that send ripples of panic through the left when Dianne Feinstein said, “I can’t say everything’s truthful.” They don’t believe her, I don’t think. If they did, they’d have brought this up.This would have been long-ago used. But in the #MeToo movement you simply can’t say, “You know What? I don’t believe you lady. I just don’t.” Nobody in politics can say that. We on the radio can say it all day long. But they can’t, obviously. So now, now Grassley has offered to go out to California. Do you think Chuck Grassley really wants to go to California, really wants to interview this babe to find out what she says? They’re giving her every opportunity.They’re going so far out of their way to be cooperative. Can you think of any other Senate witness where the committee chairman has offered to go to them in circumstances and settings that are amenable to whoever is being queried, interrogated, or interviewed? Ha! If this is true, she’ll find a way to turn this down. “I’ve left my home, and I can’t I can’t accept this invitation. I’m getting death threats. I’m feeling very scared! I’m feeling very frightened.“I’m feeling very, very unsafe, and so, Senator Grassley, thank you, but I can’t even tell you where I am, in order to do the interview.” And the media will say, “Then it must have been true. You know what, the shrinks say, Rush. The shrinks say that the less you can remember about an event, the more likely it is to have happened because you’re traumatized.” Well, if that’s the case, Kavanaugh doesn’t remember any of it.He must be really traumatized ’cause he doesn’t remember a shred of this. She remembers enough to bollix up the United States Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation process. So Grassley’s offered to go interview her. I don’t know if it’s just Grassley and his staff or if he’s gonna take the whole committee. Is Maxine Waters gonna be invited to go along? I have no idea. It’s just CNN with the story. But this woman does not want to answer questions. I think they’re making it clear they’re bending over backgrounds to let her know they want to hear her story.“We’ll even come to you. We will bring the nation’s capital to you, Dr. Ford,” and I know what she’s gonna say. (stammering) “I can’t — I can’t — That — that… My — my — my — my — my — my location would be compromised. I’ve had to leave. I’ve had to leave my home, I’ve had to leave my family, I’ve had to leave my heart because I am under death threat. And, Senator Grassley, I don’t trust or anybody in the committee not to leak where I am to these deranged Trump voters that support you.”BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Well, it seems like it’s kind of official now. There will not be an FBI investigation of the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford. President Trump has said, “No, no FBI,” and the GOP, of course, said, “No FBI,” and if Trump says no FBI there isn’t any, unless FBI wants to embarrass Trump. Who knows! The FBI probably isn’t gonna look at it, which is then throwing the ball back in the accuser’s court along with her lawyers because they’re saying, “We’re not gonna go forward without an FBI investigation.”I don’t think… As I said, I don’t think the accuser wants to testify. I can believe that the accuser is nonplussed by all this. Actually, you know, I’m not even sure I believe that. I think we’re dealing with a hardened left-wing activist here, and I think they’re all loaded for bear. I think they’re prepared to do whatever. But this is obviously a stall technique. So now what will they do, if the request for an FBI investigation is being denied, then the accuser says, “Well, then I’m — I’m — I’m not gonna come forward”?The latest is that Grassley… Supposedly, now, Grassley has offered to go out to California to interview her, which she can easily reject by saying, “No. Senator Grassley? He’s just trying to find out where I am! I’ve had to leave my home. I don’t feel safe. I’m under death threats and other threats and I’ve had to go into hiding with my family and it’s a horrible thing. And I’m not gonna tell people where I am just to go through this.”At some point, at some point here Senator Grassley, the president, the Republicans are gonna have to decide to reschedule that vote — and I wish it were still happening tomorrow. We know the Democrats are gonna oppose, and we know they’re gonna oppose in unison. We’re talking about the Judiciary Committee vote here, not the full vote of the Senate. That’s what was scheduled to happen tomorrow.And if this woman refuses to testify, you can’t let this woman or any other accuser who refuses to come forward and answer questions about her allegation — you can’t allow anybody like that — to shut down the, quote, unquote, government, right? We can’t have government shutdowns, and this is shutting down the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. Which is exactly the objective and the idea. So we will continue to discuss this as the program unfolds.There’s no question here that this is a hit job. It’s a political hit job. If it looks, walks, and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck. And this is a political hit job. And if I was lying, and if I was engaged in character assassination, I wouldn’t be in a hurry to testify about it before the entire world because I would realize I don’t have to do that in order to destroy somebody. All I’ve gotta do is make the allegation and a whole political party will back me up.All I have to do is make an allegation about the guy and a whole political party — an entire political party and most of the United States media — will back me up and I don’t ever need to testify. I just have to keep making demands that that entire political party support and the media will support. Demands I know will never be met, like the FBI investigating this. And I will succeed in destroying the character and reputation… Well, she’s not gonna destroy the character, but she’s going to destroy the reputation and the career.She’s trying to do that, as is the entire Democrat Party. So now the ball is eventually gonna be back in the Senate’s hands. And they’re gonna have to decide if they are going to retain any shred of dignity and proceed with their own process rather than have it hijacked here by somebody who won’t even answer questions about it. I don’t care who you are, the accuser never sets terms of an interview or an investigation. The accuser doesn’t get to tell investigators who investigates.The accuser doesn’t get to say when the investigation or any aspect of it happens. The accuser doesn’t get to do or have control over any of these things like this accuser is demanding, and it’s because everybody’s afraid of the #MeToo movement. Everybody’s afraid of the women’s vote. Another named witness at the alleged Kavanaugh party denies being there. “Patrick J. Smyth, one of the men who was allegedly at the party where Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s doesn’t even remember the party and therefore denies the allegations of misconduct against Kavanaugh.“Smythe and another man, Mark Judge — who was actually named by Dr. Ford — have both denied being at the party and have declined to come forward to the Judiciary Committee.” She has no witnesses. She just has a bunch of left-wing activitists demanding that everybody must believe her. “Former Classmate of Kavanaugh’s Denies Being at the Party and Sexual Assault Allegation.” This is just another story on Patrick Smyth, who denies being there.Lindsey Graham, Senator Lindsey Grahamnesty, in a statement to the Washington Post, likened the way Democrats have handled this allegation to a drive-by shooting. “Senator Graham said, ‘This is a drive-by shooting. All I can say is we’re bringing this to a close. They’ve had tons of time to do this. This has been a drive-by shooting when it comes to Kavanaugh. I’ll to listen the lady, but we’re gonna bring this to a close.'”“Drive-by” has a ring to it, doesn’t it?Drive-By Media.Drive-By Democrat Party.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Well, here’s another bit of thrown water thrown on the accuser. The FBI will not be investigating her claim, and now Montgomery County police say that unless a complaint is filed, they will not pursue an investigation into Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that Brett Kavanaugh physically and sexually assaulted her at a party in Montgomery County in the early 1980s. Both were in high school. Montgomery County, at a local constabulary. They won’t investigate unless a complaint is filed.Well, that stands to reason, and there hasn’t been a complaint filed. And what do you think the odds are that she will file a complaint? You think her lawyers will run down to courthouse and file a complaint or call the cops and file a complaint? I don’t know if you can do it after 30 years. Statute of limitations, statue of limitations, those of you in Rio Linda. I don’t know. But she didn’t file a complaint. She didn’t even remember to tell anybody about this until six years ago.   "

Great to have you, sir. Welcome to the EIB Network.CALLER: Thank you, sir. I’m just calling about Brett Kavanaugh. I used to work for him at the White House and something you said just about how this pains you. This is just… There’s a lot of bad things that happen in politics. You know the National Guard documents. There’s a lot of things that have really upset me, but this one has just really hit hard. This is a good man. You know, he’s… Well I tell people, he’s one of those people that you just hope you’ll come across once in your life and you hope some part of them will rub off on you and just so much of what I know about being a professional, balancing work and life, treating people of all levels with respect, I learned from him. And he’s just a good, decent person. And –RUSH: If you knew him in the White House that means that was when he was staff secretary?CALLER: Yes, sir. It was long hours, and it was stressful, but he… You know, and there were stressful days, but he never failed to just, even when no one was watching, just do the right thing, treat anyone with respect. You just always knew he would do the right thing. And I can just tell you, you’re not out on a limb by defending him. I just appreciate you being bold. I don’t think we have to grant that there’s any merit to this. I just believe that they’re bearing false witness. I think this is totally wrong. It offends my sense of justice. And this is just a good man. And I just don’t think he should have to go through this.RUSH: I don’t either. There’s not a shred of evidence of this kind of behavior or even allegation at any time, at any stage of his life. Not anything even close! The fact that they have to go back to high school where everybody was at one time immature and was playing around with alcohol and having a beer here or there when they were not old enough to be able to metabolize it and stay sober.CALLER: Right.RUSH: We’ve all done this! It’s all part of growing up! And to now claim that an incident that the victim claims to not even be able to remember enough significant details can derail not just a nomination to the Supreme Court, but a life and a career. It’s obscene. It is absurd. And all it takes is a single letter to a United States Senator to get this done. You’re absolutely right. This is injustice on steroids.CALLER: It is. They’re libeling the man. You know, it just relates to… We just so happen to be in the #MeToo era and now they’re claiming he’s a #MeToo guy. I mean, just because there’s a lot of examples of people out there doing bad things doesn’t mean that he has. They’ve got nothing on him. He’s a tour de force. This is just totally unjust and a lot of us who worked with him are just kind of texting each other saying what can we do. And I just thought, I’m just gonna pick up the phone and I just want to thank you for supporting him and I just want to encourage everyone out there to be upset about this because this is just totally, totally wrong.RUSH: Well, while I’ve got you, I’ve got one minute… What do you think of this circus that they’ve scheduled in the Senate for Monday? I mean, how can that possibly become anything but a circus?CALLER: I don’t see how it can be anything other than a circus. I mean, some of the original hearing was a circus, you know, and he was… I couldn’t believe how… I can because I’ve seen it, but 13, 14 hours into each day, you know, he literally is citing footnote nine of the Chevron decision, you know, at the end of the third day of the hearing without even looking down. I mean the guy is incredible. And now they’re gonna trot him there on Monday, maybe she’ll show up, maybe she won’t, and he’s gonna have to… It’s indignity, to have to sit there and say —RUSH: Total, total —CALLER: It’s just horrible.RUSH: It’s total indignity. That’s the word for this. It is indignity. It is undignified for practically everybody involved. He’s willing, however, to go through it in order to see all of this through. Look, I appreciate the call, David. Thank you.  "

There’s a new phenomenon happening in American journalism. When I say new, it’s new to Donald Trump. Trump will tweet something. Trump will say something either at a rally or in the Oval Office. When the AP, Reuters, New York Times, Washington Post report it, they all say, “President Trump, without evidence,” said whatever he said. “President Trump said, without evidence…” This is meant to cast doubt and aspersions on what Trump is saying, to make readers believe Trump is lying.Well, why isn’t this part of the story? “Christine Blasey Ford, without evidence, says that Judge Kavanaugh did whatever she says he did back when they were a couple of drunkards in high school.” You’ll notice it’s very selective. “Donald Trump, without evidence, claimed,” blah, blah, blah. Donald Trump without evidence today said that Hispanic unemployment is at an all-time record low. Didn’t need evidence, but he did have it. Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers. But we do not see, Christine Blasey Ford, without evidence…No, it says the exact opposite. Christine Blasey Ford and whatever she says you must believe it. You must believe it. It’s not up to her to corroborate anything. How the hell can that be, by the way? If the government or anybody comes after you and you end up in court, do you realize who has to prove it? The people accusing you! It is not up to you to prove your innocence. Now, many times, depending on juries and so forth, that’s what defense lawyers seek to do, find an alternative explanation.But it’s the government’s job — the prosecutors, the accusers — to prove. But how does she get an exemption? How does Christine Blasey Ford get an exemption from having to prove her claim? Well, because she’s Democrat and a leftist and that’s just the way the world works for us. We don’t have to prove anything. We’re liberals, and the way we do and think is the natural order of things and you just better accept it or else. We don’t have to prove anything, especially to you, conservative skunks! Screw you! That’s their attitude. And, in the process, look what they’re doing about the rule of law in addition to everything else they’re ripping apart.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now it’s up to 200 — 200! — former female classmates of Kavanaugh who have signed a letter praising his character. How many of you guys know 200 women, period, much less 200 that would swear by the fact that you’re a nice guy, that you are morally fit? How many of you know 200 women that would say that about you? (interruption) No, no, no. I’m not saying I don’t believe it. I’m saying it’s astounding. I do believe it! I absolutely do believe it! That’s the point.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/18/will-kavanaughs-accuser-show-up-at-the-hearing/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 18, 2018RUSH: Okay. So after all this, Christine Blasey Ford is not gonna show up for the hearing? She hasn’t accepted the invitation to show up for the hearing — and yet they moved it? They rescheduled. It was supposed to be Thursday, the vote. They canceled the vote, they moved the vote — well, they delayed it — so that they could have this hearing with Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh, and she hadn’t even accepted the invitation to show up, and now her lawyer is saying it’s not her job to corroborate her story?She’s not the one that has to corroborate her story? (summarized) “No, no, no, no! She’s making the allegation. So she doesn’t have to corroborate anything. It needs to be investigated.” This is no different than Harry Reid saying, “I have a friend that told me that Mitt Romney hasn’t paid his taxes in 10 years,” and the media says to Harry Reid, “What’s your evidence?” And Harry Reid says, “Don’t ask me! You need to go talk to Romney. Romney’s the guy hadn’t paid his taxes in 10 years.”And the media said, “Oh, yeah! Okay.” So they all ran off and start badgering Romney about why he hadn’t paid his taxes in 10 years. This is exactly what this is! So the woman — who doesn’t say a word about this for Brett Kavanaugh’s entire professional career at various confirmation hearings for the D.C. Circuit court of appeals for everything else that he’s done working in the Bush White House. This woman hasn’t had a word to say, not a thing to say.And then after every Democrat effort to exhaust — or they’ve exhausted every effort to keep him off the Supreme Court, this thing shows up with Dianne Feinstein saying, “Oh, look what I just remembered I have here. You know, I got this in July, and I just now remembered it.” And now everybody’s saying, “Oh, my God. Oh, jeez. Look what Kavanaugh did!” And they’re just accepting it because, once again, it is not the nature of the evidence; it’s the seriousness of the charge. And I am not making this up.This lawyer who, by the way… Katz is her name. She is a Democrat activist. She is plainly saying it’s not her job to corroborate her story. Her efforts, her legal efforts are funded by George Soros. There is no doubt what this is. We’ve been here before. How in the world can you say that the accuser doesn’t have to corroborate anything? “Debra Katz, the attorney for the woman accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, said that it is not her client’s job to corroborate her claims.“Katz said on CNN on Monday that investigators should be responsible for proving Christine Blasey Ford’s claim that Kavanaugh held her down and drunkenly groped her while at a party in high school.” So she can make this claim. She doesn’t have to prove it. She doesn’t have to have any evidence. The investigators have to track it down and prove it. But now the Democrats are saying, “Wait a minute. We shouldn’t be investigating this.” Like Kamala Harris, Kamala Harris said, “We shouldn’t be investigating this. The FBI should.”You know, this woman, Kamala Harris… These people are so dense. Does she not know the FBI does not investigate these kinds of crimes? The FBI does not investigate local crimes, high school drunken party crimes. The FBI doesn’t investigate those. But then again that’s not what this is about. This is about delaying everything so Kavanaugh does not get on the court and the Republicans are playing right along with this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The vote was scheduled to happen regardless what happened with Kavanaugh. But the Kavanaugh story is to obscuring everything else that for the big spenders? I mean, this is a godsend. They’re able to go in and vote on this stuff body even paying attention or cares, and once it’s over, there’s tiny little reporting on it, precious little. But I wanted to pass that on to you nevertheless because there are some things continue to happen, like Trump is declassified some of the FISA documents.That doesn’t mean they’re gonna be made public right away. Declassifying doesn’t necessarily mean they’re gonna do made public. At some point, they will. So we’re tracking that as well. But just a few sound bites here to wrap up our exclusive coverage of the Kavanaugh smear. Last night on the Fox News Channel… You know, 65 women who’ve known Kavanaugh signed a letter claiming that he’s prince of a guy, perfectly fine, decent person.This allegation is something they cannot possibly imagine. That 65 has now swelled to 200 women who’ve signed that letter. I don’t know how many of you guys out there know 200 women period — especially if you’re married — and all of a sudden 200 women pop up and say they know you well enough to vouch for your character? (chuckles) Just 200 women period vouching for you! Who can say this? (interruption) No, no! I believe it! Don’t misunderstand! I believe everything. I believe Kavanaugh. I do not believe the woman.I’m just saying this is astounding, and they’re claiming they don’t have to corroborate whatever it is they’re charging? We’ve got all of these people who personally know Kavanaugh saying it can’t possibly true. They have no experience with him. Two of them appeared on Fox News last night. Let’s see. One of the questions… There names are (let’s see) Maura Cain and Maura Fitzgerald, I believe, here, and Maura Fitzgerald is first. Question: “One of the questions is gonna be whether or not he was somebody who drank heavily in high school who could have potentially blacked out during this experience and yet had committed this act but doesn’t remember it. Maura Fitzgerald, is that a possibility?”FITZGERALD: No. In all of the times, all the years that I’ve known Brett, even if we had a beer, he was always in complete control. And he was actually one of the guys that if we were at a social gathering, he’d been the guy to look out for other people. He was always in control.RUSH: “Always in control.” So he was a designated driver-type guy. Here is Maura Cain being asked if she ever saw Kavanaugh drunk, falling down sloppy all over himself.CAIN: We drank beer. It was legal. I never saw him out-of-control drunk. He always retained his composure. He was a responsible guy. He was someone who did have a beer, but he was never out of control. He never became someone different after drinking.RUSH: Well, two people. “Never out of control.” You know people like that, don’t you? I do. I have. In high school, I was kind of impressed by the 15- or 16-year-old who was already plotting his entire life and guarding his reputation even then. I mean, a lot of people don’t start taking this stuff seriously ’til they get to college or afterwards. He may have been one of these people. Who was taking seriously his life and the establishment of a reputation because he knew what he wanted to do. It could be this is his general personality. So the next question, “You both dated him. Most people do date several people going through high school and college. Maura Fitzgerald, was he ever physically aggressive to you? What was he like as a boyfriend?”FITZGERALD: He was nothing about kind and polite and respectful. I’ve known him since high school. I dated him briefly in college and we’ve remained close friends ever since. I cherish his friendship. He has just been such a stand-up guy, full of integrity. I admire him. He never exhibited to me or anyone else that I know — treated no one with disrespect.RUSH: So in this sordid, tale we have a woman who doesn’t remember where it happened or maybe even who — not sure of the year — sends a letter to Dianne Feinstein saying (paraphrased), “I don’t want to go public! I don’t want anybody to know who I am. I don’t want you pursuing this. But I think I remember this guy falling all over me,” blah, blah, blah, blah. When this surfaces and the Democrats have run out of options, this surfaces… I don’t know. Is there anybody coming forward with knowledge of this woman and vouching for her? I don’t know. I’m asking. Has anybody seen this?“Well, uh, no, Rush. She doesn’t want to come forward.”By the way, the Republican Senate caucus is meeting as we speak to decide what to do if the woman does not accept the invitation to show up to the circus on Monday. They’re deciding what to do. They’ve gotta be real careful here. They’ve gotta give her a timeline to accept. They gotta tell her, you know, “By sundown tomorrow you gotta tell us if you’re coming or not ’cause if you’re not we’re gonna do the vote.” They can’t just let her keep the issue open. The United States Senate doesn’t, or shouldn’t, be manipulated this way.It’s up to senators to make sure that it isn’t. Anyway, we’ve got all kinds of people vouching for Kavanaugh. It seems effortless. It seems people can’t wait to come out and speak up and vouch for the guy. So now we move on to the Drive-By Media. Up next is A.B. Stoddard. She was on the Special Report with Bret Baier show last night. She was on the All-Star Panel, and Bret Baier said, “Okay, the accuser here is a registered Democrat. She’s donated to political causes and progressive candidates. A.B., this does not mean this is strictly motivated by politics. The accusations are one thing. How it was dealt with is another.”STODDARD: The idea that, uh, some left-wing grassroots (scoffs) some m-motivated person would ruin their life over this (stammers) to try to take the Kavanaugh nomination down is crazy. The reporting backs up what her lawyer said, that she didn’t intend to come forward and was outed.RUSH: (chuckles) Okay. “So the idea that some left-wing grassroots motivated person would ruin their life over this to try to take the Kavanaugh nomination out’s crazy.” No, A.B., it’s not. It is, in fact par, for the course. It is, in fact, what left-wing activists do! Her life will not be ruined. She will become an instant hero to the left, whether she succeeds in taking Kavanaugh off the court or not. Take a look Anita Hill! She was hired at the provost of this university and then at that university and she’s constantly asked to speak.She is considered an expert on sexual harassment now. There have been books written about her virtue. There have been movies made about her virtue. Even to this day, Anita Hill is celebrated by the left for her valiant effort to destroy Clarence Thomas. This woman would not suffer any indignities. But the idea that left-wing activists would not do this? This is exactly what left-wing activists do! We’re witnessing it! The idea that a left-wing activist wouldn’t do this while a left-wing activist is doing it is comical.“No, that person is not speeding,” as they go by you at a hundred miles an hour.“The idea that a left-wing activist would try to take down Kavanaugh like this is crazy,” while we’re watching it happen. (chuckles) So we’re not only not supposed to believe what we see, we are supposed to believe what we can’t prove, but we are to deny what we see. It’s an amazing set of standards. Up next, F. Chuck Todd who was on the Today show today. The cohost, Hoda Kotb, said, “Tell us about the Kavanaugh nomination. Is it in trouble?”TODD: I definitely think it’s in trouble. Nothing would surprise me including him… By the end of the week if Judge Kavanaugh decides he doesn’t want to go through this, it isn’t worth it, he doesn’t want to. Maybe he can win, but he doesn’t want an asterisk. I mean, it wouldn’t surprise me if he chose to withdraw and chose to back down. I think a lot, frankly, will have to do with what more do we learn this week? Is there anybody else from their high school days that come (sic) out? I think if any little thing that we don’t know now comes out before that hearing on Monday, I don’t think the hearing happens.RUSH: So while the accuser has yet to accept the invitation to show up Monday and appear at a circus hearing or whatever, F. Chuck Todd is asking somebody else to come forward! It’s a little dog whistle here, folks. When F. Chuck Todd says, “[I]t wouldn’t surprise me if he chose to withdraw… I think a lot, frankly, will have to do with what more do we learn this week? Is there anybody else from their high school days that come[s] out?”In other words, F. Chuck Todd is saying, “We’re waiting. We’re willing to help you! Is there any other woman in high school that this guy, Kavanaugh, bullied in similar fashion? We’re waiting for you.” Some might even say that that is a signal that somebody else is gonna show up, that F. Chuck wouldn’t put that out there unless he knew somebody was gonna come out. I don’t know about that. I maybe don’t know, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re asking, because that’s what they do. Let me tell you right now: The media is hoping that the woman has an assist, that another woman comes forward from some other period in Kavanaugh’s life.What would your reaction be if that happened? You gotta be on the lookout for it, folks. Now that F. Chuck has waved a little red flag up there, the message gone out, “We can get this guy to quit if there’s another one of you. Is there anybody out there? Is there is anybody out there, anybody else from their high school days to come out.” Savannah Guthrie then asked form of the question, “Look, just the specter of a public hearing, Chuck. We’ve seen this before. Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas a generation ago. What a high-wire act for both parties.”TODD: This one is actually in an election year! I remember that. I — I was here in Washington for that, and that was an election year. It was the beginning of a presidential campaign. And it seemed to divide not just this town, but this country. This one — because we’re so close to an election, because of the Donald Trump era — this one feels like a tinderbox. It feels like four sticks of dynamite wrapped in radioactive material. (snickers) It just feels like either side could see this erupt a culture war that defines the rest of the midterm election, the next six weeks in a way that could totally scramble what, uh, the outcomes could be.RUSH: Well, so F. Chuck signals what he’s hoping for out there, what he’s expecting. They want a nuclear explosion out of all this. They’re not satisfied yet. Kavanaugh hasn’t withdrawn, which is what this is all about.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/17/what-frosts-me-about-this-kavanaugh-mess/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 17, 2018RUSH: I checked the email during the break. “You don’t sound mad about this.” (Snort!) My friends, I spent the first part of hour telling you how mad I was back in 1990 when George Bush appointed Clarence Thomas. Look, I don’t want to be too redundant here. I realize people are in and out all day long. But back when the Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill stuff happened, remember, this program — and don’t misunderstand me here. This is not ego speaking. I’m trying to give you the factual, historical lay of the land. This program was it.There were some other conservative talk show that had come up on radio, but Fox News had not started yet. The blogosphere was not anywhere near what it was gonna be. This was 1990! People were still using CompuServe for crying out loud or AOL. CNN is the only cable network with the three networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) and the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times. It was a full-court press to do exactly what’s being done to Kavanaugh right now: Destroy Clarence Thomas. And, believe me, I was absorbed.I did nothing but refute everything the Democrats were saying every day of those confirmation hearings. Notice none of this that we’re hearing about could have an has happened during any of it testimony, any of the confirmation. This woman did not come forward then. They dragged Anita Hill out of wherever she was. It was Paul Simon’s wife and Howard Metzenbaum. They got together and they yanked her out. They had to talk her into doing it. Everybody denies that today ’cause they want to make it look like she was this committed activist back in 1990.They had to drag her out and they had to coach her and prepare her for testimony and so forth. But at least she testified, and Clarence Thomas got a chance to react to it with the famous “high-tech lynching” speech that he gave that put everybody in the Senate on this committee in their place. This is happening after all the testimony. I’m livid about this. I’m livid that decent people don’t seem to have any kind of option dealing with this. You can’t… Just in the essence of decency, you won’t find any more decent human being today than Brett Kavanaugh or his family.They are a threat to nobody. They haven’t threatened anybody. They’ve not destroyed anybody. The left could not defeat Kavanaugh during the constitutionally enumerated period of time to do so, and that would be the confirmation hearings. They struck out, they bombed out, and so now they’re dredging this up from the abject sewer. Of course I’m livid about it! I’m somewhat a little frustrated by the fact that it works. This stuff, in a sane world, the American people would be rising up in indignation and outrage over what Dianne Feinstein is attempting to pull here.I think they did when they elected Trump, by the way. How come the Access Hollywood video didn’t destroy Trump? How come none of those usual Democrat attempts to destroy Trump destroyed him? He still won. He got elected. But this is it, this is their playbook. They go back to it over and over and over again, and their playbook involves destroying people. It has me so mad, I can’t see straight. But just coming here and acting mad isn’t gonna get anything done because it is actually happening. So I find it despicable.I’m outraged that more people in Washington don’t. To people in Washington, this is the game! In the news business, man, this is exciting! This is ratings today. Never mind the fact that a man and his family returned the guillotine and subject to being destroyed simply because he has achieved enough in his life that he’s qualified to be on the U.S. Supreme Court. In Washington today, that means it’s open season to try and destroy the guy. Now, you might say, “Well, he knew that, Rush. They know.”Sure everybody knows it. Does that make it right? There isn’t any indignation. In fact, if you go to a lot of places in conservative media and you’ll find people making sure that we’re not unfair to the accuser and that we’re open-minded and that we really understand that she can be telling the truth. “And it’s a horrible thing if she is, and we must get to the bottom of it. But…” And then they go on with what they really think. But they feel it necessary to make sure nobody gets the wrong idea, that they think Kavanaugh should be sent packing if any of this is true.If any of this is true. They’re asking us to believe one heck of a lot for this to be true. And if this woman wants to come testify, it’s got to happen now. The Republicans run this show, and they need to make this happen pronto.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let’s grab audio sound bite No. 8. This is Chuck-You Schumer. He was on The View today speaking with Maude Behar, and they’re having a discussion about Kavanaugh and what to do about all this.SCHUMER: I believe Professor Ford. I think she’s credible, and I think when the investigation is finished and when she testifies and Judge Kavanaugh testifies, I think a majority of senators will find her credible, and I don’t think… I never thought Kavanaugh should get — get appointed because he was picked by a president who said, “I’m only gonna pick someone who repeals Roe v. Wade” (sic) and vetted by a group whose mission was that. The president said, “I’m only gonna pick someone who repeals health care,” (sic) and he was vetted by another group, the Heritage Foundation.MAUDE: Uh-huh.SCHUMER: So I said he shouldn’t be on the bench before this, but now we got get to the bottom of this.RUSH: Now, Trump never said (laughing) that he’s gonna pick people that are only anti-Roe v. Wade. It’s the exact opposite! There never was gonna be a litmus test. These people just lie left and right through their teeth about this. Here’s Schumer saying, “I think she’ll be credible, but… but…” You hear Schumer, “Whatever this guy believes, we can’t tolerate this!” You lost, Senator! You don’t get to pick the nominee in this circumstance! You lost! Hillary lost, and you don’t run the Senate, and you don’t get to pick the nominee!Now, they exhausted everything they had in trying to destroy Kavanaugh, and they didn’t have anything. They cannot question his qualifications. They cannot question his readiness. They cannot question his fitness. They did everything they could. They tried to bully Susan Collins into abandoning her support for him — and when all else failed, they go to the bottom of the deck and get this. They get it, for all intents and purposes, on the eve of the Judiciary Committee vote, which is Thursday.I’ll tell you as a personal aside, something that frosts me about this is what the hell have they been waiting so long to do this vote in the first place for? Why wasn’t this vote two weeks ago? “Uh, Mr. Limbaugh, the Senate runs at a very slow and distribute pace.” Yes, yes I understand that. But, for crying out loud, don’t you realize it’s time to he’d these people off at the pass? “But Mr. Limbaugh, Mr. Limbaugh, no matter when they had scheduled the vote, this would have happened.” Fine. Schedule the vote anyway. The fact that we hadn’t taken the vote provided the window of an opportunity here for all of this to occur anyway.Up next is Vince in parts unknown of central Florida. Welcome, sir. Great to have you here.CALLER: Thank you. First-time caller, sir. Thank you.RUSH: You bet.CALLER: I just got a question. Do you think there will ever be another president after Trump?RUSH: Do I think there will ever be another president after Trump?CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: (chuckling)CALLER: What he’s going through. It’s just amazing.RUSH: Oh, of course there will be. Of course there will be. You’re echoing —CALLER: (laughing)RUSH: That’s what Michael Moore’s out there saying.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: Michael Moore is out there saying that Donald Trump is the last president. There will not be another one. Not for the reason you just were saying.CALLER: Yeah. It’s horrible what he’s going through. You had started the program this morning about asking what we can do with this media and the liberal Democrats, what we can do. The only thing I can think of we might have to march our own marches. Take it to the streets. Let us get some exposure, because right now the Republicans are not getting any exposure out there. It’s always the media. They got the sports.They got a lot of arrows in their quiver, see? The Republicans are simply are not getting mobilized. And I think they need to go mobile. And I think they really need to do like back in the sixties with the civil rights movement. Get it out there. Get buses. Mobile! Take it out of those rallies. Those rales are nice and there’s a lot of passion but I think all that passion should really be on the road where the media will have to report on it. They’re getting shut out, you see, by those rallies.RUSH: See, this —CALLER: They don’t even show those rallies on CNN and all those media outlets. But when they’re on the road, when they’re on the road and in the streets, then they can’t stop not —RUSH: This is my point, though. That’s not what decent people do. Decent people don’t raise hell. They don’t destroy property, start marching in the streets and causing all kinds of violence and stuff. That’s not what decent people do! Decent people have other things to do. They’ve got other more productive, sensible things to do. That’s my whole point. Decent people do not sit around all day figuring out how to destroy people. Decent people don’t sit around all day trying to fi how to advance an agenda no matter who gets hurt at what cost.But they certainly don’t sit around and strategize moving forward a political agenda that requires people to be hurt, damaged, and destroyed. The left does! That’s their modus operandi day in and day out. I’m not saying there aren’t ways; don’t misunderstand. I’m just telling you that decent people who are up against this don’t know what to do. They don’t think this way! You tell decent people, “You’ve got to get out there and start blowing up some buildings! You’ve got to get out there and start breaking some glass! You’ve got to get out there and start breaking some heads!”That’s not what they’re about.It’s not what they do.“But, Rush! But, Rush! Decent people fight wars.”That’s a great point. Decent people resisted Hitler and the Germans. Decent people resisted the Japanese in World War II, the Nazis, the fascists and so forth. How do they did it? It required going to battle, it required going to war, and I don’t know how many people on our side are willing to do it. Obviously many aren’t. They’re expecting people they elect to do it at the point of attack, which happens to be Washington. They don’t see it happening much there, either, except with President Trump in the game. But he’s often alone in his efforts.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here’s David in Houston. You’re next, sir. Great to have you with us. Hi.CALLER: (silence) Hello?RUSH: Hello.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: Yeah!CALLER: Is this Rush?RUSH: This is.CALLER: Ah. Fantastic. Well, I have an answer to your question of why DiFi sat on this surprise, this October Surprise until now. The answer is midterms. This is all about the midterms. Because if she can bring this out at the last minute and throw the midterms to the Democrats, they solve all their problems, they get rid of Kavanaugh. Trump can’t appoint another Supreme Court nominee, and they take the House back, and they impeach Trump. The whole thing, it’s all geared towards the midterms. That’s the answer.RUSH: I think that’s true. But you think that’s more important than killing Kavanaugh?CALLER: Well, that’s just a bonus. (interruption) They can get both. They can use this nomination. Because if Republicans push Kavanaugh as a damaged candidate by this accusation, then they can use that against the Republicans in the midterms to swing, you know, women voters, #MeToo type people — which, #MeToo would vote for Democrats anyway —RUSH: See, that’s the kind of thing… You’re right about that, but that’s what frosts me. It literally frosts me. You can’t find a guy women love and respect more than this guy. So here comes this the bogus charge out of nowhere at the last minute and if the Republicans stick by Kavanaugh — which is the right thing to do! If they stick by him, then this supposedly is gonna energize women all over America to vote against Republicans because they supposedly are standing in solidarity with an alleged rapist! This is what frosts me, and it wouldn’t work if voters weren’t so ignorant and dumb — and for that we have the media to thank.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: See, that’s the thing. If the Republicans stick with Kavanaugh, the Democrats get to say, “See? Republicans don’t care about women. War on Women,” blah, blah, blah, blah. When in fact, Kavanaugh could not be more impeccably respectful and decent to women.  "

Hi.CALLER: Mega dittos. I’m a first-time caller. Been listening to you, I guess, since like ’89 or ’90.RUSH: Thank you very much, sir. I appreciate that you’re a lifer.CALLER: Almost. Yeah, I guess so. And I’ve started reading Rush Revere with my 8-year-old daughter, and she loves it. My wife really actually wonders how you — is a teacher, and she said it’s a special talent to be able to get through to young kids and she was very impressed with the whole story. Anyway —RUSH: Well, thank you. God bless you, sir. I appreciate that.CALLER: Yeah. Anyway, first point I wanted to make is I actually think these accusations are kind of good news because it shows the Democrats are out of ideas. They’ve gotta go back to the old Anita Hill accusations to… It seems to me if they can’t come up with anything new, that’s actually good for our side.RUSH: Well, theoretically. But in the process, you have two Republicans that have peeled off and the nomination may have gone with ’em! So the Democrats haven’t lost anything here. If that actually happens… I know you have another point that’s interesting too.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Peter in Redding, Connecticut. You actually… You think this has to do with Mitt Romney? How does this have to do with Mitt Romney?CALLER: Okay. Well, I was reading a theory on the internet, and I wanted to get your opinion on it. But it’s saying the timing of this 2012, you know, psychiatrist meeting is kind of interesting because going be back to 2012 was the reelection. Romney was widely expected to be the Republican nominee. According to a March 2012 article by Jeffrey Toobin in the New Yorker, Kavanaugh was widely expected to be Romney’s Supreme Court pick.At the time, they were very concerned about the Affordable Care Act. Kavanaugh had voted against it on the D.C. Circuit court of appeals, and you really don’t get more establishment Republican than Kavanaugh. So, you know, this theory is that really they were concerned about Ginsburg, whether, you know, that she wouldn’t retire and they were afraid she might die in office. So, you know, so basically the theory is that this is really a preemptive attack in case Obama didn’t win in 2012.RUSH: Uhhh, but she didn’t come forward in 2012.CALLER: She didn’t come forward but she was getting it on the record in 2012.RUSH: Oh, you mean at the psychiatrist’s office.CALLER: Right.RUSH: At the therapist’s office, getting it on the record. So you think they were gonna take Kavanaugh out back then if Romney had won and nominated him?CALLER: Right. Yeah. If Romney had won and then Ginsburg for some reason… She was struggling with cancer and if Ginsburg some reason dies in office and if Romney had won and nominated Kavanaugh to Supreme Court —RUSH: There are a lot of ifs here, and the problem is they almost didn’t bring it up now. I mean, if they’ve had it… I get the theory that they’ve had it in the deck since 2012, and if Romney had beaten Obama and Ruth “Buzzi” Ginsburg had had something unfortunate happen, that they were gonna try to destroy Kavanaugh. The purpose here was to get her story on record with a shrink, a psychiatrist, a therapist, or what have you, for use if Romney had been elected. Okay, fine. But they didn’t bring this forward until they had exhausted every other attempt to destroy Kavanaugh.And if they’d been worried about Kavanaugh all those years — and I don’t doubt that they have. I mean, he is who he is and he’s the kind of judge that he is. I think they have doubts and qualms about the woman’s story, and I think one of the reasons DiFi sat on it is I don’t think they want to put this woman up in public. I really don’t. I think they’re gonna try to engineer her testifying in private, behind closed doors because of the trauma and her desire to remain private. I appreciate the call, Peter.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/17/democrats-couldnt-stop-kavanaugh-so-they-must-destroy-him/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 17, 2018RUSH: Panama City, Florida. Ron, you’re next. It’s great to have you with us, sir. How are you?CALLER: I’m fine, Rush. Thank you. Many dittos. I just wanted to comment that I think it’s time to examine Dianne Feinstein’s motivation and her involvement in this entire accusation. I believe that she’s so far behind her own liberal base in California that she’s resorting to egregious political tactics just to regain her standing and regain the graces of liberal idiocracy in California. Taking down, or being part of taking down a SCOTUS nominee would certainly put her in that limelight with California liberals.The #MeToo allegations have removed all complicity on the part of women and the female accusers, so that any such allegation, even if it’s not against a SCOTUS nominee, gets automatically promoted to headline status and really takes precedent over rule of law and common decency. I think that Feinstein’s motivation here is personal, trying to save her own political life, her own political lifetime career in Washington. I’d appreciate your comment.RUSH: Now, who’s her opponent in California? She beat back Kevin de Leon, right?CALLER: Well, yes. She beat him by… She got 2.9 million votes. However, she has been rebuked by her own party earlier this year.RUSH: Yeah, but that’s California. They’re not gonna elect a Republican to run against her or a Republican… They’re not —CALLER: Certainly not, but I do believe that it would be within the graces of her own political establishment, her own backyard is necessary for any liberal politician in California.RUSH: Well, look. I don’t dispute that, that there is a personal benefit to her in California with local politicians, because she had a fairly bitter primary fight against Kevin. His name is Kevin de Leon, but he had it changed to Kevin de Leon to sound, you know, more worldly out there. And he got close, and she was ripped to shreds during the Democrat Party convention out in California, but she prevailed and she’s gonna have her six-year term.I think this is what it is. I think if there’s that benefit to her, it’s secondary. I think it’s the primary reason she’s doing this. It may be equal. It may be a twofer for her. But, every bit as much of this is about derailing a Trump nominee, keeping a conservative jurist off the Supreme Court because they think they’re gonna win the Senate!You cannot erase that, folks. They think that the Senate is theirs. They think the House is theirs. They’re believing all the pre-election polls. They are of the belief that none of what they’re doing here is causing any kind of a backlash among Republican voters, Trump supporters. They think that they’re beating back everybody here. They’re gonna win this in a landslide. They’re gonna win the House in a landslide, they’re gonna win the Senate, and, if that happens, they’re gonna get rid of Trump in six months or render him impotent, and this is what they’re looking at.And so if that’s the case, why let Trump have this nominee? Why in the world let Trump stack the court? This would make the court 5-4 conservative and he’s not a moderate, he’s replacing Kennedy, who was. This guy, Kavanaugh, is Scalia. He’s Gorsuch. My only point is, folks, that the Democrats, in order to do this, Dianne Feinstein, in order to do this, they have to personally destroy. They’ve lost the ability to defeat him. They could not stop him in the confirmation battle.They could not stop him at the Senate Judiciary Committee. They could not stop him with witnesses. So now they’re out to destroy him, and destroy his family and destroy his life, and destroy his career, and destroy his future. And even if he survives this and is on the court, they will continue to destroy him with books and movies and all that.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/14/kavanaugh-story-takes-despicable-turn/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 14, 2018RUSH: Now, the Kavanaugh circumstance has taken an absolutely despicable turn. Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer of the New Yorker and Clarence Thomas fame are now claiming that this story is attempted rape, that Judge Kavanaugh, Brett Kavanaugh attempted to rape the girl when they were both 17 back in high school. This is the girl supposedly locked in the room that didn’t want any of this to come out.Ronan Farrow’s tweet: A woman alleged to two Democrats that during high school Brett Kavanaugh held her down and attempted to force himself on her, placing a hand over her mouth and turning up music to conceal her protests. How the politicians responded is now a controversy. So you put Ronan Farrow’s name in there, you know, he’s got instant credibility on this. Weinstein, Leslie Moonves.So, back in a moment.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. So now this has gone from being Anita Hill redux to Roy Moore redux. Anita Hill came forward and claimed that Clarence Thomas sexually harassed her — while she followed him to every job and career change he made — and the evidence was a pubic hair on a Coke can. Clarence Thomas had had enough of it at some point and gave a great speech on the whole idea of a high-tech lynching. I heard it again yesterday.I’d forgotten how powerful it was when he was speaking to the entire committee about this whole Anita Hill coming out of nowhere at the very end on the verge of confirmation. Well, now the same thing has happened with Kavanaugh. They’ve gone to every length possible to stop his confirmation, hounding Susan Collins. In fact, they were even bribing her. They were telling her that they were going to — and they did, actually — start raising like a million dollars for an opponent to run against her if she did not promise to vote against Kavanaugh.She would not give them that. So they have ratcheted up the harassment, including sending her a massive cardboard cutout of male genitalia. All she has said is that she doesn’t like the tactics of these people that oppose Judge Kavanaugh. She doesn’t like the tactics. Now with Kavanaugh himself, it was originally that he had locked a young girl in a room at age 17 in high school, and she eventually got out. Now Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer have entered the scene claiming that this was attempted rape.Now, if this is true, why wouldn’t this girl have come forward sometime before now? Kavanaugh has been in the news I don’t know how many times in recent years. He has undergone similar congressional hearings, confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his previous posts. He has worked in the Bush administration. He’s been involved in government lawyering for many, many years. Why now? Why all of a sudden now, when every effort to stop him seems to have been exhausted?We’re told that Dianne Feinstein had this letter for months and she’s been sitting on it, that whoever sent it to her asked her to not do anything with it, which is really odd when you think about it. Why send the letter to a United States senator if you’re then gonna ask, “Don’t do anything with this and keep my name out of it”? Why send it? When I heard that yesterday, it’s like so much of what goes on: It doesn’t make any sense. If you don’t want to be caught up in this, then don’t send that letter!You obviously want to be caught up in it if you’re gonna send a United States senator a letter. You don’t detail what happened, and then Dianne Feinstein finally decides to release it, turns it over to the FBI. The FBI says, “We’re not gonna investigate this.” Well, that was yesterday. But whoever this is out in California could have come forward many times before now because Kavanaugh’s been in the news many times before, including his previous appointments to the court.He’s been reported to be on Trump’s short list since before Trump was elected. Trump put together a list of people he would nominate to the Supreme Court, and it was a very important factor in him getting elected, by the way. That’s why he is judiciously following that list because it was. It was one of the stabilizing aspects of Trump. It was one of the things that helped people stabilize their view of Trump. That list of Supreme Court nominees was fabulous.He has stuck to it, and it mitigated against charges that Trump was a loose cannon and undependable and didn’t know right from wrong, didn’t know conservative from liberal and all. But the point is Kavanaugh’s name has been out there publicly every day for three years minimum now. Why wouldn’t this have been mentioned before? And if the charge was this serious — if it’s attempted rape — why didn’t Feinstein give it to the FBI back in July?And if it’s true, why hasn’t Kavanaugh told anybody about this as a warning? And why didn’t Feinstein tell other Judiciary Committee members about this? Why did she hold this close to the vest and not say anything to anybody? And why didn’t she asked Kavanaugh about it when they met in private or even when she questioned him in public? Let’s go to some audio sound bites. Let’s see. Nah. This is Trump’s tweets over the hurricane and Puerto Rico. They’re not letting that go.They think they’ve got Trump now on this hurricane in Puerto Rico and they’re gonna nail him. Let’s see. I tell you what let’s do. Grab sound bites 2 and 3 and 4 to start with — and 5. Yeah. Here’s Clarence Thomas, sunset we’re on the subject. Let’s go back. He was on C-SPAN on Wednesday night. They aired a Federalist Society event that was recorded Saturday in Fort Worth. Justice Thomas spoke, and here is a portion of what he said…THOMAS: I was asking a friend this week, “What happened to the word ‘honor’?” Think about it. How many peep can you use — in leadership positions today — the word that I used: “honorable”? “Honorable.” Not “the honorable.” “Honorable.” If we could use that word about more people who are in public life — people who actually ask the questions at confirmation hearings instead of Spartacus. (chuckling)AUDIENCE: (laughter)RUSH: A little dig there at Cory Booker, and what he’s saying makes sense. Where is the honor? Where is the respect for what’s going on? We’re talking about here a judicial nominee to the United States Supreme Court. Where is the honor in simply dealing with the occasion? It’s United States Supreme Court.It’s the Supreme Court. It’s the law of the land. Where is the treatment of this with any honor and dignity at all? There hasn’t been any! The dignity is long gone. The honor is nowhere to be found. It’s just nothing but despicable, extremist and radical left-wing politics destroying whatever they have to destroy along the way to getting what they want. Same appearance, next bite, Justice Thomas.THOMAS: If we could use the word “honorable” more often, think about the difference it will make. Then you’ll have a legacy. We will have left the country in better shape morally, structurally, than we found it. But as long as we’re looking at our interests or scoring points or looking cute or being on TV? If you can’t debate hard issues honestly with honor, with integrity, how do we keep a civil society?RUSH: Well, it’s a good question. How many of you would suggest that we have a civil society now? You remember the mayor of Baltimore, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, she made a big point out of giving protesters space to destroy. We had to acknowledge their rage, acknowledge their anger, and if they wanted to go someplace and do a protest, gotta give ’em space. If they got destroy something to get it out of their system, let ’em do it.Is there a civil society on college campi today? This Puerto Rican thing, do you know that some group of people Puerto Rican or Latino protesters — I don’t have the name right in front of me — are having a massive protest on September 22nd, next Saturday, at Mar-a-Lago. And of course these people, protesting, that’s wonderful about America. Dissent is how America came to be. You must honor dissent.Not your kind. Your dissent is designed to destroy, not build up. Anyway, it’s a great point. Here is Justice Thomas. We’re gonna go back and just listen to a little bit of the high-tech lynching remarks that he made. It’s October 11th, 1991, on Capitol Hill during the confirmation hearings. This is after the Anita Hill thing had been brought to light. It was the wife of Senator Paul Simon, by the way, for those of you who weren’t live in ’91 or old enough to pay attention.Thomas was sailing along, the left was fit to be tied because they considered this to be their seat. Thurgood Marshall, first African-American Supreme Court justice had passed away. George H. W. Bush nominates Clarence Thomas, and they went berserk because that was their seat, they said. That seat belongs to a Jesse Jackson type, not Clarence Thomas. And they raised holy hell.And they were not able to stop Thomas until at the very end they had persuaded this babe Anita Hill to come forward and claim that Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her and it was the wife of Illinois Senator Paul Simon who led that process of going to her, talking to her, and getting her to do it.There was some other California babe named Susan Hoerchner. She testified looking constantly constipated. I’ve never forgotten it. I had a great impression of Judge Hoerchner. She was an administrative law judge, basically a shrink judge. But it was a circus. And here’s Justice Thomas as a nominee testifying about all this.THOMAS: This is a circus. It’s a national disgrace. It is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves. And it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, you will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the U.S. Senate rather than hung from a tree.RUSH: Right. He went to talk about how it was Kafkaesque. Ruth Bader Ginsburg Wednesday night, Washington, George Washington University School of Law. She spoke and she did a Q&A. And this was part of what she said.GINSBURG: Justice Scalia, who was certainly a known character, he had been a law professor and written many things, he had been on the DC Circuit, and the vote was unanimous. That’s the way it should be, instead of what it’s become, which is a highly partisan show.RUSH: There you have it. It’s true. She got confirmed 88 to nothing or 88 to 2, whatever. Justice Scalia, 98 to 2. It was overwhelming. We haven’t seen those days since Robert Bork.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Tolland, Connecticut. Chris, great to have you. I’m glad you waited, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hey, Rush. Thanks for spreading the truth.RUSH: I try. Thank you very much for recognizing it.CALLER: I just wanted to mention, like when your other callers was saying the outrage about why Congress, Senate, uses taxpayer money to hide things, but I’m just wondering where all the outrage is against Keith Ellison but yet they want to say something about Kavanaugh.RUSH: Keith Ellison’s one of their guys. They’re not gonna help take down one of their own guys. They couldn’t save Weinstein! They couldn’t save Moonves! But they can save the chairman of the Democrat National Committee. Plus, you know, he checks a lot of boxes. He’s African-Americans, African-American, African-American, African-American. He’s African-American. (interruption) Muslim? Is he Muslim? That’s a big box to check. He’s African-American. Male. I think male could be demerit; so there might be, you know, cis nonbinary, cis nonbinary, African-American.They’re not gonna willingly take out — they’re gonna see if people will ignore that too. Look, you raise a good point, don’t misunderstand, I’m playing devil’s advocate with you. Don’t expect them to take their own people out. And notice that Democrat voters don’t even care! If they even hear about it. I don’t think the Democrats or the media, they didn’t widely broadcast the sexual peccadillos and oddities of Keith Ellison anyway. Chris, I appreciate the call.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/13/feinstein-tries-to-metoo-kavanaugh/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 13, 2018RUSH: We have more breaking news, ladies and gentlemen. Dianne Feinstein… This is despicable. It is obvious that the efforts they have made to bribe Susan Collins into voting against Brett Kavanaugh have failed. You know what that is? There’s a bunch of leftists that have been threatening Susan Collins. These questions set up a collection campaign, GoFundMe or something like that for one of her opponents in Maine to the tune of maybe a million dollars to run against her if she votes for Kavanaugh.If she doesn’t vote for Kavanaugh, then they withdraw. This is bribery, pure and simple, and she’s resisting it, and she’s being openly critical of the tactics of people on the left. News from Dianne Feinstein. Feinstein’s statement on Kavanaugh: “I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities.”Man, are they grasping at straws now. What do you think this is? What is it? Some anonymous person that doesn’t want to take it anywhere has gotten hold of Feinstein despite the fact this anonymous person wants to stay anonymous and doesn’t want to come forward or press the matter. Despite all that, DiFi says she’s honoring that decision but has referred the matter to federal investigative authorities. How is that not pressing the matter further? So what do you think this is? Want to take a stab at it? What is she referring to?What could possibly be so earth shattering so late in the game, when Grassley has scheduled the vote for Kavanaugh or is close to? I tell you what I think. I think it’s a #MeToo thing. I think Dianne Feinstein’s trying to say that a woman has come forward and has evidence that Kavanaugh mistreated her. What else could it be? Ah, I guess it could be any number of things. But that’s the first thing that comes to mind.And if it is that — if it’s something that got Weinstein, if it’s something that got Leslie Moonves and now this guy at CBS, Jeff Fager — well, there’s no way this could be investigated before the vote. So it’d be a cloud hanging over Kavanaugh. This investigation that she’s referred it to. There’s no investigation that can happen before the vote; so got this giant cloud now hanging over Kavanaugh at the time of the vote placed there by a desperate Democrat Party and Dianne Feinstein, who had a spy from China on her staff for 20 years!Nobody cares; nobody seems to think it’s a problem.It’s a hail Mary because they have apparently failed in their efforts to intimidate and bribe Susan Collins.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Without knowing what it is that this late comer has told Dianne Feinstein, stop and think of something. This is almost like Clarence Thomas. Near the end of his confirmation hearings, all of a sudden here came Anita Hill. This guy, Kavanaugh, they have turned his life inside out and upside down for how many months now, and at the last moment somebody nobody found, somebody nobody had any idea existed has tiptoed forward to anonymously tell Dianne Feinstein? I wonder if this somebody in the Trump administration or maybe a journalist pretending to be whatever this is.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I was right. This is it. This is the Anita Hill playbook. This is a rehash of Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas at the last moment on the eve of the vote for Brett Kavanaugh. Headline for a story at TheHill.com: “Senate Democrats Sending Secret Letter About Kavanaugh to the FBI — Sources told The Intercept that the letter was relayed to lawmakers by an individual affiliated with Stanford University. Some sources told the publication that it was about an incident involving Kavanaugh and a woman while they were in high school. Attorney Debra Katz is believed to be representing the woman who is the subject of the letter.”I guess we shouldn’t be surprised. It’s an attempt to get in on the #MeToo movement. The #MeToo movement has ended up destroying too many Democrat guys. Moonves is now gone, Jeff Fager at 60 Minutes is now gone, Weinstein, of course, is gone. There’s a whole slew of ’em, of liberal Democrat men who are literal pigs when it comes to treating women. I guess they’ve gotta find a way here to stop Kavanaugh. They tried bribing Susan Collins into voting against him. She’s resisted those efforts.So now Dianne Feinstein, she has this statement. If you’re just joining us, she issued a statement, quote, “I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further. I have honored that decision.”No, you haven’t. You sent the letter to the FBI. “I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities,” which would be the FBI. And TheHill.com, attorney Debra Katz believed to be representing the woman who is the subject of the letter, and sources told The Intercept that the letter was relayed to lawmakers by an individual that was affiliated with Stanford. Some sources told the publication it was an incident involving Kavanaugh and a woman while they were in high school.I think it’s strange the guy’s had his life thoroughly examined for how many months now, certainly weeks? And they come up with nothing. In fact, when it comes to women, there are liberal women who have said he’s a genius, he’d be great on the court. There are women who have worked with him throughout his career who have done nothing but say the most amazingly positive things in recommending him.But they found somebody from high school — oh, no! No! I take that back. They didn’t find anybody. They were minding their own business and somebody affiliated with Stanford University decided to say, “You know what? They didn’t get rid of the guy. I gotta stop him.” And so out of the blue, Dianne Feinstein gets this letter. It is despicable.Now I tell you what I expect to happen. A bunch of people on our side of the aisle, rather than rejecting this out of hand and characterize it for what it is, are gonna start wringing their hands and get all worried, “Oh, no,” and start talking about how an investigation can’t take place before the vote. “Oh, no, what do we do?” And then some voices, maybe Trump should withdraw the nom. Don’t be surprised if you hear this. Maybe Trump should withdraw.We can’t be tainted by this. I can’t tell you how many times that this has happened where people on our side don’t even question the premise, don’t even challenge the premise, just accept it, try to limit the damage so that it doesn’t affect them.I just got a statement from Grassley on this. “Senator Grassley is aware of Senator Feinstein’s referral. At this time he has not seen the letter in question and is respecting the request for confidentiality. No plan to change the committee’s consideration of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination.”So according to Grassley, the vote will continue to go, it will happen on the 20th, which is a week from today, for those of you in Rio Linda. But of course that’s subject to change. Grassley, “I haven’t seen it, but I’ll be glad to respect the confidentiality here.”BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Don in Chicago, great to have you on the EIB Network. Hi.CALLER: Hello, Rush.RUSH: Hey. What’s happening?CALLER: First-time caller, and I’ve been listening since about a month after Barack Obama took over as president.RUSH: Well, thank you. I’m glad you’re out there, sir.CALLER: Good. Just an observation. I think the purpose of this Dianne Feinstein issue is not only to delay the Kavanaugh hearings, but regardless of how the Republicans react, the Democrats will have it to use as a campaign issue.RUSH: Oh, obviously. You mean a campaign issue above and beyond the Kavanaugh hearings?CALLER: Exactly. On it or regardless of how the Republicans — if the Republicans hold off, they’ll say, well, they’ve gotta hold off and the Republicans don’t want to hold off. If they go ahead with it they’ll say the Republicans went ahead and everybody knew that there was an issue here.RUSH: You know what? There’s no stopping it now. They’ve pulled the trigger on this. So we have to follow this through and find a way to deal with it. You know, the Access Hollywood video didn’t work with Trump. These people keep going back to the same pages in their playbook. I’m telling you, this is Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill redux.It’s almost identical. This is happening a little later than they found Anita Hill and trotted her forward, but it’s the same premise except this woman is in high school, or the incident supposedly was in high school. She’s now at Stanford. The reason they tell you that is so they can find her. You know, she wants anonymity. Supposedly. Dianne Feinstein said, “I’m gonna respect the anonymity, I’m gonna respect the fact she doesn’t want to investigate it, but I’m gonna investigate it anyway.”I guarantee you right now, everybody in the Drive-Bys are going through yearbooks, okay, high school, Stanford, she’s there now; so who went to high school with Kavanaugh, who’s at Stanford now? They’ll come out with a database of people, they’ll start narrowing it down. And it is to provide a cloud over the vote. I think they may have a dream that this would suspend the vote, delay the vote, it’s a serious allegation.We’re back here — the Mueller investigation is this. Clarence Thomas, there was never any evidence other than a pubic hair on a Coke can. That was it. And that couldn’t be proved. So what we have here is not the nature of the evidence, once again the Democrats are trotting out the seriousness of the charge mandates that we investigate even though there isn’t any evidence, the seriousness of the charge, and that’s what Mueller is relying on too.

I’m inviting all my friends to listen to you throughout the week, and at the weekend we are gonna get together and we’re gonna talk ’cause I feel like you can’t rely on the mainstream media to do any of that for you and I feel like that’s the only reason why the left still has as many reach and as much power as they do.RUSH: That is excellent. I’m very… Your enthusiasm is great.CALLER: Thank you.RUSH: You said you’re a Millennial; so you’re near 30, and —CALLER: Yeah, I’m on the upper edge. I’ll be 33 next year.RUSH: Right. So you’re on the upper edge. But I remember that passion. I remember it. I had it. I still do. That’s the great thing. A lot of people outgrow it. A lot of people grow out of it when they don’t see as much success as they envision, when they don’t see it happening as quickly. Some people… It’s not that they give up. They just lose some of the passion. Don’t lose the passion.CALLER: Exactly.RUSH: Do not lose the passion as you continue to do this.CALLER: I will not. I’m so fired up. And I just… God bless Kanye. We need more people like him to come out. I feel so bad for him. Like, I’ve experienced that sort of, like, attack, from me saying, “Oh, I’m Republican or I’m conservative.” I can’t imagine what it’s like for him. I think he’s doing an amazing thing. And I think this is a really pivotal time, and I think… I have hope that the left is just losing it and they’re unraveling. And I have hope for my generation, I think.RUSH: I’m so enthused to hear that. You are the second, maybe the third Millennial age caller today with the same belief that what you’re watching on the left is an unraveling. You’re watching them come unglued. And I hope you’re right. It would make perfect sense to me. The thing is… Well, here I’m up against time. Look, thanks so much for the call. I appreciate it. Keep the passion.  "

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/10/rush-to-trump-dont-cancel-lunch-with-kanye-take-him-with-you-to-survey-the-hurricane/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 10, 2018RUSH: Had a little story here by our old buddy Roger Simon at PJ Media. The headline: “Kanye Is Not Alone: Blacks Are Deserting the Democrat Party — In the middle of the Kavanaugh madness a fascinating development passed relatively under the radar Thursday. Trump’s approval ratings among black voters hit 35% in the Rasmussen Report survey. This day last year, it was 23%.”So in one year, Trump’s approval rate among African-Americans has jumped from 23% to 35%. No matter how you feel about polls, a 12-point jump in a year is significant. ‘Cause I’m telling you, folks, and you know this. Every presidential election, 90%, 88, 92% of the black vote goes Democrat. If that number ever became 70%, the Democrat Party would be up the tepee. They would be in deep doo-doo, and they know it, and everybody else knows it.Now, this 12-point increase, this is especially true and surprising considering the constant drumbeat from the press that Trump is a racist pig. Somebody’s not buying it, and it’s not just Kanye West. If this number grows just a little bit, the Democrat Party is, as I say, in deep tepee. And there is a story here, Celebrity Insider, Jay-Z and Beyonce Z are completely done with Kim Kardashians and Kanye West after Kanye’s latest antics.Kanye is scheduled to have lunch with Trump in the Oval Orifice tomorrow. Somebody told me, “If that happened, it’d be a big mistake. Trump need not have lunch with some celebrity after this hurricane’s hit. Don’t do it. Cancel it.” I said, “No. Take Kanye with you, if you go down there and view the disaster area. Put Kanye on the jet and go down there and survey it. That’s how you have lunch with him. You don’t break the date. You take him along with you.” That’s what I told him to do.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/10/democrat-bowling-team-captain-sounds-midterm-alarm/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 10, 2018RUSH: You know, for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact that they’re gonna be running the world in three weeks, I’m finding a lot of evidence of insecurity. For example, I have a story here. What is this? This is in TheHill.com, and it’s a column by somebody named Brent Budowsky, who sounds like the captain of a bowling team.Snerdley said he thinks this guy was a legislative aide to who? (interruption) You think…? (interruption) This guy worked for the Lord Bentsen, the former senator in Texas. “I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine, and you, Quayle, you’re no Jack Kennedy.” That Lord Bentsen, right? (interruption) Okay. Well, whether he did or not, he still writes pieces for TheHill.com.“Budowsky: Code Red Alert to Democrats.” What? I thought the Democrats were smokin’. I thought the Democrats are gonna win everything! Like TheHill.com had a story yesterday that made it look like 209 seats are gonna convert to the Democrat Party. “Former first lady Michelle Obama, one of the most popular and respected public figures in America, should spend a day taping personal endorsements for Democratic candidates for the House and Senate …“This column is a code red alert…” I’m reading from it, by the way. “This column is a code red alert to Democrats and a call to arms for the most popular and respected Democrats in America, such as Michelle [My Belle] Obama, to lead the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy. In my view,” writes Budowsky, “there’s a 25% chance that Democrats end the midterms with a nightmare scenario.”What?A 25% chance of a nightmare?Well, I thought you guys had it all locked up! I thought you pretty much had the House already done. Pelosi’s already talking about being speaker. You guys are already planning to impeach and investigate Kavanaugh and then Trump or vice versa. Now “there’s a 25% chance that Democrats end the midterms with a nightmare scenario”? That’s not quite the same as a 93% chance Hillary wins the presidency at 5 p.m. on election night. Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.Why are these people panicking?Mr. Budowsky says, “This is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves. It is a moment for bold and maximum action and turnout based on a powerful and urgent sense of opportunity and danger.” He says, “It is even possible Democrats win the House by a significant number of seats. However, it is also possible that the Democrats gain only 20 seats, falling short of winning control.“That would leave House Republicans dominant with a smaller but even more right-wing majority as the leading losers in the House midterms are comparatively moderate GOP House members. … Democrats could lose one or two Senate seats, continuing a Republican Senate that is even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority today.”Budowsky says, “If this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America unfolds on Election Day, a vindictive and triumphant Trump — having won a victory for the politics of hatred, fear and…” (laughing) Don’t you love this? You people on the left don’t understand unity when you see it. You don’t understand love when you see it. You do not understand confidence when you see it. You see love; you see hatred. You see excitement; you think you see fear.RUSH: When you see thousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies, you somehow see division. “[A] vindictive and triumphant Trump … will stand alongside Republican leaders of the new Republican Congress feeling he has achieved an unstoppable dominance over his party, our country and every branch of government with all checks and balances destroyed.”“This code red alert,” writes Budowsky, “warns about the danger of so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president who tried to criminalize his opponent…” (laughing) What? Who did what? Who tried to criminalize who? Is this guy serious? Trump tried to criminalize…? Hillary did engage in criminal activities. Not only with her email server, but in working with the Russians and creating a phony dossier that…Oh, and by the way, there is now, thanks to John Solomon… Folks, we’ve been talking for the longest time about how the Clinton campaign paid Steele to write the dossier that was then used by the FBI to go get a FISA warrant. John Solomon has now confirmed that that happened. There is no doubt, and it’s been confirmed in unclassified testimony by a lawyer from the FBI named James Baker.This is no more a matter of speculation. It actually did happen. Well, we didn’t need it confirmed. We already knew it. But it’s now been smack-dab officially confirmed that the Clinton administration conceived and commissioned the writing of that dossier that everybody knew was fake and phony, and they used the law firm Perkins Coie as a cutout to pay for it to make the money spent on this look like legal campaign expenses.And then that dossier was taken to the FBI and used by the FBI to get a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign. We now know, it’s incontrovertibly proved — even though Mueller is ignoring it — that the FBI tried to sabotage the Trump campaign and then tried to run a little soft, silent coup to get Trump out of office after he was elected and inaugurated. And this guy Budowsky has the audacity to say Trump “tried to criminalize his opponent in the last election”?Donald Trump is the victim of criminality and always has been and continues to be. Now, this is a great illustration of the divide. There’s nothing in common with this. This is such a perverted, disjointed, absent-any-kind-of-reality view of things that it is impossible to find any common ground. There isn’t any overlap. We’re dealing with an unhinged group of people who have lost the ability to reason and don’t care to even.But the point of this is they’re scared. They’re worried. They don’t really believe this blue wave business. Not thoroughly. Not if they’re gonna write pieces like this where they admit there’s a 25 to 30% chance they could lose everything and then Trump would win everything, and of course if that happens then democracy has been flouted. The people voting their preferences is an example of democracy failing, to these people, when they lose.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Going back here to the bowling team captain’s piece, Brent Budowsky. Did you notice who he said…? If the Republicans hold on, if the Republicans hold onto the House and hold onto the Senate, did you hear him very frightfully point out how that would happen? It would happen because moderate Republicans would be losing and they would be replaced by conservative Republicans.In other words, if the Republicans hold, the Republicans who will win in these districts where Republicans are retiring, his theory is, (imitation) “We could get even more conservatism! We could get even more conservative House and a more conservative Senate!” He’s putting the moderate Republicans at greatest risk for losing in his theory, in his code red alert, warning Democrats the Republicans could win it.So he’s saying that moderate Republicans are at the greater risk of losing their seats in the House. Now, how is that possible, given everything we are told by the Democrat Party and the Drive-By Media? They tell us America loves the moderates, America loves the centrists, America doesn’t want any part of extremists! America wants no part whatsoever of radicals. And yet there is the entire Democrat Party which is nothing but radical now.My point is, again, do not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and that there’s gonna be this gigantic blue wave, because not even the Democrats, in their private selves, when they talk to each other in private, not even they really believe it. They want you to think they do. They want you to be dispirited or depressed. They are very alarmed, in fact, that the latest polls that show the Kavanaugh effect on the Republican side is ginning up turnout.It’s ginning up interest, and they’re really flummoxed and ticked off at a bunch of polling data. There’s an NPR poll out there. There’s a Fox News poll, a couple others that show suburban Republican women are saying in polling data that they have a renewed interest, an increased energy, an intense desire to go vote. This is not what was supposed to happen. That’s why all these attacks lately in leftist media ripping into white conservative suburban women and do we need them or not?And we don’t, they say. So this is not… As we sit here today, this is not developing as they want you to think it is. Back in 2016, do you remember any pieces before the presidential race anywhere in Democrat media warning people, “Hey, hey, you know what? There’s a nightmare scenario here where Trump could win. You gotta dial it back. We gotta be very careful.” Do you remember any of that?There was none. They were so solid sure. They were definitely convinced that they were gonna win every. Hillary was gonna win in the biggest landslide. I mean, they had Trump’s chances at 3%, 7%, 10%. But nobody gave Trump a chance. In fact, some of the news even said Trump never thought he was gonna win! Trump never even wanted to win! Trump was the most surprised guy on Election Day in the world when he won.He didn’t want to win; they were all depressed at Trump headquarters! That’s what they wanted you to believe. Now they’ve started out saying the same thing as though power is a birthright that every American realizes the Democrats have to be put back in power. Every American releases the mistake of voting for Trump. Every Trump voter can’t wait to apologize. Every Trump voter realizes, is embarrassed, wants to fix the mistake; can’t wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot.Now all of a sudden… It’s not just Budowsky, by the way, either. There are others who are raising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish.  "

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/09/we-must-understand-what-were-up-against-because-this-is-new/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 9, 2018RUSH: Mollie Ziegler Hemingway at The Federalist… Snerdley, didn’t you tell me that after Kavanaugh was confirmed that one of the first things that you saw prominent conservatives saying was, “Don’t gloat, don’t gloat, don’t gloat”? (interruption)Yeah, that was some guy at The Federalist. Well, Mollie Hemingway has a little tweet here trying, but failing to understand. (paraphrased) “Don’t fight for what you believe in too hard! Don’t make fun of political opponents’ extremism. Don’t celebrate your victories too much in the conservative movement.” Meaning what this is, “Don’t celebrate.” What this means is, “Don’t spike the ball.” What is this, “Don’t act excited”? What…? She doesn’t understand why the conservative movement wants to tone down…She knows the answer to this. We all know the answer. Conservatives, the properly mannered, the properly decorumed, the properly refined and sophisticated conservatives don’t want people to think of them in tribal or radical kind of ways. You’re not supposed to spike the ball. You’re not supposed to humiliate your vanquished opponents. Just quietly go on to… She’s saying she doesn’t understand it. And she is right. Here’s Blasey Ford’s story on her big award.Try this. Breitbart News: “Saints [Running Back] Alvin Kamara…” By the way, the guy is a good player. I think he’s No. 21 for the New Orleans Saints. “Saints RB Alvin Kamara Wears ‘Make Africa Home Again’ Hat and Kaepernick Jersey to Stadium” for last night’s game against the Washington Redskins! You’re not supposed to say that too loud; so I do. “As players arrived at Mercedes-Benz Superdome for Monday’s game between New Orleans and Washington, Saints running back Alvin Kamara appeared wearing a Colin Kaepernick jersey and a red ball cap with the slogan ‘Make Africa Home Again.”He “didn’t exactly explain his hat and why he is pining for Africa. However, the player’s mother is a Liberian immigrant.” Well, he doesn’t have to explain it. And this is more polling data from New York Magazine. “Poll: Majority of Americans Say Kavanaugh Should Not Be on the Supreme Court.” New York Magazine. So we’ve got The Hill claiming here that… The promo of the article says the majority of Americans don’t want Kavanaugh on their Supreme Court or Republicans in control of their Congress or Donald Trump in their White House.This is a CNN poll. It’s the same poll, by the way, that… Well, now I’m confused, ’cause the CNN poll shows that Kavanaugh’s popularity after having been confirmed is increasing. But they still say a majority of Americans say Kavanaugh should not be on the court, and The Hill, in promoting this article (this runs in New York Magazine, TheHill.com) a majority of Americans don’t want Kavanaugh on their Supreme Court or Republicans in control of their Congress or Donald Trump in their White House.You see, Republicans are outliers, strangers, oddballs, kooks, really weird. Not even Americans, really. Not even part of this country. They’re interlopers and a majority of the American people don’t want Republicans in charge of their country, their court, their Congress, or their White House. Here’s a pull quote: “Of course, in a well-functioning democracy, any of these news cycles would have been terrible for the Republican Party. But in a well-functioning democracy, the Senate would have rejected Kavanaugh’s nomination:“The 50 senators who voted him onto the court last weekend collectively represent just 44% of the U.S. population.” So New York Magazine… I told you this Kavanaugh thing, this is just the beginning of what I don’t think most people can even imagine is headed our way. Some of you I think do, but I think a lot of people have no idea the absolute tumult and chaos that we’re all headed for. Regardless the results of elections, I just think the left is out of control and has a mission that is designed to totally wipe out and erase any traces of the actual founding of this country, the principles and the reasons behind it.And, you know, if you’ve been listening regularly, I have been dabbling at this in a focused manner for the past two to three weeks attempting to explain the depths here of my concern, and what I think is actually happening and what needs to happen to beat it back and how difficult that is going to be. And, as such, it’s amazing. I keep running into… In the process of putting the show together every day, I keep running into pieces written by people who are thinking along the same lines I am, and they have different ways of expressing their concerns than I do.I’m happy to run across these things. I print them out, and I’ve got a couple of them here I want to give you some excerpts from and share with you because they’re very, very close to echoing my sentiments. But before getting into those, let me give you a couple of preludes. “Special Ed Teacher…” It’s a Washington Times headline. “Special Ed Teacher on Paid Leave After Call to Kill Justice Kavanaugh”“A special education teacher in Minnesota may soon receive some ‘special’ attention by federal law enforcement officials after calling for the killing,” for the murder, “of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Intermediate School District 917 has placed Samantha Ness on paid administrative leave for a tweet, now deleted, which encouraged the assassination of the newest member of the U.S. Supreme Court. Samantha Ness tweeted: ‘So who’s [sic] gonna take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh?'”Ms. Ness later followed up with a subsequent tweet, “Brett Kavanaugh [sic] will be dealing with death threats for the rest of his life being on the Supreme Court. I doubt my mid-west [sic] ass is a real threat.” But bear in mind this woman’s a teacher of special ed students. What if one of them decided to carry out her wishes? Now, she has deleted her Twitter account, but her tweet was captured and shared by a bunch of people who said they reported it to the FBI and the Secret Service.Now, for the record, it’s the US Marshals Service that protects federal judges. But six of one, half dozen of another. “Google Executive Slams the GOP Over the Kavanaugh Nomination: ‘[F-BOMB]. YOU. ALL. TO. HELL.’ — A design leader at Google has slammed Republicans in an angry Twitter rant over the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh.” David Hogue is his name, not to be confused with Camera Hogg. ‘”You are finished, @GOP. You polished the final nail for your own coffins. [F-BOMB]. YOU. ALL. TO. HELL,’ wrote Dave Hogue Saturday, in the now-deleted tweet.“‘I hope the last images burned into your slimy, evil, treasonous retinas are millions of women laughing and clapping and celebrating as your souls descend into the flames,’ he added.” Folks, this is not idle ranting by the deranged. This is our opposition. This is the American left today. This is the result of two generations of college education, the campus and the corruption and the perversion there has become mainstreamed in American pop culture. It’s not on the fringes. This is my point.It’s not out there on the fringes and it’s not something that you would say is not representative or descriptive of the mainstream of the American left. This is who they are. This is a design leader! This is some leading design executive at Google! During the hearings last week, one of Kavanaugh’s best friends showed up to sit behind him. He is a top-tier executive at Facebook. Facebook employees were outraged when they saw his face on TV sitting behind Kavanaugh at the Judiciary Committee hearing, and they have demanded that the guy be fired.They’ve demanded that all kinds of things… Facebook employees. Facebook has caved, and the executive has apologized. He’s sorry for offending Facebook employees. This is not fringe. These are not outliers. These are people who make up the base, the foundation, the mainstream of the American left today, and particularly and importantly within pop culture. Google, Facebook, high-tier executives and ranking employees demanding Kafkaesque-like treatment for the people who show any allegiance to the enemy, any friendship with the enemy.Do not think this is gonna go away, and don’t think it’s a couple of extreme examples. This is who they are. Sarah Silverman, a well-known and oftentimes just filthy comedienne, said that she hopes President Donald Trump would one day be a victim of sexual assault, ‘held down’ and ‘violated’ in a tweet Friday. ‘I hope you someday understand what it is to be held down against your will and violated. Your compassion is startless,’ [sic] Sarah Silverman tweeted at Trump.”It was just 10 years ago that so-called comedienne Sandra Bernhard was threatening Sarah Palin that if she ever came to New York City she would be “gang-raped by my big black brothers,” quote, unquote. Remember the outrage on that one from the Democrat Party? This tweet, by the way, from Sarah Silverman was in response to President Trump saying that unruly protesters in Washington, D.C. are ‘paid professionals’.Trump tweeted: “The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad.” Look, they may be paid, but that does not diminish what they’re doing. They would be there anyway. The fact that they’re being paid is insurance that they get there. But do not think that just because they’re being paid, this rage and hatred is not real. I will grant that among some of these protesters bused in that there’s a lot of acting and they’re reciting scripts that they’ve memorized.But folks, do not discount the prevalence of this as identifying characteristics of people on the left. Trump has characterized them as an angry mob. They have reacted as an angry mob. Christopher Coldwell writes for the Weekly Standard. And he has a piece that I came across in the process of show prep each and every day, and I mentioned a moment ago that I’ve run across some things that happen to coincidentally…Sometimes I wonder, you know, “How did I run across these? Is it divine intervention?” because they help me formulate the things I wish to say you about this. And he has a piece here about the Kavanaugh aftermath, and here is the relevant part of it for me. “The general Democratic view that has hardened since the 1960s is the one expressed on many occasions by Barack” Hussein O. “The United States is not…” By the way, this is very important! This is [Christopher] Caldwell. He names this…This is a description of how the left sees America, and that view of America “is the one expressed on many occasions by Barack Obama.” It is this. “The United States is not a country bound by a common history or a common ethnicity — it is a set of values.” Now, think back to all the times you can hear Obama… Remember Obama speaking about an event that had happened or something that he had planned in legislation?He was famous. (impression) “This is not our values. This is not who we are. And we must be better. These are not our values.” And every time he did it, well, his values are never mind, and I’m looking at what he was talking about. I can’t remember specifics here, but just the idea that he would stand there and presume to be the arbiter and the person who defines American values while rejecting the premise of the very founding of America!How can in the world can this guy’s values be said to be America’s values when Obama and his Democrats reject the common principles found in the very origins of America? But this point is right on the money. That, as far as the left is concerned, we don’t have anything in common. (summarized) “We don’t have a common history. White people have a history and then the minorities all have another history, and there’s nothing in common.“And the white people have been illegally running things for their benefit for 200-some-odd years and the minorities have been taking it on the chin. And it’s about time that changed. That’s what this upheaval and overthrow is all about.” There’s nothing in common. There’s no… The minorities of America sense no greatness in America.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Right. So here’s the thing, folks. According to Obama and the left, America is not a country bound by common history or anything of the sort. There is no common ethnicity; there is no common trace to our similarities. We have nothing in common at all. Instead, America is “a set of values” — a set of values — and that’s all America is: A set of values the left defines to build a country around.But there’s a dark side to that. Rather than culture and society and commonality defining values, the left defines values based on their political perversions and corruption. And if that’s all a country is, a set of values, then somebody who does not share those values is not permitted to be a member of the community — and that’s us, folks. Conservatives. We don’t share their values. Their values define America. We are out.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let me just finish this business about the way America is according to the modern American left. This includes the Democrat Party and the media. There is a disdain for our founding. That’s what we all think that we have in common. Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, founding documents, Declaration, Constitution. Not these people. America is flawed. America is illegitimate. It was not properly founded because it was founded only for a few people — rich white men.This is what’s being taught. You can say it’s crazy. You can say you don’t believe it. This is what has been taught for two generations on the American college campus in the academe. Young, impressionable kids — especially minorities — are eating it up. They are swallowing it whole. They love it. It explains so many failures. It explains the injustices, the inequalities. It explains why capitalism sucks. It’s a built-in excuse for people who don’t think they matter, who don’t think they’re ever gonna matter!They turn their lives over to Democrats to get even. Not to make their lives better, but to get even with all these people who have made their lives horrible! So you set up “a set of values,” and that’s the basis on which the country is built. You get to define the values, and anybody that doesn’t subscribe to ’em is not welcome in the so-called nation or the community. If you don’t share the values of the American left, then you’re not really a member of this national community.You’re not deserving of its basic protections like presumption of innocence, because you’re flawed from the get-go. If you don’t share the values of Christine Blasey Ford and the Senate Democrats on the committee, then you don’t get any presumption of innocence. You don’t get any benefit of the doubt. You don’t deserve to be on the court because you represent a threat to their “set of values.” Illegal immigrants? They belong! They are accepted members of the community, provisionally, because they share the same values.And what are those values? The values of discrimination. The values of insufficiency, inadequacy. The values of being mistreated, forgotten — and the value of voting Democrat. Never forget that. But this explains what is, to many people, an inexplicable divide. Why would so many American leftists attach virtue to people in the country illegally, and talk about the separation of families and these kids, and have no concern — no concern — about the future of kids alive and born in America?It’s all based on this values basis on which they organize the country. So illegal immigrants — children separated from their mommies by the Trump administration — have much more in common with the American left, which has been discriminated in similar ways by the white majority since the days of the founding. Illegal immigrants are partners in the struggle! Illegal immigrants and criminals in general are partners in the struggle against this oppressive majority, which has denied fun and liberty and freedom to anybody but themselves.Look at Kavanaugh himself. The first way they went after Kavanaugh was sexual assault. There wasn’t any evidence for that! There was no evidence; there was no corroboration. So then it became that he wouldn’t be fair! He wouldn’t be fair because of this whole experience, because of his anger, because of his extreme statements while he testified. It would prove that he was only interested in revenge — and therefore, he became temperamentally unacceptable.And then it became amplified where his judicial temperament was just not permitted!“He doesn’t have the values that we want on the Supreme Court.”So he was accused of partisanship. He was accused of judicial intemperate. He was accused of sexual harassment. None of those things stuck. So it basically boils down to the fact that he’s not one of them — and when you get route down to it, that’s what was all about. The irony is that Kavanaugh was chosen because he is an establishment guy, and it was thought that he would sail through much easier than, say, an Amy Coney Barrett, who is demonstrably conservative, has written of her opposition to Roe v. Wade.Now, there is another piece that I encountered. Andy McCarthy pointed me to it. A member of the board at National Review has his own website, David Bahnsen. B-a-h-n-s-e-n. He’s written a very detailed essay describing his fears for the culture war that we’re in and where we are headed. And, like me, he thinks that this Kavanaugh thing represents nothing of the end. But rather this is just the beginning and is an indication of how much worse things are going to get. Let me just titillate you here.This is one of the first pull quotes I excerpted from Mr. Bahnsen: “At the heart of my statement that things will never be the same again [in America] is this discovery: The left does not wish to co-exist with the right in this country; they wish to extinguish” the right. Now, not news to me. But you gotta remember, Beltway types, the Never Trumper conservatives have always assumed that they are brethren with their fellow leftist intellectuals.They’ve always thought that, even though they’re conservative and the leftists are will you believe, that still they’re both intellectuals, and they had that in common, and the leftist intellectuals would always accept the right-wing intellectual based on the commonality of intellectualism. That’s what always has just frustrated me to no end about the Never-Trumpers. They’re blind as bats. They’re not even in the field, much less in the game.Even now, even with this Kavanaugh stuff, some of them are reluctant to get in the game. They still seek the approval of those who reject them. They’ll go down the tubes with good manners. I still! I still run into… Believe this. I still run into Republicans who tell me, “If the Republicans would just stop talking about abortion, we could win elections. If the Republicans would just stop talking about abortion, just get rid of abortion…”I look at them with puzzlement like I cannot describe. “You really think that’s what all this is about?” “Yes! We’ve gotta stop talking about abortion.” I say, “When did you stop paying attention to politics, 20 years ago?” “What do you mean? We’re so far beyond that. You don’t even see it!” But at the heart of it is: “If we just change who we are, then they’ll stop being so mean,” and that is not true, and isn’t the answer, and it is not the solution, because they have no desire to coexist.They are not energized by the intellectual feast of debate like our intellectuals are. They don’t want any part of debating anything. There’s nothing to debate! We’re not legitimate to them! So they want to just wipe us out. We don’t share their values; we never will. There’s no reason to pay us any attention whatsoever. They do not value the so-called liberal order of society. What we’re living through right now is an unprecedented level of hate, dishonesty, distrust, and mistreatment.There is an amazingly strong disdain for the ideology of conservatism, but not just that. There is an unprecedented disdain and hatred of the social norms, ’cause they don’t fit in them. They know it. They don’t fit in them! They’re out to change what is normal, and it’s gonna be them and whatever they claim normal is. They want no part of constitutional government. Constitutional government’s part of that which has discriminated against them from the get-go.They don’t want any part of Western civilization. Western civilization is all part of the discrimination, the racism, misogyny, that they suffer with daily. “But that ideological divide is no longer a merely ideological divide. … That transition from worldview to actionable behavior has accelerated faster than [Mr. Bahsen] could have ever anticipated. And what it means for our national politics and the culture at-large is frightening.”BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Look at this headline from the Washington Post. “‘An Angry Mob’: Republicans Work to Recast Democratic Protests as Out-of-Control Anarchy to Shift Attention Away From an Unpopular President.” No. We’re being descriptive of what we’re up against.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, don’t get depressed, folks. I’m spending time on this because we’ve got to properly understand what we’re up against. And it’s not something that we think it is. It’s not common. It’s not the opposition we’ve always thought. This is new. And we’re gonna have to be prepared to deal with it in different ways.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/09/ho-nominates-ford-for-award/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 9, 2018RUSH: And here we go, folks. Right on cue, right on schedule, the headline: “Christine Blasey Ford Nominated for Distinguished Alumna Award at Alma Mater.” It’s from TheHill.com. “Christine Blasey Ford, the college professor who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault” with no evidence and no corroborating witnesses “while they were in high school, has been nominated for a Distinguished Alumna award at her alma mater.“Ford was nominated for the award by a professor at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, where she earned an undergraduate degree in experimental psychology” and beating lie-detector tests “in 1988. In a letter obtained by The Hill, Jennifer Ho, a professor in the university’s Department of English and Comparative Literature, said Ford did ‘something that was extraordinary’ earlier this year when ‘she told the truth about a sexual assault'” with no evidence and no corroborating witnesses “‘when she was fifteen years old at the hands of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.'”This is what they do, folks.I predicted this.I told you!This is just the first of many. She’s gonna get book deals offered to her. There are gonna be TV movies and HBO feature movies. Then there will be documentaries. Then there will be probably one of those Netflix Making of a Murderer-type series to explain how Kavanaugh beat back her charges and scarred and ruined her for the rest of her life and all of that. We’re just seeing the beginning here of the rehabilitation of Blasey Ford, and it starts with Professor Ho rehabbing Blasey, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Ho writes, “We live in a society that does not believe women. The many indignities that women experience in their day-to-day lives is proof of this, as is the continued attacks on Dr. Blasey Ford after her testimony” that had no evidence and corroborating witnesses. “We know that people who are survivors of sexual assault” that did not happen “do not experience justice for their trauma; we know that many of them choose not to report to the police and choose not to reveal their assault,” because they, too, have no evidence or corroborating witnesses and thus “fear that they will not be believed.'”Speaking of which, grab audio sound bite No. 13. Sally Quinn. She is the widow of the lawsuit editor of the Washington Post, Ben Bradlee. Sally Quinn used to be a journalist at the Washington Post CBS, the CBS in the morning show. She’s probably best known for throwing Washington’s best dinner parties during Democrat presidencies. During Republican presidencies, nobody wanted to go to dinner ’cause they were so mad all the time.But she apparently had the best dinner parties at her and Bradlee’s house, and she was on Anderson Cooper 29 last night. Now, Sally Quinn alleges that former Texas senator John Tower… That’s how his name was pronounced: Tow-ah. His name was John Tower. He was a short little guy, five four, pockmarked face, acne, greasy hair, and this guy was apparently Don Juan running around the Senate just bedding everybody that got in his way.This guy’s had more allegations… I mean, literally! I remember one of these allegations, all kinds of senators came forward to defend him while telling him he needed to resign. One of them was, uh… (snapping fingers) Sam Nunn of Georgia. I’ll never forget his attempt saving the reputation of John Tower. I knew John Tower. I think John Tower actually was forced to resign because of one of these things, wasn’t he? But I’m not kidding. I mean, this guy was a swordsman, folks, by reputation.Koko, get a picture of the guy and put him on RushLimbaugh.com. I’ll try to find one here and show you on the Dittocam. I mean, we’re not talking about George Clooney here. Well, anyway, Sally Quinn says that John Tower once assaulted her but that she didn’t come forward. And here’s what she says. Anderson Cooper says, “Look, in your memoir, you talk to an experience where a sitting senator, John Tower, basically tried to sexually assault you in the back of a taxi.”Folks, John Tower would never be in a taxi.That would be such a demeaning accuse car to be in. You’re a senator! You don’t drive around in Yellow Cab cabs. You have a car service, a limo, a driver. Anyway, she asserts it happened in a cab. “… that John Tower tried to sexually assault you in the back of a taxi. You didn’t come forward then, and you didn’t come forward when the senator was nominated for secretary…” That’s what it was! They nominated the guy for secretary of defense, and that’s when all this came out.But Sally Quinn didn’t, and Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn’t say anything.QUINN: He dragged me over to this night club and ordered brandy and wouldn’t let go of me. And finally I got away and ran out and got in a cab, and he came out and jumped in the cab and jumped on top of me and basically tried to assault me. And the poor cabdriver was desperate, ’cause I was screaming and pounding at him. “Senator, stop.” And I was living at Fort Myer, Virginia, where my father was stationed.He was a general in the Army at the time. And the cabdriver was going about 90 miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the car. He sort of screeched to a halt in front of our quarters, and I think then Tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shotgun. But I went in the house that night; I cried all night long. I was absolutely traumatized. I never told my parents or Barry until much later, several years later, because I was so ashamed and so guilty.RUSH: So Sally Quinn assaulted by John Tower. But, you know, she… Is there another one here? Yeah. There’s one more bite we got time to squeeze in. Here another reason why. No. 14. Three.QUINN: When I think about it, I thought, “I’m so glad I didn’t do it, because I could have been Anita Hill,” and Anita Hill’s life has been completely ruined, destroyed.RUSH: No, it hasn’t!QUINN: She’s always gonna be the person who was in that hearing having to talk about these disgusting things. Christine Blasey Ford’s name came out against her will. She didn’t want to be there. What I think is that if I had been Anita Hill and I’d known better, I wouldn’t have done it. If I’d been Christine Blasey Ford, she didn’t expect it to go public, but I would have not done it.RUSH: Because their lives have been ruined. Christine Blasey Ford just got an alumna award from UNC Chapel Hill for this, and she gonna get movies and… Anita Hill’s life has not been ruined or destroyed, Sally! What world are you looking at? (sigh) Anyway, I… Why did Blasey send the letter if she didn’t want any of this to come out? This doesn’t make sense.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/09/what-will-happen-if-the-blue-wave-turns-red/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 9, 2018RUSH: Here is Sean in Philadelphia. Great to have you, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hey, Rush. I’m a big fan of yours.RUSH: Thank you. I appreciate that.CALLER: I’ll get right to the point. I have one comment and one question, and the comment is… It’s going around this talking point that, you know, since this Kavanaugh victory, that the president is teaching the Republicans how to fight. I actually think he’s teaching the Democrats what it’s like to lose, and I don’t think anybody’s picking up on that, ’cause they’re not used to losing like this. They’re used to the Republicans just giving in.The question I had was, “What do you think would happen…?” ’cause I don’t know what’s gonna happen. I actually think this blue wave talk is not true from what I’m seeing out here. “What do you think would happen to the Democrats and the media if instead of a blue wave, if there was a red wave?” I mean, what do you think actually would happen? Do you think they’d self-destruct? I mean, what would the day after look like?RUSH: I have been… I think it’s a good question, because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival and safety, because I think if the Democrats do not win the House… If you listen to the scuttlebutt, it sounds like everybody’s preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate, maybe even expand their hold there. But the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are gonna retake the House in numbers we haven’t seen in who knows how long, since 1994.I’ve been wondering, “What if all of this is just a bunch of caca, media and polling unit manufactured, just like it was in 2016?” There were not very many polls in 2016 that got even close to being right. Rasmussen was one — and by the way, Rasmussen has Trump at 51% approval. The CNN approval number for Trump is 41%. The polling data the Drive-Bys just — shows them even now, after the Kavanaugh hearing — expanding the blue wave.I mean, do you know that the Republican candidate…? Just as an aside here. Do you know the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back? The Republican. I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight, that the Republican… I’ll have to find it. But the Republican candidate for governor of California running against Gavin Newsom is closer than anybody would ever have believed possible.If the Democrats do not retake the House, I think Washington may be uninhabitable for a while. I think we haven’t seen the meltdown that is going to happen among many elected Democrats, the charges of a rigged election, of Russian interference, that Trump did it again, anything they can come up with. They are so, so certain they’re gonna win this. They’ve already banked on the win. They’re already planning to impeach Kavanaugh and Trump, and if that doesn’t happen, I really think they may lose it all and very quickly.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So our last caller, Sean from Philadelphia, asked, “What’s gonna happen, Rush? They’re all expecting a blue wave. What happens if they lose it?” Well, let me share with you a headline from Politico, just today. Politico story. Ready for this? “Politico Race Ratings: The GOP House Is Crumbling.” Here is the subheadline, Mr. Snerdley:“There are now 209 seats either firmly or leaning in the Democratic column — only nine shy of the 218 needed to win control.” That’s what you were telling me; right? You’ve got Republicans telling you that they think this is true? Some. I’m not asking for names, but you’ve got some elected Republicans where people in their offices are telling you they believe this? (interruption) Okay. So Politico says, “The GOP House Is Crumbling.” It’s falling apart.There are 209 firmly or leaning Democrat. I guess this is according to polling data, and 218 is the number of seats you need for the majority in the House. There are 435 total numbers there; 218 is the majority. So 209 seats are firmly or leaning Democrat. I mean, if the Democrats win 209 seats? This is a wipeout. The Republican Party would have to be, for this to happen, a party of Adolf Hitlers — and yet they believe it. Now, folks, I don’t have any inside information on this. I don’t know anybody with internal polling data.I don’t know beans. I don’t really pay attention to that; I never have. But the people in Washington live and die by this stuff. I’m telling you, it is their blood and water and food, polling data. It’s how they get through the day, every day, polling anything. And if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that 209 seats are leaning their way and if there is no blue wave, I don’t think there’s gonna be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrat side of the aisle or in the media.So 209 seats firmly or leaning in the Democrat column. Let me ask you a question. What could be causing this? Let’s assume for a moment… Just as a hypothetical exercise, let’s assume this is true. Can you tell me what it is — anything, one thing, a series of things — that has American voters so, so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat so that the Democrats run the House? What is it? What have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide disgust with the party?Now, the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump, that the people of this country despise Donald Trump, that the people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election night 2016. They can’t wait to get out there and show their disgust for Trump. And the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans. All right. Well, as I say, we’re hypothetically pretending this is true. What has Trump done to generate that kind of disgust? Other than be alive and be president, what has he done? (interruption)No, no. I’m being serious. You want to take…? (interruption) Oh, Snerdley said, “He separated families at the border.” I’m glad you reminded me of that. It’s getting harder and harder to watch television shows. What was I watching this last week was premier week for all of the new network prime-time shows. I think it was Law & Order (yeah, Law & Order in Your SUV or something) and the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage.The SVU cops are running around trying to prove this guy is a reprobate of the first order. “Oh, no, no, officer! No. Our government is separating these children from their parents at our border, and I am saving them!” and the cops rethought everything. “Oh, wow. We don’t have a pervert here. We have a hero! This guy…” I watched and said, “Well, that’s it for this show.” The level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates places in this country where it ought not be. There are people ought to be more educated, more informed, and smarter.But that’s gone. We have replaced informed people, educated people, learned people with absolute blockhead idiots. We’re not separating — and Trump never did separate — families at the border. That is actually Democrat Party policy. It’s related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum. Trump, in fact, wrote an executive order to end it, which was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional, that the statute in America today says families will be separated — and it’s to protect the kids.The reason for it, the reason for the separation is the parents are shuffled off into holding cells while their cases are adjudicated. So I’m watching this stupid show, and I see a guy who in any other normal season would be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted to seem to be quasi-hero because he is rounding up kids that Trump is separating from their parents and saving them. So I went to the DVR and I canceled Law & Order in Your SUV.Got rid of that. It’s been out there long enough, 20-some-odd years. They’re all dropping like flies. They all feature stuff like this in it. So you really think that 209 Republican House seats could be up for grabs because people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating families? (interruption) Well, yeah, it wouldn’t explain 209. Snerdley says, “It’s a lot of Republican retirements.”Well, yeah, committee chairmen are retiring ’cause they’re term limited! Forty-three members are retiring — some are committee chairmen — and the reason they’re quitting is because they don’t want to go back to being average, ordinary members. When you’re a committee chairman, you get perks, you get attention, you get TV time. You know, you matter. But when you’re term limited out of your chairmanship, then you quit and you parlay your time there into big bucks in the private sector.You know, there are some Republican retirements, but there aren’t 209 of ’em. But my only point is for there to be this kind of blue wave, 44, 47 retirements does not explain it. Not when the Democrats think they’ve got 209 seats leaning in their favor. (interruption) Oh, you don’t think it’s policy? There would…? If this is all true, there has to be something or a series of things that the American public is just fit to be tied over and want to take it all out on Republicans.Again, the media, the Democrats will tell you, “It’s Trump! The people of this country hate Trump. They’re embarrassed of Trump.” But that’s what they think. The evidence that the country hates Trump? It isn’t there in any poll. Even if you look at the leftist opinion polls, he’s at 41% approval. That’s not in the twenties where George W. Bush was. They drove him down in the sixth year.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: No, no, no! I don’t mean the Democrats are on line to pick up 209 seats, but that’s how the story’s written. That’s how that headline of the story’s written. No. There are 209 seats leaning Democrat already out of 435. That’s just nine short of the majority. But it’s written to make it look like they’re gonna pick up that many. It’s not what it says, though.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let me just clarify again here. I got a panicked email. “Mr. Limbaugh, I am very confused. You don’t mean the Democrats are projected to pick up 209 seats? Just 15 seats are projected to be picked up by the polls.” No, no. Fifteen seats is not enough. They need to pick up… For there to be a blue wave, they gotta pick up 26 to 30. They need 26 to gain control or 27. I mean, it depends on how you do the math on control. Now this piece in Politico, the headline is written in such a way… 209 seats leaning Democrat, leaning or locked Democrat.An average, ordinary person is supposed to conclude from that that the Democrats are gonna pick up 209 seats. The magic number for the House in control is 218, and so they go on to say that, (imitation) “This means the Democrats are only nine seats short of the majority!” So they want you to believe the Democrats have zero seats but they’re gonna pick up 209. That’s how much hatred for Republicans there is. The blue wave polls out there say that Republicans are gonna lose anywhere from 26 to 50, maybe up to 60 seats.I mean, those are the hard numbers that the Drive-Bys are throwing around. But this Politico headline and the subhead that went with it are specifically designed to make it appear that the Democrats are leaning toward picking up 209 seats, and the reason that’s written that way is to convey hopelessness. Politico knows that this story is gonna be regurgitated all over things like the AP and the Yahoo News, Apple News, any other number of aggregator places that recycle news by way of link.So you get that headline is the link: “209 seats leaning Democrat, according to latest blue wave poll.” But, no, not picking up 209 seats. They need 26 for control, and they need 30 to 35 to 50 for their blue wave.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/09/swamp-dwellers-cant-imagine-anyone-wanting-to-quit-government/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 9, 2018RUSH: Neither the Drive-Bys nor the swamp dwellers can ever imagine anybody quitting government. They can’t imagine anybody quitting the United Nations. They can’t imagine anybody quitting and leaving Donald Trump more in charge of anything than he already is. They’re beside themselves. Nikki Haley is quitting. Furthermore, nobody leaked it! They didn’t know about it; that makes it illegitimate. Something’s not right!So they immediately began speculating. “Nikki Haley,” they said, “has to be leaving in total anger and frustration over Trump and Kavanaugh,” that Nikki Haley “obviously disapproves of Kavanaugh, disapproves of him being on the Supreme Court, disapproves of the way Trump handled it and can’t handle it anymore and she’s quitting. The fact that that is the case is buoyed by that there was no leak,” meaning that her reaction has been knee-jerk and sensible and so forth. And they’ve been all hot to trot about it all morning long over on CNN.Even Fox! Even Fox is sitting there, a bunch of panelists, analysts and so forth, really worried, wringing their hands. “Oh, no! What does it mean? I can’t… I don’t… Oh, no! What’s the reason?” Because everybody in that town — I don’t care if they’re one of us, I don’t care if they’re swamp-dweller leftists. They’re paranoid. People leaving government? It’s not done — and if somebody’s leaving Trump, then people are waiting with bated breath for the whole Trump administration to collapse because this is what the swamp still thinks of Trump.It turns out that Nikki Haley is just burned out. She’s been doing this; prior to that she was governor. She has been on an intense pressure-packed schedule every day for eight or more years, and it turns out she had told Trump that she was probably gonna resign after his first two years. She will remain the ambassadorette to the United Nations ’til the end of the year, making it two years. There’s really nothing to see here.Now, the swamp then began to concoct a bunch of rumors that would explain this and foretell what was going to happen. The best and biggest rumor running around was that Lindsey Graham was going to announce his resignation from the Senate and become attorney general. This, of course, would require Sessions to either quit or be kneecapped, and then after Lindsey Graham leaves the Senate then Nikki was gonna run for the Senate in South Carolina to replace Lindsey.Because we can’t lose a Senate seat, and if Lindsey was gonna go over to the attorney general spot, Nikki could probably get it. None of that. None of that has any basis in fact. It’s all just rumor, and it’s one of these things that isn’t complicated. It’s one of these things that is what it is, and people in Washington just can’t get their arms around it ’cause it’s not normal. People just don’t quit government. They just don’t! I mean, unless they’re upset about something, angry about something, hiding a scandal that is about to be revealed or some such thing.So the Drive-Bys were waiting with bated breath!A couple of examples. “Poppy” Harlow, infobabe, CNN. This was her speculation earlier today…HARLOW: Back in December 2017, when the president’s accusers were coming forward, she said, all of the accusers, including the president’s accusers, quote, “should be heard.” Look at what the president has said in the past few days about Dr. Blasey Ford. Now, we don’t know why she’s a resigning. I’m just pointing out areas where she has publicly disagreed with the president.RUSH: Right. So you see? (paraphrased) “She believed Blasey. She believed Blasey Ford. She was righteously indignity and offended over the way Trump treated Blasey Ford; then this Kavanaugh gets confirmed, and she can’t handle this anymore! Now, we don’t know this. I’m just pointing out areas where she’s publicly disagreed with the president.” Poppy Harlow had no idea what she was talking about, nor did anybody else. You know what this is a classic example of? They found out that Nikki Haley…I’m gonna be approximate with the time here. They found out that Nikki Haley was gonna resign at 10 o’clock, and for an hour cable news had nothing but speculation as to why. They couldn’t just wait. They couldn’t just wait for the announcement and the videotape from the Oval Office where she and Trump were seated in bright yellow chairs by the fireplace. Couldn’t wait. Nope! They had to fill that time with speculation, and that’s when people really get dumb. When there’s all kinds of wild-guess speculation, that’s where people try to show their smarts, folks.That’s where all these analysts and commentators try to demo their insider status and their operative knowledge and so forth. Some of the things that I heard being bandied about simply made no sense. But much it, as they say, made for great television. It wasn’t complicated at all. She just wanted to leave. It had nothing to do with Kavanaugh. It had nothing to do with Blasey. It had nothing to do with the Supreme Court.It simply had to do with the calendar and something she had said was going to happen long ago. In terms of the idea that she’s upset, there’s another rumor that’s been going around since she announced she’s gonna resign. “She’s gonna run against Trump in 2020! She hates Trump. She is embarrassed of Trump. She just — just — just can’t stand it and is gonna run for the Republican nomination in 2020!” So she headed that off at the pass before the press even started asking questions.She says, “No, I’m not running in 2020. The only thing I’m gonna be doing is campaigning and supporting this guy,” and she pointed at Trump. You could hear the wind come out of the sails collectively of the Drive-By Media, who were convinced that a woman was abandoning Trump because of Blasey, because of Kavanaugh. Here’s our old buddy Nic Robertson, maybe our all-time favorite CNN foreign correspondent. It’s Nic Robertson this morning on CNN, you know, guessing back and forth with the infobabe, “Poppy” Harlow, about Nikki Haley’s reasons…ROBERTSON: On the issues that our allies have wanted to see President Trump be tough on, in particular Russia, because that’s one, uhhhh, that he seemed to be sensitive on and not one that he’s wanted to push as allies in Britain and France and Germany, uhhh, the Baltic states have all wanted him to be, Nikki Haley has been a source of comfort. So if you’re one of the United States enemies and Nikki Haley steps out of this position, then perhaps you breathe a tiny bit easier.RUSH: I… Look… (sigh) I’m just a radio talk show guy here, and Nic Robertson is a seasoned broadcast journalist. But I’m sorry. This is so full of it. Let’s go back to the top of his sound bites. (impression) “On the issues that allies have wanted to see Trump be tough on, in particular, Russia, because that’s the one that he seems to be sensitive on and not one that he’s wanted to push, as allies in Britain and France and Germany and the Baltics states have all wanted him to be” tough. Has everybody…?Nic, have you forgotten how Trump reamed Angela Merkel for making a deal, a side deal at the G20 with the Russians? Have you forgotten that it was Donald Trump who was tough on the Russians and that it was Angela Merkel who made a side deal with ’em for natural gas? And that it was Donald Trump that could not believe it and called her out on it and suggested that she could have purchased natural gas from any of her allies in the G20, the G8, the G15, or the G whatever?Trump has been tough on Russia to the extent that the people promoting a Trump-Russia collusion story have been discredited thoroughly! Trump has not been a Russian puppet. Quite the contrary. But you wouldn’t be able to convince Nic Robertson of that. Oh, no! They get these ideas in their head. “Trump and Russia got together! They steal the election from Hillary! Trump is a Russian stooge. Trump has money ’cause the Russians saw to it; Trump owes Russia because of that. Trump, therefore, is soft on Russia.”Now, “Nikki Haley is leaving, and that means nobody’s left to be tough on Russia and our allies are scared to death.” That is a total, 100%, front-to-back, top-to-bottom crock, folks. I guarantee you, our allies are probably happy to see Nikki Haley go because she is tough and she is pro-America. She believes in America first just like Trump does. Not at the expense of our allies. She wants everybody brought along. But she’s not a pushover.These people don’t know what they’re talking about! They get these notions in their heads, these fantasies — or these “narratives,” as they call them — and they are reality, whether they touch on the truth or not. Here is Trump and Haley with her resignation announcement in the bright yellow chairs. I got emails today from people. “God, I hate those chairs, Rush! You got tell ’em to get rid of the chairs.” I said, “Are you telling me that’s what you notice here?“You’re watching Haley resign and Trump’s sitting next to her and they got a great presser going and you’re telling me the chairs are too yellow?” That’s what makes me think we got no prayer. We got no hope. We have a serious thing going on the Oval Office and I get emails, “Oh, my God! The chairs, Rush!” The chairs? Well, anyway, no chairs on radio, folks, because no pictures except those that I intricately paint for you with my clever use of verbiage, diatribe, rhetoric, and resistance. Here is a bit of that sound bite…THE PRESIDENT: (camera clicks throughout) Nikki Haley, ambassador to the United Nations has been very special to me. She’s done an incredible job. She’s a fantastic person, very importantly. But she also is somebody that gets it. She has been at the United Nations from the beginning with us, from the beginning, and working with us on the campaign. It’s been really a long time, very intense. And she told me probably six months ago, she said, “You know, maybe at the end of the year — at the end of the two-year period but the end of the year — I want to take a little time off. I want to take a little break.” So we’re all happy for you in one way but we hate to lose you. Hopefully, you’ll be coming back at some point.HALEY: (laughs)THE PRESIDENT: Maybe in a different capacity. You can have your pick. But I just want to let you to know that at the end of the year Nikki will be leaving and will be in constant touch.RUSH: She has been a great in the United States ambassador to the United Nations. She was a very good governor. She is a solid, quality person. She has done great work in this administration and as governor of South Carolina. I know a lot of people, period. I know a lot of people in South Carolina who live there love Nikki Haley. It is gonna be a great loss. She was fearless at the United Nations.She was undaunted and unintimidated by that Star Wars bar scene, surrounded by a bunch of thug-dictator tyrants in that room. She gave ’em the business and what-for in defense and promotion of America each and every day. I guarantee you Trump is sad to lose her. Here’s a little bit of what she had to say. John Roberts, White House press corps, said, “Ambassador Haley, you list a long list of accomplishments. Why would you want to leave all that behind? Is it really a personal decision because you’ve been away from your family for so long or something else?”HALEY: My family is very supportive. So, no, there’s no personal reasons. I think that it’s just very important for government officials to understand when it’s time to step aside. And I have given everything I’ve got these last eight years, and I do think that sometimes it’s good to rotate in other people who can put that same energy and power into it. I want to make sure that this administration, the president has the strongest person to fight. It was a blessing to go into the U.N. with body armor every day and defend America, and I’ll always do that.RUSH: Yeah, and so she’s just gonna take it easy. We don’t know what the future holds. We don’t know how soon she’s gonna get the itch to get back in it. But you heard president say, “Come back, take your pick, whatever you want.” There’s nothing really to see here. The fact that it didn’t leak has people (the swamp dwellers) stupefied.And because it didn’t leak, because they didn’t know about it in advance, then they are highly suspicious of this. And they were hoping and praying that it had to do with Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh. So it is what it is. It was fascinating to watch an hour’s worth of speculation about what it could possibly be, and there was no… In all of that hour’s worth of speculation, there wasn’t one positive suggestion.Every idea or wild guess was rooted in doom or trouble, negativism of some kind. There was very little time given to the fact, “Hey, you know what? It just could be that she’s tired.” Even if it was just that, she had to be tired of Trump. She had to be fed up trying to represent Trump. This is what they all want to hear. It’s what they expect to hear. And when they don’t hear it, they make it up.  "

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/08/why-im-optimistic-about-the-midterms/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 8, 2018RUSH: Don’t you love the way Democrats are now blaming Michael Avenatti? In fact, it was a CNN either assignment editor or reporter late on Saturday afternoon after Kavanaugh had passed the confirmation video that they started unloading on Avenatti, that Avenatti’s late-arriving allegations of gang rape only served to water down the serious allegations of Blasey Ford. Hey, Democrats, Blasey Ford never had anything other than allegations which could not be established. You know, that has been totally, completely ignored by people on the left because of their beliefs now the allegation’s all you need.The nature of the evidence is irrelevant.But still the fact that they were turning on Avenatti. Do you know there are people seriously taking Avenatti’s presidential intentions in 2020? There are people in the media seriously considering that Avenatti might throw his hat in the ring, and because Trump did it, that Avenatti might be able to pull it off. Until he screwed himself with this stuff. And then there are people wondering if Avenatti is not actually a Trump buddy, if Avenatti is not a Republican inside plant because what more perfect way to water down Blasey Ford’s lack of evidence than to throw out some ridiculous gang rape charge the day Blasey Ford is supposed to take the stand.I’m sorry, appear before the committee.So everybody’s waiting with breathless bated breath over Blasey Ford, who is also supposedly terrified, and then out of the woodwork here comes Avenatti and Swetnick with the charge of gang rape and red Solo Cups and Quaaludes in the punch. And now Avenatti’s supposedly livid that the Democrats are blaming him and attacking his client, and he says he’s got more earth-shattering news on Kavanaugh; just wait. In fact, Fauxcahontas says that she has additional news on Kavanaugh. Just wait.The Democrats continue to say that they’re gonna keep investigating Kavanaugh. And if they have to delegitimize the court, they’ll do it. Because if they think they’ve lost the court then the court will, of course, become illegitimate in their minds. And every ruling on which Kavanaugh participates, which will be every one, they’ll think he should recuse on everything, by the way, because of the contentious hearings that took place. Look, I know a lot of you were terribly concerned about the midterms, and I’m not trying to provide any false hope or comfort.Don’t misunderstand. There’s a formative experience for me in this, and it’s the Wellstone memorial in 2002. I’ve cited it before but I’m gonna cite it again. Because I like to be optimistic, folks. I’m sorry; I can’t help it. I’m not a natural pessimist, except when it comes to two things: playing golf and using weight. But other than that I am a natural optimist. And if you go back to 2002, the first midterm elections after George W. Bush, and it’s almost identical.The Democrats were enraged that the Supreme Court stopped the count in Florida of the hanging chads. The Democrats believed that the Supreme Court handed George W. Bush the victory illegally. Never mind the Florida Supreme Court was out of control the way it was handling all the legal issues here. The U.S. Supreme Court had to step in and stop is it because it was out of control and when they did, the Democrats were fit to be tied.And from that day forward, George W. Bush was an illegitimate president. And he didn’t stop being illegitimate, and they finally got his approval numbers down to the twenties six years later, in the middle of his second term. So we get to 2002, and it’s the first chance the Democrats have to pay the country back, to pay the Republicans back, to pay Bush back. And they are going to retake the House, and they’re going to retake the Senate, and they’re gonna reopen the Florida recount!And they’re gonna make sure that justice is finally done and that Algore be duly recognized as a legitimate winner of the presidency, even though Algore didn’t want any part of it by that time. They were feeling so up, so sure, so confident, that when it came time for a memorial for their late, great senator from Minnesota, Paul Wellstone, they totally blew up what was intended to be a memorial honoring and celebrating the life of Wellstone. It was about three weeks prior to the midterm elections in November of 2002.The Wellstone memorial was hijacked by activist Democrats and turned into a pure political rally, the purpose of which was to destroy George W. Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone. Republican senators who were friends of Wellstone’s dutifully showed up at the arena. They did this arena in a place that holds 15,000 people, if my memory serves, 10, 15,000 people. It was sometime after… Wellstone died in a plane crash, and it was sometime after that, but this was the official memorial. I don’t think it was ever intended to be a memorial.I think it was a political event from the get-go disguised as a memorial! Anyway, Republican senators not knowing up from town, Trent Lott and the boys all day showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial, a religious memorial to honor their fallen colleague, Paul Wellstone. They were booed and bullied and harassed out of the place within 30 minutes of having arrived and sat down! It was identical to what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators and the hallways of the Senate office building.Except this was at the memorial. And this with Democrat voters going up to where the Republicans were seated and getting in their faces and pointing fingers at ’em and booing at them. They thought they were there to participate in a solemn occasion. They got up and they walked out and they left. And this memorial turned into a hate fest, a hate-fest aimed at George W. Bush, a hate-fest aimed at George W. Bush’s policies.They couldn’t even set aside what had happened on 9/11 for this memorial. This memorial took place about 14 months after 9/11 took place. So then the midterms occur. I remember I was invited… It was this the last time this happened. I was invited for election night coverage on NBC. Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw. I dutifully accepted, and I went. I was not on camera all night. Maybe four or five times while they cycled other people through. And they brought me in after it was clear that the Republicans had gained seats!It’s unheard of! The Democrats, just like now, were supposed to win big! Because the Democrats told it: Everybody hated Bush. Everybody resented the way the Supreme Court stole the election for Bush, that Algore had won the popular vote, just like Hillary did. And that the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and 9/11 and Bush’s general stupidity and incompetence and as such could not wait for the Democrats to take back control of what is rightfully theirs, Washington, D.C.Except it didn’t happen. The Republicans gained seats. Tim Russert was great. Brokaw brought me out, “So what do you think happened here?” I said, “The Wellstone memorial. The Wellstone memorial is what happened.” And I went on and told ’em why in a truncated version of what I just said to you. They were shell-shocked. They were shell-shocked. This just not in the formula. The party in power does not pick up seats in midterm elections, the first ones after a new president is elected. So that’s a formative experience for me.And if it’s… I’m like Pascal. (paraphrasing) “If it’s happened once, it can happen again. Something that hasn’t happened before probably won’t happen, but if it has, then it can happen again.” And this is a replay of that, except this is a replay of even more outrageous behavior. The Wellstone memorial took place on one night. The Democrat Party has been insane on display for two full years. And actually longer than that. But in context of Trump’s election, it’s been two consistent years of public derangement, public insanity, psychological disorders on display, childlike tantrums.By the way, I, too, have sat in the Senate gallery. As a young boy, my parents took my brother and me to Washington, D.C., one summer. And the Senate was in session. And I remember Barry Goldwater was among the senators speaking when we were there. He was speaking on the farm bill. I was 14 or 15. And I remember being in the gallery, and I had a… It was a pamphlet or a book, some kind of a manual explaining what the Senate was and what was going on. And I was turning the pages.A Senate page came and grabbed that book away from me and said, “You’re making too much noise. I’ll give you this back after you leave.” Just turning a page was not permitted. The gallery could not do anything more than breathe. You were not allowed to chew gum. People were chewing gum, and the pages said, “You’re leaving or else you’re putting it in a piece of paper and tossing it. You’re not staying in here chewing gum.” They would come whisper this to you. They took my little pamphlet away. I felt like the Gestapo had just come.And then I’m watching this thing the other night, and these women are going batty sounding literally like they are infants out of the womb and they don’t want to be there, and I couldn’t even make out what they’re saying. It sounded… Like Christian Adams said, it sounded like we were in the middle of an asylum in there. Mike Pence was saying over and over, (imitation) “Sergeant-at-arms! The sergeant-at-arms will restore order in the gallery. The sergeant-at-arms will restore order in the gallery.”The sergeant-at-arms is having a hell of a lot of trouble restoring order in the gallery.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, folks, another thing for you to remember about the midterms coming up. If the Wellstone memorial analogy doesn’t do it for you, there’s one thing else you need to keep in mind, and that is Donald Trump. We have Donald Trump on our side.And that’s one of the biggest equalizers going. And it is completely undersold, underappreciated by the American left and the Drive-By Media. Trump’s got four rallies alone this week. And they are not national rallies; they are intended for local consumption. Do not discount anything in which Donald Trump is involved. I’m just saying.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The Washington Post is pushing a big poll they’ve got today: “Survey of Battleground House Districts Shows Democrats with Narrow Edge.” It’s the Washington Post-Schar School survey. “The survey of 2,672 likely voters by The Post and the Schar School at George Mason University shows that likely voters in these districts favor Democrats by a slight margin: 50% prefer the Democratic nominee and 46% percent prefer the Republican.”It’s a generic ballot poll.But here’s the thing.John Fund of National Review dug deep, because the Post is really heralding this thing. They’re singing its praises. “The poll sounds like it had a lot of people in it, but it didn’t. It had an average of 39 respondents per district,” 39 respondents. As Mr. Fund said, “This is not social science or polling science. It’s darts.” In 69 House battleground districts, the Democrats lead 50-46? Well, yeah, you only speak to 39 people district? That’s what the Washington poll is. Thank you, Mr. Fund, for that.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/08/democrats-really-dont-care-about-sexual-assault/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 8, 2018RUSH: I’m gonna weigh in on Susan Collins here in a second. Her speech on Friday was… I don’t think it was the turning point. Folks, I don’t think the vote’s any different than it would have turned out if Blasey Ford hadn’t shown up, if DiFi hadn’t leaked all that. If all of that had not happened, the vote would have been the same, 50-48. I firmly believe that. This is not to be critical of Susan Collins. Quite the contrary. The turning point was Trump explaining to the nation that Blasey Ford could not back up or corroborate her story!That had not happened. That did not happen in the hearing.Blasey Ford got away with being “credible,” as far as the hearings were concerned. Only when Trump unloaded and told America during his rally that she can’t tell anybody where it happened, when it happened, what year it happened, where the house was, how she got home, what she said after it happened to whoever. None of it! The people that she said were there? All four denied it. The American people didn’t know that. The Drive-Bys didn’t report it. Trump was the turning point. Trump enabled Republican senators to hang tough.Here is Mac in Allentown Pennsylvania as we head back to the phones. Greetings, sir. Great to have you with us.CALLER: Oh, wonderful to hear from you, Rush. I’m a listener from the earliest days, and I’ll make a comment quick about the Democrats and the whole process with this hearing. And then, if you have time, I’ll tell you how you converted my wife from non-listener to one of your most loyal fans, which is a crazy story. But, anyway, with the Kavanaugh hearings, what’s so sinister and ironic in all this is if you remember back to Bill Clinton and the accusations that came out against him in the early days — not that early.But all the accusations with him — the media, Saturday Night Live, every talk show, the news outlets — they totally destroyed these women. They made fun of their looks. They made fun of their weight. They mocked their stories. They discredited ’em. They questioned their motives. Unlike Dr. Ford, where you have someone that doesn’t remember anything, you had victims that remembered — in particular Juanita Broaddrick — the time, the place, the who, what, where, when, with witnesses.The irony is so disgusting — and there’s no political motive with Bill Clinton’s victims because they were members of his own party! And that’s the sickness of all this. And I think senators in this whole process now have the perfect weapon to use — and I hate to call is it a “weapon.” But the perfect reality slap is to bring this up and call it out. I mean, Pelosi, Schumer, Durbin, any number of them wouldn’t even take a call from Juanita Broaddrick, a member of their own party.RUSH: Yeah, but, see, they had their chance to do that and they didn’t want to go there, because they couldn’t take the risk of offending people who believed Blasey. But the fact of the matter is — and I will say it again — the Democrats don’t care about sexual assault, as evidenced by your recitation of the facts of what happened to women who accused Bill Clinton. They were destroyed, and Hillary Clinton ran the unit that did the destroying! It was called the “bimbo eruptions unit.” It was Hillary and Betsey Wright.Bob Menendez — Democrat senator with a 10-point reelection lead in New Jersey — was caught running around with one of his donors in the Dominican with underage women. He narrowly escaped conviction and a trial over campaign contributions. Democrats don’t care about this! This was just a vehicle. It was just a Hail Mary. It was an October Surprise. You name it. It was just the vehicle. They had tried it with Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill. They got close; so they wanted to relive history and try this again.I don’t think any of it was real. You look at the Democrat activists that were involved with Blasey Ford. I think the whole thing was strategized. Now, it’s interesting you bring up the Clintons. Grab audio sound bites 10 and 11. Saturday. Michael Smerconish has a show on CNN. His guest was James Carville. Now, James Carville is the guy, in discussing Paula Jones during the Clinton years… Paula Jones sued Clinton for a number of things, and that’s where Clinton got in trouble by suborning perjury and lying under oath in grand jury testimony.He lost his law license for a year. It was James Carville that said (impression), “Drag a dollar bill through a trailer park and you never know what you’re gonna get. Here we have Paula Jones! You drag a dollar bill through a trail park and that…” (interruption) Was it a hundred-dollar bill or dollar bill? (interruption) A hundred-dollar bill. All right. Well, anyway, Carville is still proud of the remark. Here’s the question: “Would it have been better for the GOP if Kavanaugh had failed, because then the base would be so mad; so ticked off they’d all come out to vote in November?”CARVILLE: You know, that’s the money question, and I just found myself today for the Democrats, Kavanaugh is worth a lot more alive than dead. This is not gonna go away. They’re not gonna stop doing stories on Kavanaugh. They’re can… You know, they’re gonna keep him front and center. He’s not gonna go away. And had they defeated him, they would have just picked someone equally as right wing as Kavanaugh and have rammed him through in a lame-duck session. I think today’s result is probably as good as you can hope for. Kavanaugh is gonna be an issue in 2018. He’s gonna be an issue in 2020. The Democrats are gonna keep digging up stuff. The press is not gonna stop all the things that they’re working on about Kavanaugh.RUSH: Well, it sure sounds to me like there’s a coordinated effort to continue destroying Kavanaugh. And here’s Carville (impression), “That’s the best thing we could have hoped for! Best thing is to have that guy on a court and keep looking into the guy! If he’s up there on the court we can just keep lookin’ into the guy, and everybody gonna do it! They’d just ram somebody else in there! If Kavanaugh had been beaten, they’d just ram somebody else in lame-duck session we wouldn’t know what hit us.” And then Smerconish says, “Lindsey Graham dusted off one of your lines from the old days: ‘Drag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park.’ What were you thinking when you heard him doing that?”CARVILLE: (chuckling) You know, I said a lot of things in my life (chuckling) as a joke! Was cracking a joke it was actually about Gennifer Flowers, and I don’t think that Dr. Blasey Ford strikes me as a kind of little bit of different — little bit of a different deal here, you know? But always… I’m always complimented when people use my lines.RUSH: So he’s not taking it back. He’s very proud of the fact he talked about a 100-dollar bill dragged… Gennifer Flowers didn’t come from a trailer park. She might have come from the beauty parlor but she did not come from a trailer park, and Blasey Ford didn’t come from a trailer park. (impression) “I — I — I meant it as a joke. It was just a joke.” Yeah, it was a joke and it was applauded, and it’s applauded to this day, and it just means the Democrats really don’t care about sexual assault. They are very good actors.You look at all the Democrats that do it! Look at all the Democrats in Hollywood that have been called out and named for doing it! Look at all the people who have known for all of these years that the Democrats do it — including the actresses — and nobody said a word until the Democrats decided it was time to get rid of Hillary, and that meant, “Let’s out Weinstein,” Harvey Weinstein. That’s it, in a nutshell.Here is Jeff in Houston, Texas. Great to have you, sir. Hi.CALLER: Thank you, sir. Dittos, Dr. Limbaugh.RUSH: Thank you, sir.CALLER: Brett Kavanaugh. Only two options. He’s either innocent or his guilty, and if he’s guilty and that’s true, Democrats offered one of the most incompetent, bumbling prosecutions in any case in American history. Now the Dems are gonna have to go to their graves knowing they’re responsible for putting a sex-offending criminal to the Supreme Court. (chuckles)RUSH: (chuckles) Is that how you want to look at it?CALLER: (chuckles)RUSH: Ha! If he’s guilty, the Democrats botched the prosecution and because of the Democrats we’ve got another pervert on the court. Is that…? That’s how you want to sell this?CALLER: That’s the only two options I see, Rush.RUSH: Well, either he did or didn’t do it, and either she is lying or he is.CALLER: (chuckling)RUSH: Well, wait a minute now. You put in those stark terms. Do you realize nothing has been resolved? Do you realize nothing has been resolved? We still don’t know. The preponderance of the evidence — I should say, the lack of any — pretty much exonerates the judge. But there was not any official conclusion to this, and maybe there couldn’t be. But if she lied… You put it in terms of, “If he lied, the Democrats botched the prosecution and he’s on the court.”If she lied, then she has committed perjury under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Her lawyers have aided and abetted that. I mean, some real serious crimes have occurred if she is lying. It’s already been detailed, the vulnerabilities he faces if he lied. But nobody’s talked about what she would face if it were found that she had lied — and it’s bad. Perjury? I mean, this woman would be facing jail time. Her lawyers aiding and abetting. All of the Democrats involved in leaking her testimony.The fact that she… Do you find it strange, in that light, that she can’t tell anybody where, when, who was there? She can’t tell a soul when it happens, where it happened, where the house was, which house it was. She can remember one thing about that day: She had a beer. You’ve got her lawyer spreading this whole tale. She will not give up the therapist notes. She will not provide all of the details from her lie-detector test. There’s a reason, I think, that Blasey didn’t provide any specifics.Because how do you show a generality not to be true? (impression) “I — I don’t remember the house.” “What year did it happen?” “Uhhh, well, it was summer? Summertime, uh, when I was…” “Yeah, but what summer?” “Uh… (sobbing) I — I don’t know!” How do you disprove that? If she had named a year, if she had named a month, if she had named a house, if she had been specific in any way, then it could have been blown to smithereens. I didn’t believe any of it. Not because she’s a woman and not because I have any particular affinity for Kavanaugh. I didn’t believe her because she’s a leftist. "

Thank you very much.CALLER: Just a quick question for you.RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: You know, I think that the senators knew they weren’t going to get the votes, the Democrat senators, that is, to oppose Kavanaugh and make sure he’s not on the bench in the Supreme Court. So I was wondering, do you think that the way they framed him with the media is something they’re going to use later on to frame the entire Supreme Court, when they don’t get their way?RUSH: Bingo. That’s already begun. The delegitimization of the Supreme Court has already begun. Why, none other than the woman that hired Kagan… Sorry, that’s her name. The woman that hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard, Elena Kagan, who was the dean at Harvard Law and hired the guy, who was so good, she’s now a Supreme Court justice, thanks to Obama. She has said it would not be good for him to be on the court.It would not be good, too controversial. The integrity of the court would come into question. There’s no question. This is what the left does! They lose control over an institution, the institutions thus, in their minds, is corrupt, unreliable, and must be eliminated from the power structure. You’re exactly right, the assaults on Kavanaugh are gonna continue, and they will become as they already are becoming, assaults on the court and rulings itself.  "

She says that anger always lasts longer than happiness, and it’s the Democrats that are angry.Yeah, Democrats are angry. But what’s new about that? They are perpetually angry!Democrats have been furious since Hillary lost. They’ve been furious since Gore lost in 2000! They’ve spent the last two years having a collective hissy-fit.

They’ve thrown any notion of decent behavior and civility out the window.They chase Republicans from restaurants. they attack teenagers wearing Make America Great Again hats.

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/05/dems-put-the-screws-to-murkowski/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 5, 2018RUSH: CNN is not happy. CNN is a little on edge out there. CNN just reported that the Turtle had lunch with Susan Collins, and that the Turtle came out of having lunch with Susan Collins and said that he’s optimistic, and the CNN reporter said McConnell doesn’t do that much. He rarely speaks to the press in circumstances like this, you know, just kibitzing with them in public rather than formal setting. I think for the Turtle to say that he’s optimistic? He wouldn’t put himself out there like that if he thought Collins was gonna turn around and do a 180 on him.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I want to reread to you Kimberley Strassel’s tweets about Lisa Murkowski. Lisa Murkowski… By the way, this is another one that CNN obviously is nervous about because earlier today Lisa Murkowski was a definite “no” on Kavanaugh, and in announcing her definite “no” she said, “He’s just not the right man for the Supreme Court right now.” “…just not the right man…” So Kimberly Strassel says now she’s changing…She’s not changing. She’s saying that her mind’s not made up. The link is a Reuters story, and it says essentially Murkowski has not made a final decision. You could have fooled me. It sounded awfully final to me this morning when I read it. “Brett Kavanaugh is not the right man for the Senate right now.” Now she’s saying it’s not her final decision. Something is happening in that regard.Here are Kimberly Strassel’s tweets again. The first one here… Well, they’re both right on the money. “1) Just to be clear…” (interruption) Yeah, I’m trying to amplify these. I’m trying to make sure more people will hear about these tweets than will see them. Yeah! Absolutely. It’s worth it. Kimberley Strassel, Wall Street Journal columnist, editorial page editor and writer:“1) Just to be clear on what @LisaMurkowski voted for today…” Lisa Murkowski, Republican, Alaska, voted “to legitimize and sign off on the most despicable tactics ever in a nomination.” Lisa Murkowski, Republican, Alaska, voted today “to stand with Dianne Feinstein, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris. –to leave Judge Brett Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury/impeachment,” which they’re going to pursue by the way. Oh yeah, they’re gonna!Another interesting thing. Hang on. Another new development. But hang on here just a second. Here’s a second tweet before it Kimberley Strassel: Lisa Murkowski, Republican, Alaska, today voted “to abandon due process and presumption of innocence. –to potentially leave High Court at a 4-4 deadlock, putting the loony 9th circuit in control of everything that matters to Alaska,” her state, “development, prop rights, gun rights, enviro rules, etc.” Lisa Murkowski has made “[q]uite the statement.”These are two devastating tweets, and they are right on the money. Legitimizing and signing off on “the most despicable tactics ever,” standing with Feinstein, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris — who is in a class by herself in mendacity and a number of other things. Just… Just… Not much redeeming there. But more importantly, Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh “subject to claims of perjury and impeachment,” and then leaving the court tied.If he’s not confirmed, the court stays a 4-4 deadlock. The reason that matters is that if the court votes 4-4 on any case, then the decision prior to the court hearing, it is affirmed. Nothing changes. And that means that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals would be the highest ranking court that could make decisions regarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska, her own home state. It would be idiotic to put the Ninth Circuit in charge if you’re a Republican… By the way, she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights.And to put the Ninth Circus Court of Appeals and a bunch of leftists in charge of those issues in her state? This is shooting herself in the foot, all to supposedly be in unison with the #MeToo movement. So I mentioned we had a couple of photos of Dianne Feinstein. It looks like she has cornered Murkowski. I don’t know when the photos were taken. Presumably, they are recent. We could found out.We just check Feinstein’s wardrobe on particular days of hearings. But go ahead, Scott, and put it in the switcher. For those of you watching the Dittocam, there is a picture — and stand by ’cause we have a close-up. There is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally with Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway at a Senate office building. They are chatting with each other, and Murkowski has a pained look on her face.Feinstein looks like she is… Well, the picture speaks for itself. With that hand up, she’s got her cornered. Feinstein has got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski. It’s an aggressive move. It allows Feinstein to lean into Murkowski. Now, let’s switch to the close-up of that photo. For those of you watching on the Dittocam, do you see the pained expression on the face of Murkowski and the expression of intent seriousness and you-better-be-listening-to-me on the face of DiFi?Now, we’ll have these photos up on at Rush Limbaugh too. I’m not trying to leave anybody out. But I wanted you watching on the Dittocam to be able to see these. That close-up is the same shot, just a close-up of the previously televised photo. (interruption) Is that right? Well, Dawn looking here says, “Boy, Feinstein sure does look like a bully,” and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable, does she not?I mean, it’s a really pained look on her face, and it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship. It looks like Feinstein is giving her what-for. We don’t know when the picture was taken, and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong. We have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going. (interruption) Well, I wouldn’t call that romantic. I take that back.One of these is from California, and romance there has all kinds of shapes and forms. So you could be right. It could be a romantic interlude. I certainly… What’s the old saw? It’s not for us to criticize who loves who and why. So, yeah, it could be a lovers’ spat, lovers’ quarrel. We don’t know. But I’ve gotta get these photos up to Koko, unless Koko can find them. I’m sure Koko can find them himself. He may beat me to the punch.Now, the other breaking story… Eh, it’s not a breaking story. But in the Senate campaign in Tennessee… This is kind of interesting. This is the Marsha Blackburn story. Here opponent is Phil Bredesen, and Bredesen is saying that he’s disgusted and that if he was in the Senate, he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Now, he’s a Democrat running against the incumbent, Marsha Blackburn. What is a Democrat doing saying that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh?This is in the middle of a campaign here. Now, I know it’s Tennessee and it’s deep red. I know Bredesen wants to win and so forth, but this? He expected this to pay off for him in his campaign. This is obviously a reaction and reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh in the state of Tennessee. Phil Bredesen is, by the way, starting to lose ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data. This is for Corker’s seat.Corker, by the way, has also tweeted today that it is outrageous to punish somebody who hasn’t done anything to anybody for all of these supposed to actions other men have engaged in against women. His point is: We have no evidence Kavanaugh did anything to anybody, and we’re gonna deny him a seat on the court because of that? And the next day we’re gonna deny because of judicial temperament? Then we’re deny because he committed perjury? Then we’re gonna deny him because he threw ice at a bar back when he was in college?But Corker made it plain that he doesn’t think Kavanaugh should be held accountable for things he hasn’t — it’s kind of like the affirmative action argument. Why in the world are we gonna be punishing people here for racial discrimination when they haven’t engaged in it? “Well, we gotta make up for lost time,” the left says. Phil Bredesen, who is starting to lose grounds, fall behind Blackburn in the race to replace Corker…I mean, this is a really strange time to go public against his own party. He’s a former governor of Tennessee, and he “issued a statement rebuking Democrats for hijacking the confirmation process as a license to indulge in partisanship. If he was on the Senate floor right now, Bredesen announced that Kavanaugh would be planning his swearing-in ceremony. Bredesen he said he was disgusted by the treatment Dr. Ford got and he’s determined to help bring about fairer and more respectful treatment of these issues.”Now, see, he wants both sides of this. So he goes out and he rips into the treatment of Dr. Ford but also says that Kavanaugh would be confirmed. This is… I wouldn’t call it blockbuster, but it’s one of these things that you look at and you wonder, “Why now?” On the verge of the vote a Democrat candidate for the Corker seat beginning to lose ground…? It just tells you where, at least in Tennessee, where public opinion on this resides.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. Throw that picture back up on the Dittocam. Okay, that’ll work, the close-up. That picture of the alien versus Sigourney Weaver. It’s actually Dianne Feinstein and Lisa Murkowski. This picture was taken the day Blasey Ford testified. It was taken the day before; so a week ago Wednesday this picture was taken, the day before Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh testified. So that kind of helps put the picture in a little more context, does it not?Now back to the phones to Houston. This is Scott. Great to have you on the EIB Network. Hello. We lost him. So Scott in Houston is gone. Houston’s one of my favorite towns. Mark in Knoxville Tennessee you’re next. Greetings, sir. Hi.CALLER: Good afternoon, Rush. Thank you so much for taking my call. Any time, sir. Any time.CALLER: Longtime listener and first-time caller. It’s an honor to speak with you today. Would like to discuss Ms. Murkowski briefly with you. I believe it was during the Gorsuch hearings that Murkowski went to the administration, i.e., Trump, and bargained her vote for exploration rights in ANWR, and I worked up in Prudhoe. I know what that’s like. The revenue that that field brings to the state residents–RUSH: — This is correct. You’re right. I remember that. You’re exactly right. I think I know where you’re going. This is a hell of a payback.CALLER: Yeah. Well, you know, if it’s met with some resistance, is this her way to get the gotcha back on Trump, or why hasn’t that card been paid back to her to say with the stroke of the same pen it can all go away? You know, just something that makes you go, hmm. The other question —RUSH: Wait a minute. The stroke of the same pen…. What could go away?CALLER: Well, if the stroke of the pen can put ANWR in place for the state.RUSH: Oh. Oh! You mean Trump could cancel ANWR as payback to Murkowski for going against Kavanaugh?CALLER: Yes, sir.RUSH: He wouldn’t do it.CALLER: Oh. Okay.RUSH: Too many people would be hurt. Too many people be hurt by it.CALLER: You’re right. But that means a lot for her and her state. So I don’t know. The other quick question that I have for you, as you’ve mentioned earlier that if the Democrats regain the House that almost immediately impeachment hearings would start against Trump. But it would most likely include Kavanaugh. What does that do for Neil Gorsuch? Does that put him back in play again?RUSH: Back in play, you mean to be impeached as well?CALLER: Absolutely, sir.RUSH: No. No. No. They wouldn’t bite that much off. If you get rid of Kavanaugh, get him back off the bench and stall Trump’s next nominees, win the White House in 2020… No. In fact I think my guess is that they would go after Kavanaugh first, in terms of impeachment proceedings. Be fresh in everybody’s minds. Go after him on perjury and sexual harassment.I mean, serious, serious things for which a conviction could ruin his life as well. And then after they get Kavanaugh, then they go after Trump as the guy knowingly who nominated Kavanaugh. Then they add all the other things on Trump. Just my guess that they would go after Kavanaugh first. But Gorsuch they would leave alone. Gorsuch didn’t shift the balance of the court. Kavanaugh does.  "

I think you ought to be prepared. Let’s do a little hypothetical. Let’s presume that it’s tomorrow at 5:30, the vote’s over, and Kavanaugh is confirmed.Let me ask you a question. Do you think that the Democrats in the Senate, the Democrats in the media, do you think all of these deranged, psychologically out of whack protesters are just gonna say, “Well, we gave it our best shot. We’ll wait ’til they nominate somebody else and try to destroy them”? Or do you think that they will continue in their effort to wipe Kavanaugh out and destroy him? Believe me, choose door No. 2. Especially if these clowns win the House, they are going to immediately mount two things: Impeachment of Trump and, therefore, impeachment of Kavanaugh!Because if Trump shouldn’t have been there in the first place, then his nominee should not be, either. This is not going away. There’s only one way that it might. And it’s a huge long shot, and it is this. And by all rights, by all that is just, by all with a world in which God is present, the Democrats ought to have their rear ends handed to ’em in these upcoming elections, by all that’s just, by all that’s decent, they ought to be wiped out.This ought to be the biggest midterm landslide defeat any party has ever experienced. This party deserves to be punished at the ballot box like no party ever has! And in a decent and just world, that’s exactly what happened, would happen. And if… Right now the Democrats are expecting this gigantic blue wave where they’re gonna win the House and Pelosi’s already talking about being speaker. They’re even dabbling about the possibility of winning the Senate.And then they’re telling everybody what they’re gonna do. And I’m telling, you better, f they do win both of those seats, you better get as much active enjoyment out of our current economy and your current liberty and freedom as you can. Because they are going to start immediately erasing it by raising taxes, raising corporate taxes, committing this country to all kinds of worldwide climate change garbage that is going to redirect American resources.They’re gonna reenact the Obama agenda, and they’re gonna put it on steroids, and that’ll mean wiping out all of these trade deals, all of these new jobs. The Democrats want government to be front and center in everybody’s life. They want every voter to think whatever they have came from government, came from Democrats. It didn’t come from you. It doesn’t come from your hard work. It doesn’t come from your self-reliance. It comes from them.And you’re gonna learn it and love it and live it, by golly, by gosh, or else you’re gonna be punished. This party deserves to be so soundly defeated in November that we haven’t seen anything like it. If they lose. If they do not win the House, if they do not win the Senate, if they lose seats in both, then that might make some of the leaders of the party rethink their current strategy.But if they win based on this, it’s gonna get even worse than it’s been, this politics of personal destruction is going to be amplified, and every Republican is gonna be targeted and every political media opponent is gonna be targeted. If they win with this kind of behavior and treatment of people and turning American principles upside down like “innocent ’til proven guilty,” if they win doing this, whew. New Zealand! Is the coast open?  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/05/professional-democrat-operative-engineered-flake-elevator-ambush/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 5, 2018RUSH: Senator Flake just announced he’s going to vote for the confirmation of Kavanaugh “unless something big changes.” Well, we don’t know what the “something big” changing could be. It could be anything. This is why I think he deserves a little praise here for doing the right thing when, in his world, people that matter to him — a lot of them — are just up and arms over this, and he’s standing up and doing the right thing here.So I want to play an audio sound bite for you and this is to give you an idea what’s happening to Flake — and it’s happening to all of them. Remember that elevator confrontation where the two women and the CNN camera just ran into the elevator and ambushed the guy, started shouting, and it looked like it totally unnerved him? Well, the woman…It was portrayed by CNN as just a couple of citizens that happened to be walking through the Senate. (impression) “They saw Flake, and they got livid, and they tracked him down and they went in the elevator — and average citizens are livid!” They weren’t average citizens. They were part of the paid mob, and one of the babes involved admits it this morning on CNN. This is Ana Maria Archila. Question: “Where is the disconnect in the conversation these days?”ARCHILA: In order to have a healthy democracy, it is essential for our political leaders to connect with us, to look at us, to not look away, to listen to our stories. I feel very encouraged that actually people around — across the country are doing precisely that. We’re stepping… We’re overcoming some of our fears, doing things for the first time. Maria, who was there in that elevator with me, has never talked to an elected official. We spent 15 or 20 minutes before we saw Flake talking about how do you do that, and what I said to her was, “Just tell him why you’re here.”RUSH: Right. So you see they’re sitting outside planning this. A little coaching go on. Ana Maria Archila is the co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, which is a Soros-Hillary Clinton front group. But the point is they’re not average, ordinary citizens outraged by what’s going on. They’re political activists. But the press portrays these people as just outraged Americans — women outraged at the status of male dominance in America, and they forced their way in there courageously — and it’s not that at all. He was ambushed by a political mob!  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/05/gop-senators-face-enormous-pressure-and-threats/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 5, 2018RUSH: So the vote was 51-49. Manchin, Flake, and Collins all voting yes, but the final vote cannot happen by Senate rule before 4:42 p.m. Eastern Time tomorrow. It has to be 30 hours after this vote was taken. Now, I want to say, I’m not surprised by Murkowski who voted “no.” A lot of people are asking is the vote now not gonna change? I mean, if the cloture vote and we got the procedural vote 51-49.No, folks, because I’m gonna tell you what’s happening out there. I have been made privy to some of the comments, not just on social media, but to the offices that many Republican senators are getting. They are being deluged, their entire families are being threatened. Their grandchildren are being threatened. Their wives, their husbands, barmaids, everybody they know being threatened.It’s enormous; it is never ending; the phones don’t stop ringing; the threatening emails and tweets do not stop arriving; it is unhinged; it is vile, and it is evil. And it’s not just Flake and Collins and Manchin. It’s all the Republicans are hearing. It is one of the most disgusting things many of these people say they’ve ever seen. In that regard, Jeff Flake and Susan Collins, I think they have to be credited for doing the right thing.They are both facing enormous pressures. Flake is getting pressure like you can’t believe from not only members of the paid professional mob squad on the left, but other Democrats in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee. I don’t think as far as Flake is concerned, he voted today for Kavanaugh in a… It’s not technically a vote for Kavanaugh. It’s a vote to go to a final vote.And the rule of thumb always is that as these procedural votes go, so goes the final vote. But you can’t make book on that simply because of the abject, real, frightening threats these people are getting. And I think the vote for Flake today was really hard. I’ll tell you why. He went from being a “yes” vote to being harassed on the elevator to becoming a “yes” vote with the FBI investigation.He got what he wanted. They’re still leaning on him. He’s leaving the Senate. This is his final term. The easy thing to do here would be to vote against Kavanaugh and receive the praise of the mob and receive the praise of the Democrats, and he went ahead, and he voted in what many of us think is the right way. He did the right thing.He’s gonna be attacked viciously. He is going to be accosted by the left all the way through the rest of today, tonight, and tomorrow. The same thing with Susan Collins, the senator from Maine. I can’t describe for you… You might have an idea; you probably know. The things that are being said to these people, the threats that they are getting belie the notion that we live in a civilized society.It’s unhinged. Much of it is insane and deranged and is made up of the psychological disorders that I believe constitute now the mainstream of the Democrat Party. The protesters are paid. Their signs are all the identically manufactured, the same phrases all over them. And these people… I don’t know if you’ve received threats and I don’t know if you’ve been barraged by them, but if you have and if you believe them, they can unnerve you.Yet Flake and Collins did the right thing here. I only hope that they’re able to maintain their positions. Now, Collins has announced that she’s going to make a statement after 3 o’clock today. And of course everybody’s on pins and needles wondering what that’s going to be. Now, the thinking on this goes that there’s no way she would vote “yes” on the procedural vote this morning if her intention is to vote “no” down the road.If you’re gonna kill the nomination, do it now, not tomorrow. I don’t think any of these theories or traditions can be hoisted up and used and relied on. I think we’re in brand-new territory here for a number of reasons. I don’t think you can say that just because Susan Collins voted “yes” this morning means a guarantee she’s gonna see vote “yes” tomorrow. And then why make a statement at 3 o’clock? Why make some…? Why 3 o’clock? And why make some statement?Now, I try to keep my ego out of this as much as I can, but I’m telling you, when I see somebody’s gonna make a statement at 3 o’clock, first thing I realize is I’m not gonna be here to comment on it. And I wonder if I’m the only one that notices that or if the person making the statement might. It’s a curious thing. It could just well be that she wants a lot of attention for what she is going to say. But as of right now, they’ve both been… (interruption)I’m not sucking up, Snerdley. Snerdley’s accusing me of sucking up. I’m not. I know the kind of threats these people are getting. Susan Collins… In fact, I’ll tell you this. Susan Collins has been assured by people that if she votes “no,” she can forget ever be reelected to the Senate from Maine by the Republican Party there. She’s also being told that if she votes “yes,” that all kinds of horrible, despicable things are gonna happen.Flake is being told this. They all are. But Collins and Flake and Murkowski… Joe Manchin. Joe Manchin on the Democrat side. Joe Manchin voted “yes.” He’s a Democrat, West Virginia. He’s getting a load of it as well. So it could well come down… You know, there’s Senator Daines’ daughter in Montana? His daughter is scheduled to get married tomorrow. And he says, “You know what? I’m going to the wedding. This only happens once. I’m going to the wedding.”Donald Trump, Jr., said, “I’ve got total faith, Daines is the greatest guy. If they need his vote, he’ll be there.” Well, they’re gonna needs his vote. So they got a plane standing by. They’re gonna maybe… Somebody said, “Why don’t you do the wedding in the Senate anteroom and have the reception in statutary, statutory, statuary, whatever it is, hall?”But he will get there; he will vote.And it could well be that they’re gonna have to Vice President Pence up there for final passage to make this happen. I hope it doesn’t eventuate that way. But there are a lot of people here that are doing the right thing and acting courageously, and because of that they are in the line of fire, euphemistically speaking that the left has set up for everybody. Collins and Flake have both tried to be accommodating and reasonable; the other side is not. They’re vicious and they’re vile; they are despicable; they are mean.And it’s the same thing happening to Senator Flake.So take a brief time-out. We’ll continue here, your phone calls as well. It’s Open Line Friday, which means that you can talk about pretty much anything you want. There are other things happening, as is the case each and every day, other things outside the primary news event of the day, which of course is the Senate vote on Kavanaugh.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, folks, don’t misunderstand me here. I know… (interruption) Mr. Snerdley…. Mr. Snerdley is worried about Susan Collins. He’s saying, “Why call and announce? Why make an announcement 3 o’clock? You voted ‘yes’ to continue the process. You voted ‘yes’ on the procedural vote. There can be only one reason to call a 3 o’clock announcement, to say you’re gonna vote ‘no.’ After suggesting the process should go forward, you want to shut down the process.”I realize a lot of people think that that’s what’s in store here. And, course, I’m hearing… I knew this was gonna happen. I’m hearing from droves of you who say the proof is the timing, that she’s gonna do this after this program ends. It means that, “Rush, it can’t be anything you’re gonna like.” I’m getting emails that say… (interruption) You think that’s right, too? (interruption)Snerdley says absolutely. He thinks that’s right as well. Well, we’ll see. I’m not going to withdraw my acknowledgment that I think she did the right thing.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Snerdley just found a link that Lisa Murkowski has not made her final decision yet. Uhh, that’s not what we were told earlier today. We were told her decision was final and that she had said, “Kavanaugh’s just not the man at this time for the Supreme Court.” That’s a quote. Well, I’m holding here in my formerly nicotine-stained fingers… By the way, coming up on the Dittocam in the next segment, the monologue next hour: A couple of pictures of Dianne Feinstein with Murkowski up against a wall.Feinstein’s got her hand above her head up against the wall, and it looks like Feinstein… It looks like the alien and what’s her name, Courtney…? What was the actress in the Alien movies? (interruption) Sigourney Weaver. It looks like Feinstein’s the alien and Murkowski is Sigourney Weaver, and that big weapon is about to pop out of Feinstein’s mouth and obliterate Murkowski. We’ll have that. In fact… Nope. We’ll save it ’cause I don’t have much-time here.I want to read to you a couple of tweets from Kimberley Strassel at the Wall Street Journal. “1) Just to be clear on what @LisaMurkowski voted for today: –to legitimize and sign off on the most despicable tactics ever in a nomination. –to stand with Dianne Feinstein, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris. –to leave Judge Brett Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury/impeachment.”She signed off “2) –to abandon due process and presumption of innocence. –to potentially leave High Court at a 4-4 deadlock, putting the loony 9th circuit in control of everything that matters to Alaska–development, prop rights, gun rights, enviro rules, etc. Quite the statement.” Boy, that is so true. It’s a 4-4 tie. The 9th Circuit contains Murkowski’s state. She’s supposedly a Republican. But this nails it.She voted “to legitimize and sign off on the most despicable tactics ever,” to stand with Feinstein, Kamala Harris. I’m telling you, this party — the Democrat Party — in a just world, would suffer the biggest midterm electoral defeat in this nation’s history. They deserve for this country to rise up against them at the ballot box because of everything they’ve done. In the past two years alone, just to Trump and the people that voted for him, specifically Kavanaugh.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/05/balsey-fords-camp-tampered-with-witnesses/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 5, 2018RUSH: There’s a really important story out there that is not being covered. It’s not being covered on even Fox News or Fox Business News. It is a story of massive witness tampering. It is a story about a witness, Leland Keyser, one of the reportedly best friends of Dr. Blasey Ford. Leland Keyser says that she was bullied by another friend of Ford’s and a former FBI agent herself, Monica McLean.She was bullied. She was told, she was asked to change her story and say that she was in the room with Blasey Ford when Kavanaugh… Well, she was at the event when Kavanaugh supposedly did the dirty against Dr. Ford. She has maintained from the get-go that she doesn’t know what Dr. Ford’s talking about. She wasn’t there.None of the four “witnesses” that Dr. Ford says were there say they were.Monica McLean, a former FBI agent and former friend of Blasey Ford, and it was at McLean’s house in Delaware where Blasey Ford wrote the letter to Feinstein! Did you know that? Yes! Blasey Ford was in Delaware with Monica McLean, and some are suggesting (I don’t know if it’s true) that actually Monica McLean might have written the letter. But at least that there was a collaboration, the letter that was sent to Feinstein. You would think this story would be all over the place.You would think that it would have been mentioned on the Senate floor today when they took the procedural vote, which, by the way, was 51-49 Kavanaugh. I don’t think there were any surprises. A lot of people thought that Murkowski was gonna vote to confirm. I never did. I never did. I thought Murkowski was always gonna stake out this position. Then I saw a story that some 300 female lawyers from Alaska had been leaning on Murkowski.So she voted “no” and said that Kavanaugh is not the right man at the right time to be on the court. But this is pretty big story that Blasey Ford’s FBI friend Monica McLean was pressuring Leland Keyser to modify her testimony and statement so as to say that she, “Oh, you know what, I just remembered, I was there, I remember that Kavanaugh, I remember.” That’s what they wanted her to do. You thought it was kind of dubious, you thought it might have been a little sketchy that Blasey Ford’s best friend is a retired FBI agent?We mentioned this to you earlier this week. A former DOJ officials may have ties to the FBI’s attempt to run that coup on Trump. Her name is Monica McLean again, and they were together on July 30th when Ford was writing the letter to Feinstein. They were in Delaware at McLean’s house. Leland Keyser is an ex-wife of Bob Beckel, a former Democrat political operative, Fox News commentator and CNN commentator. They wanted her, they pressured her to “revisit” her statement.The Wall Street Journal had the story or has the story today. This is witness tampering. This is asking a witness to lie so as to buttress the story told by Dr. Blasey Ford. The pressure came from a former FBI agent again who’s one of the beach buddies of Dr. Ford’s. If this isn’t witness tampering then somebody needs to tell me what it is. Charles Grassley was on Fox. Grassley, as I mentioned at the end of yesterday’s program, Grassley has been on fire. Something has really set him off.I would think that it would have happened years and years and years ago, but whatever. Something has really set him off now. He’s going after the press, accusing them face-to-face of outright bias. He’s accusing the Democrats of being insincere, doing great harm to the Senate. One of Grassley’s points is (and John Cornyn’s, too): If we’re gonna get rid of somebody on the basis of an allegation with no proof, what are we doing for every future nominee that comes before this committee?If the new standard is that all a nominee has to be is accused of something and that kills the nomination, then where are we headed? We’re headed exactly where the Democrats want. Just to refresh your memory, Blasey Ford and Leland Keyser were close… I mean, some say best friends, at the time of the alleged attack by Kavanaugh.When Keyser’s denial was brought up at the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Blasey Ford attempted to discredit her by saying (imitation), “Well, she’s got health problems. She had problems. I don’t know, but she was not well. I felt really bad for her.” It turns out that Leland Keyser’s a former pro golfer. She does have back and neck problems but not mental health issues.Monica McLean, again, Blasey Ford’s lifelong best friend and the woman Blasey Ford allegedly coached prior to taking a polygraph test. This Monica McLean is all over this story. We’ve only learned her name in the past week or so. And according to reports, Monica McLean was at Blasey Ford’s side in the hearing room before she testified. She was. I have now seen photos.Anyway, Grassley said on Fox & Friends this morning that there is evidence in the FBI report that other witnesses were leaned on by allies of Blasey Ford as well, not just Leland Keyser! Other witnesses were leaned on. That means every senator has seen that. Every senator that’s read the report has seen this! And it apparently isn’t changing any votes.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We’ll go to Pleasanton, California, first with Chris. Hello.CALLER: Hello, Rush. Good to talk with you. This Monica McLean, who you were just speaking of, the person that contacted Ms. Keyser and trying to get her to possibly change her testimony —RUSH: Yes.CALLER: — she’s the same person that the boyfriend of Dr. Ford mentioned in the letter he sent in talking about how there was coaching going on by Dr. Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph exam.RUSH: Yeah. That’s another story, by the way. The boyfriend’s letter has yet to be reported in mainstream media, nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Leland Keyser to change her testimony. Those two stories have not been reported ABC, CBS, NBC, Washington Post, New York Times, Associated Press. People have not heard either of those.CALLER: And there’s other things, like, for example, Dr. Ford mentioned in her Senate… I mean in the testimony she gave, she mentioned Rehoboth, Delaware, was where she was at. And that’s the last known address of this Monica McLean.RUSH: Correct. Yes absolutely. When they wrote the letter, when Blasey Ford wrote the letter, that’s where she was. She was in Rehoboth, Delaware, with McLean. Yes.CALLER: So here’s my question. There’s an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on behind the scenes here that hasn’t come out yet. I’m wondering if the Democrats, oddly enough, are not better off holding this vote now before more of this comes out. (Unintelligible) if it’s going to go through and at the last-minute change… One of the people that’s saying they’re gonna vote changes it so suddenly it goes down, and according to them because all this is about to come out.RUSH: It’s not about to come out. That’s the whole point. You know it, but it’s not gonna come out. It hasn’t come out yet, it’s not gonna come out. Now, one thing. It has… The Leland Keyser pressure to change her testimony, that is in the FBI report. The Democrats have seen that. Grassley referenced it, and Grassley says there’s a lot more. There are many more examples of Blasey Ford witnesses being pressured to change their testimony.Democrats have seen all that. It doesn’t change anything, it’s not gonna change anything. This is not about the evidence. It never has been about the evidence. And if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York Times website in five minutes and if ABC, CBS, NBC began to report all this, it wouldn’t change one Democrat Senate vote. Democrats can’t delay the vote anyway. That’s up to McConnell, the Turtle.CALLER: Well, the question is, why wouldn’t Republicans make a greater effort for it to come out?RUSH: Why wouldn’t they make a greater effort to…? It’s in the FBI report. The Republicans are thinking, the Democrats can see it. The Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report. They discovered —CALLER: Yeah, but to my knowledge, none of the Senator Grassleys, so forth, are not mentioning what we were just talking about in this conversation.RUSH: No, they’re not. I can’t tell you why they’re not mentioning it.CALLER: Okay. Thank you.RUSH: You bet.CALLER: I’m wondering myself.RUSH: Well, no, your questions are entirely legitimate, and they’re rooted in pure common sense. You’re sitting there thinking if the world knew this, it would change everything. It shows that the Blasey Ford side is willing to commit perjury, suborn perjury, pressure witnesses to change their stories, which then could be said to conclude that there’s not anything that Blasey Ford is saying that’s reliable!But those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large. They’ve not shown up at Yahoo News, the Associated Press, New York Times, CBS, NBC, CNN, and they won’t, for the exact reason that the stories are being suppressed. But the Democrats in the Senate know it. Doesn’t matter. It’s about the seriousness of the charge. It’s not about the nature of the evidence. It never is.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: In Christine Blasey Ford’s letter to Dianne Feinstein, Leland Keyser is referred to as a “he.” Leland Keyser is one of Blasey Ford’s best buds, the ex-wife of Bob Beckel. In the letter to Feinstein, Leland Keyser is referred to as a “he.” This has led analysts to believe that Ford didn’t write the letter. Ford would know that Leland Keyser — would presumably know that Leland Keyser is not a man. If Leland Keyser’s one of Blasey Ford’s best buds then she would know she’s a woman.But she’s referred to as a “he.” So now we’re back to Monica McLean, Blasey’s friend that helped her write the letter from her home in Rehoboth, Delaware. Guess what? McLean is a former FBI agent said to have worked as a spokesperson for Preet Bharara. Preet Bharara is a former staffer for Senator Schumer.He went on to become U.S. attorney, Southern District for New York, ’til Trump fired him, and now he is one of the biggest Never Trumpers out there. McLean’s lawyer is David Laufman. “From the archives of the Washington Post, February 2018…” This guy was instrumental in the prosecution… Well, he was the prosecutor in charge of… (ear-splitting tone) Well, there’s the ear-splitting tone. Hang on. Let me complete the dots when I get back.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay, to review: In her letter to Feinstein, Blasey Ford refers to her best friend, Leland Keyser as a “he.” Blasey Ford’s best friend is a woman. Blasey Ford would know this. So if Leland Keyser is referred to as a “he” in this letter, it’s logical to conclude that Blasey Ford didn’t write the letter. Okay? Well, then who might have helped her? Well, that would be Monica McLean at whose home Blasey Ford was in Rehoboth, Delaware, at the time the letter was written.McLean, former FBI spokesperson, also worked with Preet Bharara… The reason I’m going through all this is that Blasey Ford is using people that are tied and linked at the hip and the heart and the brain to Democrat Party activism, from the FBI to the Department of Justice to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Now, Monica McLean’s lawyer happens to be a guy named David Laufman.According to the Washington Post, David Laufman helped oversee the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server from which she was exonerated, and Laufman also helped oversee the Russian interference in the Trump election or campaign in 2016. So how is it that Blasey Ford ends up in the home of a woman who’s tied to the DOJ and the FBI and characters who were involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Trump-Russia collusion investigation?How does that happen? If you’re just a woman out in Santa Cruz or Palo Alto and you see that Brett Kavanaugh has been nominated to be in the Supreme Court and you don’t think he should be because you think one time he attacked you, you send a letter to Dianne Feinstein, and the next thing you know… No. No. No. That’s not it. You send Feinstein a letter after traveling to Delaware to meet with your buddy Monica McLean who probably writes the letter for you because of the inclusion of Leland Keyser as a “he,” not a woman, which she is.So you’re just… You’re a beach babe, a psychology professor, whatever, from California, and you end up writing a letter after traveling to Delaware, after saying you’re afraid of flying, and the lawyers don’t tell you that the committee is willing to fly out to California till they interview you. (impression) “I — I — I — What? I didn’t know. I did, I didn’t know you I — I would have welcomed you into my home if you had come.”I don’t even think I buy this. She didn’t want them to come out there because she was gonna go to Delaware to meet with McLean! She didn’t want the committee seeing who she was meeting with. This whole thing required her to come to Washington. For this to pull off, she had to come to Washington. So we look at Hillary Clinton’s email server investigation and the Trump-Russia collusion, and what do we find? A woman who happens to be helping Blasey Ford defeat Brett Kavanaugh and his nomination to the Supreme Court!With every Democrat saying within minutes of Kavanaugh being nominated they’re gonna oppose him, with every Democrat saying they believe her even though she doesn’t have any evidence, and TIME magazine just put her on the cover, the new cover of TIME magazine. Let’s see. It’s an illustration of Blasey Ford last week. She’s seen taking the oath. It’s pathetic. This whole thing has been a setup, is my point.And the people that set it up are the same people that have been running the silent coup against Donald Trump! And every Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee knows everything I just told you. But rather than it be a problem, they’re telling themselves how well organized they are and how brilliantly they pulled this off. In their world, they’ve made the American people really believe that this woman was minding her own business one day when she was 15 and this nominee to the court came and brutalized her, and she’s just a woman.(Imitation) “Oh a teacher, that likes children, and that’s terrified to be here, huh.” They’re thinking what a masterful plan we’ve pulled off. We’ve got everything in this country thinking A that something that didn’t happen did, that we have nothing to do with it, when this whole thing is an orchestrated screenplay! And that’s why DiFi won’t turn any of the therapy and the polygraph information for the Judiciary Committee to look at. And the Republicans know this too.But the power of the Democrats is look at the Republicans that are quivering and a little afraid to go ahead and confirm Kavanaugh. This Democrat machine is a scary, scary bunch. Democrat machine includes the media and all of these psychologically deranged protesters that are out there threatening and in some cases committing violence. We’ve got one of them who has just been arrested for “doxing” a bunch of Republican senators. That’s tech lingo for releasing their documents.“Doxing” means to discover all of their private information, name, address, phone number, bank accounts, all that stuff, and making it public. A guy who interned for Sheila Jackson Lee and I think worked for Feinstein is the guy that did it! And don’t forget, Feinstein had a Chinese spy on her staff for a year driving her around. It might be legitimate to ask, was the Chinese spy actually a spy? Let me put it another way: Did Feinstein know that he was a spy and that’s why he was there?I don’t know. I’m just telling you, we have been, again, subjected to a gigantic, real life Netflix drama. This thing has been scripted, it has been choreographed, it has been rehearsed! It had an objective that failed. And this is the reason we’re learning all this. The objective was for Kavanaugh to withdraw. They thought that they would get Kavanaugh so intimidated and making him think that all of this was so futile that in order to spare himself this assault, he would withdraw his nomination.Barring that, that Trump would withdraw it so as to spare him the embarrassment. They miscalculated both ways. So now we’ve had a procedural vote, we’re gonna have the real Senate confirmation vote tomorrow on a totally manufactured, written, and I’m sure it’s been tested, script, with the power players being same people, the FBI, Department of Justice, deep state who helped run the silent coup against the Trumpster. Back to the phones we go.This is Joe in Cincinnati. It’s great to have you, sir. Hi.CALLER: Rush, it’s an honor to speak with you. You’re a patriot, and I salute you.RUSH: Thank you very much, sir. I appreciate that more than you know.CALLER: I’ll be quick. I’m a military service member of 16 years. And after witnessing this Kavanaugh circus, my friends and family say, hey, you should run for political office. After this there’s no way, because being deployed several times, the standard for left would be to accuse me of war crimes. Now, Rush, being a military service member I’m not gonna present a problem without a solution. And here’s the solution.After Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh gets settled in, he should file slander charges against Swetnick, Ramirez, Ford, and any other activist liberal slanderer or the new standard will be “guilty until proven innocent.” And I can tell you this right now: My military brothers and sisters have not fought and died for that sort of right for this country.RUSH: Damn right! That is exactly right. I don’t think Kavanaugh would be able to sue them. I don’t think that… Once you start getting into government, government officials and so forth… You get the First Amendment, which protects political speech. And you can produce an ad that says pretty much anything. And they can lie about whoever and whatever you want, and there’s not much you can do about it.The remedy for that is more speech, which in this case equals more money to counter the lies that are being told. It’s a frustrating thing. It drives a lot of average people out of politics even to the point of not voting or not caring ’cause they think, “Why should I? I don’t know who’s telling me the truth. Probably nobody is. I can’t keep track of it anyway. It’s not worth the angst that it causes.” It causes a lot of people to tune out. But this is causing people to tune in.I wish there were a remedy for this. ‘Cause it is all of what you said, slanderous and libelous. But there isn’t any recourse. You know, it’s the old song, success is the sweetest revenge.  "

Thom Tillis has had some really, really interesting things to say. Several of these senators have mentioned that the FBI has interviewed more than 150 people about Kavanaugh in his seven background investigations — 150 people — and not a one of them has corroborated any allegation against him! Thom Tillis just noted that the first background checks of Kavanaugh were done right after he got out of college.Tillis said that the FBI surely would have come across these rape allegations then if there was anything to them. But they haven’t corroborated anything. There are thousands of questions that he’s answered. He’s undergone a more exhaustive investigation than any Supreme Court nominee, and they can’t find diddly-squat on the guy. And then Tillis nuked this whole latest attempt to say that he didn’t have the proper judicial temperament last week. Tillis pointed out 31 hours of hearings that he was of perfect temperament until it came time to defend his name against these charges.These Republicans are doing a pretty bang-up job in their presser right now.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Holy smokes out there. Holy cornstalks, Batman! Charles Grassley is going off on the media like I’ve never seen him do! He’s accusing them of bias in practically every question that they’re asking him! He’s really ticked off!  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/04/panic-sets-in-throughout-the-drive-by-media/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 4, 2018RUSH: Now we’ll play for you a couple of audio sound bites. This is John Harwood. John Harwood is a liberal Democrat member of the press. Been at the Wall Street Journal, been at the New York Times, CNBC, wherever he’s needed to advance the leftist agenda, Harwood goes. Today he appeared on CNBC’s Power Lunch. And this just a little bit of his report about the impact of the Kavanaugh nomination on the midterms elections.HARWOOD: This Kavanaugh nomination controversy has sent an electric charge through the midterm campaign, and right now it appears to be benefiting the Republicans the most. Here in Florida, Bill Nelson, the veteran Democratic incumbent, is leading by just one percentage point in this recent Mason-Dixon poll. Rick Scott, the former health care CEO turned governor of Florida. But if the voters that we talked to about this Kavanaugh nomination are any indication, Rick Scott may get a benefit from angry Republicans who are fired up by this issue.RUSH: I just need to ask if any of you remember who it was who’s been saying all these months that the issues that would decide the midterm elections hadn’t happened yet. That would be me back in April, May, June, July, August. That’s right, Mr. Snerdley. That would be me. Now, here is Harwood. I think… Folks, I think just based on the way I’m watching liberal reporters talk about this today, I’m getting a sense of a bit of panic setting in.I really believe that they thought that no matter how this Kavanaugh thing went, they would win. I think they thought they’d persuade people Kavanaugh was a reprobate and if he got confirmed it was really firepower their base that a mugger and a rapist and all this stuff’s on the court. If they lost it, ditto, same thing. I think the one thing they didn’t count on is rejuvenating and reviving the Republican base they think is happening, they think it’s happening. Here’s Harwood. He went out and talked to some voters, and this is that report.MAN #1: It’s such a fraud issue.WOMAN #1: The Kavanaugh hearings are a disgrace.MAN #2: The thing nowadays there’s so many people in the world nowadays, you know, if I come out and say here, you’re — you’re Joe Smith and — and you sexually harassed me when I was in high school, you’re guilty, today. There’s no if ands or buts.MAN #3: I don’t think the — the liberal side, the Democrats are doing themselves any favor with what’s going on right now with this nomination, the Supreme Court nomination. I think it’s — I think it’s a sham. I’m disgusted watching it.RUSH: They actually played this on CNBC. Harwood actually went out, he talked to these people, that’s what they said. Can you imagine how shocked the Democrats are and the media is to hear this? This is… I’ll tell you another reason why. This is the exact opposite reaction they have been trying to create! The media has been doing everything they can to drum up hatred for Kavanaugh! They have been doing everything they can to try to make average voters think that Brett Kavanaugh is the seediest, biggest gang rapist reprobate that’s ever been nominated to sit on the Supreme Court!They have been trying to make people believe that! And now they’re getting it thrown right back in their face that that’s not what’s happening. One of the reasons for this is that Kavanaugh is a likable person and that he’s been on courts for years! And there have been countless opportunities for all of this to have been discovered and proved, and nobody has ever been able to! A lot of common sense rearing its head here.And it’s in direct contravention of the attempts in the reporting by the Drive-By Media to create hatred for this guy among the American people. And when they get stuff thrown back in their face, like our old buddy Nic Robertson, remember went over to Cairo, Tahrir Square talking to natives of Egypt trying to get them to talk about how important Obama was to their freedom movement. And everybody he talked to said, Obama didn’t have anything to do with this. Obama? What’s Obama got to do with it?Nic Robertson was for it. “And there you hear it here in Tahrir Square, Egyptians left and right loved Obama.” None of them said that! In fact, a couple of them he talked to mocked Obama and made fun of him. So when they have this stuff thrown back at them, direct evidence that their attempts to create and shape public opinion are not working… Oh, there’s Heidi Heitkamp. Well, it’s a report that she’s gonna vote “no” on Kavanaugh, despite the popularity of Kavanaugh in her state. It’s just a Fox chyron graphic: “Senator Heitkamp to Vote ‘No’ on Kavanaugh.”People thought she might be turn-able.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/04/have-we-heard-from-director-comey-yet/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 4, 2018RUSH: The Democrats are raising holy hell that there’s only one copy of the FBI report. They’re raising holy hell because they want to be able to leak it. They said, (imitation), “One report? How are we supposed to read it, one report? Why, it’s crazy.”Well, the reason there’s only one copy of it is so that it can’t get leaked. This is raw data about people, folks. We have gone to great lengths to explain to you what this FBI report is. It is a series of Form 302s. It’s like the FBI version of the form 1040. A 302 is simply the results of an interview with people, people of interest, targets, non-targets neighbors, passersby, irritators, whatever. The FBI goes and talks to people.They’ve done this about Kavanaugh now seven times, over the course of his judicial career and when he was in the White House, staff secretary to George W. Bush. He’s carrying the nuclear codes in what’s called the football. He’s gotta have top-level security. He’s gotta be worthy of it! They’ve done background after background after background on Kavanaugh! And they just did another one! And they went and talked to specific witnesses as a result of the claims by Blasey Ford and Ramirez!They talked to Mark Judge, they talked to Ramirez, they talked to a bunch of people. They produced the results of those interviews. They don’t tell anybody they think they’re lying. They don’t report their opinions. They don’t come to any conclusions! They simply file the 302s and they send ’em up to the Senate and the White House. The Senate gets one copy. And you know why that is? Because Obama and Patrick Leahy, who was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee back during one of the Obama terms, agreed to this!The Democrats, the Republicans and Obama agreed that FBI reports like this would be submitted to the Senate only one copy so that senators can’t walk out with it and leak it! They’re gonna leak it anyway. That’s already started to happen. And the Democrats know this! This is another example of how they just simply lie. This is not just being disingenuous. They’re lying! And they’re trying to make it look like Trump and Grassley are trying to hide something!And it’s not! It’s the law! It is Senate law! Senate rules! With the imprimatur and the agreement of Barack Hussein O. And so now all these Democrat senators are just whining and moaning about the unfairness of it and how hard it is to read it. With only one copy, that means we have to go up in groups and we have to make an appointment. It was the same thing with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Members of Congress had to make an appointment to go read that entire bill, if you will recall. The point is, there’s no trick being played here.Trump, the Republicans are not trying to limit the Democrats’ knowledge of what’s happened here. And the senators like Flake has seen it and Susan Collins, and they have both praised its thoroughness. They have both praised its thoroughness. And Collins has talked about how…And Flake, too, actually, about the fact that it’s very thorough in the fact that there isn’t any new corroboration! The bottom line is, the FBI looked into this, they talked to specific witnesses as named by Ford and others, and they can’t find any evidence for what Ford claims! Or Ramirez! It’s that open and shut! And they’re livid.I do believe that they thought they could get some witnesses to lie or to, you know, skirt around the edges of things. No, I mean it, folks, I don’t trust these people, I don’t trust these Democrats to be aboveboard when it comes to a justice on the court that they think is gonna overturn their world. Believe me, this is all about them wanting to be able to continue to kill babes in the womb at their greatest desire. They don’t want any limits on this at all. This is what this…They fear they’re gonna lose this, despite what Kavanaugh has said about overturn Roe v. Wade and all this. This is really what it’s about, and the larger thing it’s about is the Democrats rely on courts to impose their policies on America when they can’t win them legitimately with legislation. So, anyway, there’s nothing untoward here about there only being one copy. It’s Senate rules established back during the Obama administration.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Ari Fleischer with a good point. Do you notice what the director of the FBI did not do today? Christopher Wray did not call a press conference to praise himself and the bureau on the latest Kavanaugh report. Has anybody heard from Comey, by the way, yet praising the FBI for their work? (interruption) That still hasn’t happened?We haven’t heard from Comey yet? (interruption) Well, whenever the FBI does something great… I mean, he comes out and he always praises them on that Trump-Russia stuff. You would think… He loves the FBI. He doesn’t want the FBI to ever get creamed, and the Democrats are sliming the FBI like you can’t believe. Where’s Comey with his statement defending them? That’s all I’m asking. Sensible question, if you ask me.  "

What are the Republicans gonna do if Kavanaugh’s not confirmed? Are they gonna sit home, gonna be fired up? What are they gonna do? That’s not the question. The question is, “What are the Democrats gonna do if Kavanaugh is confirmed?” That’s what I think may be the bigger question — and, in the interests of discovering this, let’s go to the audio sound bites. We have a group of protesters occupying Senator Collins — Susan Collins of Maine — office, and during the protest, one of the protesting women made some remarks…WOMAN: I am begging, begging Senator Collins to not put a blind eye, to stand with us. It devastates me that I have to stand here! I stood on the steps of the Brooklyn Supreme Court last night and spoke at a vigil. I got on a train this morning at 6 a.m. It terrified me that I and other survivors have to tear our bodies apart and share our stories. Vote “no” on this confirmation. Do not turn a blind eye. Listen to us! Listen to me! Listen to our stories. We are not opportunists when we do that. Hear me. Vote “no” on this confirmation. Do not put a serial perpetrator on this court. Hear me, believe me, see me.RUSH: “It terrifies me that I and other survivors have to tear our bodies apart and share our stories.” I think Planned Parenthood tears your bodies apart. I don’t think Kavanaugh’s doing that. I don’t think Susan Collins is doing that. And you call him “a serial perpetrator,” but there’s no corroborating evidence. Now, what is this woman gonna do if the Democrats lose this? Go to the shrink or go to the polls? What’s she gonna do? Just asking. I’m just asking.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Little background here on that female protester sound bite we just played. These Kavanaugh vigils at these various courthouses around the country, those are organized by Move On, just FYI. MoveOn.org started… (interruption) Does anybody remember how Move On started? Right. The MoveOn.org movement was started during the Clinton impeachment proceedings, and its purpose was, “Come on! Let’s move on! Let’s stop the politics of personal destruction! Leave our president, the most moral man in America, Bill Clinton, alone, will you?”That was the original charge of MoveOn.org. If you’re gonna do anything, just give him a slap on the wrist. No lower than that. Might hurt. Just a slap on the wrist and then let’s move on! Now Move On has become a very pro-left, anti-America activist group. And that rant that we just played in the audio sound bite, it’s almost word-for-word what every other one of these protesters has said. They’ve memorized it. And it must have been focus grouped.These are paid professional protesters, folks. You have to understand that. These people are there because of George Soros. Just like all the Black Lives Matter people that show up in Ferguson, Missouri, or wherever, these are paid, bought-and-paid-for protesters made to look like it’s an organic movement of people genuinely outraged by Republican Senate action and Kavanaugh. They are bought and paid for. They are given focus-tested scripts. ‘Cause I’ve heard that rant from a number of different protesters at different places. That’s why I think it’s probably been focus grouped.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, Fauxcahontas. You should know Fauxcahontas was out speaking at an anti-Kavanaugh rally, and she got booed and practically shouted off the stage because she forgot to mention Native Americans as an aggrieved group in America. I’m not kidding! A bunch of leftists practically had to storm her tepee and get her off of the stage ’cause she didn’t mention Native Americans.  "

His father was the Council of Economic Advisers head honcho for Nixon, and Ben Stein is an independent. He’s a Hollywood actor, producer, writer, raconteur. He writes op-ed pieces for the American Spectator, and he has one here that’s dated today that’s entitled, “The Kavanaugh Beer Wars.”I just want to share some pull quotes from this story with you, because he sets it up by pointing out that he and his wife have been watching that TV series The World at War. Now, where did that run? That’s old. That’s been on a while. Was it A&E way back during the Biography days or National Geographic or something? Maybe the World War II Channel, I don’t know, but have you seen The World at War? Well, it’s years ago, and it’s got actual black and white footage of World War II and some… (interruption) Yeah, yeah.So he and his wife have been watching this, and he writes that they could hardly get through it without breaking down and crying at the atrocities that they are seeing, just the horrors of war. He writes, “Then I think of what the most august legislative body on earth, the U.S. Senate, is obsessed with: a teenage drunk’s high school yearbook’s inside jokes. These are what we are supposed to be examining until our eyes burn up in their sockets.“Not the threat of nuclear war begun by Chinese hypersonic low altitude cruise missiles. Not the clear signs that Iran has put itself on the lip of becoming a nuclear power. No, we’re supposed to be guessing what a group of beer-swilling high school boys made up fake bragging about. Is this what we fought for?” writes Mr. Stein. “Is this what the Constitution means? That the legislature concerns itself with a 15-year-old girl’s allegations that she was touched lasciviously 36 years ago? Is this what equal rights means?“The equal right to slander a man and wreck his family with zero evidence? Is this what our soldiers fought for in Normandy and Remagen and in the skies over Germany? Are we really in that estate? Where are the brains of the nation, to focus on a fairly typical high school spree instead of what we can do to help the teens of Chicago stop killing each other?” What we have been watching, writes Ben Stein, “is the murder of an innocent human being and his family in order to win an election.“This is lowering the mighty vaults of power in the District of Columbia until they become trailer trash bars and beauty parlors. God help us if we do not pull ourselves together and focus on what’s important and lasting in human life.” Do you know how many people I’ve heard say a strain of that — last week, last month, last number of years — along the lines of: If we don’t pull ourselves together, if we don’t come together, if we don’t unify, if we don’t realize what’s real important and focus on that, then God help us? (interruption)No, no, no, I don’t disagree with the sentiment, but I think it’s futile. Come together with who? Would somebody tell me what there is of what we saw last Thursday or Friday on the Democrat side to “come together” with? You go to the protest of Kavanaugh right now outside the district court of appeals in Washington. You tell me what there is to come together on. You tell me! Let me tell you one of the reasons why this country is roiled. I’m gonna repeat something. Have you ever wondered why they don’t have any abortion protests in the U.K. — or if they do, I mean, they’re minor.They’re skirmishes. You never hear about them. It’s because abortion became legal in the U.K. in the House of Commons! It was voted on! Everybody had their chance to make case. Do you realize, folks, 80%, if not more, of the liberal agenda that is governing the culture of this country has not passed in our Congress or legislatures? That’s 80% of the destructive pop culture impulses of the American left have been forced on us by courts — and that is why, all of this, among many other reasons, is so crucial to the Democrat Party.Because they cannot… Look at gay marriage and all these other things. None of that happened in the United States Congress via legislation. There were periphery bills on it, but most all of this stuff — including other cultural things — happened because judges either reject legislation to defeat this stuff or they impose their own political views, like Roe v. Wade was imposed in 1973 on the Supreme Court. And because there have not been actual votes, democratic votes on some of these key seminal issues, we are constantly roiled.The Democrats do not want votes on these issues because they’ve not gotten to the point where they would win them — and if you think they would, take a look at the eight years of Obama. What did Obama do, what did he have to do to get his agenda enacted? Congressional action? No. This one was Obamacare, and that required a bunch of trickery, and there wasn’t a single Republican vote for it. Obama got everything he wanted done via executive action and executive order, which is one of the reasons why Trump’s had such ease repealing it.So a majority of people in this country are forced to live in a culture that they reject and yet has not been voted on. Now, you tell me where there is common ground to come together! It’s a wonderful sentiment, and it makes whoever says it sound reasonable and heartfelt. But it’s just words, as far as I’m concerned. Anybody can say it. (interruption) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Snerdley. Don’t misunderstand. I’m not criticizing Ben Stein.He just reminded me. “God help us if we don’t pull ourselves together.” How in the hell is that gonna happen? Do you realize the American left doesn’t think but one thing? The only thing wrong in America is that we’re alive, folks. As far as these insane lunatics on the left are concerned, the only problem we’ve got is that we are alive and have the ability to oppose them. Now, how do you “pull ourselves together” with that?I don’t see how it is possible, which is why I have a constant refrain: They need to be defeated, and that is why Donald Trump is so important, irreplaceable, and valuable. He’s prominent on our side, gets it, understands it, and attempts to do just that: Defeat them. Rather than kowtow to them. Rather than try to make it look like we’re interested in cooperation, crossing the aisle, extending the friendly finger of fickle and fate, hoping against hope that we can come together. Find common ground and once again rediscover our national purpose.Our national purpose is under assault.Our national founding and purpose and objectives is under a blistering attack by a bunch of people I think actually are not completely healthy. They’re in bad health, and that bad health is exploited and used by the Democrat Party and the American left, and political issues are made out of psychological disorders. The purpose of all that is revenge and punishment at people the left thinks are standing in their way. It’s normal versus abnormal, if you want to really get down to what this is all about.I need to know where and with whom and how we pull ourselves together with the abnormal. They haven’t the slightest interest in it even if people on our side do. So, yeah, it’s a nice sentiment. It’s a sweet-sounding sentiment. “If we don’t pull ourselves together and focus on what’s important and lasting in human life, then we’re gonna go down the the…” Well, we don’t have anything in common, including on what’s important in life!When you’ve got whatever percentage of our population has been taught, has been brought up to hate this country and a majority of its citizens — and then has been taught that the reason they’re miserable and unhappy is because of a majority of people in this country — there’s not much else that can explain this kind of explain this kind of rage, temperament, misery, and anger which is constant, and it’s never assuaged. They are never happy.No matter what they win or what they get, they are never happy, and there is a human psychological reason for that as well. But the point is, come together? “If we don’t come together…” Stein is right. I mean, you watch World at War and you find out what we faced? I think we’re at the time where a majority of America has no idea what Omaha Beach was, why it was important. No idea. “Normandy? What’s that?”And then when they learn, “Ah, that’s old! That doesn’t mean anything. That’s irrelevant! That’s so long ago. That’s not the world today.” No, it’s only how the United States survived as it is. No, it’s so unimportant, it’s the only thing that stood in the way of a murderous anti-Semite tyrant from controlling the world. It’s the only thing. Not important, huh? But it’s not taught as such. It’s taught as American imperialism, colonialism, or what have you. I’d love to be able to come together, folks. I just don’t see any way to do it.  "

Back between September 8th and 11th in Indiana, Democrat voter enthusiasm was 41%. It’s now down to 39%. In Missouri, September 8 to 11, it was 44% down to 42% now. In Tennessee, Democrat voter enthusiasm was 47% (this is the number of Democrats who are gonna turn out) 47% back in early September, 38% now.That’s a nine-point drop in Tennessee. On the Republican side, Republican enthusiasm in the same three states is increasing. In Indiana, it’s gone from 32% to 41%, in Missouri, 36% to 44%, and in Tennessee, 33 to 44%. So numbers now, 41%-39% Republican, Indiana; 34-42 Republican, Missouri; 44-38 Republican, Tennessee. That’s a Fox News poll in just three states.One of the people interviewed by the FBI in this most recent report is this Deborah Ramirez. Now, Ramirez… (sigh) You know what? I can’t even remember what… I’m getting her confused. Is she Avenatti’s client? (interruption) No. Who is the gang rape? Avenatti’s client. (interruption) What was her name? (interruption) Swetnick! That’s right. This is Ramirez. This is… (sigh) Anyway, she was interviewed by the FBI, and the latest Ronan Farrow report further discredits her Kavanaugh allegation.Just to recap. Before she fingered Kavanaugh, Ramirez was telling classmates she could not be certain it was Kavanaugh. She now admits that her drinking that night clouded her memory or whatever it was she alleged Kavanaugh to be doing. Only after six days of talking to her lawyer, a Democrat politician, was Ramirez able to “remember” it was Kavanaugh. Every single one of Ramirez’s so-called witnesses sides with Kavanaugh.The only so-called corroboration Ramirez had was a guy who heard about the incident from somebody else. That someone else says he has no memory of the incident. Ramirez is a Democrat activist. Wednesday’s New Yorker piece trying to back her up is “a blatant piece of left-wing activism.” But it ends up that Ronan Farrow’s report further discredits her allegation in the end, and she was talked to by FBI. She was one of the people talked to, as was Mark Judge for three hours.The Democrats thought Mark Judge was gonna spill his guts and con… (interruption) Mark Judge, right. Was gonna spill his guts and convict Kavanaugh. He didn’t, and neither did Ramirez. The FBI… So these two people, the FBI talks to ’em. These are the people the Democrats wanted! “Mark Judge! Mark Judge! Mark Judge!” they kept saying all last week at the hearing, last Thursday, and then, “Ramirez! Ramirez!”The FBI talks to ’em; they submit the report. Sorry, says the report, but there’s no corroboration here. So Flake looks at it. “No corroboration!” Susan Collins looks at it. “Wow. This is really thorough. No corroboration.” A CNN reporter, right before 12 noon today — reporting on Flake and Collins — is very distressed, reporting that Flake is once again acting like a Republican, once again sounding like a Republican. The CNN infobabe to whom he was speaking (I think it was Kate Bolduan) said (summarized), “Well, we’ve got until Saturday noon to change things. We’ve got until Saturday noon.”Not “they’ve got.”“We’ve got.”The Fox News poll also says Republicans “are making gains in key Senate races as well. A new round of Fox News Battleground poll shows Republican trend in the fight for the Senate. The Republican candidates are helped by increased interest in the election among Republicans and pro-Trump sentiment.” Really? Why, we’ve been led to believe that Kavanaugh, being a gang rapist, attempted murderer, and worse, was wildly unpopular! I guess this proved the Republican base is… It doesn’t prove anything of the sort.It proves that people aren’t buying the allegations against Kavanaugh on the Republican side.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  Doug Schoen, well-known Democrat pollster and analyst, was on the Fox Business Channel today and said by the election, the Kavanaugh affects on the Republicans will be baked in and the left will rise up and swamp the Republicans, especially in the suburbs with women.  That’s what they were thinking today.    "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/04/resident-trumps-pacing-explained-for-senator-sasse/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 4, 2018RUSH: One of the preeminent, most noteworthy Never Trump senators is Ben Sasse of Nebraska.In fact, let me find the Sasse sound bite. I know it’s near the end. Grab audio sound bite No. 20. There is an intense competition amongst Never Trumpers in Washington over who will become the next McCain, who will become the next conscience of the Never Trumpers, who will become the next conscience of whatever the Never Trumpers think Trump doesn’t have that they do have, that the Republican Party needs to reclaim. And here is what Ben Sasse said last night on the Senate floor…SASSE: We all know that the president cannot lead us through this time. We know that he’s dispositionally unable to restrain his impulse to divide us. His mockery of Dr. Ford last night in Mississippi was wrong. But it doesn’t really surprise anyone. It’s who he is.RUSH: Mr. Sasse, Senator Sasse, I have an alternative view, and I’m not gonna presume that you’re listening but maybe somebody who knows you is. I need you to consider something, Senator Sasse. You and numerous others say that President Trump mocked Dr. Ford in his rally, Southaven, Mississippi, earlier this week. Then you suggest that Trump knows what he’s doing, despite all the criticism he gets, that he is doing this, it’s who he is. He can’t help it.Mr. Sasse, I think it’s the other way around. I think Trump knows exactly what he’s doing. I think Trump has a behavioral pattern, it strategically happens, it’s call pacing. And let me briefly explain it again in setting up what’s to come next. When Trump originally spoke about Dr. Ford, what did he say? Compelling testimony, riveting. He couldn’t turn away from it. If she’s telling the truth, Kavanaugh’s gone. He’s got no prayer. If Kavanaugh’s lied in his testimony, he’s gone.Trump said all of this, and everybody said, “Wow. This is really unusual for Trump.” No. It’s not unusual. Trump gets himself on record, not every time, but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approved Washington establishment way. And every time he does it, do not some of you panic? Maybe you don’t anymore. But when he first started doing this, like Paris climate accords, yeah, yeah, there may be something here, we’re gonna look at it. No, he’s gonna cave, oh, no. Doesn’t matter.You can remember countless times where the president’s initial statement on an issue has seemed to dovetail with what the swamp thinks! But then a few days or a week go by and the president becomes who he is, and he starts speaking out against it after he’s put himself on the record. He does this for credibility, and he does it. It’s something called pacing. And it relaxes the opposition in any number of ways. He’s doing the same thing here with Dr. Ford. He knew right off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate, that nobody can prove, that she couldn’t prove.And what he did on Monday night was not mock her. He explained to everybody the truth about her. Everybody, because of what Trump did at that rally, everybody was forced to look and listen to that little riff on Dr. Ford’s shaky, uncorroborated, unprovable testimony. The Drive-Bys were never gonna tell the truth about Dr. Ford. The Drive-Bys were not able to ignore the rally. They tried. Not even Fox televised Trump’s rally. But because he said what he said about her, he forced the Drive-Bys to cover what he said!In the process, the Drive-Bys reported what he said! And people like Ben Sasse and others started, (imitation), “Get me the vapors, get me get me the vapors, oh, my God. Trump is… This is horrible. This is inhumane. He’s not fit.” What Donald Trump did, recounting the absurd inconsistencies in her testimony, Donald Trump calling her out on everything has been played now on all media. It went all day yesterday, reporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday.The fact is, the Drive-By Media did not report the inaccuracies of Dr. Ford’s testimony. The Drive-By Media did not report on none of the corroboration being possible! They did not tell their audiences that the four people Ford placed in the room when her incident happened claimed they weren’t there! Nobody knew that, folks! Other than you, the people that watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr. Ford couldn’t back up what she was saying!The people that watched the mainstream media had no idea that the four witnesses Ford claims were there all deny it and don’t remember being there! And one of them was one of her good friends! The Drive-Bys were not reporting any of that! The Drive-Bys were reporting what the Democrat senators, (imitation), “I believe her. She is a credible witness.” As far as the American people who watch only mainstream media’s concerned, the woman was telling the truth, they had backup, she had corroboration, and Kavanaugh was guilty!So Trump goes out, tells the truth about her, she doesn’t know what, she doesn’t know when, she doesn’t know where, she doesn’t know how she got home, she… Gets it on the record, the Drive-Bys have to report it and for the first time in their lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard it! Look at it this way. Think of the millions of people who had never heard the truth about Dr. Christine Ford and her full-of-holes testimony. Think of the millions who’d never heard it until Trump went out and characterized it for everybody.Think of it this way. Think of the thousands of voters in Missouri, in Arizona, in Michigan and Maine and West Virginia, North Dakota, Alaska, who now know the truth, who never would have known the truth had Trump not detailed it for people in his rally! Collins, Manchin, Heitkamp, McCaskill, Flake, Murkowski, they knew that there was no corroboration. They knew that there couldn’t have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses. This is why Trump did it.This is why Trump does what he does. If we had an honest media, millions of people would already know that Dr. Ford’s story doesn’t add up! If the media ever told the truth about this, there wouldn’t be any protests today, or not nearly as large and voluminous. The people at these protests think she’s telling the God’s truth. They think it’s gospel. They don’t know that her story can’t be backed up. Their media hasn’t told ’em. The Democrat senators haven’t told ’em. Only Trump did. Another reason why they hate him.But we don’t have an honest media. And so millions of people had no idea of all the holes in the Christine Blasey Ford story. Now they do. And here’s a little cherry on top. Since Trump did that and the whole media reported on it and Democrat senators and the like were asked about it, what comes three days later? Today’s FBI report saying no corroboration for what Dr. Ford said. So Trump says it, people like Ben Sasse and other Never Trumpers go literally insane.But if Trump hadn’t said it, nobody would know it, but Trump did say it. Millions now do know it, and here comes the cherry on the top, the FBI report. We couldn’t find any corroboration for her story. End of the week, Trump was right! Drive-By Media wrong! Democrat senators wrong! Ben Sasse wrong! And Trump doesn’t do this accidentally. It’s not like he’s lucky and stumbles into this stuff. This is Trump’s strategy, and it’s all related to the pacing of how he originally or initially, eventually, I should say, gets to his real thoughts on any issue.  "

Great to have you.CALLER: Hey, Rush. Mega dittos from a lifelong listener. I’ve been listening to you for 30 years. I just want to thank you for everything you do for the country and especially your leukemia-and-lymphoma-a-thon that you do once a year. It’s fantastic. It means a lot to me.RUSH: Thank you, sir.CALLER: My question is, what do you think is going on with the Mueller probe? ‘Cause it’s sure gotten quiet.RUSH: Well, it’s an interesting question. What’s going on with the Mueller probe? The latest I’ve heard of the Mueller probe, the story actually has a sentence in it (paraphrased), “The special counsel’s office of Robert Mueller III, Esquire, most honest man in Washington, is shedding prosecutors.” Shedding prosecutors! Now, when your cat or dog sheds, it means they’re losing hair. Mueller is losing prosecutors. Meaning the job’s almost done.They’re moving away. They’re going off to other things. There’s less and less for his team of Trump haters to do. I’ll just repeat what I said at the very opening of the program. I don’t think this tax story would have run today if Mueller were still hot on the trail and had something, and if the Ford story weren’t beginning to unravel. The New York Times story wouldn’t have run. When I saw on Drudge this massive New York Times story, my first reaction…Remember, folks, I am a student of the media and the left, and nothing happens by accident. The Times didn’t just finish the story by deadline last night, thereby making it able to be published. They’ve been holding it! They’ve been working on it for a year. They’ve been coordinating with the Showtime network. They’ve been producing a documentary for the past year documenting how the Times found it, how they reported it, how they prepped it, how they wrote it.The fact that this thing was released and published last night for today? The first reaction I had was, “The Kavanaugh thing must really be unraveling, ’cause it’s time now to turn attention to Trump from a new angle,” and it’s not really new. It’s taxes. The latest news… Correct me on this, Mr. Snerdley, if you’ve seen something more recent. But the last story I saw on this is that Mueller… (chuckling) I don’t know what to believe anymore.Mueller is showing various people Roger Stone emails and texts and asking them what they know about it. We’re down now to Roger Stone in an investigation that started with everybody thinking Trump cheated with Russia and that Mueller was the guy that was gonna find it — and when we got Trump’s tax returns (impression), “We were gonna see that it’s Putin that enabled Trump to hold on to his money and get more of it. Trump’s wealth is directly tied to illicit activity with Russia.”Well, there isn’t any Russian anything in the New York Times story. So we’re getting down to the nitty-gritty here. You know, ethics say that a special counsel should not write and release a report within this close proximity to an election because of the impact that it would have — and they, of course, are unbiased and totally objective in the Justice Department and they’re not about affecting the outcome of elections. Ha-ha-ha-ha.Which is all they’ve been trying to do for two years. I wouldn’t be surprised if they release a report, you know, a couple days before the election which excoriates Trump for irresponsibility, excoriates him for a bad attitude, excoriates him for having really, really shady friends and all that but doesn’t accuse him of anything.If it’s not supposed to happen before the election, that’s when it probably will happen, is the way these people operate. But maybe it won’t. Outside of that, I’m like everybody else. I don’t know what Mueller has. I don’t know what he’s gonna reveal. I don’t know what he’s gonna report. Zip, zero, nada. All I know is that the Drive-By Media decided to try to make something else a bigger story today than the Kavanaugh story.  "

I’m glad you waited. Your turn. Great to have you here.CALLER: Thank you. God bless you, Rush. It’s an honor to talk to you.RUSH: Thank you so much.CALLER: I have a comment and then something personal to share.RUSH: Okay.CALLER: I’ve listened and watched what I can of these hearings. I sit and can’t help but think, “What if he would have appointed a woman? What would they have come up with then?”RUSH: Trump almost did. Her name is Amy Coney Barrett —CALLER: Mmm-hmm.RUSH: — and she will be next, theoretically. (sigh) It was a toss-up. But it was decided to go to Kavanaugh, because they thought it would be easier with Kavanaugh, with his record, and that the Democrats would be loaded for bear against a woman. Because Amy Coney Barrett, when she did her confirmation hearings for her current position on the court, Dianne Feinstein said to her, “The dogma lives loudly in you, isn’t it?” Meaning, “Your Catholic religion, your Catholicism is really deep in you, the dogma,” because Amy Coney Barrett is openly pro-life.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: They would have destroyed her just like they’re destroying Kavanaugh. They would have found a different angle to take, but make no mistake about it. They would not have gone easy. That’s… See, that would have pointed out the hypocrisy. Hang on the break here coming up, Susie. We’ll get to you right after the break, but that’s the hypocrisy. They would have destroyed this woman, any woman!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. We go back to Susie in West Virginia. Thank you for waiting during the break. I’ll just tell you, if Trump had picked a woman or when he does pick a woman, they will destroy her no matter what. We’re in the midst here of women must be believed and women can’t be challenged and women this and women that. They’ll destroy a conservative judicial nominee if Trump picks one. You watch. It’ll happen.CALLER: My other part I wanted to share is I have been raped twice in my life —RUSH: Oh, my God.CALLER: — and as I listened to this woman, I agree with Trump. I’m going, “Where? When?” You remember those things. What bothers me the most is to see the viciousness of what they’re doing to this man’s character. To, me they are raising his character. They are being violent. What bothers me… Part of me thinks something happened to her. Some people have felt that something happened in her past. But in taking and accusing —RUSH: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Can I stop you for a second there?CALLER: Yes.RUSH: Because you’ve just said that you have, I mean, shockingly, frightening experience with this.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: Could you tell me why you think that — and a lot of people say, “Oh, I think something definitely happened to her. Probably may not have been Kavanaugh, but something happened.” Why do you think happened to her?CALLER: Well, I do think… Just listening to some people and thinking, “Well, you know, given the benefit of the doubt that something did/could have.” But what she’s doing is accusing the wrong person and letting the person that actually did it to her get off scot-free.RUSH: Yeah. See, that’s the thick here with me. If something actually happened to her, then whoever did it is gotta be laughing all the way to wherever he’s headed.CALLER: Exactly.RUSH: Well, I’m sorry. I have a problem with this line of thinking. “Something happened to her, obviously, but it may not have been Kavanaugh.”CALLER: Well, I’m not saying I totally agree with it but I’m going the benefit of what people say, you know, because how (unintelligible) something stuck. But if —RUSH: People say that because they want to be seen acknowledging her as believable or credible so they don’t get ripped.CALLER: I don’t believe her. I do not believe her. Accusing him, I do not believe her one bit, because she doesn’t say where it happened. She can’t remember the house. She can’t remember this and that. I remember things (voice breaking) with both of them.RUSH: What about the business that some of these experiences are so, so, so demeaning, shocking, violent that people, some victims don’t want to remember and don’t? I mean, they suppress it. Do you, having had this happen, can you spell to that? ‘Cause there are a lot of people who, I’m told, have horrible things happen to them and they do suppress the memories, and sometimes they’re forced into therapy to bring those memories out because if they don’t, they’re never gonna get past it.CALLER: Right. Well, the second, I ended up pregnant and my foster mother took me to have an abortion at four months. Now, I can’t give you the date, but I can give you the time that it happened because it was near my homecoming, was a majorette, and it was around the end of September of 1974. Now, the date, the very day, I can’t give him that.RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: But there’s things that will trigger it. If you can’t remember that date, there are things near that’s happened around that that will. You can say, “Yeah, this is what was going on at this time, and this is when this happened.”RUSH: Yeah. I… (sigh) You try to put yourself in similar circumstances. I’ve never been accosted that way. I’ve had upsetting things happen — we all have — and I’ve tried to think independently. None of them anywhere approaching yours; don’t misunderstand. I’m trying to think, what, 36 years ago? “Okay, where was I and what things that happened?” Once I know where I was, once I’m able to place where I was — either within a given month or week or even year — then my memory starts telling me within a certain date range that things happened.In my case, the more upsetting they were, the more vivid the memory, because the event was a formative one, for either good or bad. But I do remember specifics. Now, I couldn’t take you to the exact house where one of these events to me happened while having dinner. I know that it was in Sacramento. I couldn’t tell you where the house was today if my life depended on it.But I could tell you the guy and his girlfriend and the layout of the kitchen and all. I could do that. But where it was, I couldn’t. But rape victims and sexual abuse victims, it depends on the victim. Some of them have vivid recall of every detail like this and some don’t. But her date range and descriptions of the house and the placement of people there who all deny it, and the timing of all of it?If you put this whole package together, it just (chuckles) and the reason for it (to keep a conservative off the Supreme Court)? I just don’t think any of this is spontaneous happenstance. I don’t think Feinstein just received a letter she didn’t know was coming. I just don’t believe it. Can’t prove it. Just don’t believe it. I don’t believe she’s minding her own business one day and she gets a letter from a constituent who said, “I don’t want to be known, I don’t want to be named, and I don’t want this taken any further.”Well, that… (chuckles) It just doesn’t make any sense. Unless you put it in the proper context of what the express purpose of this is, which I happen to believe is forcing Kavanaugh to resign, to withdraw, or for Trump to withdraw. I think this is beginning to unravel because Trump and Kavanaugh have hung in — and by unravel, I mean be exposed for the phoniness that much of it is. Anyway, Susie, I’m glad you called. Thank you. Thank you very much.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/03/democrats-promise-to-deliver-revenge-for-the-psychologically-disturbed/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 3, 2018RUSH: Brian, St. Augustine, Florida. I really, really, really appreciate your waiting. Thank you.CALLER: Thanks, Rush. I just wanted to say that Kavanaugh is the scapegoat for all of the women who have been sexually assaulted but were afraid or embarrassed to report it.RUSH: Well… (sigh) You may have a point. I think you’re right in line with one of my newfound theories, and it’s actually not a newfound theory. What it is is a very late arrival on my part of being able to verbalize it. You’ve heard over the years, “Liberalism’s a mental disease,” and there are all kinds of people have said that, and I thought, “That’s too simplistic, and besides, it’s not effective. Even if it’s true, it’s not gonna be effective to say that.”But that doesn’t erase the fact that we’re dealing with some genuine, incomprehensible emotional problems on the part of these people, and I have to give credit where credit is due. It was a little blurb by Jim Geraghty at National Review that caused the explosion of brain synapses in the frontal lobe here. He said… I’m paraphrasing; I don’t have it right in front of me. But he said, “I don’t even think this is what it is.”He said, “I think psychological disorders, people with psychological disorders have become liberals in politics, that psychological disorders… People who have them, have brought their disorders into politics — and rather than just a singular thing that happened to them, they make it all about the country did it to them or an entire population did it to them,” and I think that’s exactly what liberalism is and has become, and that’s where we agree.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Folks, here is the Jim Geraghty quote from National Review. “The more time I spend covering politics, the more I’m convinced that a significant chunk of grassroots political activists aren’t really arguing about politics at all. These folks are actually grappling with personal psychological issues and projecting it onto the world of politics.”Bingo!I’ve been searching for that description for years! I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together. It’s one of the rare moments I was unable to. This is exactly right! We’re dealing with people who have suffered some kind of psychological disorder; they’ve turned to politics for the solution — or the revenge is actually what they’re looking for — and they don’t just want revenge against whoever did whatever to them.They are now demanding that every representative of the group that the individual that did something to them belongs to be made to pay a price for it. It’s what the… Well, the #MeToo, in large part, was never bipartisan. It was thought to be, said to be, but it never was. Okay, even if it was, it’s been co-opted by the Democrat Party. Look at the Occupy Wall Street movement or look at Black Lives Matter. Take any left-wing group that you want.It’s made up of people who for some reason think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody, and instead of dealing with that in their lives, they enter politics, and they demand that the Democrat Party take up their cause. The Democrat Party willingly has. The Democrat Party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups with their singular causes.Because the Democrat Party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America, that America is responsible for what happened these people! That capitalism is responsible! That the power structure, that the founding is responsible. So people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy, and then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts.And they become political movements, and then they become victims — and that, of course, allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives. And then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you. I contend to you that most people on our side have no idea how to deal with this. No idea whatsoever. So we end up in debates about (chuckles) boys who want to pretend to be girls so they can go in girls’ bathrooms, and it becomes legitimate.It’s sick in many instances. Not that specifically, but just the whole concept of what is happening here. It is a violent, bullying, intimidating movement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate, various agendas — and the target is America. The target is America, as founded. The target is American capitalism. So when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand-in for men who have abused every woman out there, he’s right.Blasey Ford will end up being supported by other women who’ve been abused. Whether she’s telling the truth or not, it doesn’t matter! Because it did happen to them. These women we don’t know that are out there watching this, it did happen to them — and by God, somebody’s gonna pay for it. In this case, it’d be Kavanaugh. That’s how they’re gonna be heard, rather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them.It’s the same thing, I think, with Black Lives Matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem. “All cops are bad. Every white cop is a racist. Every black convict is innocent.” Every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible, in unfairness, in bias, in discrimination, in racism, all of this. The Democrat Party is the organizing party, the collection agency for all of these complaints. The Democrat Party’s happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one.The Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they’ll fix it — and they never do. They never do! The rage and the anger never ends. It only gets worse because the Democrats don’t fix anything — and finally, it doesn’t even depend upon being fixed. It just means, “Somebody’s gotta pay! In this case, Kavanaugh! He’s gonna pay, whether he did it or not.”  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/03/trump-didnt-mock-ford-he-told-the-truth/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 3, 2018RUSH: So the FBI probe of Kavanaugh is expected to wrap up very soon. I asked Snerdley today, “Are you worried about this? These are the FBI. These are the people that tried to screw Trump. These are the people that ran the coup, silent coup, working with people in the DOJ.” Now, many of those FBI people are gone, like Strzok Smirk and Page, McCabe, Comey, and so on. By the way, did I see something about Comey is refusing a request to testify about something and they’re gonna have to subpoena him?I just saw a graphic on TV about that. We’re overloaded here today, folks. It’s requiring every talent I have to keep some semblance of organization, ’cause things keep popping. You get the show prepared and the show starts and half of it’s irrelevant. But we do our best each and every day to make it all make sense once the entire presentation is completed.“FBI Probe of Kavanaugh Is Expected to Wrap up Very Soon — People familiar with the process said…” This is a Wall Street Journal story. Then, after that, there are stories that say the only people that will see it are senators. McConnell said the only people that are gonna see this report are senators. Remember what the FBI report is. It doesn’t have any conclusions in it. Well, it isn’t supposed to. It’s just a series of 302s. Those are the…It’s like a 1040, 1040-ES with the IRS. A 302 is simply an interview form, and the FBI goes out and talks to people and reports what they say, might compare it with previous statements and turn it over to whoever asked for all this — in this case, the Senate Judiciary Committee — and then they form conclusions based on it. Now, when McConnell says that the only people gonna see it are senators, it’s guaranteed, therefore, to leak.And depending on what it says or what the conclusion to all this is will have a lot to say about who ultimately leaked this. McConnell continues to depending on to be adamant there’s gonna vote. He’s saying no matter what you people try to intimidate our senators, gonna work. We’re gonna have a vote on Kavanaugh. (Ostensibly on Friday.)“Lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford Say That Their Client Hasn’t Been Interviewed,” and they’re desperate. They want the FBI to interview her. Well, I’m sorry, but that’s not what this is. It says right here, “FBI probe of Kavanaugh,” and that may be one of the things that’s wrong here. But it’s not an investigation of Blasey Ford, it’s an investigation of Kavanaugh, and the FBI’s already done it six times! This is the seventh! There’s not an official investigation into her.She’s the accuser. She’s above reproach, don’t you know. This is the… We’re so out of balance here. Women — activist feminazi women — can demand all kinds of investigations into men. Men cannot require or demand investigations into women. Can you imagine if somebody tried that? I mean, women as an entire gender population of the country? Men are under investigation in this country, be it through Kavanaugh or through Trump or whoever.Now, let’s get to Trump mocking (this is TheHill.com) Christine Blasey Ford. Let me look at the audio sound bites here. Yeah, grab sound bite Nos. 5 and 6. This is what the left is really irritated about today. Last night in Southaven, Mississippi… This is a suburb of Memphis. It just barely over the Tennessee-Mississippi state line, and here is Trump. This is at another make America again rally, “Make America Great Again.”THE PRESIDENT: How’d you get home? “I don’t remember.” How’d you get there? “I don’t remember.” Where is the place? “I don’t remember.”AUDIENCE: (laughter and applause)THE PRESIDENT: How many years ago was it? “I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know! I don’t know!”AUDIENCE: (roaring applause)THE PRESIDENT: What neighborhood was it in? “I don’t know.” Where’s the house? “I don’t know.” Upstairs? Downstairs? Where was it? “I don’t know, but I had one beer. That’s the only thing I remember,” and a man’s life is in tatters. A man’s life is shattered.RUSH: Now, that is not mocking Ford. Mocking would have been to impersonate her. He didn’t do that. See, this is what’s wrong. Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have. These are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators! Her timeline should have been challenged! Her allegations should have been challenged! But they weren’t! The Democrats weren’t going to. The Democrats announced her and stated her to be credible. “She’s above and beyond reproach!“You cannot challenge her! She is the accuser!” So the Republicans, they played right along and went out and had Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions — which now turn out to be brilliant, but at the time we were all kind of curious, you know, what the purpose was. All Trump is doing is reminding everybody what she said. She doesn’t know! She doesn’t know! The people she says were there say they weren’t there!This is not mocking her, and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country. An accuser comes forward, and you can’t poke holes in obvious places? You can’t point out obvious discrepancies? You cannot reference or make mention of the differences in her story, depending on the day she’s telling it? Whatever this is, it is not mocking Christine Blasey Ford! Now, a lot of people are saying, “But this is crazy, Rush, because last week Trump was saying that she was ‘credible’ and her testimony was ‘compelling.'”I have explained this before and I’m going to explain it again. Trump always eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything, and he may not do that out of the batter’s box. I have a name for this. I call it “pacing.” Trump will initially go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the DREAMers — or in this case Dr. Blasey Ford, he’ll call her credible testimony compelling. He’ll even go so far as to say (summarized), “Yeah, if she’s telling the truth, yeah, then my nomination might be in trouble. Yeah. I’ll agree with that.”That gives him credibility. It makes people kind of cock their heads. They don’t think Trump can be that fair. I’m talking about the media and the left, the Democrats. They don’t think Trump can be that reasonable. But he does it to them every time. It gives him the credibility to later be critical and to step away. He said, “Yeah, I found her credible. I found her compelling.” Then, as we learn more, and then as events play out, Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on what is not a knee-jerk reaction.If Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally, why, there would have been hell to pay. But now he can back it up. Now there’s all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn’t make any sense. We’ve got an ex-boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and has taught people how to beat them! We have people challenging her account. We didn’t have that last week. It is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did.It gives him the credibility later to be critical and to step away. It’s a common technique he uses. He does it on everything. It’s why I’ve always told you: Don’t take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he’s caving or flipping. You people, I’m sure you remember there have been many instances (in fact, I may have fallen for one myself; that’s how I learned) that Trump will tweet something or say something it will make you look like he’s about…Before he pulled out of the Paris climate accords, what did he say? “Climate change a very serious thing, and we have to look at it, and we are looking at it, and we’ll do the right thing.” Oh, so he’s on record as being open about it! And then later on when he’s learned what he needs to learn, comes out and tells you what he thinks, really thinks. It’s a pattern. It’s a technique. It’s a Trump-developed…I don’t even know if he developed it or it’s just how he does it naturally and instinctively. But I call it “pacing.” Now, Republicans have not built up this reputation. Senate Republicans haven’t; Trump has. Trump has established that after he makes an initial statement on something, he can make fun of things — and what really irritates the left is he gets away with it. I cannot tell you how it irritates them. See, he shouldn’t have survived the Access Hollywood video.See, he shouldn’t have survived anything they’ve thrown at him. The fact that he has and has continued to prosper and the triumph, I cannot tell you how blindly insane it has made them with rage. Other Republicans have not developed the gonads to do this and pull it off. Trump has been attacked so much, we’re now… If you go back to 2015 when this campaign started… This is 2018. This is three years — in fact, it’s three years and three months. Trump gets in in June of 2015.Trump has been attacked so much, he doesn’t care anymore. It doesn’t bother him anymore, is my point. He’s now willing to take the arrows. He’s willing to take the hits for everybody else. That’s why he is needed, folks. He is willing to do what he did last night. I know. Murkowski and Collins are shuddering and cowering in the corner with the vapors. “Oh, my God. It was so horrible. It was so horrible!” It wasn’t horrible. Everything he said is true! He was not mocking her! The actress whose audio we played mocked Blasey Ford. Trump didn’t.He just simply pointed out she kept back up, she cannot corroborate. There isn’t any corroboration for what she said. Why is that not relevant? Why does that not matter? Why have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it’s gospel, and then be joined by a so-called movement called #MeToo where all women can join it. Can you imagine if there was something going on…? Can you imagine if men organized for the express purpose of destroying women?You can’t even imagine it, can you?You can’t even imagine, organized movement, the male version of #MeToo. “Well, Rush, I mean, women are not out there sexually abusing…” Well, yeah, that does happen, but that’s not the point. This is not about… Even Bannon said it. This is not just about sexual abuse. This is about raw power. This is about female rage because of things that have happened to them, the leftist women, and they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement.I’m just asking you to think. Can you ever…? Can you envision a movement of men? If such a group existed and Oprah had invited the leader on her show, he’d have been thrown off in the first 10 minutes and been ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of his life. It could not happen! Women are a minority, supposedly, even though they’re not, in numbers. But it’s so out of balance. All Trump did was say what everybody following this knows.Even the Democrats. The Democrats know there are all kinds of holes in her story. Trump doing what he’s doing provides a lot of cover for a lot of people. That’s one of the many reasons why he’s needed. Trump said, “Guilty until proven innocent. That’s very dangerous for our country.” That’s what this is. That’s what the Democrat Party is ensuring, and that’s what Democrat senators have said! That the accused has to prove he didn’t do it, that the accuser doesn’t have to corroborate anything, the accuser doesn’t have to prove anything.Where? In what civilized society is that real? Trump said, “Guilty until proven innocent. That’s very dangerous for our country. I have it myself all the time. But for me, it’s like part of the job description. Let it happen to me. It shouldn’t happen to him,” meaning Kavanaugh. Translation: “I’ll take the hits. I will take the arrows. I will stand in the way of bullets and I’ll take ’em for the team.”BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, Sarah Sanders, White House press briefing is going on. She just laid into the press, and she said exactly what I said, if I don’t mind saying so.She said Trump didn’t mock anybody last night. He simply recited the facts! And he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats. They’re to blame for this. None of this needed have happened in public. They had Blasey Ford’s email or letter way back in July. They could have done everything that’s been done to investigate her claim off record, behind the scenes, nobody knowing about it.But they didn’t do that. They waited to use it as a Hail Mary. She disputes the idea that Trump mocked. She said, “All he was doing was reciting the facts.” Here it is again. This is what the press, the media, everybody is out now ripping Trump, claiming that he mocked Christine Blasey Ford.THE PRESIDENT: How’d you get home? “I don’t remember.” How’d you get there? “I don’t remember.” Where is the place? “I don’t remember.”AUDIENCE: (laughter and applause)THE PRESIDENT: How many years ago was it? “I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know! I don’t know!”AUDIENCE: (roaring applause)THE PRESIDENT: What neighborhood was it in? “I don’t know.” Where’s the house? “I don’t know.” Upstairs? Downstairs? Where was it? “I don’t know, but I had one beer. That’s the only thing I remember,” and a man’s life is in tatters. A man’s life is shattered.RUSH: That is the point! Christine Ford is fine! Christine Ford is absolutely fine, despite how she acts! Kavanaugh’s life is shattered, ruined. His wife, his family, his past, his present, his future, destroyed! They don’t care. Sheldon Whitehouse… I’m sorry. Not Sheldon. Senator Kennedy from Louisiana? This guy is a walking sound bite. This guy’s out there; he’s saying things like (paraphrased), “Some Democrats have no soul.“Their mothers must not have breast-fed them. They don’t care who gets destroyed! Dr. Ford, her confidentiality, her family. They don’t care if Kavanaugh gets destroyed.” This is John Kennedy, Republican, U.S. senator from Louisiana. Some of my colleagues on the Democrat side are in good faith. Some I’m convinced don’t even have a soul.“Their mothers didn’t breast-feed them. They didn’t have to. They went to raw meat. They went right to raw meat. They don’t care who gets destroyed, Dr. Ford or her confidentiality, her family. They don’t care if Kavanaugh gets destroyed or his reputation.” Anyway, Senator Kennedy said, “What I am hearing from voters in Louisiana is enough is enough.” Right on cue from American greatness: “Dem[ocrat]s Risk Losing Suburban Women with Kavanaugh Attacks,” by Julie Kelly.“I am not a crier. One of my best friends teases me that Satan cries more than I do; my husband jokes about my ‘six-second cry’ when I finally shed some tears. But as I watched Brett Kavanaugh’s opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday, I cried — and for more than six seconds. I wept for him, for his crushed wife seated behind him, for his young daughters, and for his friends. I cried for our country.“It was an emotional release of sympathy, frustration and rage. I wasn’t alone. Several of my friends admitted they had the same reaction. … Mollie Hemingway mirrored the feelings of millions of women when she choked up that evening during an interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News: ‘I was sobbing when I was watching it,’ Hemingway said. ‘I heard that a lot from people as well. It was hard just to watch those clips here.’ …“The Democrats’ insistence that due process and a presumption of innocence don’t apply to men (particularly conservative white men) is a terrifying prospect for the husbands, sons, fathers, and brothers [women] love.” The abject insistence on denial of due process, denial of presumption of innocence. Trump I laid it out! She cannot confirm what she said! She has holes throughout all of it. Yet she is said to be eminently credible, and we can’t challenge it.So Trump does. I’m telling you, folks, you’d better be thankful. If Trump hadn’t done it, you wouldn’t be hearing it anywhere but here and elsewhere in conservative media — and don’t think that suburban women all across America aren’t seeing the same thing. They are. Here’s more Trump from the rally in Southaven, Mississippi, last night. Here. He took a shot at Swetnick and that lawyer, Avenatti.THE PRESIDENT: We had another woman just reported by a sleazebag lawyer named Avenatti.AUDIENCE: (booing)THE PRESIDENT: Sleazebag! Sleazebag! Well, it turned out even NBC — who’s as bad as they get. Even NBC couldn’t shield her with that interview. Did you see that interview? This woman had no clue what was going on.RUSH: Sarah Sanders is saying to the press at the briefing that every bit of evidence they’ve seen so far support’s Kavanaugh’s case (and it does).BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So Rambo Blumenthal is out there attacking Trump and his vile attack on Dr. Ford. They called him Da Nang Dick. This is the guy who lied for many years about serving with bravery and honor in Vietnam when he had never, ever, been there. He literally claimed that people were dying all around him but he and his platoon kept doing their job. He was never there! The guy’s a sicko! He’s a pathological liar! He got called out on it!The people of Connecticut still elected the guy! He used to be the attorney general of the state, now he’s a senator. I call him Rambo, Rambo Blumenthal. I wish he would just sit in his office and play with his GI Joe dolls and be quiet. But no, he’s out there claiming that Trump’s vile attack on Dr. Ford disrespected “the entire survivor community.” We have a survivor community now. A survivor of men community now. It’s on CNN, and here it is.“Even the Connecticut senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump…” The target of attacks from Trump? The guy was a flat-out liar! What do you mean, “the target of attacks from Trump”? Trump didn’t attack anybody! He told everybody who the guy is! Here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now, exactly as I said. She got a question from John Roberts, and it was all about (imitation), “Do you think that maybe the president shouldn’t have done it mocking her like that because it gets to Collins and Murkowski and it may affect the way they vote. It’s horrible. Do you think the president maybe should have not done it?”SANDERS: The president was stating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell’s report. He was stating facts that were given during Dr. Ford’s testimony. And the Senate has to make a decision based on those facts and whether or not they see Judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court. Every single word Judge Kavanaugh has said has been picked apart, every single word, second by second of his testimony has been picked apart. Yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them, that’s totally off-limits and outrageous.RUSH: Exactly right! You can’t challenge her! So Trump did, for everybody else who doesn’t have the gonads to do it! Trump did it! And, yeah, he’s providing a little shade for some of these people to hide under. And I’ll guarantee you, they may be publicly saying I wish he hadn’t done it, that’s outrageous what Trump did. They’re thanking everybody he did it privately. Somebody has to say it. It’s the freaking truth!  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/03/the-only-option-is-to-defeat-democrats-politically/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 3, 2018RUSH: Right here it is. “Three Different NBC News Stories on Kavanaugh Face Accuracy Issues — NBC News published a misleading article that claimed Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh misled the public on when he first found out about Deborah Ramirez’s accusation against him.” That story is falling apart. “NBC spread a claim in an anonymous, entirely uncorroborated letter allegedly from a woman who claimed to have heard that Kavanaugh pushed his girlfriend up against a wall in 1998.”That can’t be corroborated. “NBC also faced criticism for reporting on evidence-free social media posts from a woman who claimed to have heard rumors of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation during high school.” That can’t be corroborated! I mean, NBC has been putting things out there that nobody can find any evidence of, and now they’re backtracking and trying to cover their rear ends.This is funny. You know, Avenatti’s case… He’s the lawyer for Swetnick, who claims that Kavanaugh is running gang rapes. That has been totally nuked, and Avenatti has not produced any evidence, documentation requested by the Judiciary Committee. He hounds them all the time. So they’ve responded and they say, “Okay, well, send us what we’re looking for here. We’ll look into it.” He doesn’t send them anything. So his last communication to Mike Davis — who’s the chief lawyer for nominations of the Judiciary Committee.Avenatti sends him a letter, “Mr. Davis, stop playing games. If you’re the chief counsel, then you need to do your job. Please respond to our requests.” Davis wrote back, “Mr. Avenatti, we’ve already reviewed your client’s allegations. We focus on credible allegations. Please stop emailing me.” This whole thing has been a setup, and the Democrat Party is in on it. Various special interest groups of the left are in on this.The setup is now continuing. First off, grab sound bite 31. Lindsey Graham, in Washington today at the Atlantic Magazine Festival. (Boy, is that a festival you’d like to go to, some magazine festival? I’m sure there’s lots of wine and cheese.) The editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg is interviewing Lindsey Graham. Question: “What would you say to the president about his performance last night where he disparaged Dr. Ford?”GRAHAM: Everything he said was factual. He’s frustrated his nominee has been treated so badly —GOLDBERG: Factual! Is a personal, degrading attack —GRAHAM: Yeah, well, you know —GOLDBERG: — on someone who’s a private citizen!GRAHAM: You know, here’s what’s personally degrading: “This is what you get when you go through a trailer park with a hundred-dollar bill.”AUDIENCE: (grumbling)GRHAM: This is not the first time this has happened.GOLDBERG: That was actually a reference to something somebody said.GRAHAM: [Bill Clinton strategist] James Carville. See, most of y’all are too young to remember this. The bottom line is: I know what can happen to a woman who comes forward in a political environment.RUSH: Now, Graham’s point is that there’s a lot of young people in this audience that don’t remember the Clinton years in 1992 when James Carville was trying to destroy Paula Jones. (impression) “Eh, you never know what you’re get when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park! What you’re gonna come up with, uh, is women like this who hassle our greatest president on earth, Bill Clinton.”Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women, and Lindsey Graham was referred that. But these people in the audience didn’t know it. They thought he was talking about Ford, and that’s when he stopped and said, “Ah, ah, ah. See? That’s actually a reference to something somebody said, James Carville. Most of you all are too young to remember this.” So not only do they live in denial that it ever happened.Now they’re trying to shut down anybody who brings it up. You know, the Clinton years and what they did to women supposed to go down the memory hole. Now I have a transcript. An anti-Kavanaugh protester confronted a Republican senator, and he pushed back. This was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall. Anti-Kavanaugh protesters have flooded Capitol Hill, and they’ve been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices in Senate office building!How does that happen? But what we all know how it happens, but they’re there. One of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through Senate building walkway Monday. And she said, “Why are you supporting Kavanaugh? Why are you supporting Kavanaugh?” Cassidy did not ignore her. He took the chance to push back. He asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges.Cassidy: “Why wouldn’t I support Kavanaugh?”Protester: “Because rapists are bad.”Cassidy: “Wait a second. Everybody there said it didn’t happen; he didn’t rape anybody. So why am I gonna…?”Protester: So you’re gonna…? So you’re gonna believe Mark Judge over a woman?Cassidy: No. I’m going to believe her best friend who says it didn’t happen. She wasn’t there.Protester: Her best friend didn’t say it didn’t happen. Her best friend said she wasn’t told about it.Cassidy: Her best friend said she didn’t remember it.Protester: So you’re okay, as a doctor, to harm a woman?Cassidy: Wait a second. Are you okay as a person to go ahead and to accept a non-corroborated charge to destroy somebody’s life? If it destroyed your life, your son life or your husband — ?Protester: Silence.Cassidy: Wait a second. Answer my question. If it was your husband, your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated, would you like that?Protester: I would support a full FBI investigation.RUSH: We’re dealing with programmed robots. I’m glad Cassidy pushed back, but it’s a lost cause on the protester. The protester is not even hearing what he says. She’s got programmed answers bought and paid for by George Soros, and she hears keywords in what he says, knee-jerk reaction causing things and replies accordingly.Cassidy says, “No, no. Would you like an uncorroborated charge to destroy…?”“I wouldn’t marry somebody that was a drunk,” said the protester.“Oh, no. Wait a minute. Uncorroborated.! Answer the question. I don’t think you’re able to. Because you know it’s unfair.”Protester: “I would stand up.”Cassidy: “You know it’s unfair.”Protester: “I would fight and I would make sure women are heard. Clearly you’re okay if a rapist goes on Supreme Court.”Cassidy: “No, I’m not. But then, on the other hand, clearly you’re okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing to you.”Protester: “No, there is evidence. Look at the standard. How many people are in jail for less?”RUSH: So what this… Unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something else and helps people understand it, it’s a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you’re trying to persuade them. You can’t persuade them, just like you can’t persuade the media. You know, I’ve told the story when I was first at this — very young, wet behind the ears, naïve — and the media would want to talk to me. I thought they were very interested.I knew nobody’s ever heard of me. The radio show’s taking off. I thought they were legitimately curious and that’s how I went into early interviews, and found out that’s not at all what it is. They weren’t curious about anything. They were simply there to discredit me, make fun of me, to raise doubts. It took me longer than I want to admit to figure this out. You cannot persuade these people. You can’t change their minds in debate. It’s why I say the only option is to defeat them politically, and that’s happening.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Bill on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Great to have you, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Rush. A delight to talk to you. The problem with all of this is I don’t think anybody’s gonna be punished for it, least of all Dr. Ford, who is a serial perjurer, as you suggested earlier. But I think there is one person who ought to be in the crosshairs, and that is the president of the American Bar Association. I’m looking at an editorial that appeared in the Wall Street Journal September 29th entitled, “Another Kavanaugh Flakeout.”It talks about Robert Carlson, the ABA president, who, right after the hearings, sent a very misleading letter to the Senate suggesting that they need an FBI investigation and that there must, must, must be a delay in the confirmation. And this Robert Carlson gave this impression and it was coming as an official document of the American Bar Association, which gave its highest uncompromising positive rating of Brett Kavanaugh, but it didn’t. It turns out that this Robert Carlson, the ABA president, consulted no one there —RUSH: Right. Exactly.CALLER: — anyone and didn’t even ask the committee responsible for judicial recommendations.RUSH: That’s exactly right. I’m sorry to interrupt you, but we’re down to it on time, and I want to buttress your point. He sent a personal letter made to look like the whole ABA was reneging on their referral of Kavanaugh. You’re exactly right. You’re also right that nobody here is gonna be punished. Nobody ever is in the swamp! That’s one of the things that has people irritated. No matter what’s learned, no matter what’s exposed, nobody gets held accountable for any of it. And it’s damn frustrating for a lot of people.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/03/whats-missing-from-the-new-york-times-story-on-trumps-taxes/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 3, 2018RUSH: There’s a big lack of a reveal in the New York Times tax story on Trump. The New York Times did a yearlong investigation of Trump’s taxes. Now, I don’t know where they got the returns. It’s illegal that they have them. Obviously, somebody at the IRS doesn’t care. I mean, the left has infiltrated everything, so obviously that’s how this happened. Doesn’t matter. Once the Times has them, that’s that. But it had ’em now for a year.Note when the story runs. They ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story, right? This is something, ideally, you’d want to wait until closer to the election. You want to maybe wait a couple of weeks. But, no, they ran this thing yesterday. And now there’s a companion Showtime network documentary on this. So there’s been some collaboration (you might even say some collusion) on this. Why cover up the Kavanaugh story with this?This is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks. “What to do? What to do? We got Trump out there…” They claim he’s mocking Blasey Ford. He wasn’t mocking her. Look, I understand Republican senators saying what they’re saying. “Oh, my God. This is unacceptable. I don’t know why the president did it!” He did it for some reason. Everybody’s pointing out that Trump, just last week, was saying she was very credible.Yeah, he did, and we knew when he said that why he said it. He had to! Everybody has to. Before all this is investigated and put to bed, you can’t run out there and start ripping on her. Even if it’s deserved, even if it’s warranted, last week you could not rip on Christine Blasey Ford. There was nothing… There’s no upside to doing it, no matter if you were right. Even if she was lying through her teeth and you could demonstrate it, last week was not the time to do it.So Trump joins the chorus, “I find her compelling. I find her very credible.” Well, now she’s not so credible. (She never was.) But now she’s not so credible. There’s all kinds of holes, and Trump just pointed ’em out. All Trump did is point out the flaws in her story, which should have happened during the hearings last Thursday. But the Republicans were not gonna go there. They were not gonna challenge her because it just wasn’t smart.Especially with that voice that she was affecting, to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn’t believe her, would have not been politically useful. But in a normal congressional hearing, committee hearing, her allegations would be challenged and tested. They were not. That’s all Trump did! Trump pointed out the mistakes or the lies or the differences, the prevarications.She can’t remember where, when, who. The people she says were there say they weren’t. That’s all he did. Republican senators should have done that last week, but they couldn’t. So Trump’s given ’em cover, Trump’s providing shade for ’em, and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want. He understands that. By this time, we have to assume Trump knows what he’s doing. When he goes off-script, he doesn’t step in it. It may look like it, but he doesn’t.But that’s not the big take-away. The big take-away for me is this. One year, the New York Times has been investigating the Trumpster for 40 years. They’ve got tax returns going back who knows how long, and guess what’s not part of the story? Guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump? Guess what one word you do not see in the report?Anybody want to take a guess? (interruption) What? “Payoff,” did you say? No. That’s not the word. What one word is not in this entire New York Times story? I’ll give you a hint. It was the sole reason the left wanted to get their hands on Trump’s tax returns. (interruption) Russia! 10-4! That’s it! They wanted Trump’s tax returns because their tax returns, they said, would prove Trump colluded because his money came from Russia, because his wealth was because and due to Russian connections.That’s what everybody on the left was convinced was true, and now here’s the New York Times story. A yearlong investigation of Trump’s taxes going back more than 40 years, and they’re not able to find any Russian money? So now they didn’t find any Russian money, and I guarantee you they expected to. They’re the ones that said this! They’re the ones that said… I’m talking about everybody on MSNBC, CNN.Go back a year, go back to the 2016 campaign when everybody was hell-bent on proving that Trump was a Putin stooge. Trump was a toady. Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enabled Trump to get rich — and his tax returns would prove it, they said! So I guarantee you when the New York Times got these documents, the first thing they did was make a beeline, keyword search, however they search it, looking for “Russia,” “Russian,” Russian names. Answer? Big, fat zilch, zero, nada.So now they’re back to something else. Now they’re back to what’s always been said about Trump, that he got rich from his dad. Now they’re saying that all kinds of phony entities were created like shell corporations and other things for Trump and his siblings — not just Trump, Trump and his siblings — to hide money from the IRS. Which, of course, they say is fraud. During all of this time, 40 years, you don’t think Trump’s tax returns have been pored over with a fine-toothed comb by IRS auditors?Do you think the New York Times has found something the IRS didn’t know? I mean, after looking at Trump’s tax returns. I think no Russia means gigantic letdown, which we’re not gonna see any evidence of because they’re not gonna write that. But I’m telling you, they were so sure that that’s how they’re gonna get Trump and that’s how they’re gonna make Mueller’s investigation pay off: Get Trump’s tax returns. If you just think about, you’ll remember this.Now this big, long story in the upcoming Showtime documentary with no mention of Russia or Russians finances as part of Trump’s wealth. When they saw that it had to just devastate them. So now they have to go looking for other things in this that will supposedly knock Trump. But I’ll tell you this. Angus King, who’s a senator from Maine (he’s an independent) was telling a couple of journalists (summarized), “You know, you people… If you think that this is gonna hurt Trump, you have got to learn something.“You people on the left…” This is Angus King. He’s an independent; he goes with the Democrats. “You gotta learn something: Every time the New York Times or CNN or the Washington Post attacks Donald Trump, you just glue Trump’s supporters even tighter to him. You think that Trump supporters are gonna be talked out of supporting Trump because of the New York Times? It’s never gonna happen.”Angus King said, “This isn’t going to hurt Trump with his base. It’s not gonna cause to happen what you all want to happen. You want to separate Trump from his voters, but this isn’t gonna do it. This is gonna make them stick to him even tighter, because this because this is what they’re expecting you all to do. They’re expecting you to try to destroy him. They expect the media to be joined at the hip with the Democrat Party to take out the guy they voted for and elected.“Trump’s voters admire him. Trump’s voters celebrate him. Trump’s voters back him ’cause he’s the only person like him out there in politics today that they can support.” That’s Angus King. Only time will tell if this is gonna have some deleterious effect. But, folks, look at all the things that the media’s dredged up since the 2016 campaign that they thought was gonna be the silver bullet.Every one of these things they came up with was going to be the final nail in the coffin. The NBC Access Hollywood video.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I think this whole thing has been a deep state setup job against both Trump and Kavanaugh, that this whole Christine Blasey Ford thing is a setup. I think the whole thing is a setup, and I’m gonna tell you when I thought that, folks — and I’m not at the point where I can go into details right now.  It would not be productive.  The minute I saw Dianne Feinstein hold up that letter and talk about having got it? Nah. It just started to smell right there, ’cause I know these people, and the evidence of this is right in front of our faces.  All we need to see is the DOJ-FBI silent coup that was run against Trump on this bogus Russia collusion. Look at all of the allegations against Donald Trump that have turned out to be nothing.  Nothing can be proven, established, nothing can be made of them.  And they have been never ending, from the moment Trump got in the campaign.  The really big things like Trump colluding with Russia. Remember, that’s what finding the tax returns was all about.  I have to make this point again.  The left wanted Trump’s tax returns ’cause that was gonna be the end.  They were gonna be able to prove it! That’s why Trump wouldn’t release them, remember?  They said it would prove that Trump’s wealth comes from Russia.  And that’s why Trump is a Putin stooge, that Trump would be nothing if it weren’t for Putin and the Russians.  Trump would have gone broke long ago.But Putin and the Russians bailed him out, and that’s why Putin wanted Trump elected and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So now we get news the New York Times has had Trump’s tax returns for a year, and they’re poring through them. At the same time, Showtime network is doing a documentary on the New York Times story and reporting in Trump’s taxes.  And would you believe it? They’ve had these documents on Trump’s taxes for a year.  They ran the big story today, yesterday.  There’s not a word about Russia anywhere in the Trump tax return story, and I’ll guarantee you this.  When the New York Times got whatever they have of Trump’s tax returns, I will guarantee you the first thing they zeroed in on was trying to find evidence that Trump was doing business — shady business — with somebody or a series of people (oligarchs, don’t you know) in Russia.  I’m here to tell you that the let join that they experienced when they didn’t find Russia in there nearly destroyed them.  So they’ve been look at these things for a year now trying to find an alternate way of destroying Trump with his tax records ’cause the Russian angle bombed out.  That’s the big take-away on Trump’s taxes, to me: What isn’t there versus what they thought was going to be there.   Virtually every one of these attempts to get Trump has been concocted.  Every one of them has been the result of a created and organized strategic plan, be it the silent coup on Trump-Russia collusion, be it Comey trying to set Trump up with Comey’s being fired.  It has been, since Trump was inaugurated — even during the transition it’s been — a series of steps or efforts to get rid of Donald Trump, to overthrow the election results of 2016.  I think Christine Blasey Ford is an element of that whole movement or that whole desire.  The Democrat Party is in on it.  They are as much a part of the deep state as the FBI, DOJ people that were doing this.  And I think the objective of Christine Blasey Ford — this whole thing; not her specifically.  Look, I think she’s an activist and in on it.  But that’s neither here nor there.    "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/03/how-rachel-mitchell-quietly-blew-up-dr-fords-testimony/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 3, 2018RUSH: What is this? (interruption) You want a replay of the babe that imitated Dr. Blasey Ford? Snerdley didn’t hear it yesterday? Okay, can we grab that from the archives? I just saw the note. Can we grab that from the archives again? The actress, who I’m still not gonna name because she’s gotten in a lot of trouble with her buddies on the left for doing this, but I mean it is so spot on. We’ll get to that. We’ve got a lot of time to get to that. Greetings, and welcome, folks. Here we are revved and ready again, just as I said yesterday we would be, at the Rush Limbaugh program and the EIB Network.It’s 800-282-2882 if you want to be on the program. Got it already? Okay. Let’s do this and get it out of the way and then there’s a couple of other things I want to do to get out of the way before we get to the meat of this. I just want to point out that Christine Blasey Ford’s entire testimony was blown up by an ex-boyfriend of six years. The ex-boyfriend describes how, after he broke up with her, she continued to use his credit card, that she never once expressed a fear of flying, that she lived for a time in a 500-square-foot home, so she’s not claustrophobic.He said it didn’t have two doors, that she never once mentioned being sexually assaulted by anybody, and the big deal is that she helped people prep to take lie-detector tests. She never had a fear of flying. (cough) I’ve got a frog in my throat today, folks, and until I get rid of this I may sporadically cough out there. It’s very rude and I apologize in advance for it. She never once mentioned sexual assault. He had sent a letter and signed it.His name’s been redacted. He sent a letter to the committee. The point is, look, she’s a doctor of psychology. She knows how to manipulate lie detector tests. She’s coached people on how to do it. And, again, just to review, never mentioned assault, never mentioned by Kavanaugh, ex-boyfriend of six years, never demonstrated any kind of claustrophobia, never expressed or showed a fear of flying. In fact, they flew all around Hawaii, this boyfriend and Dr. Ford in a little prop plane, and she never expressed any problem with flying.He also says that she is a polygraph expert and she cheated on him, but that was just a bonus. She cheated on him and that was just a bonus. Now it has also been learned… (cough) I want to try to develop this later… I really hope this doesn’t mean that I’m getting a cold. You get a frog in your throat… (interruption) Red tide? You talking about the algae thing that’s…? (interruption) No, no, no, no, no. I smoke enough cigars to be immune from most things.(interruption) Oh, yeah… nicotine that provides the immunity? It really does in my case. I can prove it. Every time I’ve quit smoking I’ve gotten a perpetual never-ending cold. Hey, don’t distract me on this. Red tide. Algae. Ron DeSantis will fix that after he becomes governor. I’ve seen his TV ads. He’s gonna fix that. That’s his primary message in his campaign ad. He’s gonna fix the bad algae and the red tide out there, Ron DeSantis.I was gonna try to make the case here today, do you remember the prosecutor that the Republicans hired, Rachel Mitchell? And everybody was just disappointed as hell and panning her and say what’s going. In retrospect now with things that we have learned just in the last 24 hours, that woman was brilliant. That woman has caught Christine Ford in lies. If they’re ever needed, if it’s ever needed to expose this woman, I think people are gonna try to get through this without exposing Ford for what she is. (interruption)Yeah, yeah, yeah, I’m gonna talk about what Trump did, but Trump did not mock her last night. He made fun of her claims. He did not imitate the way she speaks. But, look, I understand Republican senators being alarmed about that, but you gotta look at it this way. Trump is simply providing them cover. Trump is giving them shade to go ahead and vote the way he… Trump said what needs to be said, but these guys aren’t gonna say it.Her timeline alone has shifted. When do you think this incident with Kavanaugh, the alleged incident happened? Because she has described it as early ’82, mid-’82, sometime in ’83, her timeline has changed based on who she’s been talking to, and that has been documented. The fact that she has lied openly now about not knowing anything about polygraphs and not helping people pass them. There’s a signatory to one of the support letters written for her, Monica McLean, retired FBI, special agent, her best friend for life, and she is named as one of the people that helped Dr. Ford pass a lie detector test in her employment application for the FBI. Monica McLean issued a statement to ABC: “I have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken at any time.”I think they’ve been caught big time, and Rachel Mitchell, if I have time… I’ve just got enough data on this right before the program began. I didn’t have time to assemble it. But the questioning that we all thought was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr. Ford to so many lies that if it ever became necessary to use them, she could be destroyed. Credibility, credibility could be destroyed. I think everybody’s gonna try to get past this or through this without any challenging of Dr. Ford because she’s elicited such sympathy.One of the ways she did that was with her speech pattern, which I am one of the only people in the media that I know have pointed out her speech pattern. Look, I’m a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist. Vocal work, voice capabilities, voice talents (cough), excuse me again… I may have gotten it out of there that time, we’ll see, are a specialty of mine.I recognize speech patterns. I am able to attach speech patterns to personality types. You can definitely do this. Well, a voice actress in Hollywood decided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr. Ford afterwards, and the Twitter universe came down on this woman mercilessly. So we have not mentioned her name. It’s out there, but I want to protect her at least here from any further assaults taking place. But here is what she posted and it is so spot on.ACTRESS: I don’t know if anybody is listening to the Dr. Blasey Ford testimony about Brett Kavanaugh, but this is how I sound. I know it’s a surprise to even me that I talk this way and I’m a doctor and a grown woman. I sound like I’m still back at that high school party. Um, I can’t help it. I just have this kind of a voice, like a baby, even though I’m a doctor, and I’m on this media circus political stage, and I have kids myself that I don’t know why I speak with vocal fry (sic), but you can listen to my testimony and hear that a grown woman sounds this way, Dr. Blasey Ford, thank you.RUSH: And that speech pattern, what does it make you think? You’re dealing with a child here, you know, the up-talking at the end of every sentence. It’s vulnerability. It’s fragility, almost, in a way, maybe even somebody nervous and traumatized and scared. And that is exactly the personality that I think she wanted to affect. And she succeeded with it. And it’s because of that that I think… No matter what is learned about her and how much she has lied, if you will, which again, Rachel Mitchell has, if necessary, could blow this woman out of the water.That’s what I had… Nobody else has put this together, by the way, that I’ve seen. I’ve just… In random show prep, you know, story here, story there, I’ve been noticing things. There’ll be a little reference to what Rachel Mitchell asked her about Subject A and her answer, then you read another story and there’s one more reference to Rachel Mitchell. And you put all these together, and it’s almost as though Rachel Mitchell knew going in that she knew a lot more about Blasey Ford than anybody has alluded to.She knew about Monica McLean. She knew about the polygraph. Everybody, “Why’s she asking this? Why are you…? This is not what this is about. This is about Kavanaugh. Why aren’t you asking her details to confirm about her story?” Instead, this prosecutor was asking all about seemingly unrelated or not really important things. So we will just have to see. Again, Monica McLean, retired FBI, and this, by the way, brings up or conjures up… FBI? Ford has a best friend in the FBI who resigned, retired in 2016?I wonder how many people working on the Trump case at the FBI trying to establish collusion that Dr. Ford and Monica McLean know. You know, what kind of possible connection here is there, maybe? So it’s fascinating, as is the letter from the ex-boyfriend. The primary reason the ex-boyfriend says he broke up with her is how she lied about using his credit card. He took her name off the credit card when they broke up, and she continued to use it.She charged about 600 bucks on it. Ford was asked directly in the hearing if she had given tips on how to pass a polygraph. She said, “Never. Never.” Rachel Mitchell: “Have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to pay a polygraph test?” “Never.” Remember when that question was asked? I do. “What the hell was this?” Now, Senator Grassley has been busy refuting claims made by Avenatti and others.Grassley is on fire, by the way. Grassley is doing such a bang-up job, as is his staff here. Grassley has sent a letter to Ford’s attorneys telling them about the ex-boyfriend seeing her coach somebody on how to pass a lie detector test and has again asked for the therapist notes and the polygraph, the audio-visual. They want to see it. Grassley and the committee want to see the notes of her meetings with her therapist and they want to see the polygraph test that Ford took.Ford’s lawyers have refused to turn any of that over. So they’re not being forthcoming with things that are crucial. Now Dianne Feinstein has made a move to seal the FBI investigation. I think they think the case is collapsing, and you know what I think evidence of the case collapsing is? This New York Times story on Trump’s taxes.That’s the first thing I thought when I saw this New York Times story. Because they’ve been sitting on this so long that Showtime has been able to prepare a TV documentary on it. So Showtime, which is owned by CBS, has been working with the New York Times on this documentary on the supposedly explosive details of Trump’s taxes. And what do we know about Trump’s taxes?Well, it’s a blockbuster story of the day. The Times reports that Trump’s father may have left him more money than anybody knew about 40 years ago and that Trump and his siblings set up shell corporations and phony “thises” and “thats” to hide the money from the IRS. There’s another blockbuster story out there today that Kavanaugh wrote a letter to his college friends that they should warn the neighbors in the Ocean City condo they were renting that they might make some noise.He wrote the letter 33 years ago. This shows that Kavanaugh was out of control in high school, going to loud parties, creating loud parties, loud noise. He was so thoughtful, he sent neighbors a letter warning them that there might be some raucous noise coming from the condo when they threw the party. That’s a blockbuster story out there. Monica McLean left the FBI and the DOJ after 24 years of employment there as soon as Trump won the election, 2016.The only thing Ford has turned over from the polygraph is two questions. Remember when that came up, the polygraph exam? I asked her two questions. Two questions? What polygraph test, what lie detector test only asks two questions? That’s all the committee has been given. Now, Blasey has been citing the polygraph has proof that she’s telling the truth. And now here comes this ex-boyfriend saying that…The problem with the ex-boyfriend is he’s a boy, and that gives Democrat senators the right to totally disbelieve him. Men, of course, lie all the time about things. Women never do, as it goes.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination or to have Trump pull it.Now that that hasn’t happened this case is beginning to collapse. You see stories all over the media about how all this so-called evidence just isn’t there. They thought that the mere allegation would be enough, that Kavanaugh would not sit there and let his life be destroyed by this. They thought Trump wouldn’t sit there and let his nominee be destroyed like that because they think Trump’s ego is such that he will not be allowed to be to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn’t do.So they thought there would be a giant cave on this, and there hasn’t been. So now it is panic and scramble time. So they zero in on Flake, and Trump couldn’t hold it in anymore. Last night at the rally, he just unloads on the fact that Christine Ford doesn’t have any evidence, is changing her story. And the media is all over the place now saying (paraphrased), “Well, you know, this just may have screwed it. Murkowski and Collins, they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh.”Okay. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I told you some things yesterday that I’m sure people have forgotten. But they’re no different today than they were yesterday. Democrat senators in red states are in heap big reelection trouble. In fact, there was news yesterday — polling data, late polling data — that we may be looking at a red wave in the Senate, not a blue wave. In North Dakota, which Trump carried by 36 points, Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo-doo after having come out against Kavanaugh.“The latest poll taken after the Democrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before the committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer, the Republican opponent to Heitkamp, has opened a 10-point lead over Heitkamp! Joe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous. Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing to her challenger, Josh Hawley. Joe Manchin, West Virginia…” They’ve all been hoping that McConnell would wimp out or that some Republican senators would wimp out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to.In other words, these four — Donnelly, McCaskill, Manchin, and Heitkamp — have all been hoping that Collins caves, that maybe even McConnell would cave and that Murkowski would cave and will Flake will continue to flake and cave. But in their states, there’s hell to pay. In their states, people want Kavanaugh confirmed. In fact, in North Dakota, voters back Kavanaugh 60 to 27.Polling has begun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp. So my point is, it may not matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski. But if they actually don’t vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night? Well, that would be embarrassing for them. Now, since Trump’s on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr. Ford, I want to share something with you I found today at Power Line.
Scott Johnson, one of the contributors at Power Line, writes, “A reader [of theirs] however, writes to note the changes in Ford’s timeline. The reader calls himself an ‘engineer with a specialty in data visualization.’ He made the graphic” he created a chart, in essence, “drawing on public sources – ‘mainly the Washington Post and public legal documents.'” It is the dates, the varying dates, the different dates of the sordid event Dr. Blasey says happened — and the dates float!She’s not even consistent with the day. So the timeline of her story doesn’t even add up. “The reader notes ‘the sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the Story Date column (first column). For six years her story was ‘mid ’80s.” ‘Why,’ he asks, ‘the sudden change within a few weeks after 7-6-2018? Answer: Dr. Ford came into the Democrat orbits of Rep. Anna Eshoo (Democrat), Senator Dianne Feinstein (Democrat), their staffs and highly partisan Dem lawyer Debra Katz (recommended by Feinstein).“Right after that, Dr. Ford changed her story two more times in two months — growing more specific [after she began consulting with Democrat activists] — as they conspired to damage Kavanaugh.” So the chart here — and I know charts are difficult to convey, but this is a text chart. There is some bars in this thing. But it is entitled, “Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s Ever-Changing Story — Multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incident.” In the therapist notes, the incident is said to have occurred in the mid-1980s when she in couples therapy.The therapist notes from when she was in individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid-eighties, but the late eighties! In her text message to the Washington Post, she’s back to saying that it happened in the mid-eighties. In her letter to Dianne Feinstein, she said the incident happened in the early eighties! In the handwritten statement at the time she took her polygraph, “high school summer in the eighties” and “early” is crossed out.Early eighties could have been ’80, ’81. At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, she said it happened in the summer of 1982. She had never said that before. She had said mid-eighties, late eighties, mud eighties, early eighties, high school summer, early eighties. She specified summer 1982. These changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists, the staff of Feinstein and Anna Eshoo and Debra Katz, the lawyer.“Christine Blasey Ford’s Changing Kavanaugh Assault Story Leaves Her Short on Credibility — Put aside Christine Blasey Ford’s emotional performance. Her testimony revealed her as a witness whose memories change at her convenience. … First, Ford’s testimony that the assault occurred in the summer of 1982, when just 15, conflicted with both her therapist’s notes and the text message Ford sent to the Washington Post.”BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: “First, Ford’s testimony that the assault occurred in the summer of 1982, when just 15, conflicted with both her therapist’s notes and the text message Ford sent to the Washington Post. According to reporter Emma Brown, Ford claimed she had been assaulted in the mid-1980s; and the therapist’s notes stated Ford had been the victim of an attempted rape in her late teens.” Well, she was 15 in 1982, 1983 somewhere along there, but the “attempted rape happened in her late teens.“But by that time, Kavanaugh was attending Yale, so Ford’s recasting of the attack to the summer of 1982 is suspect.” In other words, this event, if it happened, she had all kinds of potential dates where it could have happened — and every time she reported this, the date changed. It became “the summer of ’82” only after she began to consult with Feinstein’s staff and Anna Eshoo’s staff and her lawyer, Debra Katz.I’m convinced that they decided to claim the date was ’82 so as to coincide with where Kavanaugh might have been able to be placed. “She still — and this is fundamentally crucial. She still cannot specify when. Trump was right. She can’t specify where — meaning, the house. She can’t specify the time of day. She doesn’t remember how she got home. The floor plan of the house also changes. She ran out of a small bathroom to a bathroom in one instance of the story.In another instance, she they ran out of the small bathroom into a living room, family room, combo room. So much of her story is fluid, and the Democrats know everything that I’m telling you. It doesn’t matter, because this is purely political, it’s not about sexual abuse. It’s political, and therefore she’s gonna be believed, Did anybody find it strange, the minute she makes the allegation here comes a movie or a video of Hollywood actresses and all these Democrat Senators, “I believe her.”Based on what? Well, I’ll tell you: Based on the necessity of believing her, because this whole thing was strategized. This is what the left does. Meanwhile, the country is being asked to feel so bad and so sorry for a woman who was so mistreated. Don’t forget, even the number of witnesses that she claims were there changes — and the sexual makeup, the gender makeup. Some cases five people there. Some cases three people plus her.In one instance, it’s all guys. In one instance, it’s all guys and one woman her best friend. But no matter. Everybody she places there denies being there, ’cause she doesn’t know when it was! I really think having now looked at Rachel Mitchell’s questions in the aftermath of what we have learned that I think Mitchell was brilliant. I think Rachel Mitchell…If it ever comes to this, her questions and the answers from Ford are gonna be able to be assembled and compared with what Ford has said and the Democrats have said, and I think she… If it comes to this, she could be exposed as a serial perjurer. That was what Rachel Mitchell was after. Nobody saw it at the time. Everybody thought Republicans were making a big mistake here rather than challenging her honesty and veracity while she was testifying.  "

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/02/democrats-the-party-of-psychological-disorders/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 2, 2018RUSH: Anybody ever heard the name Christine…? What’s her name? Christine Fair? Dr. Carol Christine Fair? Anybody heard of her? Let me tell you who she is. She is an associate professor in the security studies program at Georgetown. Georgetown’s not an insignificant university. Georgetown is the… In fact, Georgetown University was the nucleus, the center of the movement to give women as much contraceptive help as possible, birth control pills as far as the eye could see. Georgetown was the center in that movement. And this babe… Well, speaking loosely here. This woman, Dr. Carol Christine Fair, is an associate professor in the Security Studies Program. I don’t know what securities studies is.You would think that it’s like national security, but it could be home security. I don’t know what it is. Women’s studies, deep-diving studies, any number of other studies. Well, Dr. Carol Christine Fair, an associate professor in the Security Studies Program at Georgetown, said white GOP Senators deserve to die miserable deaths ‘while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps.’ She went on a profanity-laced tirade against Kavanaugh, calling him a ‘rapist’ and ‘perjurer.’ This is a professor at Georgetown. She described the Republican Party as an ‘f—ing death cult’ and ‘filthy swine.’She tweeted, “Look at thus (sic) chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist’s arrogated entitlement. All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps. Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes.” That’s a professor. That is a tenured and highly respected professor at Georgetown University. “All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps. Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine?”Is there any embarrassment over Dr. Christine? No. But I’m telling you this is why I have ascribed the theory that what liberalism and the American left has become is essentially a party of psychological disorders infiltrating our political system and demanding that their psychological disorders be treated as serious policy disagreements and that they be given policies they demand. We’re dealing with people that have psychological disorders who’ve become the base of the Democrat Party.All of them are victims. It’s somebody else’s fault. “Dr. Fair said this in response to Senator Lindsey Graham blasting Democrats for the biggest political sham he’s ever seen.” After this tweet, she is still employed at Georgetown, where probably she was applauded by several others there who share other psychological disorders. Now, Twitter has removed her account after she tweeted that white men should be castrated and fed to pigs. But she is still at Georgetown. And she probably will be back on Twitter after a limited amount of time.Folks, if you are a woman and if you are the mother of sons, and, if, in this climate, you vote for any Democrats, you need to really think about that, because you are more than likely voting to put your sons in lifelong political peril. If you’re married to a man in any job or income bracket and you vote for any Democrat, you are living on borrowed time. Your whole life can blow up at any second. The Democrat Party, the American left can come along at any time and take out your man, if they need to.If you have brothers and vote for any Democrat, you are sentencing your brothers to blindsiding potential ruination. Even your father in his 70s or 80s is not immune to having his life wiped out of the existence with one Drive-By news story. If you have any treasured men in your life, a high school or college friend, a mentor, a neighbor, a business partner, a pastor, a boss, a coach. If you have any men in your life that you love, respect, and like, and you vote for any Democrat, you are putting them all at risk.They are one Drive-By Media story or one moment of attention away from potential destruction, one accusation, regardless how uncorroborated or ridiculous it may be. I know that there are angry women like Christine Fair out there, and I know that there are angry women like Dr. Ford and others. But they are not the sample size of American women. If you’re a standard-issue, ordinary, normal, loving female living in America and you vote for any Democrat, you really need to stop and think about it.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/02/swetnicks-story-unravels-on-nbc/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 2, 2018RUSH: Julie Swetnick was the babe that was dragged out of wherever by Democrat activist/lawyer Michael Avenatti. Swetnick is the woman who claimed that Kavanaugh and his buddy, Mark Judge, gave women booze and pills to essentially incapacitate them while setting up gang “rape trains” for their buddies in school.She has under withering investigation said (paraphrasing), “Well, (sputtering) I — I don’t know that Kavanaugh ever… I — I — I… He was in the vicinity. It’s very, very coincidental if he didn’t do it.” But she’s backing off of it. NBC News, Kate Snow was very depressed, very disappointed. They can’t corroborate anything she said! They’re trying as hard as they can! They can’t find any evidence that what she’s saying is true, Swetnick.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: NBC News has had to admit that they are unable to independently corroborate the claims of Julie Swetnick, unable to independently corroborate Swetnick’s claims and has not spoken with anybody who says they saw Swetnick at parties with Kavanaugh! They can’t find anybody that can place her there!But she says she was at 10 parties where Kavanaugh and his buddies were running rape trains, gang rape trains. They can’t find anybody who saw Swetnick. Swetnick was a college student when Kavanaugh and his buddies were high school students! Everybody’s asking, “What’s a college student, female, hanging around at a high school party for — and why keep going back to gang rapes, if that’s what’s happening at these parties?” You know what her lawyer said to that? Her lawyer said that she was doing research!Yeah. Julie Swetnick kept going to these gang rape parties to gather evidence, to do research. But NBC — and believe me, they’re lookin’. NBC News can’t find anybody who says they saw Swetnick at parties with Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh has said he doesn’t know Swetnick and has called her claims a farce. “Ex-Boyfriend Says Swetnick Threatened to Kill His Unborn Baby, ‘Was Exaggerating Everything.‘” Look, Julie Swetnick isn’t credible, just like Christine Ford isn’t credible. I don’t mean to insult anybody here, but we’ve been through it a thousand times.Ford? Nobody she says was there says they were. She doesn’t know where or when. She doesn’t what she said afterwards and how she got home. She doesn’t know anything, other than Kavanaugh did it. She has no credibility and neither does Swetnick. So Swetnick isn’t credible. Ford isn’t either. Feinstein is not credible! The Democrat Party is not credible. The media is not credible. There is no credibility on the allegation side of this entire Kavanaugh story.Last night on Laura Ingraham’s show on Fox News, “Julie Swetnick’s ex-boyfriend, Richard Vinneccy, details why the third Kavanaugh accuser is unreliable. Vinneccy says Swetnick never mentioned having been sexually assaulted” to him. “The ex-boyfriend of Julie Swetnick, the third woman to make uncorroborated, lurid allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, told Fox News exclusively on Monday that she had threatened to kill his unborn child and at times even bizarrely asked him to hit her.“‘Right after I broke up with her, she basically called me many times and at one point she basically said, ‘You will never, ever see your unborn child alive,’ Richard Vinneccy said on The Ingraham Angle. According to Vinneccy, Swetnick told him at the time, ‘I’m just going to go over there and kill you guys.’ Swetnick is represented by … Michael Avenatti. He did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment on Vinneccy’s allegation, but in an interview on CNN Monday night, he cast doubt on Vinneccy’s credibility and characterized him as an estranged ex-boyfriend.”Again, “NBC: We Can’t Corroborate Any of the Claims Made by Julie Swetnick, Also Her Claims Have Shifted.” Swetnick said she saw boys “congregating outside rooms,” but, quote, “I didn’t know what was occurring.” Wait a minute! You started out saying there were gang rapes going on in there, and now you’re saying, “I don’t know?” And she says that she never saw Kavanaugh in the room, but he was outside, she’s sure, and that’s not a coincidence.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Julie Swetnick: “I cannot specifically say that Kavanaugh was one of the ones who assaulted me, but before this happened to me at the party, I saw him there. If Brett Kavanaugh was one of those people that did this to me, there is no way in the world…” If? Wait a minute! I thought he was. I thought he was running the show here. Now she can’t place him there? Julie Swetnick.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I’ve got some Julie Swetnick sound bites. I want to share ’em with you. They are sound bites from an MSNBC interview. Kate Snow is the senior national correspondent for NBC News. She used to be with CNN. She interviewed Swetnick. I’m gonna set this up again by reminding you of a few things, which you’re going to hear, which will then more easily help you to remember that you heard it.You’ve been told, and then you’ll hear it for yourself, and that way it will remain with you. She is taking back that Kavanaugh organized gang-rape trains at these 10 high school parties she attended while a college student. Let me just tell you, as a former high school student who went to parties, if a college babe had shown up, it would have been nirvana. I’m just telling you. If a college babe had shown up? Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! If a college guy had shown up, we would have all known the guy’s striking out with college girls and is showing up to a high school party trying to impress the high school girls.But Swetnick showing up at these high school parties, claiming that Kavanaugh and a friend of his were drugging and liquoring up women to get them compliant so as to be able to pull off gang-rape trains. You’ll hear her pull back (summarized), “Well, uhhh, I can’t say specifically that Kavanaugh was one of the ones who assaulted me, but before this happened to me at that party I saw him there. He was there! If Kavanaugh was one of those people that did this to me, there’s no way in the world he should go on the court.” But she can’t place him there other than say it’s coincidental.So here we go with Kate Snow. The first question on our sound bite roster: “Can you tell me what happened as much as you’re comfortable saying?”SWETNICK: (haltingly) I was at a party, and I remember that I started not to feel very well. And they went I know I was shoved into a room and I’m having my clothes torn different directions. I was touched everywhere. Uh, I was physically assaulted in every way you can possibly physically assault a woman. It was horrible. I had no way to fend them off.SNOW: You know what I’m gonna ask:Everyone is wondering if one of those people was Brett Kavanaugh.SWETNICK: I cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me.RUSH: What? What? Well, that’s not what the original claim was! Your lawyer puts this last-minute claim out there. “I can’t specifically…” NBC is starting to get deflated already. They think they’ve got the gold mine of interviews. They’ve got the get of gets. They’ve got Julie Swetnick. The problem is her lawyer didn’t properly vet her, because her lawyer didn’t think with the media, it’d be necessary. The media would accept whatever he tells them ’cause the media wants to get Kavanaugh too. NBC, I don’t know if they’re really vetting her or just trying to get confirmation here to add to what they want to do.So Kate Snow then says, “Did you see Brett Kavanaugh spiking the punch? Did you see him putting grain alcohol in the punch?”SWETNICK: I saw him giving red Solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame, and there was grain punch at those parties. And I would not take one of those glasses from Mark Kavanaugh — Brett Kavanaugh. Excuse me. I saw him around the punch containers. I don’t know what he did, but I saw him buy them. Yes.RUSH: Well, now, what…? (laughing) You see what’s happening? First, he set up the gang rape trains. He was responsible for drugging and alcoholing, liquoring up the women. Now, “Oh, no, I can’t say he assaulted me.” She apparently was assaulted in any which way you can imagine, but she can’t name him, and then when it… (paraphrased exchange) “Did you see him spike the punch with grain alcohol?” (laughing) “Well, I saw him have a lot of red Solo cups. I wouldn’t take a red Solo Cup from Brett Kavanaugh no matter what you gave me!”Now we’ve got the fear of the red Solo Cup. How do we know it was a Solo Cup? There’s a lot of different manufacturers of cups, including Playtex. How do we know that it was a Solo Cup? Solo is being sullied here, that their cups are being used in the abuse of women. Then NBC admits they cannot locate two of her witnesses! One of the witnesses she names says he never heard of her, and the fourth witness that she named is dead.SNOW: We haven’t heard from those friends. So I’m asking, you know (sputters), are there people —SWETNICK: Yes.SNOW: — alive today —SWETNICK: Yes. I ha– I have — I — I —SNOW: — who would say, “Yes, I went to those parties with Julie”?SWETNICK: I have — Yes. There are people that know about those parties.SNOW: (dramatic voiceover) This morning, Swetnick provided four names of friends she says went to the parties with her. … One of them said he does not recall a Julie Swetnick. Another of the friends she named is deceased. We’ve reached out to the other two and haven’t heard back.RUSH: “Ssssssssssssss” is the sound of air coming out of a balloon or any other inflatable object. Next, we go to Swetnick’s former boyfriend, who was on The Ingraham Angle last night on the Fox News Channel. This is Richard Venneccy (is the pronunciation). The question: “You claim that Ms. Swetnick threatened you after you broke up with her. What types of threats are you alleging?”VENNECCY: Right after I broke up with her she basically called me many times, and at one point she basically say, “You’ll never, ever see your unborn child alive, and I just gonna go over there and kill you guys.”INGRAHAM: She said she was gonna kill you?VENNECCY: Yes.RUSH: Right. After she’d dealt with the unborn baby. She was gonna do that first. “You’ll never, ever see your unborn child alive…” Do the Democrats really want to stand behind this? Is this what they want to vouch for? They’re backing off of this. Again, I don’t mean to be redundant, but Dianne Feinstein all of a sudden this afternoon bringing up the fact, “We need to start looking again at his Roe v. Wade decision, women’s reproductive health and his assault weapons thinking on it.” Why? That’s been vetted long ago.And you didn’t have anything to opposed him there. So… Can you imagine how they feel about this? I mean, they’re fools to believe this was real in the first place. But they’re so damn desperate.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So to sum up Julie Swetnick, she’s gone from all these wild claims to now saying that Kavanaugh didn’t do it — didn’t drug her, didn’t gang rape here, didn’t set ’em up. Now she only allegedly places him nearby and has now a fear of red Solo cups. She doesn’t know if he spiked the punch with grain alcohol. She doesn’t know if he was there when she was assaulted over every bit of her body, she said. And the people that she says can confirm her story are dead or don’t know her.So tell me how is this verified? How do we corroborate Julie Swetnick? We don’t. So all the Democrats have here is “the seriousness of the charge,” but they got zip, zero, nada evidence. So Avenatti, her lawyer, has been doing damage control, and he’s out there saying that one of Swetnick’s friends told her that Kavanaugh was spiking the punch. Oh ho! Oh! We got it wrong first, Judge. It wasn’t that she saw Kavanaugh. Somebody told her that Kavanaugh was spiking the punch. She never saw it.So now the FBI has to go out and try to find this so-called witness. This is a great game the Democrats think they have going. “Oh, no, it wasn’t Kavanaugh! (stammering) She saw somebody!” That’s why this stuff has got to stop. By the way, you heard Chuck You Schumer in that sound bite floor of the Senate say, “Kavanaugh is talking to his friends at Yale.” So what? Could somebody tell me what is wrong with Kavanaugh calling people he went to school with at Yale and asking them to tell people what they knew?What is so wrong with that?There’s even a tinge of suspicion attached to that. Do you think the Democrats around scouring, either, for people who will claim to be Julie Swetnick’s buddies? Do you think the Democrats are not doing that? What is so wrong with Kavanaugh calling people he went to school with at Yale and asking them if they remember all this stuff that didn’t happen? I mean, even trying to confirm and prove your innocence — which shouldn’t even be what Kavanaugh has to do. Even that is now being accused by the Democrats.And all these other… There’s a bunch of other people, classmates at Yale, claiming that Kavanaugh has lied about his binge drinking. But there aren’t any witnesses that can show that. “In the wake of Kavanaugh’s testimony before the committee last Thursday, the media have doubled down on efforts to turn up evidence of illicit behavior in high school and college” because they’re trying to bolster Ford. They’re trying to find anything ’cause Ford doesn’t have anything, either. They’re trying to find anything to save her story, and they can’t.They can’t find anybody that can confirm what these late-arriving witnesses, Ramirez and Swetnick, are saying. And this brings me… I referenced this in the first hour of the program, “The Case Against Kavanaugh’s Collapsing,” by David French, who is a leading Never Trumper at National Review.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/02/heres-why-i-led-with-nafta-yesterday/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 2, 2018RUSH: I was just made aware of an audio sound bite that happened on PMSNBC this morning. Bill Burton, who is the former deputy Obama White House press secretary, was talking about me and Kavanaugh. They were monitoring this program. Doesn’t surprise me a bit that the Obama people are still monitoring this program. And I’m just gonna tell you. I’m not surprised. I did not predict this, but I wondered if somebody was going to notice what I did yesterday. Here’s Craig Melvin, the host, setting up Burton with the question.MELVIN: Let me ask you really quickly here, Mr. Burton, about this Washington Post article yesterday. The right has come alive with impassioned defenses of Kavanaugh in recent days. Talk show host Rush Limbaugh unleashed a torrent of criticism on the air such as his riff last week on militant feminism. “These women are angry,” Limbaugh said. “Something has happened to them in their lives, and their rage and anger, they take it out now on the country or on all men or men in “the powerful majority,” which is white Christian men and so forth.” Again, that’s a quote from Rush Limbaugh. Thoughts?BURTON: Look, I listened to some Rush Limbaugh yesterday and what I noticed about his show that he actually started with half an hour about trade before getting into the Kavanaugh stuff. And it made me feel like maybe some of the energy was gone.RUSH: I am so happy somebody noticed that. Now, if you were listening yesterday, you know why I did it. Because I told you why I did it. I told you why I opened with NAFTA. And I’ll repeat myself again. We started out by pointing out Trump had done a 30- to 45-minute ceremony announcing NAFTA in the Rose Garden, and he had all the people that had helped make it happen there, and I pointed out that this is something that the press is gonna…They’re there in attendance, but all they want to ask Trump about is Kavanaugh. They’re not asking about NAFTA. They’re gonna look past it because to them it isn’t any big deal. It’s trade. Big whoop. They’re missing it again. This is a seminal Trump campaign issue! Something that he promised, something that he committed to doing and came through and did it! He got rid of NAFTA! And I knew that if I didn’t open the program talking about it, we wouldn’t talk about it because it would be swept away by the Kavanaugh stuff.So I, as I told you yesterday, opened with it to make sure that we discussed it here and to make sure you in this audience heard the discussion and realize the importance of it. Because it’s relevant! When you start talking about election turnout in November, when you again remind people that Donald Trump happens to be the rare politician that actually keeps promises, makes them and does his best to keep them. And this is a huge one! I knew the media was gonna look past it. The media was gonna think that Trump’s probably using it to distract people from Kavanaugh because of how badly Kavanaugh’s going in their minds.That’s not at all what was going on. Trump was singing his own praises because he should have been. It’s a huge achievement. Let me tell you something else about this. Since Mr. Burton has availed me the opportunity to talk about this again, nobody is talking about this, but I’m here to tell you that gutting NAFTA, when you go inside the Beltway, when you get into the heart of the swamp, when you get into the bowels of the Washington establishment, gutting NAFTA is killing them! NAFTA.If you go back to 1991 and ’92 when NAFTA was put together, the entirety of the Washington establishment… I mean, intelligence, foreign policy, State Department, Commerce Department, marketing department, everybody was in on it. It was a huge deal. It mattered to the swamp because it was one of the first early steps toward establishing the concept of globalism. It wasn’t a direct assault on sovereignty of the United States, but it took us down that road. It established international tribunals to which the United States would be subordinate to, such as the World Trade Organization.And the Washington establishment, the exact people Trump ran against, the exact people Trump defeated, NAFTA was their baby. They conceived it. They birthed it. They raised it. They stood by it. They loved it. And it’s gone. It took them years to get NAFTA written. It took them months to get it passed. P-a-s-s-e-d. As I say, it was a serious and important step toward globalism and subordinating the United States to world tribunals, like the World Trade Organization and the International Criminal Court and this kind of thing.It was not making America great again, and it was not putting America first. NAFTA and deals like it are kinds of things that establishment types see as their purpose and their expertise. This kind of thing, these kinds of trade deals and promoting globalism and a gigantic world structure, a world order that McCain often spoke about, this is why they are there. And it’s gone. Well, I’m telling you foreign policy wonks… It did not getting any coverage ’cause Kavanaugh is dwarfing everything, but I’m here to tell you that all of these invisible swamp dwellers who live and die by such things as NAFTA are beside themselves that Trump got this done.It is a huge middle finger to them. Now, to Bill Burton it’s just trade. (Impression) “Ah, Limbaugh on his show talking about trade was not Kavanaugh because Kavanaugh’s not inspiring anybody.” How can anybody listen to this program and think that? Creating NAFTA took these people years. Trump guts it, he replaces it in months, and to add insult to injury, the Mexicans and the Canadians want to be part of it! They asked to be part of it! Their noses are not out of joint. They’re not crying and moaning about the loss of NAFTA.They want in on this new Trump deal. And that is also profoundly insulting to the swamp dwellers. They can’t see straight! This is just more hatred for Trump! This is just… It’s blinding them. And now there’s a companion story (I didn’t have a chance to get to it yesterday) that the ChiComs are getting ready to lower their trade barriers on U.S. exports because of Trump’s tariffs! It’s all working! This is something these guys never even tried to do!To straighten out the trade imbalance with the ChiComs? The swamp dwellers never even tried to do that. That was just another circumstance we had to accept in the modern world. And watch what’s gonna happen next. I’ll tell you right here and now, Iran is gonna come to the table. You watch when that happens. This is all falling into place for Trump, exactly as he said, exactly as he is making happen.I don’t know how many of you do wire transfers, but there’s a form of wire transfer called SWIFT. And if Europe goes ahead and puts in a replacement for SWIFT, Trump is liable to freeze the Iranians out of using it, meaning they’ll have trouble moving their money around. That’s why I brought it up because it is such a huge deal in so many ways. It’s a huge deal in turning the swamp upside down and inside out, and it is a huge deal for Trump, making America great again, putting America first, and following through on a deeply, deeply committed and highly touted campaign promise. Trade deals were among Trump’s top three campaign issues.It’s not an accident that 90,000 tried to get in to see Trump at Johnson City, Tennessee, after the NAFTA deal was done. The people in Washington, the Drive-By Media are totally missing this. It’s not sexy to them. It’s not a big deal. NAFTA, trade deal, yeah. Screw Trump for doing it. But they don’t have any ability to see its connection and its relevance and its importance in Trump supporters remaining revved up and loyal.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, Trump is gonna actually go up to the Senate and get them to ratify NAFTA rather than “deem” it to have been passed. That’s a trick Obama played when he couldn’t get Senate ratification. He would just deem it to have been passed and then implement it. It’s one of the tricks he played with, I think, the Iranian nuclear deal. It’s one of the reasons Trump was able to unwind that. There was the Corker loophole, everything else. But Trump’s gonna actually go up there and get this thing ratified, this new NAFTA deal. This is the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement or some such thing.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here’s Trump. We’ve got time to get this. Grab sound bite No. 28. This afternoon Trump at the White House line talking about the new NAFTA replacement agreement, the USMCA trade agreement…THE PRESIDENT: The deal we made with Canada and Mexico has gotten tremendous reviews, as you see. It’s been very well received by farmers and ranchers and industrialists and workers generally, and it’s been really something. But it’s gotten tremendous reviews, and even many of the Democrats — including Chuck Schumer — came out and said nice things. It’s nice to see a little bit of a bipartisan approach. But the big trade deal, the largest deal ever made so far in trade, I expect to top it with China or EU or something. As you know now, we’re working on China, we’re working on Japan, we’re working on EU. But these are great deals for our nation and great deals for our workers. I think the Democrats are gonna like the trade deal. They already do. A lot of them have come out and said very positive things about it. We seem to have great support for the trade bill. It covers just about everybody.RUSH: Yeah, well, a bunch of swamp dwellers are not happy. Their life’s work went up in smoke when NAFTA died.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/02/the-turtle-takes-charge/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 2, 2018RUSH: The Drive-Bys caught up with Dianne Feinstein, who made it easy to be caught up with. She wanted to be caught by the media. This was a question about the floor vote on Friday. You know, the Turtle… We have the sound bites. The Turtle! The Turtle! For the Turtle, he was on fire moments ago. Last night and just now, McConnell… In fact, let’s do those first. Grab audio sound bite… Well, let’s play No. 3. Let’s set this up. This was yesterday me on my own show…BEGIN ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: This has got to be stopped, because it’s not real! The Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go. Submit names they want the FBI to talk to? Investigations don’t work that way! The FBI follows evidence, leads, and when they don’t find anything — unlike Bob Mueller — they stop. Mueller has been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and hasn’t found any, but he’s still going, and that’s exactly what this is gonna be if somebody doesn’t stand up and stop this.Somebody on the Senate Judiciary Committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start vouching for the investigation that’s taken place. There are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh. Somebody needs to speak up for him. Somebody anybody vouch for him. Somebody needs to stand up and say, “They have been thorough, and they haven’t found anything, or he wouldn’t be where he is now, sitting on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.” But that’s not happening.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Well, but it is now. Late yesterday afternoon, Senate floor, here is the Turtle.MCCONNELL: On top of its six prior investigations of Judge Kavanaugh, Democrats demanded a supplemental investigation. If you listen carefully, Mr. President, you can practically hear the sounds of the Democrats moving the goalposts. But the goal hasn’t moved an inch. Not an inch. The goal has been the same all along. The time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a close. Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination is out of committee. We’re considering it here on the floor — and, Mr. President, we’ll be voting this week.RUSH: Late yesterday afternoon, Mitch McConnell on the floor of the Senate, and he got so much support for what he did yesterday. Amazing how that happens, isn’t it? He heard from so many people what a great thing it was, that he went out and he did it again. He went out there again, and he recycled the old Bill Clinton line to boot! Here’s McConnell from just a couple hours ago.MCCONNELL: When Judge Kavanaugh demonstrated his widely acknowledged brilliance, open-mindedness, and collegiality at his confirmation hearings, some chose a darker road. The politics of personal destruction were willfully unleashed. After the FBI shares what they’ve found, senators will have the opportunity to vote. We’ll have the opportunity to vote “no” on the politics of personal destruction. We’ll have the opportunity to vote “yes” on this fine nominee.RUSH: That doesn’t even touch what he did. He went out there and he… He didn’t call these guys out by name, but he quoted some of the most outrageous lies that Democrats have been telling, including members of the Judiciary Committee. He pointed out their hypocrisy. He pointed out their prevarications. He pointed out their straight, up-and-up lies. It was so good that it forced Chuck You Schumer to go to the floor to rebut it! Chuck You went out there and tried to make chicken salad out of what. It was incredible listening to Chuck You.(impression) “I believe Christine. She was eminently credible. Judge Kavanaugh is not.” It’s the other way around! We have a lifetime of investigation of Brett Kavanaugh, folks. There have been six, now seven FBI investigations and background checks. We have had more people looking into every nook and cranny of Brett Kavanaugh’s life, and we haven’t even begun to look at hers. We’re just assuming she’s credible because that’s the Democrats’ position on this.They can go back and they can look at anything Kavanaugh’s done, but she is off-limits for some reason. We can’t go and find out what she did at all those beach parties. We can’t go out and found out what she did when she was out there skiing and surfing and flying around. Pfft! None of that’s been done, and yet she is credible and he isn’t. And now DiFi. Drive-Bys ran into DiFi. She was going someplace up on Capitol Hill. A reporter said, “Senator Feinstein, would a floor vote Friday on Kavanaugh be too soon?”FEINSTEIN: Oh, I believe it is. I believe it’s too soon. It’s Tuesday, and, uh —RUSH: Stop the tape! It’s what everybody agreed to. Oh, by the way, you know what Flake is now saying? This guy, Flake… There’s a part of me that thinks that he was in on this from the get-go. There’s a part of me that thinks he was not scared to death when he got harassed and protested in the elevator. There’s part of me that thinks he’s in on it, ’cause he hates Trump and that’s what all this really is. All of this is aimed at people hating Trump, and Kavanaugh’s in the way. In order to get Trump, they gotta get Kavanaugh.But Flake is out there saying, “You know what? I, um… I — I — I… (sputtering) Kavanaugh’s too partisan for me. I don’t think we need that on the court.” Wait a minute! You said you were gonna vote for him Friday morning, Flake, and then you did! Flake voted for Kavanaugh after claiming he was gonna vote for him. Now he’s out saying, “He’s too partisan for me. I don’t… (sputtering) I don’t want that on the court. I don’t think we can do that.”Flake is demonstrating that his name is actually an apt description of his personality. Now here’s Feinstein. He wanted a week! He wanted a week! Everybody agreed to a week! And as predicted by me and many others, within hours of agreeing to one week the Democrats said, “That’s not long enough,” and here’s DiFi. Take this from the top again. “Senator Feinstein, would a floor vote Friday be too soon?”FEINSTEIN: Oh, I believe it is. I believe it’s too soon.RUSH: Yes, oh yes.FEINSTEIN: It’s Tuesday, and, uh we have to put all the facts together.RUSH: We have.FEINSTEIN: Uhhh, um… And this is… I guess it’s my tenth Supreme Court hearing that I sat on, and there’s never been one like this, with the issues like this.RUSH: Yes, there has.FEINSTEIN: And I don’t take it lightly. So we need to do our due diligence.RUSH: That’s not what you’re doing.FEINSTEIN: And there are other issues too. There’s reproductive choice for women.RUSH: What!FEINSTEIN: There’s presidential authority.RUSH: What!FEINSTEIN: There’s an opinion that he wrote where he said in a D.C. assault weapons case that assault weapons could not be regulated because they were in common use.RUSH: What!FEINSTEIN: So there’s things like that that need to be looked at.RUSH: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I thought the investigation was to look into what’s-her-face, Blasey Ford, maybe Ramirez, and at the outside, Swetnick. They’re all being looked into, and there’s nothing there, and so Friday? “Oh, it’s way too soon. Besides, we gotta look into reproductive health because, you know, Brett Kavanaugh wants women to die! And Brett Kavanaugh this and Brett Kavanaugh that.” That’s why I say, “Somebody has gotta stand up and stop this.” Shut it down, because it isn’t going to stop.It is never gonna be time to vote.It’s never gonna be time to end the investigation.It is never gonna be time to move this thing forward.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. So we just heard Dianne Feinstein say, “Wait a minute. We gotta go back and look at Kavanaugh’s rulings on Roe v. Wade and assault weapons.” What? What is that? You weren’t able to stop him on those during all of your exhaustive hearings, so you went for rapist and you went for ice thrower, and now you’re back to saying his decisions pose a threat? Folks, it means they’ve got nothing on all this sex stuff, if DiFi’s taking this back now to his danger represented by the decisions that he’s made, which they’ve already been through inside out.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: CNN. This happened just before the conclusion of the previous hour, I’d say 10 minutes ’til 1, CNN aired this.JOHN KING: There are some Republicans who say if Kavanaugh went down, if he was defeated or was forced to withdraw, that that would just gin up Republican turnout because the court is their Holy Grail and they would come rushing out. Here’s Rush Limbaugh saying don’t bet on it.RUSH ARCHIVE: [I]t’s very easy to sit here and say — in the midst of this all this Democrat trickery — that it’s gonna fire people up on the Republican side. “They’re gonna be so ticked off and so mad, they’re gonna show up and vote like they’ve never voted before.” But is that gonna be the attitude if he’s not sworn in? … Because if that happens, that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in — meaning he is not confirmed in the Senate — do you think it’s gonna be easy for the Republicans to say, “Did you see what happened to Kavanaugh? We’re in the majority, and we couldn’t get him confirmed! You need to come out and vote for us!” How does that work?JOHN KING: “How does that work?” Pretty good point. I do think that that’s an important point, that if Kavanaugh goes down, it will be because moderate Republicans decided to not vote for him, and that could depress turnout in some ways. That could lead to a number of people saying, “What’s the point?”RUSH: The point I was making is, and I’ve been hearing this this from a lot of people, that if Kavanaugh goes down it’s just gonna fire up troops because Republicans are seen trying to make it happen and if it goes people…. I understand the thinking, but it just flies in the face of human nature. Beyond that, why do we have to lose in order to win? I never understood that. Why do we have to lose Kavanaugh in order to gin up turnout?Depending on how it would happen, I’m not sure it would gin up turnout anyway. You got the majority party saying they couldn’t get their nominee confirmed and they go to voters say, we’re the majority and we tried we tried but we couldn’t get ’em confirmed, you need to vote for us and you need to give us more Republicans in the… There’s a disconnect there.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. Back to the phones we go. We’ll cram our next exciting phone call into our remaining moments here. Auburn, Washington. Kirk. It’s great to have you, sir. How are you?CALLER: Mega dittos, Rush. I’m doing okay.RUSH: Good, good, good.CALLER: I just wanted to talk about the two people we gotta worry about about credibility here are Ford and Kavanaugh. Okay? So Ford. You have to believe that Ford would leave her best girlfriend alone with four boys — two of which just sexually assaulted her — without attempting to get her friend out of the house or even talking to her friend about it later. Or you’ve got Kavanaugh who the U.S. government trusted so much, they trusted him with the nuclear launch codes under G. W. Bush.RUSH: Well, you know, you may have a point there. That is one of the jobs of the White House staff secretary, which Kavanaugh was for George W. Bush.CALLER: Well, Kavanaugh actually even mentioned that in the hearings.RUSH: So you… Yeah, and you cannot carry the suitcase, the football, the nuclear codes without having a very, very high clearance. That’s a good point. I had missed him saying that.CALLER: Yeah. It was almost a throwaway line. I think it was in his opening statement where he was really sticking it to ’em.RUSH: Kirk, thanks very much for that. I appreciate the call. As I say, folks, I get the impression here that the Democrats know this is kind of collapsing or falling apart on ’em. When I heard Dianne Feinstein start talking about, “We need to look again at his rulings, Roe v. Wade, reproductive freedom, and, uh, and, uh, assault weapons.” Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I thought this was about gang rape and throwing ice in a bar? I don’t think they’ve got anything here. Of all these witnesses, none of them apparently have any evidence corroborating witnesses of the sort.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I need to go back. I need to filed Sheldon Whitehouse. Here it is. No. 9. Sheldon Whitehouse. This guy’s funny. This was the Democrat who on Friday morning, the morning of the vote, held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh’s calendar and said that he had figured out how to translate it.The date in question, he figured out, could be the date where the incident Dr. Ford described happened. He sought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that Kavanaugh used on his calendar — of course, in incriminating ways toward Kavanaugh. So on Good Morning America today, George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking to Sheldon Whitehouse. He’s a Democrat from Rhode Island. He said, “Are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry? Can they finish this by Friday?”WHITEHOUSE: I think I’m satisfied. We don’t know, uh, all the details yet, but clearly if they have been given free rein to interview whomever they want then that’s a very good sign. The last thing we want is a sham investigation. I also think that there’s a fairly small universe of witnesses here and a very big FBI. So yes, I think they probably should be able to, uhh, get this done by Friday if they really, uhhh, put the effort into it.RUSH: Now, wait a minute. That just makes too much sense. That just doesn’t fit with Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate — who we have. Grab audio sound bite No. 8. This is Chuck You. He went to the floor right after the Turtle did and basically made the case that we’re nowhere near ending this FBI investigation. As the Turtle said, Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts.SCHUMER: We are looking at what Judge Kavanaugh says at age 53, not what he did at age 18. We are looking at his credibility now as a grown adult, and if you believe Dr. Ford, then Judge Kavanaugh is not telling the truth. Just yesterday, NBC News reported that either Judge Kavanaugh or people close to the judge were in communication with his Yale classmates to get them to rebut allegations by Deborah Ramirez. … It seems that Judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about Miss. Ramirez’s story.RUSH: So now it’s about Kavanaugh lying? It’s about Kavanaugh perjuring himself, and that means he’s not qualified? They’ve gotta make up their minds! First, he’s a serial gang rapist. Next, he throws ice on people at a bar. Then he’s a fall-down drunk, and now he’s a liar. They are flailing. But Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his minority leader in the Senate, Chuck You Schumer. “Yeah. I think Friday’s fine.“Yeah, there’s not too many people to talk to here! The FBI’s got a lot of people. Sure we can get this done.” That’s just too sensible. Maybe Whitehouse is out there chucking the spear here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane. But they are moving the goalposts — and yes, for delay — but they’re also trying to move the goalposts as a target where they can catch Kavanaugh in anything.There’s one more that I want to play and I’m looking for it and I just found it. I want you to go to audio sound bite No. 12. The question of who leaked Dr. Ford’s letter to Dianne Feinstein. You know, this business of leaking this letter, my memory on this is kind of fuzzy. But I remember Feinstein doing a press conference either on the floor or at the Judiciary Committee. I remember her showing the letter holding it up or talking about it.I remember… I don’t know if that was the leak, but she clearly talked about it and said that she’d had it since July and that she told us all about it that whoever had sent it didn’t want to be named and didn’t want to go forward. She didn’t know what to do with it. She’s holding this thing and saying, “I don’t know what to do with this.” It was all part of a strategy.So late yesterday afternoon on Sheppard Smith reporting on the Fox News Channel, Trace Gallagher was sitting in for Shep Smith. And he had the legal affairs correspondent for National Public Radio on there, Nina Totenberg. He said, “Mitch McConnell said Friday he thinks the Democrats won’t agree to a limited scope in the FBI investigation. Now today, they’re asking for 24 more witnesses to be interviewed! What are your thoughts on that, Ms. Totenberg?”TOTENBERG: I remember when I broke the Anita Hill story, I thought this was the closest kept secret, and I managed to f-find out about it. I later found out there were probably a hundred people in Washington who knew this secret and kept it for a very long time. You and I are not stupid people.GALLAGHER: Right!TOTENBERG: We may not be brilliant, but we’re not stupid. And once you get us on a case like that, and lots of people are talking to each other, one leads to another. And it doesn’t have to be a member of the Senate who leaked this.GALLAGHER: Yuh.TOTENBERG: It doesn’t even have to be a staffer who leaked this! It doesn’t have to be a member of her law firm! It just seeps out, and that’s what happened here.RUSH: Why didn’t I think of that? “It just seeps out,” kind of like it’s in a pressure cooker and after a while, the pressure cooker develops a seeping leak, and here comes the news of the letter. A hundred people must have known about this! A hundred people knew about Anita Hill, but they waited ’til the last minute to try that too. So she’s running interference for Dianne Feinstein. Believe me, they’re buddies.Nina Totenberg, Dianne Feinstein, NPR, the Drive-By Media, the Democrat Party, they’re buddies. So she’s doing a CYA for Feinstein here. (impression) “Well, you know, a lot of people knew about it and more people know about it and it just kind of seeps out there.” (chuckles) Somebody “seeped” it. Whether you want to change the term to “seep” from “leak,” somebody did it. It didn’t just leak out on its own. But that’s what Totenberg wants you to think happened here.  "

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/01/somebody-has-to-stand-up-to-the-democrats/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 1, 2018RUSH: So I just took a look here at the Drudge Report during the break, and what do I see? What is the lead headline on the Drudge Report? Let me read it to you: “White House Expands FBI Probe.” I said, “What the hell is that?” So I clicked on the link. Here’s what it is. (shuffling papers) Right here my formerly nicotine-stained fingers. It’s the New York Times working in tandem with NBC News. Headline: “White House Tells FBI to Interview Anyone Necessary for Kavanaugh Inquiry.”This is because of what they claim Trump said at his press conference today where he said, “No, I don’t want to limit anything.” They run a fake news story, NBC does, claiming Trump’s limiting the investigation. He says, “No, I’m not. That’s fake news.” So then they’ve got it on record, “Trump Not Limiting Investigation,” which means it can go on and on and on and on, and now they’re broadcasting everywhere: “White House Tells FBI to Interview Anyone Necessary…”Right on schedule, CNN reports that the Democrats have submitted a list of 24 people they want the FBI to talk to. This after Fox News had it earlier today that the FBI’s about to wrap up tomorrow. This is gonna have to be shut down at some point. This cannot go on. All this is, is delay, delay, delay, delay, and I’m gonna tell you what needs to happen. There is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down, and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient, is somehow incomplete.Somebody needs to be stand up and say, “It’s the exact opposite, that this is the seventh investigation.” Now, Trump has, but somebody besides him needs to make the point that this has been a thorough investigation, that every last minute jack-in-the-box that’s popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made. But there’s only so much you can do with a woman who doesn’t remember where or when whatever happened to her happened.And there’s only so much you can do when the people in the room she says were there claim they weren’t! This investigation, somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it! Somebody needs to stand up and promote it! It needs to be spoken for! This has got to be stopped! Because it’s not real. The Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go, submit names they want the FBI to talk to? Investigations don’t work that way!The FBI follows evidence, leads, and when they don’t find anything, unlike Bob Mueller, they stop! Mueller’s been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and hasn’t found any. But he’s still going. And that’s exactly what this is gonna be if somebody doesn’t stand up and stop this! Somebody on the Senate Judiciary Committee needs to stand up — or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up — and start vouching for the investigation that he says has taken place.There are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh. Somebody needs to speak up for ’em. Somebody needs to vouch for ’em. Somebody needs to stand up and say, “They have been thorough and they haven’t found anything or he wouldn’t be where he is now sitting on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals!” But that’s not happening! Somehow we’re letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here into Kavanaugh has been half-baked, lukewarm, and incompetent because of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence, no corroboration, and nothing.Yet she’s incredible; Kavanaugh’s not. Look, we had a caller earlier, “How do you stop a bully? You smack ’em in the face.” Somebody needs to stand up and tell the Democrats to shut the hell up, that they’ve gotten everything they’ve asked for in this case and there just isn’t anything there, and to go home. The idea this investigation is not thorough, is incompetent, is incomplete, or has been rigged is absolutely bogus. Now, there making things up, that Trump is gonna limit it.He did no such thing, but he sure fell for the bait. “I’m not limiting anything. I’ve told the FBI to take this wherever it takes them.” Promptly, Democrats say, “Well, here’s 24 people we want you to talk to.” What if you called the FBI and said, “There’s some people in my town here really, really screwing the pooch and I need to get something done about it and here’s the number, “would you go and talk to ’em?” (Snort!) It doesn’t work that way, does it?“But, Rush! But, Rush! This is the United States Senate. Clearly they can have the…” No. It’s not… (sigh) One other thing. You know, one of the movies I have recommended over the years that people rent if they haven’t seen and watched it is called The Lives of Others. It’s a movie about East Germany during the Cold War, essentially how the government literally spied on every citizen. The German chancellor at the time was Erich Honecker.He’s the guy that, you know, drugged the East German women, Olympic teams. Anyway, it’s a frightening movie in terms of what a gigantic police state with the ability and power to spy on people creates. Well, I have here a tweet from none other than Jane Mayer who’s done her level best to destroy Clarence Thomas, writing books about the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas thing. She tried to blame the TV show 24 for torture at Abu Ghraib and Club Gitmo! She blamed a TV show for inspiring torture in the United States military!And now instead of the lives of other others now we’re gonna weaponize college friendships. Here is the tweet: “If you knew Brett #Kavanaugh at @Yale and have any relevant information about him, please send a text to @NewYorker’s @JaneMayerNYer ’77,” ’cause she’s a Yale graduate 1977, and there’s her phone number here. “Please RT.” So she’s out soliciting from anybody who could say, “Yeah, I knew Kavanaugh!“I saw Kavanaugh. I didn’t know him but I saw Kavanaugh. He could barely stand up! Every Friday this guy would beating people up and they were going to hospital.” You saw that? “Yes, I did. I saw that.” It doesn’t need to be true. She just needs to able to say somebody somebody told her. “Oops! We got another allegation we gotta track down.” This is how this is all going, until somebody stands up and says this is it and starts vouching for the investigation that’s taken place.Isn’t that what Rosenstein and McCabe and Strzok Smirk and Mueller and all these people say? Aren’t they out there vouching for their investigation into Trump? Isn’t the media telling us every day it’s thorough and it’s continuing to look and all this sort of stuff? We’re not allowed to think that investigation’s flawed in any way. But this one? “Yeah, this is all rigged. Yeah, this? They — they — they’re ignoring things. Eh, they don’t care to find out what happened to Christine Ford. BS!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: And there’s one other thing today that has been bothering me ever since I saw it, and that is this report first on the Fox Business Channel and then Fox News that the FBI says that they’re about ready to wrap up their investigation, may have it wrapped up tomorrow. Folks, the FBI would never say this! The FBI doesn’t announce when they’re gonna end things. They don’t even tell you when they’ve started something. So what the hell is this?I mean, even if it’s true, they wouldn’t announce, “Hey, we’re gonna have this wrapped up.” They wouldn’t go to the media and say this unless… Unless it’s somebody at the FBI who want the media to say it’s over tomorrow so that the media can say the fix is in. Because the big news of the day is that Trump supposedly said that the investigation can be widened. The New York Times has it. Now here comes a story that the FBI’s finished, wrapped up tomorrow? Don’t buy it. Don’t believe it.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/01/is-crowdfunding-is-the-new-democrat-money-laundering/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 1, 2018RUSH: To Washington, D.C. Will, glad you called, sir. What’s happening?CALLER: Thank you, Rush. It’s a pleasure to be here. I wanted to get your thoughts on the ethical issues of the GoFundMe page. If you recall during Dr. Ford’s testimony, the prosecutor asked her how she was paying for the legal feels and her security. She mentioned her GoFundMe page. Those three pages have raised close to a million dollars, and there has to be some kind of ethical issue. You could just accuse somebody without any kind of corroborating evidence and then go public with that and raise, you know, that amount of money is a very, very troubling thought. There’s a lot of weird incentives there for people to make cross accusations if they think they could raise, you know, a lot of money via crowdsourcing.RUSH: Look, this is a toughie. In a strict capitalist sense, she has identified a market, and that is there are deranged lunatics who want her to be right, who hope she’s telling the truth. They want her to continue to speak intelligently. They want her lawyers to continue to strategize and screw Kavanaugh. They’re happy to pay for it. This is how they can be involved in politics beyond voting! They’re more than happy to pay.It doesn’t matter to them that she can afford her lawyers herself. It doesn’t matter to them that her lawyers are working pro bono because this is a political case so she’s identified a market. There are people that want to support her with money; so she starts the GoFundMe page. I actually think somebody sent me a note today that GoFundMe is now the new money laundering, essentially money-laundering operation for the Democrats much like the unions were, because where’s a lot of this money gonna go?A lot of this money is gonna go to these two lawyers who are then gonna be… Well they’re already involved in Democrat Party politics. So it’s a new form of fundraising that’s not called fundraising. This was made to look like people supporting a bedraggled and falsely accused, uh, uh, stressful, uh, really in bad shape woman who can barely, barely get through the hearing. (Impression of Christine Blasey Ford) “Oh, I’m terrified!” They’re happy to help. She’s not the only one using it for this. There’s a lot of Republicans, a lot of people who are using GoFundMe pages to raise money for their legal bills and other expenses.If you can convince the American people to support you, well, I mean, I don’t think there’s anything in media that could be done to stop it, and I don’t think that you can draw any conclusions about her from it in terms of whether she’s being truthful or not. If you wanted to draw a conclusion that the GoFundMe page is a way to get Democrat suckers (i.e., voters) to pay for this so that it doesn’t cost people who already have a lot of money anything, then you could try to make that point, that the Democrats are using these poor people. But, I don’t think you’re gonna be able to find a way to stop this. It’s too widely used.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/01/if-you-want-to-fire-up-voters-for-the-midterms-win-dont-lose/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 1, 2018RUSH: I want to grab a phone call, because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it. This is Jason in Muskegon, Michigan. Jason, thank you so much for waiting. I appreciate it. How you doing?CALLER: No problem. Thank you for letting me be part of the excellence.RUSH: Well, I appreciate that. You are. You are here as part of the excellence by association.CALLER: Good. Yeah, I was thinking that there’s no better way to motivate a group than by attacking them, and by attacking Kavanaugh they’re basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base who showed up in ’16 and voted Trump. Part of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination, and here we are. Democrats are gonna make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy, and they think that they can last through 2020. So they’re not really pressing the issue as hard as what Republicans could, knowing that if we want to get our guy in there, you know, we’re gonna have to show up in the midterms. They’re gonna have an adverse effect if they keep delaying this.RUSH: I’ve heard people say this. Jason here thinks that all of this is gonna backfire on the Democrats and motivate Republicans to show up and vote. Not just now, 2018, but again for Trump in 2020. Let’s go to the audio sound bites on this. Jason, thank you much. We’re gonna start here. This is Fox & Friends Weekend on Saturday morning. Rachel Campos-Duffy, who is one of the hosts, is talking to CBN political correspondent David Brody about all this. And she says, “Well, we know the Democrats have already been really energized about the midterms. I don’t know how much more energized they could get. But I’m sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week. This hearing has really fired the Republicans up.”BRODY: From my reporting and from that deplorable evangelical base, I can tell you they say the Democrats’ dirty tricks have riled them up like never before. I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it’s gonna be real tough for the Republicans. Actually, if Kavanaugh is not confirmed, that would even rile up that deplorable evangelical base — and the GOP base — I believe even more, at least for people that I’m hearing from. And so, look, I think that’s a big part of what’s going on here.RUSH: Now, look, you can’t blame David Brody for being 50% informed because I pulled back that original prediction after it had gone viral all over the Drive-By Media. That’s why it’s still prominent in people’s minds. And my retraction of that prediction has barely received any whimper because it doesn’t serve the Drive-Bys any good. When the Drive-Bys hear me predicting Republican doom, they can’t help themselves. They gotta put it all over the world in the media.“Rush Limbaugh says Republicans guaranteed to lose House if Kavanaugh not confirmed.” That prediction was based at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved. If the Republicans didn’t fight for Kavanaugh. If the Republicans just whimpered out, I predicted that would happen. But once this began to unfold, I retracted that prediction and said it could end up being the opposite here. But of course that prediction didn’t go viral. And Jason in Muskegon, I want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case. Here is one more bias on this.This is C-SPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning. Jesse Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard, Andrew Egger, about me.HOLLAND: There several conservatives including Rush Limbaugh who warn that Republicans could lose their majority if they don’t get Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court. Is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about, midterm consequences?EGGER: Arguments like the one that Limbaugh makes are a little convenient. Uh, whether or not Kavanaugh gets through, I think this whole situation has really fired up Republican voters.RUSH: Once again, somebody else… You can’t blame ’em, folks. Don’t get mad at ’em, because my original prediction was everywhere, literally all over the place. It was on Saudi TV. It was on the BBC. It was on Russian television. I think even the North Koreans had it. The little pot-bellied dictator mentioned it in his Saturday night message to the people. It was everywhere. When Rush Limbaugh says, “Republicans are gonna take it in the shorts,” everybody in the media covers it.Again, I made that prediction at a time where it looked like they were getting ready to bail on the entire nomination. When that didn’t happen, when the Democrats went a couple of steps too far and caused the Republicans to engage them in this, then I revised the prediction.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Jeff in Sarasota, Florida. Hi. Great to have you here, sir. What’s up?CALLER: Hi, Rush. Just wanted to make a suggestion or an idea. It’s kind of a fantasy. It would ever work but, you know, the left has always behaved like bullies, and they’ll do anything, and they’ve never had real pushback from our representatives on the right in Washington. So, you know, when you have no ethics and your dirty tactics pay off and they have benefits for you coupled with the fact that, you know, you never have to suffer consequences on yourself? It’s like a bully. There’s no reason to stop. When your tactics work there’s no reason to stop.RUSH: Exactly.CALLER: No bully has ever stopped until they get punched in the mouth.RUSH: Exactly.CALLER: Maybe it’s time that, you know, we don’t want to become them, but maybe let’s for a year let’s become them. Let’s show them that anything destructive they can do to other human beings, it can —RUSH: Now, wait a minute. You know, one thing. I reject this whole argument… By the way, I don’t disagree with you. I reject this argument. We don’t have to become… Did we have to become Hitler to beat Hitler? Did we have to become the emperor to beat the Japanese? No. Decency can beat these people. It’s just that decent people are not conditioned and primed for it every day. When you’re up against indecency, a lot of decent people don’t know what to do about it. But smash-mouth is right. Doing what they do? Maybe it’s time.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, folks, one other thing here. We just had a caller who said that we don’t want to become them, but it’s time to start playing this game the way they do. I made the point you don’t have to become them to beat them at this game. We didn’t have to become Hitler to win World War II. We didn’t have to become the Japanese emperor to win World War II in the Pacific Theater. That’s always been a bogus thing. “We cannot go after these people at the risk of becoming who they are.”What a crock. That’s nothing more than some limitation that’s in utter denial of people who are already found to be of a fine character. You can enter into tough battles without losing your morality and your moral character and so forth. But as an example of how we almost do it now and then but then we pull back, I call your attention last week to when Lindsey Graham unloaded on the Democrats. He unloaded on ’em, and he was a thousand percent right in every allegation he made.A couple other Republicans echoed Graham but with no passion and with no energy. They just echoed what Graham said intellectually. Now, according to our caller, that should have been the starting point! People should have been picked up on Graham’s opener and run with it, and it should have become the daily identifier of the Republican Party. They should have been throwing back, firing back right at the Democrats in their faces every hour of every day. It’s exactly what Graham did.Make that the ongoing battle. Put them on the defensive, make the media repeat these charges that Graham laid out. But instead, it was a standalone. Graham said it — it was great, it was impassioned — and that was the end of it. It was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican. So Graham’s impassioned allegation of the Democrats was followed by agreement with Jeff Flake’s demand that the FBI be allowed to do one more week of investigation, thereby nullifying Senator Graham’s point.He even went along with Flake. You can’t do these things as one-offs. If you’re gonna tell people who the Democrats are, if you’re gonna try to inform the country what’s really going on here, you have to do it every day, and you’re gonna have to do it multiple times a day. It’s gonna have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day-to-day basis. But it never does. We’ve had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republican has done a one-off like that and it’s been great and we have celebrated it, and we’ve cheered it. “Way to go!”And it dies, except for here on talk radio or maybe on Fox News. But it dies. Well, Lindsey Graham didn’t have to become them to do what he did. He just had to be honest, and he was. Lindsey Graham didn’t have to worry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people. And, by the way, did you notice not a one of them on the Democrat side cared a whit about what Graham said? None of them even got mad at it.Not a single one of them even wanted to refute it. They didn’t care. The only thing got a rise out of them was when Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter. So she turned around and asked her staff, “Did you guys leak it? No, they said they didn’t leak it, Mr. Chairman. We didn’t leak it. I just asked my staff. They said they didn’t.” Oh, what about an investigation, huh? Well, Tom Cotton says we’re gonna investigate Feinstein, and we’re gonna investigate some of these other things.That needs to be followed up on! There needs to be follow-through. But I, for one… I know investigations are necessary, but I’m getting tired of ’em ’cause all they are is further delay. How hard is it after on stand up and say, “Brett Kavanaugh is credible in his denial”? Why is that so hard? She doesn’t have any evidence! “But she made a credible witness.” How? “Well, she was really suffering and in pain.” So? None of that establishes credibility.An attitude doesn’t give us credibility. Pain and suffering doesn’t equal credibility. Democrats are always in pain and suffering over something. Now, I want to go back to my prediction. My original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this, if they don’t vote out Kavanaugh in that committee — if he doesn’t get voted on, if he’s not confirmed — the Republicans are gonna have hell to pay because voters are going to be fit to be tied with being let down again.Then the Democrats kept pulling stunts, and it became conventional wisdom. “If this keeps up, Republican voters are gonna get so ticked off! Republican women and mothers are gonna get so mad, ’cause they’ve got sons and they hate seeing what’s happening to Kavanaugh. They don’t want to imagine it happening to their own kid. They’re gonna show up in droves!” Well, I want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something.If Brett Kavanaugh… Just think about this as a hypothetical. I’m not predicting it. If Brett Kavanaugh is not sworn in early next week — if you can hypothetically envision the day where Kavanaugh is not confirmed, not sworn in, are you gonna be fit to be tied? Are you gonna be so mad that you can’t wait to vote, or are you gonna be so mad that you feel betrayed?Because if that happens, that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in — meaning he is not confirmed in the Senate — do you think it’s gonna be easy for the Republicans to say, “Did you see what happened to Kavanaugh? We’re in the majority, and we couldn’t get him confirmed! You need to come out and vote for us!” How does that work? That’s gonna be pretty difficult.Asking Republicans to come out and vote to keep the majority when Kavanaugh’s not sworn in? Everybody thinks that what voters are gonna remember in November is this, the unfairness to Kavanaugh, the dirty tricks the Democrats are playing. But stop and think. Kavanaugh is not sworn in, and the Republicans think, “Wow, we’re set up now, man!“They’re so mad out there, we’re guaranteed to get their votes. There’s gonna be a Republican wave ’cause of what happened to Kavanaugh,” and then the Republicans start campaigning, and they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kavanaugh. “Oh, you mean that he’s not there? You mean he didn’t get sworn in? You’re the majority. We know it’s very small majority, but you’re the majority, and he’s not sworn in, and you want us to…?”How does this work, folks? My point is it’s very easy to sit here and say — in the midst of this all this Democrat trickery — that it’s gonna fire people up on the Republican side. “They’re gonna be so ticked off and so mad, they’re gonna show up and vote like they’ve never voted before.” But is that gonna be the attitude if he’s not sworn in?Republicans have been asking for the majority for a long time. They keep working and voting mostly because of Trump, voters do. They keep showing up because of Trump. Trump alone will be able to make the case. Trump alone will be able to turn a Kavanaugh defeat into turnout. But Republicans in the Senate and the House? I don’t know how they do it. “Vote for us, Kavanaugh was defeated”? “Vote for us so it doesn’t happen to the next nominee”?Is that really effective? See, I just don’t… I hear too many people talking about this. It seems like every time you want a big turnout, we have to lose something so that people get fired up. I’ve been hearing this since I’ve been doing this show. Back in 1992, people called here and said, “Rush, Clinton needs to win. Then people will see how bad the Democrats really are. People will see what skunks they really are.” I’d say, “Are you kidding? We lose and then tell ourselves we’re gonna win?”We’re still doing it here with Kavanaugh. So Kavanaugh doesn’t make it. This is gonna really fire people up? Why do we have to lose to fire up the base? That doesn’t make any sense to me! It ought to be the other way around. This is another trick I think that gets played on Republicans. “Your base is gonna be really fired up if Kavanaugh doesn’t make it.” Wait a minute.The Republicans are the majority. How in the hell is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesn’t make it? “Well, Rush, voters are gonna be so mad.” Yeah. At what? The guy got railroaded and our guys couldn’t stop it and we’re supposed to say, “Well, okay, man, we’re really loaded now. That’s gonna really cause the turnup to spike up!” Sorry, folks. I don’t think it works that way. What people…?In the hypothetical I just gave you, what’s gonna happen is that voters are gonna be out there saying, “Even when we vote Republican, the Democrats still run the town,” and it doesn’t equal show up; keep electing Republicans. Gotta be the other way. Got to win this! We’ve got to beat the Democrats, not lose to them! By the way, I’ve had a lot of emails from a lot of people who think they’re expert political analysts, and they all…Well, not all, but a whole bunch of ’em have this theory that the way to get the base all fired… We want to let them destroy a great life, a great patriot, a great American — his whole career, his future, maybe his family — in order to win the midterms? How does that work? Your football team loses. Does that make you want to become a season ticket holder, or is it when they win that you want on the bandwagon and you want to be on the team?Why do we have to keep losing to fire up our base?You talk about a trap?If you ask me, the media’s behind that, the Democrats, the Washington establishment.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This is Sharon in… This can’t… Lititz, Pennsylvania? How do you pronounce where you are?CALLER: It’s Lititz.RUSH: Lititz. Good.CALLER: Yes, sir.RUSH: What’s happening?CALLER: Hi, Rush. Thank you for taking my call.RUSH: You bet.CALLER: I’ve been curious about since about the beginning of this year, several times you mentioned that an incident or an occurrence has yet to happen that will affect or seriously affect the midterms. I was curious to hear if you think this Kavanaugh nomination that’s gone sour is that incident.RUSH: Well, it could be, but the point was, I didn’t have anything specific in mind. It’s just that we get a poll in June or a poll in May or even July, and it tells us what the public is thinking of doing in the November elections. My point was: This is silly. This poll doesn’t mean anything. Does anybody remember the poll in July of 2016 or in August? It doesn’t mean anything ’cause it’s not when the election is. And I said the events are gonna shape the midterms haven’t happened yet. I said that in July, August, September. And this is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind. But there’s gonna be something beyond this.CALLER: Oh, dear.RUSH: This is gonna get resolved one way or the other, and depending on how it’s resolved, yeah, it’s going to affect turnout. It’s going to affect votes. If the Democrats lose this, if Kavanaugh gets confirmed, then, you know, what are Democrat voters gonna do? They’re just gonna be really enraged and show up and vote or are they gonna be mad, depressed, and sit at home? Who knows? But this thing is gonna get resolved. If this is not resolved before the election then it’s a defeat anyway because all the Democrats want here is delay, delay, delay.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: But my only point was those polls in the summer are largely irrelevant because there are things that are gonna happen much closer to the election that nobody can predict that are gonna have a great impact on it. This is one of those things, yes. But I don’t know if it’s the final one.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: For example, who would have predicted back in July or August that we’d be done with NAFTA, we’d have a brand-new trade deal that gets rid of the horrible aspects of NAFTA, and have a new trade deal that’s pro-America? And then after that, how many people think that that is instrumental in voter turnout, hmm? What do you think?  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/01/rachel-mitchells-devastating-report-on-blasey-ford/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 1, 2018RUSH: I mentioned that we have a poll here from Mark Penn, and the headline of the piece (it’s an op-ed that he’s written at TheHill.com) is, “Kavanaugh Polling: FBI on the Hot Seat.” The upshot of this is “Americans believe Christine Blasey Ford. And most also believe Brett Kavanaugh. … If the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges,” and there won’t be any corroboration of the charges, unless somebody does what this whole thing has been from the get-go and makes it up. I put nothing past the Democrats.Everything that we saw on Friday was orchestrated. It was the biggest mistake in the world. Maybe it’s Senate tradition; I don’t know. I haven’t seen enough committee hearings. I don’t know if on the day of a committee vote on anything every senator gets to speechify and that that takes four hours. The Judiciary Committee meeting was scheduled for 9:30. Everybody thought that was the vote. But, no, Grassley announced the Democrats wanted to speak, and they did, and they all kept harping on an FBI investigation. It wasn’t fair.And we know what happened, and at one point Flake disappears. Nobody knows where he went, after he was harassed by a bunch of political activists and a CNN camera in an elevator, the Senate office building. The whole thing was orchestrated and pulled off. And I think the Republicans know all of this. I think the Republicans are not dumb. The Republicans are not blind. They’ve had too many years of watching how the Democrats operate not to know something was coming.There just wasn’t the will to stop it, ’cause the Republicans need to be seen bending over every which way possible to accommodate the credible testimony of Christine Blasey Ford. It was not credible! It isn’t credible today! How does this work? Any woman comes forth, says anything she wants, it’s automatically credible. The accused, who denies it, is not credible? The fix is in from the get go on all this! She doesn’t know…By the way, Rachel Mitchell, the Republican sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona that they hired to question Blasey Ford on Thursday, whenever was it, has put together her review of Christine Blasey Ford and it’s devastating. It is documented devastating. She has no reason to be believed. She can offer no reason. She doesn’t even offer consistency. There’s even a little story that’s developed about her use of Safeway, that she shopped in Safeway a lot, and that was new.The theory behind that is Mark Judge wrote a book. As part of his therapy for alcohol and drug abuse, he was told to write a book. It was supposed… It was a fictional book. It was an aid, an attempt to help him through his problem. It was not a memoir. In this book, it talks about Safeway a lot, and he works there, did work there. So she automatically places herself at a Safeway where he is! Rachel Mitchell found this highly suspicious and, like much else that she said, impossible to prove. Her report…I mean, I printed it out. It’s like six pages here. It is devastating: The inconsistencies in her stories, the variables in her story, the fact that none of the stuff that matters can be proven, the fact that the people she said were in the room don’t… The number kept changing from the original letter to subsequent interviews and then to the testimony she had. The idea that she was afraid to fly and yet here she is vacationing all over the world.How did she get there? The idea that she refused to talk to the committee even in California. We learned that she didn’t even know the committee had offered to fly out there because her lawyers didn’t tell her. By the way, a couple of Republicans are now demanding an investigation. Tom Cotton says, “We’re gonna investigate Feinstein. We’re gonna investigate this leak and we’re gonna investigate these lawyers who may not have told her that the committee was willing to go out there because they believed that she was afraid to fly.”None of this was true. So the idea is that… She’s the least credible witness in all of this, and yet there she is automatically said to be credible. Every leftist supposedly reviewing her performance says, “I found her credible.” Based on what? “She was in such pain. She was so, so still shaken by what happened all of those years ago. You could see it.” Yeah, because she really knew how to make it look like that. I don’t think… For me, I don’t think any of this has been genuine.I think it’s all orchestrated. I think a lot of it’s focus grouped. I think it’s scripted, because none of this passes any kind of a smell test. Anyway, back to Mark Penn’s poll, very quickly. “Americans believe Christine Blasey Ford. And most also believe Brett Kavanaugh. … If the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges, 60% believe that Kavanaugh should then be confirmed, according to a weekend Harvard CAPS/Harris poll of 1,330 registered voters. …“Sixty-six percent of Americans support that decision” to have the FBI investigate, “and that includes 80% of Democrats, 69% of independents but only 45% of Republicans,” who are the smart ones. “Huge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it, and 40% thought she alone was credible, 23% thought just Kavanaugh was, and 27% said both were believable.” If you combine all of that, “the poll findings indicate that 67% found her credible and 50% found him to be so. …“But the credibility of their testimony does not appear to be the decisive factor. Rather, the question comes down to corroboration as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should ascend to the high court. In terms of the overall needle, after the testimony was heard, 37% say confirm the nomination, 44% say reject it, and 18% remain undecided, with Democrats going one way and Republicans the other. But…”But! But! But! But! Hang on. Don’t get depressed. “But once the voters are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation, this shifts [from 37%] to 57% who favor confirmation,” meaning the people in this poll do not know, did not know — many of them did not know — that the people she places in the room have denied being there. When the pollsters told them that fact, the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jump from 37 to 57%.“[A]nd that goes up to 60%” in the hypothetical question, “if the FBI [after a week] agrees there is no corroboration” for her story — and they’ve already done that. But now we’ve got Comey entering the picture. Now we got Comey urging the FBI to keep digging — the same FBI that’s been running a silent coup, FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here’s Christie in Durant, Iowa. Great to have you as we head back to the phones. How are you doing?CALLER: I’m good. Thank you so much. I’m so excited I get to talk to you.RUSH: Thank you!CALLER: We are being played, Rush. And I don’t know if anybody has brought this up or not, but I’ve been thinking about this forever and ever and I’m so glad I got to ask you about it just in case you have brought it up. But has anybody ever thought that the reason she looked so credible because she was so emotional and, you know, wimping and nearly jumping out of her skin is because she freaking went on national TV? She was convinced to go on national TV to continue a lie that is this horrible? Have you ever had someone lie to you and they’re kind of a little nervous and shaky?RUSH: See? That’s exactly what I mean.CALLER: So if I went on TV hero for the “They-knew movement,” as Tomi Lahren called it, and they finally get there and you’re like… She’s smart enough to know that all the people she’s looking at know that this is not true.RUSH: What you are doing is understandable. You’re putting yourself in her position and wondering how you would be. You’d be terrified, you’d be scared to death, and you might betray that. Your voice might be shaky and you might be forgetful and you might be nervous and jittery and so forth. For people untrained in this kind of thing, yeah. But I don’t buy that that’s who she is for a minute.I think this was rehearsed and scripted. She knew what she was gonna say and so forth. I think it was practiced. (sigh) She’s from Palo Alto. These people are left-wing activists. Now, I don’t want to appear to just out-of-hand reject your theory. I need to ask you a question. Honestly. There’s no wrong answer here. Do not misinterpret any tone in my vice. I’m actually asking you to help me.CALLER: Okay.RUSH: Was she credible to you because of her demeanor and her voice and her up-speaking technique and her apparent nervousness? Did she come across as credible to you? Believable?CALLER: No! That’s exactly what I just said. She came across as someone who was sitting in front of a bunch of people telling a lie, and the reason why she was able to be whimpering and shaky and nervous and look like someone who had been raped is because she knew she was lying on national TV.RUSH: Okay. I heard that. I thought you said the reason she comes across as credible was because people identify with suffering and pain and all that.CALLER: She’s whimpering and scared out of her mind because of what she’s doing.RUSH: Well… (sigh)CALLER: And she was convinced to do something really stupid.RUSH: She’d have to have a conscience for that. Do you think leftists…? Leftists can’t survive with consciences. Look, she is willingly — and not just following. She is leading now an effort to destroy, literally destroy another human being, his life’s work, his family, his past, and his future. You gotta have no conscience to be doing that. Her description of what happened to her… Uh. (sigh) Well, I couldn’t do what she’s doing, but not because I’d be nervous.It’s ’cause I couldn’t live with the guilt. If I were participating in an effort that had an entire political party depending me to pull it off, to destroy another human being, if it weren’t true, I couldn’t do it — and I don’t think they have any problem doing it. I mean, they are trained. They are trained in this kind of political tactic. That’s what being a leftist is.They are not docile like you and I and living their lives and politics happens to be a part of it. Politics is everything. It is their identity. To come forward with a story like this, to know that you can’t offer corroboration or proof, you’ve gotta be really certain that nothing’s gonna happen to you. You gotta be certain that the party is gonna protect you, that your lawyers are gonna protect you. You’ve gotta be certain that the Republicans aren’t gonna do anything to you, and how do you do that?You appear to be a woman in distress who has been abused and so forth, and since everybody knows Republicans hate women and have been having a War on Women, you can be the Republicans aren’t gonna did lay a glove on you. They aren’t even gonna try. But at the end of all, what have you done? You’ve destroyed the life, the achievements, the future, and the family of a fellow human being. It’s about time people learned what we’re up against and who these people are. It’s not earning what we’re capable of. It’s admitting is because it’s happening way, way too often!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. They have it? Say 10. Say 10. Say 10. You know the old saw, “How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice, practice, practice.” How do you get to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee? Practice, practice, practice. See you tomorrow. Thanks for being with us, folks.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/01/trump-eviscerates-phony-democrat-senators/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 1, 2018RUSH: So the Drive-Bys wanted to talk to Trump about Kavanaugh, and he decided to go there, and he just eviscerated Richard Blumenthal and Cory Booker and Dianne Feinstein, and basically told the media that as far as he’s concerned, they are the Democrat Party too. He talked about Blumenthal lying for years about having served in Vietnam when he had never even been to the country, served with valor as a Marine. He said this guy — a serial liar on his own resume — is questioning Brett Kavanaugh?He went to talk about Cory Booker who has admitted to fondling women in an… By the way, that was an attempt to cleanse himself, to show that he has reformed when he did that. He went out and he accused Feinstein — sort of quasi-accused her — of leaking the Christine Blasey Ford letter. He did this Saturday night in West Virginia, and it was hilarious the way he thinks he knows that Dianne Feinstein leaked.I don’t have time to explain it. I’m gonna have to show it. For those of you watching on the Dittocam, I’ll do my best to show you what Trump did. He imitated Feinstein when the whole question of leaking came up. Now they’re asking, “If it’s proven that Kavanaugh was a drunk in high school, does that mean you’ll pull the nomination?” and Trump is talking to them about that. So we’ll keep going here.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So the president continues to take questions in the Rose Garden from the Drive-By Media. I would JIP it, but there are things I want to get to here, and I can just as easily relay what the president I ssaying. He’s just laying the Democrats out. He’s laying them out for the lying tricksters and skunks that they are. He’s linking the media to the Democrat Party, which… We do it all the time here, but you don’t really hear the president make it that direct and obvious.He has just eviscerated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats, from Cory “Spartacus” Booker, to Richard Blumenthal, to Dianne Feinstein. Now, what he did with Feinstein… If you’ll recall, is toward the tail end of the hearing on Friday, before the vote came, somebody raised a question of how in the world did Christine Blasey Ford’s letter to Dianne Feinstein leak? Because it was… We are made to understand that the letter said that she didn’t want anybody to know her name and that she didn’t want to come forward.Yet the woman had written the Washington Post! She’d called the Washington Post tip line, the New York Times. She has an op-ed published in the Washington Post. But all along we’re told she didn’t want to go public. So people were trying to claim… You know, for all this talk about what Kavanaugh’s done to this poor woman, it’s the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her through this (sobbing) “emotional wringer. It’s so unfair and such spotlight.”It became obvious that there could be only three sources for the leak because of limited possession of the letter. One would be Senator Feinstein and/or her staff. The other would have to be somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter. So some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein, and she sat there and fumed while this was happening.And as all the other possibilities were mentioned, she eventually asked for a point of order to Chairman Grassley and said (summarized), “Chairman Grassley, I need to react. I need to respond to this outrageous allegation that I or my staff had leaked this letter. Just for the record, I just asked my staff. I just asked my staff if any of them leaked it, and they have assured me that they didn’t.” (Snort!) But what we saw when she was do, she turned around to her staff sitting behind her, and she starts mouthing.We can’t hear what she’s saying ’cause it’s off mic, but she’s obviously asking them, “Did anybody leak it?” She turns and asks, “Did you leak it? Did you leak it?” She turns back to the camera, “We didn’t leak it, Mr. Chairman. We didn’t leak it.” Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday night by saying (summarized), “Oh, is this how we’re gonna determine who leaked something? She gets to turn to her staff and ask them, and they deny it, and that’s it?“Meanwhile, Kavanaugh sits over there and has to undergo his seventh FBI background check. His accuser has no corroboration and no evidence, and he’s presumed to have done it? And Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff, ‘Hey, did any of you leak this letter? and they get to say, ‘Oh, no, no! Wasn’t us. Wasn’t us.’ And she turns back around and says, ‘We — we didn’t do it, Mr. Chairman,’ as though, ‘Case closed; it wasn’t us’?”They had to have done it. It was strategic! Just like what happened on Friday was strategic!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: To Trump sound bites. These are from the Oval Office. It was during an announcement ceremony for a new trade deal eliminating NAFTA, getting rid of it. It’s a brand-new trade deal. The Drive-Bys were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh, which meant they asked questions about Kavanaugh. Trump, after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA, started entertaining the questions and we have — one, two, three. We’ve got four of them here. And here is Trump… This is not actually in response to a question. He’s just riffing here during the ceremony talking about the midterm election, fake news, Kavanaugh things.THE PRESIDENT: We have Senate races that weren’t even in play six months ago. As you know, there are a lot of repression (sic) polls or polls that aren’t very accurate. We had areas and we had congressional seats, too, where I know it’s gonna be a positive outcome. But you look at what’s going on, and it doesn’t seem to broadcast that way. But I certainly had that with my election. They were telling me I was, you know, in trouble in certain states that I end up winning, like, in a landslide. And I knew I was gonna win them in a landslide, but they wouldn’t report it that way. You know why? Fake news.RUSH: Now during the Q&A Cecilia Vega, ABC News White House correspondent, said, “In a tweet this weekend, you said it’s incorrect to say that you’re limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh. But your own statement on Friday made it very clear. You said this investigation must be limited in scope. So which is it?THE PRESIDENT: This is our seventh investigation of a man who has really… You know you look at his life until this happened. What a change he’s gone through, what his family’s gone through, the trauma, for a man that’s never had any accusation, any… He never had a bad statement about him. I think was No. 1 in his class at Yale. He was No. 1 in his law school at Yale. And then what he’s gone through over the last three weeks is incredible. So I want the FBI — this is now their seventh investigation. So it’s not like they, you know, just starting. I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation.RUSH: Let me explain that answer. These sound bites have gotta be… Yeah, it’s No. 30 coming. Okay. When this whole FBI investigation started, everybody knows… We heard Flake command a week for his vote, one week. So that’s how the committee vote ended, 11-10 in favor of Kavanaugh with the proviso that Flake was not gonna vote when the floor vote for final confirmation ’til the FBI had spent at least another week looking into this.So then NBC runs a story out of nowhere, fake news, claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI. It was a setup. It was a trap. They laid a trap. NBC News — which is complicit with the Democrat Party in most things — laid a trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI scope. Because, you see, there are things to find, and Trump wants to cover it up. Donald Trump who’s had so much control over the FBI the last three years.Same FBI that’s been doing its level best to get Trump thrown out of office. Somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation. So Trump responds, “I’m not limiting the scope of anything. I’ve told the FBI to look at whatever they need to look at.” “Oh, okay. Thank you, Mr. President. So if it needs to go two weeks it can go two weeks; so the White House has claimed there ain’t any limitations.”See how this works? It was a trap, it was a setup, and Trump tweeted out that he’s not limiting the scope; NBC’s lying. Of course they’re lying! It was a setup! And so now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business News that the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow. But then the question becomes, well, what to do with that. If FBI has finished talking to everybody they need to talk to, then what are the Republicans do with that?Do they hold on to it ’til Friday or do they move on it? Well, I’ll just tell you. If this ends tomorrow, if this is all accurate, the Democrats are gonna be fit to be tied that the thing didn’t go on ’til Friday and they’re gonna demand. They’re gonna start saying that this thing is rigged, they knew it was gonna be rigged, and they’re gonna demand even most of your time to fix the fact that it was rigged. They’re gonna do that anyway.They’re not gonna let this thing end on Friday. If we let them have their way, this investigation isn’t gonna end on Friday. It won’t be long enough. Besides, Trump said he’s not gonna have any limit on the FBI. So why are they stopping now? It isn’t possible they could have found everything there is to find on this, they will say. To which the response is, well, they found nothing in a hundred thousand or more Hillary emails in a couple days.Let’s see. Let’s skip forward here to audio sound bite No. 30. Reporter: “About Judge Kavanaugh, there are concerns that he might have lied or mischaracterized his drinking while he was testifying. If they find that Kavanaugh lied about his drinking, or if he lied about other things, do you think that that bars him from being your nominee to the Supreme Court?”THE PRESIDENT: I was surprised at how vocal he was about the fact that he likes beer, and he’s had a little bit of difficulty. I mean, he talked about things that happened when he drank. This is not a man that said that alcohol was absent, that he was perfect with respect to alcohol. Look at some of these people asking the questions. Okay? Look at Blumenthal. He lied about Vietnam. He didn’t just say, “Hey, I went to Vietnam.” No, no. For 15 years he said he was a war hero! He fought in Da Nang Province!We call him “Da Nang Richard.” Da Nang! That’s his nickname, Da Nang. He never went to Vietnam! Take a look Cory Booker. He ran Newark, New Jersey, into the ground. He was a horrible mayor. And he made statements that when he was in high school or college, what he was doing. He actually made the statements. And now he’s talking about Judge Kavanaugh. And I could go through a whole list of them, okay? Look at Dianne Feinstein.RUSH: And he starts talking about Feinstein with the Chinese spy on her staff for 20 years, and then he tells the story about how Dianne Feinstein assured everybody that her staff didn’t leak the Blasey Ford heard ’cause right there in the middle of the hearing she turned around and asked ’em. The camera was on her and she turned around and asked, “Did you leak? Did you leak? Did you leak? Uh, Mr. Chairman, my staff tells me that we didn’t leak it. I didn’t leak it and my staff says they didn’t leak it, so no, Mr. Chairman, we didn’t leak it.”Well, then that’s that!Just like Kavanaugh says he didn’t do what she says, but no, that’s not good enough! You need the FBI, you need everything you can get to find out if Kavanaugh’s lying. But we’re just supposed to sit there and accept Dianne Feinstein that you say and your staff say — in a period of five to 10 seconds — that you didn’t like it? And that’s that? And Trump is so right about Richard Blumenthal. This guy, folks.. This guy… You know, I don’t understand Democrat voters. It can’t be on substance.This guy lied! He claimed for 15 years he was a medal-winning war hero, servitude with valor in Vietnam. He’s never been there. He had to call a press conference with tears to explain why and what happened. There is not a single Republican alive the media would allow to survive a transgression like that. Ann Coulter. She’s got a really funny column, really great column. All the Democrats and media are saying, “You can’t have 11 old white guys on that committee asking her questions and judging her.“You can’t have that.” So she said (summarized), “Okay. If you don’t like the 11 old white guys, how about if we have Al Sharpton come in and ask questions, Al Sharpton of Tawana Brawley fame? How about we get Bill Cosby in there? Get another African-American. How about Keith Ellison. Get a Democrat, black guy in, a Democrat who’s got his own sexual harassment problems. How about Alton Maddox, attorney for black youth hired by a Jewish landlord?” She goes through a list of Latinos, Native Americans, and African-Americans who have abused women. “Let’s have them come in and ask the questions if these 11 white guys are incapable of it.” Really smart.

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/28/flake-fears-realized/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 28, 2018RUSH: CNN is breathlessly reporting that Jeff Flake — who announced he was gonna vote for Kavanaugh this morning — walked out of the committee room today with Chris Coons, Democrat from Delaware, and hasn’t been seen since. So CNN’s trying to say that there’s a lot of drama being played out behind the scenes and that maybe Flake is going to get his mind changed by the Democrats. CNN is claiming Flake is wobbling, might still vote “no.”That’s the current holdup in the voting right now.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We are keeping an eye on the committee. They’ve not voted yet. They’re supposed to vote soon. Still some concern over where is Jeff Flake. CNN is breathless. CNN is…Oh, they’re so hoping that somebody got to Flake. We, of course, are hoping it’s wishful thinking. In the event somebody did — and, by the way, let me just… I told Snerdley, I told the people on the other side of the glass 45 minutes ago that I’m not thinking this is over at all. I’m listening to these Democrat speeches where they are still campaigning, and then they get up and walk out. Every one of them is looking right at where Flake is sitting, either he or in Grassley’s direction.I told ’em in there (and they can back this up) that I wouldn’t be surprised if one of two things happened: If Grassley did decide to delay the vote or if Flake changed his mind. Snerdley looked at me and said, “No way! No way! Not after you commit. No way,” and now look what CNN’s reporting. I know it’s CNN, but somebody’s telling ’em that. It could all be bogus, designed to be seen by others. (interruption) Right. “Talks going on behind the scenes. … Drama playing out behind the scenes. … Dem, GOP members in talks.”What could that be about? If the Dems and the Republicans are in talks, the only reason to be talking (sigh) would be to change what was supposed to happen here at 1:30.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Yeah, all right. It’s confirmed the Democrats are really putting pressure on Flake. I was wise. I was wise to not trust this at the get go. I didn’t… I didn’t say… There’s a lot of things I’m holding back today, folks. I’m gonna tell you up front I’m holding back, because I don’t want to end up being a factor in what’s happening here today. I don’t mean to sound egotistical, but there are certain things that in this charged atmosphere, they’re just waiting for someone like me to say something that would turn into a news story that would fire people up.So I have withheld what have been fears all day long about Flake. The minute I got here and found out this vote was gonna take four hours — will have four hours of debate prior to it — instead of happening at 9:30, and knowing that Flake is leaving… This is his last term in office. Knowing that Flake, at the end of the day, still does not like Donald Trump at all. Kavanaugh is a Trump nominee. The Democrats are now working hard to change him.I’ll guarantee you they’re not talking about FBI investigations or fairness or any of that. They’re talking Trump. Amy Klobuchar set that up by saying that she doesn’t think Kavanaugh’s qualified or legitimate simply because Trump nominated him. I think they’re probably talking about Senator McCain to him. “You can be a hero like Senator McCain! Remember Senator McCain thumbing down Obamacare, the repeal of Obama? You can do the same!” I know they’re working on him this way, and this was a fear I had from the get-go today.I mean, even from last night. We’re talking about Jeff Flake here, maybe even a little bit Corker. Now, all of that having been said, McConnell has said that regardless, there’s gonna be a floor vote next week, and here’s another thing. Traditionally, the vote in the Judiciary Committee is supposed to serve as a guide to the full Senate. See, the full Senate’s not on the Judiciary Committee, and so Civics 101 says, “The rest of the Senate will learn what to do by listening to the learned knowledge and recommendation of the Judiciary Committee, which will have fully vetted the nominee,” blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.I guarantee you that the other senators are not sitting out there waiting to hear what the Judiciary Committee recommends with its vote. So McConnell says there’s gonna be a vote regardless. Flake’s vote? Somebody is gonna be needed. If Flake drops off, we’re gonna need Collins, Murkowski, and so forth. McConnell says the vote is going to happen. In fact, our microphones are still there. Let’s JIP a little bit of this. Grassley just resumed his seat here. Let’s see what’s happening. We have a few moments here to find out.FLAKE: (haltingly) I, uh, have been speaking with a number of people on the other side. We’ve had conversations ongoing on for a while, uh, with regard to, um, making sure that (sigh) we do due diligence here.RUSH: Jeff Flake is speaking.FLAKE: And I think it would be, uh, proper to delay the floor vote, uh, for up to but not more than one week, uh, in order to let the, um, FBI continue — or, uh, to do an investigation —RUSH: I told you, Snerdley! I told you. I told you.SPEAKER: — limited in time and scope, uh, to the current allegations that are there. And, uh, limit in time to no more than one week, and I… (sigh) I will vote to advance the bill, uh, to the floor w-with that understanding. And I — I’ve spoken to a few other members, uh, ummm, who, uh — on my side of the aisle that — may be supportive as well. But that’s my position. I — I think that, uh, that we — we ought to do what we can to make sure that, uh, that we do all due diligence with a nomination this important. And I want to say that this committee has acted properly and, uh, the chairman has bent over backwards, uhhh, to do investigations from this committee and to delay this vote in this committee for a week so that judge — or so that, uh, Ms. Ford, Dr. Ford could be heard, and she was yesterday. Uh, so… So that’s, with that agreement, uhh, I will vote to advance bill for the floor. Uh…GRASSLEY: Clerk will call roll!(crosstalk)RUSH: Okay. Pot it. Pot it down. What Flake is saying here is he’s prepared to vote for Kavanaugh in this vote, but he wants a delay for a week on the full Senate vote so that the FBI can investigate. I still don’t believe that that’s how they got to him. I think they got to him with Trump, but they could have gotten to him with this FBI business. We got a little few seconds here. He’s still speaking. Let’s see. Maybe we can get Grassley and some of the action.FLAKE: My — my understanding — and if the Democrats could speak to it, if Chris or — or you —GRASSLEY: No.FLAKE: — as we talked about before if the Democrats would accept and endorse a — a one week, uh, um (sputtering), FBI investigation limited in time and scope.FEINSTEIN: That is correct.GRASSLEY: Well, since you’re the deciding —FLAKE: Yes.GRASSLEY: Well, since you’re the deciding vote here, we’ll vote and then if there’s any sort of discussion, we’ll go do that after the vote. Call the roll!CLERK: (gavels) Mr. Hatch?HATCH: Aye.CLERK: Mr. Graham?GRAHAM: Aye.CLERK: Mr. Cornyn?CORNYN: Aye.CLERK: Mr. Lee?LEE: Aye.CLERK: Mr. Cruz?CRUZ: Aye.RUSH: They’re calling the vote!CLERK: Mr. Sasse?SASSE: Aye.RUSH: They’re calling the vote without a commitment to do the FBI investigation!CLERK: Mr. Crapo?CRAPO: Aye.RUSH: Grassley!CLERK: Mr. Tillis?TILLIS: Aye.RUSH: Grassley manned up here!CLERK: Mr. Kennedy?KENNEDY: Aye.CLERK: Mrs. Feinstein?FEINSTEIN: This is on the nominee?GRASSLEY: Yeah.FEINSTEIN: On the nominee, no.CLERK: Mr. Leahy?LEAHY: On the nominee, no.CLERK: Mr. Durbin?DURBIN: No.CLERK: Mr. Whitehouse?WHITEHOUSE: No.RUSH: Our seconds with dwindling.CLERK: Mrs. Klobuchar?KLOBUCHAR: No.RUSH: We’re hoping to get all this in before we have to do.CLERK: Mr. Coons?COONS: On the nominee, no.CLERK: Mr. Blumenthal?BLUMENTHAL: No.CLERK: Ms. Hirono?HIRONO: No.CLERK: Mr. Booker?BOOKER: No.CLERK: Ms. Harris?HARRIS: No.CLERK: Mr. Chairman?GRASSLEY: Aye.CLERK: Mr. Chairman, the votes are 11 yay, 10 nay.GRASSLEY: The nominee will be reported to the floor.FLAKE: Mr. Chairman, may I —RUSH: Okay, gotta go. Take it away.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. The Senate Judiciary Committee has voted to send the Kavanaugh nomination to the floor, 11-10. Flake’s vote is contingent in the full vote on whether or not they delay that full vote for an FBI investigation, and that now is not up to this committee. That’s up to the Turtle. It’s up to McConnell as to when the vote takes place. All the rest in there right now is just noise.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. The ball is in Donald Trump’s court now. We’ll see how he deals with this. Just hang on, folks. I’m gonna tell you what happened and put it all in perspective for you.JOHNNY DONOVAN: And now, from sunny south Florida, it’s Open Line Friday!RUSH: It’s easy for me to say now, but Snerdley can back me up. I had fears this was gonna happen from the moment I showed up here because we’re talking about Jeff Flake. I didn’t say so because I didn’t want it reported in the media: “Rush Limbaugh worried about Flake.” I didn’t even want to put the idea out there. I’m also not saying some things about the hearings yesterday because I don’t want what I say to end up being a distraction. The liberal media is out there waiting for any of that.So I’m kind of holding back here — and don’t worry. You’re gonna hear what I think at some point. But I gotta be strategic here given all this going on. Here’s where we are. The vote was supposed to be at 9:30 today. The Democrats on the committee asked for a chance to speak before they voted. They began to filibuster. The vote was then announced. When Grassley decided to let that happen, he had to let it happen for everybody. So the Democrats, especially Cory Booker, just started flapping their gums, just started talking about meaningless garbage to make it sound like it was meaningful, but it wasn’t. It just time filling and time wasting.The vote was moved back to 1:30. As we approached 1:30, people noticed that Chris Coons and Jeff Flake had left the committee room some moments earlier and nobody had seen ’em since. This, of course, made people curious, and they found out that eventually Coons and Flake had been huddling and the Democrats have been working on Flake to agree with them that the FBI needs to take one more look at this, given Blasey Ford’s testimony now and given the other allegations, the porn star lawyer’s allegation from what’s-her-face. (interruption)No, no, no, no. Avenatti’s client. I’m having a mental block on her name. Ramirez… (interruption) Yeah, Wetnick, Swetnick whatever it is. So the Democrats been pushing for a FBI investigation just to delay things. The FBI… Here’s what’s silly about this, folks. The only thing the FBI would do if they’re authorized to do it is what they’ve already done! The FBI has already said there’s nothing here! This is so… I overuse the word “maddening.”Well, anyway, I’m jumping the shark here. Let me come back and get back into the chronology. So Flake comes back in with Coons, huddles with Grassley. And the upshot of it is that Flake says he will vote for Kavanaugh if there will be a delay in the full Senate, the floor vote on Kavanaugh for a week so that the FBI could investigate, which is what the Democrats have been demanding and begging for. So they got to Flake somehow.We’ll find out in due course what they promised him or how they got to him. That will eventually reveal itself. So Flake makes his demand of a one-week delay for the FBI, just to we can all be thorough here and remove any clouds of doubt, in exchange for there being a one-week investigation. Well, Grassley — just to cut to the chase here — immediately calls the vote without telling Flake whether he accepts Flake’s demand. They do the vote, and Flake votes Kavanaugh.So the vote goes out of the committee 11-10 in favor of Kavanaugh, which doesn’t mean anything in terms of the final vote. Don’t doubt me. It doesn’t mean anything. It used to maybe carry some weight, but it doesn’t anymore. What Flake then said is, “Yeah, I voted yes today, but my yes vote on final confirmation of Kavanaugh will not be forthcoming unless there is a one-week FBI investigation.” He’s holding his vote and he’s telling everybody he might not vote Kavanaugh if there is no FBI investigation.Well, the problem with all of this is that nobody in that room, in the Senate Judiciary Committee room, can authorize an FBI investigation! Nobody can make that deal with Flake! Grassley can’t make that deal because Grassley doesn’t run the Senate. Mitch McConnell does. As the majority leader, Mitch McConnell runs the Senate. Mitch McConnell is on record saying there will be a vote next Tuesday on Kavanaugh.Now, that was before Flake pulled this stunt today agreeing with the Democrats that his vote is contingent on a one-week — maximum one-week — FBI investigation into only allegations we have at the moment, which would mean Blasey Ford, Ramirez, and Swetnick. But nobody in that room can make this deal. Chuck Schumer, as the minority leader, has to negotiate with McConnell on whether or not there’s gonna be an FBI investigation before the floor vote. Now, McConnell… Let’s go through the possibilities.McConnell could say, “I don’t care about Jeff Flake’s vote. We’re not doing an FBI investigation.”Then Schumer could say, “Well, then my guys are not gonna show up and vote. We’re gonna walk out! We’re not gonna vote and neither is Flake.”To question McConnell is say, “You don’t want to vote? We don’t need your vote, but we’re gonna have the vote.” They can’t filibuster it. They can’t nuclear option it. They’ve blown that. The Democrats can’t. But getting into what FBI would do, here’s the thing. Do you realize, folks, none of these people have to talk to the FBI in this circumstance?A one-week delay is nothing but silly. It is the Democrats’ latest victory in delaying the final vote. They’re gonna keep trying to delay and delay until after the midterm elections. That is all this is about because they think they’re gonna win them, at which point Trump’s nominees go sideways and there will never be a vote on Kavanaugh and Trump will have to pull it ’cause it just won’t be the case.They’re gonna run the show, House and Senate. Trump’s nominees go nowhere. The only thing the FBI would do is go out and interview a few witnesses. They might interview Mark Judge, for example. But those people do not have to talk to the FBI. They may not want to, and they do not have to. Do not doubt me. None of the people that the Democrats want the FBI to talk to are under any kind of compulsion to talk to the FBI. They do not have to.Meanwhile, the most the FBI would do is interview these people and then turn the interview notes over. They’re called 302s. There’s a Form 302 for an FBI interview. The 302s would be turned over to the Senate and the Senate would be right back where it is today making the decision! The FBI being involved is a nothing burger! It is unnecessary! It’s not going to be determinative at all! And I’ll tell you somethin’ else!I’m just gonna go on record here as telling you something else! If — if — the FBI investigating this finds out that Dr. Ford is lying, the Democrats will still not change their vote. If the FBI were to find that Avenatti’s client is full of it, if the FBI were to find that this Ramirez woman — who’s the second woman to come forth after Dr. Blasey Ford. If the FBI finds that not only are these witnesses lying, but there is nothing to what they’re saying, and if that’s what they report… Well, they wouldn’t report it. The Senate would.They would get the interviews, and if any interviews the FBI finds out that Blasey Ford is lying… This is just a possibility here. You know, hypothetical. My point is, this is so irrelevant and so un-determinative and so not really necessary that no matter what the FBI finds, the Democrats are not gonna change their vote. Right now, the Democrats are operating on the premise that Blasey Ford cannot lie.“She’s a woman! She’s making the allegation; it’s true. We must take her seriously,” and “take her seriously” means believing her! If we don’t believe her, we’re insulting her. If we don’t believe her, we’re not taking her seriously.” So the FBI goes and talks to her. She can’t tell them where it happened. If she now tells them where it happened then they’ve got a problem because she under oath said she doesn’t know where it happened. If she suddenly remembers, we got a problem. If she suddenly remembers when it happened, specific date and time, we have a problem because she’s under oath saying she doesn’t remember that.So they go interview her. She says the same thing to the FBI she said yesterday. Nobody knows anymore than they know today. The FBI will furnish their 302s and reports and will add no new information to anything because all of this already has been investigated by committee investigators. If there are no changes, if there is no corroborating evidence, if the four people named by Blasey Ford who claim today under oath that they do not know what she’s talking about, that they weren’t there — if they say that to the FBI — will the Democrats accept it because it’s coming from the FBI?No.I’m here to tell you that there’s no circumstance under which the Democrats are gonna change their vote on this guy. Some of the red state Democrats might like Joe Manchin and some of the others that are maybe feeling some heat in the midterms. But the Democrats at large, as a party, are not going to change their votes on this. And the reason I’m saying that is to point out the futility and the utter irrelevance of this and cement the point that it is nothing more than another delay. Trump… You know, Jeff Flake does not get to authorize the FBI.The only thing at stake here is Jeff Flake’s vote. Flake voted for Kavanaugh in the committee on the basis that there’s gonna be an FBI investigation of a week. If that investigation doesn’t happen, then Flake can say, “Okay. I’m not voting for the guy.” But Flake cannot authorize the FBI and Grassley can’t authorize the FBI and Dianne Feinstein can’t authorize the FBI. And the FBI’s already said they don’t want any part of it! The FBI’s already said to them it’s a closed case. It’s not in their jurisdiction!There hasn’t been a formal complaint filed where it happened in Montgomery County!It’s 36 years old!The American people ought to be outraged at the Democrat Party. The American people ought to be fit to be tied and frustrated as hell over the Democrat Party thwarting the process here, because that is all this is. Well, it’s not all it is. In addition to all of that, it is the purposeful — and I mean that. It is the purposeful destruction of a man and his career — his achievements, his integrity, his reputation, his family — and his life in general. That is also on the table as a threat to anybody else who might come along and threaten the Supreme Court as somebody like Judge Kavanaugh does.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: A friend of mine known affectionately as “Mr. Hawaii” just sent me a text and said, “What is the purpose of the delay?” Well, let me tell you what the purpose of the delay is. I just watched Chris Coons, who made the deal with Flake, say (paraphrased), “Look, we need to remove the cloud over the head of Judge Kavanaugh, and I think everyone agrees that the FBI looking into this — or any new allegations — in the next week. It is something that should be a bipartisan effort because this committee was too partisan. The American people need to see us working together.”So we have a one-week delay that the Democrats now say, “Maximum, we’ll agree, one-week delay. Have the FBI come in, look at this.” But Coons also said, “Any new allegations that come in, they, of course, should be investigated.” The reason for the delay is for new allegations to be brought forth — and I’m telling you, the Democrats already have them in their back pockets like cards waiting to be played. The reason for the delay is to get another delay. And after securing that next delay, go for another one.All of this is about one of two things: Delaying the vote or having it canceled before the elections in November, or having the president withdraw Kavanaugh or Kavanaugh withdraw himself. Those are the objectives. Anything to prevent the vote. Anything! That’s what the delay is. The delay is the next phase in new allegations. “But, Rush, they just agreed to one week.” Folks, wait. It’s Monday, next week, hypothetically — and everybody thinks the FBI is looking into Blasey Ford and some of these others.And then why, lo and behold, here comes another Democrat lawyer with another allegation! Do you think the Democrats gonna say, “Well, we can’t investigate that because we agreed to end all this on Friday”? Ha! If there’s a new allegation, it will be met with a demand to extend the investigation. We said it from the beginning of this process: Every day the Republicans do not call the vote on this is a day there isn’t going to be one.And it’s now getting to the point every day that the vote is not called equals four or five days of delay. So now the ball is in the court of the Turtle, Mitch McConnell. By the way, Trump… Apparently, they got a press gaggle in there at the White House. Did you hear what Trump said? “Well, if that’s what they want, let it play out.” That’s… I didn’t see it. That is a report that I got. I guess I should say this with an asterisk. I have learned unless I see it myself, that I should pass it along to you with reservation.A lot of people think they hear something, but when I look at it, I don’t hear what they heard. But the note I got was that Trump said, “Well, if they want to let it play out, let it play out.” I have another fear here. (chuckling) I’m wondering if I ought to keep quiet about it or not. I almost walked in during the break to tell people and make my prediction what’s coming next. (long pause) I’ll think about it. In the meantime, let’s go to the phones. We got Michelle in Topeka, Kansas, who has been waiting awhile.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: MSNBC is reporting that Senator Murkowski is supporting Senator Flake’s call for a delay.Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. But, again, they don’t have anything to say about it. It’s gonna be McConnell. But what’s McConnell gonna do if more and more members of his caucus ask for a delay? Again, let’s look at this way. Let’s say that next Monday, Christopher Wray, director of the FBI calls a press conference and says, “The FBI has completed its investigation.”He’s got Robert Mueller standing right next to him.“We have completed our investigation. We have found absolutely no evidence of collusion in the 2016 election between Donald Trump and the Russians or vice versa.”Do you think the Democrats would say, “Whoa. Okay. Cool”?Do you think they would accept it? No. Just as they’re not gonna accept if the FBI turns in interview reports that doesn’t change the circumstances today, that don’t change the status quo. If the FBI happens to turn in a report that they’ve confirmed that Dr. Blasey Ford is lying, it isn’t gonna change the Democrats’ vote on this. That’s why all of this is pointless and a waste of time.(interruption)RUSH: Snerdley, you’re acting surprised.(interruption)RUSH: You’re not surprised Murkowski threw in with Flake, are you?(interruption)RUSH: Right. Yeah.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We have audio of President Trump this afternoon in the White House shortly after the shenanigans in the Judiciary Committee where the vote was called and it was 11-10 to support Kavanaugh out of the committee. Jeff Flake agreeing with the Democrats for a one-week delay for the FBI to investigate whatever the Democrats can find next in addition to Blasey Ford and whatever else.So the one week investigation is gonna be expanded because, by Monday at the latest, there’s gonna be another allegation, and the Democrats are gonna say, “Well, we can’t control that!” Ha-ha-ha. So anyway, when they got to Trump, he was meeting with the president of Chile, Sebastian Pinera, and White House correspondent Jim Acosta was Acosta-ing Trump. He said, “What did you think of Dr. Ford’s testimony when you heard it?”THE PRESIDENT: I thought her testimony was very compelling, and she looks like a very fine woman to me. Very fine woman. And I thought that Brett’s testimony, likewise, was really something that I haven’t seen before. It was incredible. It was an incredible moment, I think, in the history of our country.RUSH: And then the question was, “Would you be willing to reopen the background investigation into Kavanaugh?” Listen carefully…THE PRESIDENT: I’m just hearing a little bit about it because I’ve been with the president of Chile, and we’re talking about some very important subjects. But, uhhh, I’m sure it will all be very good. I guess the vote was a positive vote, but there seems to be a delay. I’ll learn more about it as the day goes on. I’m gonna rely on all of the people, including Senator Grassley, who’s doing a very good job. Uh, that will be a decision that they’re going to make, and I suspect they’ll be making some decision soon, whether to take a vote or to do whatever else they want to do. I will be totally reliant on what Senator Grassley and the group decides to do.RUSH: Well, it isn’t gonna be Grassley. It’s gonna be McConnell. So the president is basically deferring, at least in this statement, to the Senate. If McConnell, Grassley, whoever, want the FBI to look into it, then the president seemingly is fine. He will leave the FBI decision up to them. I still don’t know about this authorizing the FBI business. I thought Trump had to do it. So, Snerdley, think I ought to share my prediction or withhold?(interruption)RUSH: All right. I’ll withhold it.(interruption)RUSH: They know I made it. If my prediction’s right, it won’t be long we’ll find out — and if it happens, you’ll know it, folks. (chuckling) Believe me, you’ll know it.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I’ve got a question. As long as we’re getting the FBI back in here, how about reopening the Hillary email investigation? I mean, they exonerated her before they even interviewed her. How about reopening that? Hmm? Hey, Senator Flake, could you make this part of your deal? Could you, say, get the FBI to relook at Blasey Ford be contingent on the FBI reopening the Hillary email investigation? Senator Flake? Could you do that?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. My prediction… I’m not gonna voice it, but if it happens, I guarantee you will know what it is. But I don’t want to be a factor in it, so that’s why I’m not announcing it. I’m not holding back on you, folks. I’m trying to be responsible here, unlike half of the damn United States Senate.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/28/are-democrats-the-anti-man-party/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 28, 2018RUSH: We’re gonna get to the phones but I saw something here at the break that I gotta comment on: Some really near hysterical Democrat congresswoman during the break was going nuts. “Why…? Why…? Why don’t we take Dr. Ford seriously? Why…? Why do we disrespect Dr. Ford? Why do we…?” What does that mean? On the left, what does “take her seriously” mean? Who did not take her seriously? Everybody bent over backwards! In fact, everybody treated her like she was so fragile that she might crack and break at the slightest little raised voice.Everybody was treating her with kid gloves!What do you mean, “take here seriously”?Well, I know what they mean. I’m asking the question rhetorically. What they mean is, “Why don’t you believe her?” Well, the answer is because she doesn’t have any evidence and there’s no corroboration for it. That’s why! “Well, that’s not fair. She’s come forward at great risk, and using great courage. Why won’t you take her seriously?” Everybody did take her seriously. She was given every opportunity in the book! And then this congresswoman said, “Why won’t Grassley and the Republicans open an FBI investigation?“Why are they so reluctant? It’s because they’re afraid the FBI’s gonna find something that disproves what they believe! If you’re Kavanaugh, and if you’re really innocent, why not do it? Why not have it really proclaimed you’re innocent?” Because you don’t need to. But that’s not the reason, and they don’t want to say it! I’ll say it: The reason they’re not calling the FBI in is because you people are doing nothing but trying to delay this, and they’re not gonna fall for your trick! Now, for some reason, Grassley…Other than Graham. Graham’s the only one that pointed at ’em and told them what they’re gonna do. He called ’em out on it. Didn’t faze ’em. Didn’t faze ’em a bit. He nailed ’em to the wall. He told them exactly what they’re doing and why it isn’t gonna work and how unfair it is. This ongoing whining and moaning about the FBI is nothing more than an attempt to delay and, after that, it’s designed to put a cloud of doubt over Kavanaugh. (impression) “Kavanaugh didn’t want the FBI! The Republicans didn’t want the FBI examining what went on here.“If you’re really innocent, why wouldn’t you want an investigation?” There’s been an investigation! Six FBI background checks of the guy! If we know already that he’s really innocent and Dr. Ford can’t prove what she’s saying, then what is the point? I’m telling you this frustrates people. I’m getting more email about this. The Democrats do not know what they’re doing with this FBI garbage. They are irritating people far more than they are buttressing their forces on the left. Let’s go back to the phones as promised. Worcester, Massachusetts. Steve, you’re next. Hello, sir.CALLER: Hello. Wicked mega dittos, Rush. I’m calling from behind enemy lies here.RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: This is one of the highlights of my life talking to you.RUSH: Thank you, sir.CALLER: I’m part of the silent majority, never having my voice heard anywhere up here, and I’m grateful for this opportunity to converse with you. But what I’m calling about is why I’m not hearing the Republicans make an issue of how Dr. Ford deleted all her social media before her testifying, bringing it to public knowledge. I would consider that destruction of evidence.RUSH: Because they were treating her seriously. They were taking Dr. Ford… It’s a good question. Nobody did bring it up. She did. She had… I don’t even know if she did it or somebody did it. Some of the activists working for her did it. Democrats probably. They scrubbed her social media the minute she was identified. I mean, within, what, a half day of her being identified, they scrubbed her social media. They got it. They deleted it. They erased it.And they didn’t bring it up yesterday because they knew she had no evidence! She didn’t bring anything new! She brought no corroboration! Nothing. All she brought was her heroism and her caring and her, uh … her, uh… her truth. Yeah, that was a favorite word Democrats are using. Yeah. “She came with her truth.” She came with her version. We didn’t get to the truth yesterday. What we got to was she couldn’t prove what she was alleging. And the people she named?I mean, I don’t… I don’t… Heh. (chuckles) The people she named claimed they weren’t there. The Democrats say, ‘But they didn’t say that to the FBI. They said it in a sworn affidavit and sworn affidavits are not enough. Sworn affidavits are never enough!” Oh, really? Well, they clearly were plenty to try to nail Trump! Sworn affidavits left and right to try to go get FISA warrants to spy on Trump! Sworn affidavits here are people claiming under penalty of felony, meaning they know that they are committing a felony by lying; if they get caught, it’s jail time. They sign the affidavits anyway. She had no evidence. So the Republicans… Really, she was treated like a fragile teenager. One gust of wind could have ruined her day! That’s why.Michael in Sterling, Virginia. You are next on the EIB Network. Hello.CALLER: Hey, Rush. How are you? Recent Harvard grad. Always nice to break out echo chamber with you.RUSH: Well! A recent Harvard grad.CALLER: Yeah, and I have some friends back there. People are apparently losing their minds right now in some of the predictable ways. But the question I wanted to ask you, Rush, is: Look, obviously this whole hearing is playing into the popular narrative of Republicans equal anti-woman party. I can’t help but wonder if and when there will be a tipping point with these miscarriages of justice, ultimately the narrative shifts to Democrats becoming the anti-man party. Do you think that will happen, and if so, are we there now, or when does it happen?RUSH: We’re not there now, but it’s a good question. I don’t know how likely it is, but I’ve already seen in a number of places that I scour on a daily basis in show prep — and I’ve had emails from people I know — and the reaction I’m getting from a lot of mothers who have sons is that they’re scared to death. They’re scared to death what they see being done to men here — and Kavanaugh is a choirboy! Kavanaugh is a choirboy.They’re trying to turn a choirboy into a serial rapist who deserves to be behind bars, and then whatever happens to him there, he deserves. Now, if you’re an average, ordinary American mom and you have a couple of sons or a son, and you’re about ready to send him off to where liberals run things like at universities and colleges… And you can already seeing what’s happening with the snowflake movement, the social justice warriors with white privilege, white-privilege males being the reason for all the problems in America.I’m seeing — and it’s all anecdotal. By that I mean I haven’t seen anything scientific in terms of polling data. I’m just aware that — and it’s not reported in the media. This would be one of these things like in the 2002 midterms that the Republicans ended up winning. In the aftermath, they ask people, “What was the reason for your vote?” and they said “values,” and nobody thought values were a part of the 2002 midterm campaign.“It’s midterm House races. What do you mean ‘values’?” It turned out it was the Wellstone memorial. They watched that, and they were appalled by the values they saw there. Values voters came out and won a Republican majority in an off-year election after Bush’s first term. It’s unheard of and nobody saw it coming. We could be at the beginning of something similar to that at the way boys are being treated. They’ve got moms too.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I just ran into this story. This is from our buddies at NewsBusters. “Feminist Author Jill Filipovic Demands Women ‘Divorce Your Republican Husbands’ — [F]eminist author Jill Filipovic … tweeted instructions to her fellow scorned women on how to get back at the man. ‘Divorce your Republican husbands.'” This is why I say, ladies and gentlemen, that I think a lot of political activists are actually victims of psychological issues and are projecting it onto the world of politics.I think… I really do. I think this is the way to explain much of liberalism, that they have victimized so many people, made them think they’re victims. That means they’re helpless, things are hopeless. Everything’s stacked against ’em. Whatever’s wrong in their lives, it’s somebody else’s fault. The Democrat Party has lassoed all these people and has promised to fix things for them by getting even with the people who are responsible for mistreating
’em, which happens to be white, male Republicans.This is so deranged. “Divorce your Republican…”? She’s serious! “Divorce your Republican husbands.” That’s how we get back at what the Republicans are doing to Dr. Ford. “You get even with ’em! You divorce your Republican husband.” She’s serious about it. She’s tweeting it out there. People are treating it seriously. This is deranged. This is a psychological disorder of some merit, some degree. You read something like this and you can’t help laugh at it, and then you realize they’re serious.Get even with the Republicans for what they’ve done to Dr. Ford by divorcing your Republican husband and take him for all he’s worth. Now, somebody tell me that that’s rational. Tell me it’s a rational way to think, that it’s a rational solution to a problem. None of it is rational! But it makes perfect sense if you look at these people rather than being political activists, that they are first people with psychological disorders who have found their way into the political system and been validated.Their psychological disorder, their mess, whatever it is, has been validated by the Democrat Party, which then goes and makes policy based on all of this, and then it finds its way into the curriculum at universities in the form of women’s studies curricula and other such things.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let’s go back to the phones. Stephanie in Savannah, Georgia. You’re next. It’s great to have you here.CALLER: Hi. Good to talk to you. I was calling just as a mom of three young boys 4 years and under. This case has really gotten my attention. You know, right now I’m just trying to keep them from burping at the table and to use their inside voices. But I know as they get older, my husband and I are gonna be teaching them to be gentlemen and to be honest and have good character and — in our house — to be godly men.So I was watching yesterday, and I missed some. Not a lot but I have three little ones so I missed a little bit. Just watching was so discouraging because it breaks my heart that for my boys, even if they do live an upstanding life, that because they’re males, they can be brought down and their lives be ruined if just one female brings an accusation against them.Just because they’re female, they deserve to be believed, apparently. So I just felt bad for Judge Kavanaugh’s parents and for his mom sitting there having to listen to her son defend himself — and his kids — and prove to the whole nation that he’s not a sexual predator. So it just breaks my heart for her. It breaks my heart that nobody has the backs of our boys anymore.RUSH: No, they don’t. No, they don’t. Not right now. It’s become fashionable even for Republicans to accept the idea that there is wanton male abuse out there because everybody wants the women’s vote, just like it was fashionable to agree with the concept of amnesty because everybody wants the Latino or Hispanic vote. Look, you’re one of many mothers from whom I’ve heard with the same concerns.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We got Michelle in Topeka, Kansas, who has been waiting awhile. Hi, Michelle. Great to have you here.CALLER: Hi, Rush. It’s an honor to talk to you. Long-term listener. I am a Midwest mom who is mad as heck — to be nice — at Washington. We watched the hearing, the whatever, the show yesterday.RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: And even my son, who’s 13 years old, comes home from school, watches a couple hours of it, and he goes, “Do they not even understand the law, everybody calling for these FBI investigations?”RUSH: Your 13-year-old son said that?CALLER: Yes! He goes, “They’re idiots,” and I’m like, “Yes, they are,” and I have a son, a stepson. I have six brothers, a husband who’s self-employed, and I’m going, “If they can do this to this judge, what about them?”RUSH: I was gonna say, “How many of them are rapists?”CALLER: None that I know of.RUSH: See, “that (you) know of” is the key.CALLER: (giggles) Judge Kavanaugh, I cried yesterday for him and his family. (choking up) To put somebody that has that kind of standard through that while all the people attacking him…? (groans)RUSH: Michelle?CALLER: Ugh!RUSH: It is that standard that is under frontal and direct assault in this country.CALLER: Well —RUSH: People who live and have the value base of Judge Kavanaugh and his family are exactly what the left is assaulting in this country.CALLER: Exactly.RUSH: Kavanaugh happens to be the front-and-center victim right now, but that is exactly the kind of people and life they are trying to erase from government.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The problem here is… Well, not the problem. The… Well, it is. Brett Kavanaugh, in a certain period in America’s past, would have been considered the epitome of an ideal American man. Well educated, hardworking, a good husband, devoted to family and community, charitable, concerned with others, a great father, great colleague, good boss. Chamber of Commerce kind of guy! I mean, the kind of man that any community would hoist upon a pedestal with pride, who’d be a role model for his own kids and others in town.A Norman Rockwell type of American. Hardworking. Nothing handed. No shortcuts. Everything about Kavanaugh — pretty much every characteristic he has — is a threat to the modern-day left. Kavanaugh is the epitome of the example of how you do not need a big government, how you do not need constant help. He’s a glittering and shining example of the lack of dependence. He’s a man. He does things on his own based on his acceptance of responsibility, combined with maturity.These are things that today people like Kavanaugh are blamed because of, using my theory that left-wing political activists are actually people with psychological disorders who have infected the political system with their disorders, manifested in demands that whoever is responsible for the mistreatment of these people, the government get even with ’em. Well, Kavanaugh is a classic example of a guy who’s responsible for the shortcomings of others simply by virtue of his achievements!The fact that he’s white and Catholic just adds to the fact that they hate him. Now you add that he’s conservative and a judge nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court — which, to the people on the left, the Supreme Court is the embodiment, it’s the last reservoir of maintaining their psychological disorders as national policy. So there’s not a redeeming thing about a man like Brett Kavanaugh to people on the left, and I’m not exaggerating. Some of you might find this a biiiiiit over the top.I honestly don’t think it is.They much prefer sniveling, weak, dependent people.Those people are bendable, flake-able, malleable. Those people can easily be turned into reliable supporters and voters. People like that are unwilling to turn their lives — people like Kavanaugh unwilling to turn their lives — over to government, government agencies, some government official. It’s considered irresponsible to have somebody else tell you how to live your life, good or bad. It’s just not part of the thought process of being an American.You don’t turn to others. Others are not responsible for what happens to you — and your failures, you don’t blame on other people. And then after you fail you don’t get mad at whoever you think wronged you and join the political process and get even with whoever wronged you. Kavanaugh represents the antithesis to all that. He’s not alone. There’s a lot of Kavanaughs in America. Most of them you don’t know about.You know them in your community. They don’t have national acclaim, but there are a lot of them out there, and they represent the target. They’re the ones that have the bull’s-eye on them. He just happens to be very prominent and would have… Well, he’d be one of the top 20 most powerful people in American government as a Supreme Court justice. As such, it cannot be permitted for Kavanaugh to be permitted on the court with this makeup.If the Democrats held the court right now 7-2 or 6-3 in favor of liberals and one of the three conservatives was resigning and Kavanaugh was nominated to replace him? No sweat. They’d confirm him yesterday, maybe. I mean, maybe a big fight, but they wouldn’t go to this length to keep him off of it. The fact that he’s gonna become a genuine No. 5, consistent No. 5 on the conservative side? Unacceptable.Right smack-dab in the middle of all of that is their fear of how he would vote if Roe v. Wade came up again. They are convinced he would vote to overturn it, despite what he has said, despite the fact that that’s not gonna be what happens anyway with Roe v. Wade. And not just Roe v. Wade, but Obamacare and its repeal. He has openly stated that he thinks Obamacare is unconstitutional.So that would go by the wayside, too. So he’s painted a couple of targets on his back rulings-wise, in addition to the target that’s there just because of the kind of man that he is. And not only do they not have any compunction about destroying his life, career, family, they do it eagerly. They do it as they celebrate it. They celebrate the destruction.  "

She was so nice, and she was so thoughtful, and she was heroic,” and all of these other descriptives but none of them mattered.It doesn’t have anything to do with what was at stake yesterday, except if you’re liberal Democrats, where, to them, the nature of the evidence is not of any relevance at all. It’s the seriousness of the charge, which means that it is true. In the same thing, I start getting irritated. It’s why I don’t watch a lot of cable news anymore. I tuned in yesterday when I got home. I wanted to watch the completion of Kavanaugh. I watched his opening statement here and then left and got home in time to see some of the Q&A.And then I turned over to the media, and the media starts analyzing what just happened, and here the guys are on CNN and MSNBC. And they’re acting like (impression), “Everybody thinks that Kavanaugh’s a liar. Every American! Every American thought that Dr. Ford was brilliant and a hero and so honest and so real — and — and — and so caring and so thoughtful and so…” It just drives me nuts that these people start assuming that every American agrees with them.For example, the Democrats say, “Man, this poor woman has been so mistreated. This is really going to inspire our voters!” I thought Democrats didn’t need to be inspired! I thought they were already fired up? There’s more evidence. We’ve got a Pew Research Center poll. Republicans are just as fired up as Democrats are. Fairly close, but Republicans on balance are just as fired up. There’s no particular fired-up advantage that the Democrats have. In the real world, there’s continued evidence. Michael Moore’s movie. Wouldn’t you think…?In an America that just can’t wait to destroy Trump — just can’t wait to fix its mistake of voting for Trump — realizes that they made the gravest error they’ve ever made and they hate Trump now and they’re embarrassed of what they did and they can’t wait to get out there and vote Trump and the Republicans out of office in November — wouldn’t you think a deranged lunatic hate-Trump movie would draw record crowds and raise record revenue? You would think that. But Michael Moore’s movie is bombing everywhere. It’s bombing in the case of ticket sales. It’s bombing revenue-wise.At the Toronto Film Festival, it barely was voted the eighth best. That doesn’t sound like blue wave stuff to me. Doesn’t sound like… I mean, these people, as rabid as they are in their hatred and resentment for Trump, would go anywhere they could to get their taste and fill of it. I’ll tell you what did Michael Moore in, in addition to the fact that I think it’s way, way overblown. I don’t deny there are plenty of people that hate Trump. Don’t misunderstand. We’ve got more Americans than I ever thought possible with psychological disorders who are considered political activists on the left.And they’re out there, and they’re numerous. They’re not the majority of people in this country. I simply refuse to believe that a majority of our population has and is governed by psychological disorders, that psychological disorders determine their politics. I refuse to believe that. Not a majority. But here’s the problem with Moore. He goes out there, produces this anti-Trump movie, and he forgets that audiences don’t have to pay any money to see it. All they have to do is turn on CNN! All they have to do is turn on PMSNBC.All they have to do is read the Washington Post, the New York Times. Why go to a movie, and why pay whatever it costs to go see a movie where you can see the same thing every night, every day over and over again for absolutely zilch? So Moore’s sense of timing, his sense of where the public is, the belief that the country hates Trump? Everywhere you see this, everywhere you see leftists trying to make money or raise money on the basis of Trump hatred, it just bombs. They lost the special election in Texas where the Democrats had carried the district for something like 139 years.In Texas, in the middle of what’s supposed to be a blue wave!  "

It’s gonna be an 11-10 vote with the announcement today by Jeff Flake and Bob Corker that they are going to vote “yes” on Kavanaugh.Democrats on the committee are speechifying and walking out of the committee. The last senator to speak was Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Honestly, I understand Connecticut’s a big blue state, and I understand it’s just overflowing with New York Times-groveling-and-reading voters. Democrats. But this guy Blumenthal… I don’t know how many people know this, and if you did know it, how many of you remembered it. You remember yesterday…? Well, you probably don’t. Blumenthal, when it was his turn to interrogate (if you will) Justice Kavanaugh, came up with a Latin phrase and asked Kavanaugh if he knew what it was.
“Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus.” You know, legal people like to use Latin and throw it around so that we don’t know what they’re talking about. It sounds sophisticated and educated to start tossing around Latin. “Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus.” What it means is… It’s a principle in trial that if a witness is shown to have lied about one thing, then you can go ahead and proceed on the basis that a witness has lied about everything, and this is why it’s always dicey for lawyers to put known liars on the witness stand.This is one of the problems with having defendants testify. If there’s a record of them lying, it’s a legitimate question: “Well, how do we know you’re telling the truth now? “‘Cause I am! I am! I am! I’m not lying now.” But you have, and so it’s just an automatic strike against one’s credibility. The legal principle of “falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus” means that if you lie about one thing, then it’s perfectly acceptable — and even, in some cases, required — to believe that you would lie about everything.I thought, “What a guy to bring that up! Richard Blumenthal!” Richard Blumenthal, senator from Connecticut, lied for years about serving in Vietnam. Not just serving in Vietnam, serving with great valor. He lied for years thinking it would help his resume and that it would counter some of the beliefs that people have about left-wingers being pansies and this kind of thing. So he routinely lies, and the press doesn’t challenge him on it because they don’t want to challenge him on it because they don’t want to believe that he might be lying about it.If anybody came forward and said that he is lying about it, then they would defend him. Finally, the heat got so bad that he had to admit it. To watch him trying to talk about “falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus,” trying to say, “Kavanaugh, you lied about one thing. We can infer you’re lying about everything”? Same goes for you, Senator! Goose for gander. Kettle calling black. Everything works here. If you’re gonna start holding other people up to that standard, then you better look at it and have it apply to yourself.The specific translation for “falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus” means somebody who would lie about his military service will lie about anything. That’s how we seek to define it here. So there he is questioning Kavanaugh — Kavanaugh’s honesty and Kavanaugh’s credibility and so forth. This is the kind of thing that when people find out about it, it just rubs them raw.  "

You’re first on Open Line Friday. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Rush. First, it’s an honor to speak with you. I’m a listener since 1990.RUSH: Thank you very much.CALLER: I have been watching the hearings. I watched them all day yesterday, and, as a rape survivor, I just want to tell you: You don’t forget one minute of the whole thing. You remember the color of the walls, you remember how you got home, you remember the face, you remember the music that was playing, you remember the layout of the house. You don’t forget it, particularly as she said she had PTSD? I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD. You relive that every single day. You never forget it! So I don’t believe one word of this woman, and I feel sorry that I have to say that, because women should be believed. But this is so blatantly political and partisan, I can’t stand it anymore! That’s my comment.RUSH: Well, I’m glad you called. You wanted to get it off your chest.CALLER: Oh, yes.RUSH: Now, wait a minute. Let me just ask you something.CALLER: Yes?RUSH: Are there not some traumas that are so harrowing that victims do repress the memory and forget?CALLER: Not with PTSD. PTSD, part of the symptoms is you relive it every day, and sometimes multiple times.RUSH: A-ha. A good point! She did say PTSD.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: PTSD, in order to have it, you have to have the memory. Is that what you’re saying?CALLER: Well, you know what? Then she had more than one beer, which makes her a perjurer.RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: Okay? My question is —RUSH: Your question is?CALLER: Go ahead. I’m sorry.RUSH: No! What’s your question?CALLER: My question is, “Can Brett Kavanaugh sue for defamation of character?”RUSH: No.CALLER: Why not?RUSH: Well, everything’s possible. In politics, it’s really difficult to do this because of the First Amendment. The First Amendment was really written for political speech. No limits on it whatsoever. So you can defame people in political ads, for example. People have tried to run defamation suits. But they usually end because of this thing called “discovery.” (chuckles) You have to open your life up to the competing client and lawyer. Let me tell you something about PTSD. I know a guy who had to go to drug rehab, and he told me a story about it.One of the things that they do in drug rehab is try to take you back to the earliest memories you have in life that could have caused some kind of psychological disorder, which could have led to your being unable to face reality and looking for ways to numb pain and so forth. And he told me they tried to tell him, based on some stories that he described of this childhood, that he had PTSD because of the way his parents treated him, and he had never…Until he had been told in drug therapy, he’d never considered any of the sort of thing. But they zeroed in on his upbringing and stories he told about growing up. They turned around and said, “You have been traumatized. Your parents traumatized you.” My point is that therapists out there have… There are certain hot issues that go from time to time. PTSD is one, and I’m not informed enough to know what all the different disorders are.But somebody who never thought they had PTSD — it would never even occur that they had Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, especially from the way their parents treated ’em — were told that they had it. Now, if you happen to be somewhat insecure and if you happen to be looking for excuses to explain the things about yourself that you don’t like, and somebody comes along and tells you, “You have PTSD,” it may be easy to believe it. And thereby have a built-in excuse for whatever is wrong with you. I just think it’s interesting that somebody that had never even considered it, they tried to convince him he had it and it was why he was behaving the way he was.  "

But in the space of fourteen days, he and his family have seen that lifetime record of exemplary service spat on, courtesy of the today’s Democrat party.And, even now, they are unapologetic. They have no shame or remorse for what they unleashed on Judge Kavanaugh, Dr. Blasey Ford, the confirmation process, and the country.Judge Kavanaugh fought to reclaim the honor of his good name, which liberals tried to destroy so viciously. He deserves to sit on the court. He always has.What Democrats and their media allies deserve is another matter entirely. And not fit for young or old ears in this form.  "

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/27/callers-have-their-say-on-the-hearing/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 27, 2018RUSH: So let’s grab the phones while we have some time here before the hearing resumes and we’ll start with Michelle in Pennsylvania. Hi. Your turn. What do you think?CALLER: I don’t know where to start, Rush. Let me start by saying I am a recent convert to your show during the Obama years, and I thank you for what you do to enlighten us. I am a 52-year-old woman. In 1989, I was 23 years old, and I was the victim of a serious sexual assault. When I say sexual assault, I mean rape. I have a problem with people saying “sexual assault.” Anyways, I don’t forget one detail of what happened that New Year’s Eve by no fault of my own.I remember the man’s name.I remember what he looked like.I remember his eye color.I remember what he wore.I remember being trapped in that specific house and not being able to leave.So this woman, this doctor, this educated woman is just making my blood boil. And I don’t want to pass judgment on her situation. I wasn’t there; so I can’t say. And I know everybody deals with trauma differently. But I find it very hard to believe that this educated, accomplished woman doesn’t understand these questions, doesn’t know her vocabulary. I just don’t get it, and I’m very upset.RUSH: Let me ask you this, because I have a question for you, and this is what it’s gonna all come down to for everybody at the end of the day here. Do you believe, according to…? After having listened to her, do you believe that happened to her in a room in a house at around 1982 at around sometime after 6 o’clock at night approximately? Do you believe something happened to this woman?CALLER: Again, I don’t want to pass judgment on another gal’s situation. I would have liked to have been able to see what was going on. I was just —RUSH: No, but I’m asking you to.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: This is what these senators are gonna have to decide, “Did something happen to her?” And then if the answer to that is “yes” then, okay. Do they believe her that it was Kavanaugh (she’s unequivocal, 100%) or are they gonna believe Kavanaugh’s denial later? Do you believe that she’s being truthful that something happened? I’m not asking you now if Kavanaugh did it. Do you believe now based on the way she’s told the story — and you can add your own experience in if you want. But you’re just watching this today. Do you believe something happened to her as she describes it?CALLER: I think she thinks something happened to her and I think something might have happened to her at some point in her life. But whether she is coming forth of her own volition or she’s being wound up by political parties with an agenda? That’s another affair. But I don’t think… In this country, you cannot just assassinate a person’s character without some kind of evidence. I can tell you that friends and families of mine could vouch for something that happened to me back then. There were specific timelines. People knew what happened.RUSH: Because you told them.CALLER: Because I did. You’re darn right I did. So something doesn’t add up. So my question to these senators is, “What is not adding up?”RUSH: Well, it depends on which senators you talk to.CALLER: And I get that.RUSH: But let me just answer your question. We most certainly can in America today. You’re watching it happen. We most certainly can destroy a life. We can destroy a career. We can destroy exceptional achievement. We can destroy a future and a past, and we can destroy a family.CALLER: You can.RUSH: We’re watching it happen! We absolutely are. The Democrats are more than willing to do that. That’s what we’re up against, and that’s one of the reasons our people are hamstrung. They don’t know quite how to deal with people who are willing to do that. Here, imagine this setup. We’re up against people who have no compunction whatsoever about doing just that, and what is our reaction? “We can’t be seen as bullies!” They can bully Kavanaugh all day, and they’re going to.They can embark on a political course of action that will result in Brett Kavanaugh’s life, career, accomplishments and achievements being wiped out and destroyed, his future — and who knows what it’s gonna do to his family. They can do that all day long. They’re doing it. We’re saying to ourselves, “We gotta be real careful ’cause we can’t appear to be unfair or bullying of the woman who is making it possible.” You’re absolutely right.There is no corroborating evidence for this, and there isn’t gonna be when this is over. She’s offered nothing new. She’s offered no new evidence, no new proof, no nothing. Nothing new, nothing’s changed. Yet tune to the media, and the media is convinced — even our media, Fox News — it’s over. It may as well be over. The Democrats are hitting grand-slam home runs with every five-minute segment; the Republicans are not even on the field.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: It’ll be interesting to see if the Republicans on the committee are as frustrated as some of you are about how the morning has gone. It’ll be interesting to see what strategery has been changed during the recess here, what procedural changes there might be. Now, Dr. Ford said something else that, to me, is contradictory. One of the people supposedly in the room when this assault happened was a friend of hers. The friend’s name is Leland Keyser, and Dr. Ford mentioned her again today as being there, but Keyser remembers neither Kavanaugh nor the incident. And she’s a friend.I’ve got time to squeeze in another call here. Pat in Chicago. You’re next. Hello.CALLER: Hi, Rush. It’s truly a great honor to speak with you.RUSH: Thank you very much. I appreciate that.CALLER: I heard everything that I needed to hear after her opening statement. I was writing down some notes as she was reading her opening statement.RUSH: Yeah?CALLER: She indicated that both Kavanaugh and Judge were, quote, “inebriated and belligerent” and that they had been drinking prior to coming to this residence. She indicated she can schedule a floor plan so she remembers that portion of it. She said she had one beer, which sounds very contrived by her attorneys because she didn’t want to say she was drunk and she was a participant in it. So let’s say she did have one beer and Kavanaugh and Judge had been drinking.They obviously had a lot of alcohol in their system, and 30 minutes later she decides she’d gotta go to bathroom, according to her. So they’re obviously more drunk than they were when she got there. So they’re beyond belligerent. They’re beyond inebriated. So there’s four or five people in there, whatever she determines — you know, whichever way the wind’s blowing — whenever she’s writing the article. There’s no music on downstairs. So in an unfamiliar house, she goes upstairs to find a bathroom.There’s no bathroom on the first floor? There wasn’t a half bath there? What was she doing, going to take a shower? She goes upstairs for some reason by herself, and these two belligerent and inebriated boys that were making all kinds of racket somehow snuck up behind her without her knowing and pushed her into a bedroom. Because she didn’t turn around, she couldn’t hear anything behind her with these boys that were just totally drunk and out of control.But somehow, they made it up the steps behind her, and they were super quiet. So they push her into this bedroom, they push her down on the bed, and for some reason in this bedroom there’s music playing, according to her, when there’s nobody in there. So the music isn’t playing downstairs where the people are. The music is playing upstairs and Kavanaugh cranks the music so it’s real loud, so when he puts his hand over her mouth no one can hear her scream.Okay? So he’s got this loud music up. She eventually gets away and runs into the bathroom that’s off the bedroom and she says she locks the door. Now, did she say Kavanaugh after this — if he’s trying to rape her — comes over and jiggles the handle? You know, he don’t (sic) want to be shut down. Did he jiggle the handle? No. What did he do? He and Mark Judge went over, turned the music down so she could hear them, not only —RUSH: Hold your thought. I gotta break. Hold your thought. Right at that very moment.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Pat in Chicago. Please resume where you were. Kavanaugh had just turned down the music in the bedroom, which was the only room in the house apparently during the party where there was music on.CALLER: Right. After his attempted rape — which we’re told by the professionals that rape is about power, rape is about control. So after he is stymied of raping this girl and she gets away from him and escapes and goes into the bedroom — I’m sorry, to the bathroom that’s off the bedroom and locks the door, what does he do? Does he try and take away more power from her? No. He turns down the music so she can hear what’s going on so she knows that it’s safe for her to come out, and she claims that she could hear ’em going down and bouncing off the walls.They weren’t bouncing off the walls when they came up, they were stealthy. But when they went down they were bouncing off the walls, which gave her an opportunity to escape. So she unlocks the bathroom door, and instead of immediately going over, closing the bedroom door and locking it — ’cause you know it’s the same lock; so if you can get through the bedroom door, you can get through the bathroom door — and looking for a phone in the bedroom and saying, “Hey, so-and-so, you brought me to this party. You dropped me off.“I’m having some problems here with a guy. I need you to come pick me up right now. I don’t feel safe.” Does she do that? No! What does she do? She walks downstairs, and according to her testimony knowing that she had to walk past them, walked out outside. Now, Kavanaugh’s this great athlete; right? So what prevented him from chasing her? Why would she go outside? Why would she open herself up to that? She’s in a strange neighborhood.She can’t even define where this house is. She goes outside not having any mode of transportation to take her anywhere that she wants to go, and she goes outside by herself. Did she take her friend with her? Where’s Leland? Why didn’t she say, “Leland, he just tried to attack me! Stay with me until I get somewhere safe.” Did she do that? No, she doesn’t. To piggyback off what you said, after being freed and she’s safe, wouldn’t you think she would know what happened next after that?RUSH: Well, that’s the thing. I mean, picking up where you left off, the thing that is really hard to believe is that she can’t remember how she got away from there!CALLER: Because she was never there.RUSH: She can’t remember how she got home. I don’t know how you would forget that. How would you…? That’s your escape! That’s how you get to safety. That’s how you rewrap yourself in your cocoon of security. She can’t remember that. She would have had to have made decisions. Was she gonna walk, catch a cab, call mom and dad, hitchhike, ask somebody at the party, “Is there somebody who can drive me?” We don’t know. She can’t tell us how she got out of there.CALLER: So in this case, you know, it’s basically her “witnesses,” quote, unquote. They will not corroborate what she’s saying. Her best friend — this Leland who was her best friend — said it never happened. She was never there.RUSH: Right.CALLER: Now, in a case like this, let’s say it’s, “he said, she said.” In a case like that that’s 35-year-olds, in my book plausibility determines credibility, and if anybody finds her story plausible, they’re sick in the head.RUSH: Well, it’s more than that. This story — uncorroborated, no evidence, no witnesses. Is this what you will use to disqualify a nominee about whom everything else in life we know? We know his achievements. We know his decisions. We know his writings. Through six FBI investigations, we know everything there is to know about this guy except for this one tale which can’t be corroborated, for which there’s no evidence. Are we gonna keep a guy off the court for that, balancing this, what we’re hearing today against what we know about the rest of and the entirety of his life?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Lindsey Graham was just being interviewed by the media, the media scrum following the break in the hearings, and he was fit to be tied over this. He said he didn’t hear one thing to change anything, that she didn’t corroborate anything. She did not. He doesn’t doubt anything happened to her, but Kavanaugh is unequivocal it didn’t happen. He’s got three witnesses that say they weren’t there when Ford says they were there. He made the point (summarized), “They want an FBI investigation?“You couldn’t even get a search warrant for this because she doesn’t know where it happened! She doesn’t know where it happened, she doesn’t know precisely when it happened, she doesn’t know how she got home when it was over.” He thought that the Republican prosecutor had done a good job. I don’t think the Republican prosecutor had enough time to close her case. That’s just me. We go back to the phones now to Washington. Kathryn, you’re next. I really appreciate your waiting, and hello.CALLER: Hi. How are you, Rush?RUSH: Fine and dandy. Thank you very much.CALLER: I was just calling in because I am similar to Christine Ford in some ways. I have a PhD, I went to a really excellent college, and 20 years ago, I was raped. But what is different about me is that there is no way I would ruin that man’s life. I mean, I’ve forgiven him, and I’ve had to do that to get on with my life. The idea that someone would say something just to ruin their life is just wrong.RUSH: This is why the Republican prosecutor was attempting to establish, that Christine Ford is the product of a Democrat Party operation, because the Democrat Party will destroy people to stop their opponents from winning. You’re not a political person. You don’t think this way. They do! This is exactly how they think. They are using her. She didn’t come forward on her own; I don’t care what anybody says. They’re using her to get this done.CALLER: And it’s so insulting to people that were actually raped, I have to say (chuckles), and it’s so insulting to people with any kind of human decency. That’s —RUSH: Well, we’re not… (chuckles) Again, you know, I may be out on… This is not thin ice. We’re not dealing with decency here. We are in the mire and muck of politics where indecency is the objective of the Democrat Party whenever politics is involved, and that’s why you’re having trouble relating. You can’t see yourself destroying the life of your rapist, even though some people wouldn’t blame you!CALLER: No. I… (chuckles) You know, you sound just like my husband, which is funny, because he listens to you all the time. And, you know, he says the same thing. He’s like, “You just don’t get it. I can’t try and explain to you how a liberal thinks,” and that’s why I started listening. He’s listened to your show for years but I’ve recently started listening more so that I can be aware, because it’s just so mind-blowing, if I could say anything.RUSH: I know exactly what you can’t relate to, and that’s precisely because you’re not cut from that cloth. Many people are. Hang on, Kathryn. I want to just say one more thing to you.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Kathryn, Washington. You’re back. I want to share something with you. You admitted that your husband is telling you how political the left is or Democrats are and you have trouble recognizing it. You’re not alone there. I want to share with you maybe a way to help you understand just who they are and a way to maybe help you logically spot it when you see it. My whole life, I have been struggling to find the way to tell people who are not as politically oriented as I am or not political junkies what liberalism is and who liberals are and why they are a danger.Because most people don’t look at people’s ideology. They judge other things. I finally stumbled across… I’ve always had this in the back of my mind, but I’ve never been able to come up with the words. I was reading a little blurb by a columnist at National Review named Jim Geraghty, and he nailed it. It was not a big, long piece. It was almost kind of like a throwaway line. Essentially, he said that it struck him that what liberalism is — what the Democrat Party is — is people with psychological disorders who are now politicizing those disorders and blaming various institutions or America at large for their disorders.CALLER: Mmm-hmm.RUSH: And I’m telling you, that is… As far as I look at them, I think it’s exactly right, and that’s why so much of liberalism is tough to understand because it defies logic. People try to say, “Well, that’s just who liberals are,” but it doesn’t make sense to you because it defies logic. But the way to give you an example. What is the Black Lives Matter movement? It’s hatred of all cops.CALLER: Right.RUSH: The theory is these are groups made up of people who may have had a bad experience with cops. Maybe they’ve been affected by it one way or the other and they’ve got some kind of disorder related to it, and they blow it up into being all cops are bad and all of America that supports authority is bad. But when they enter the political realm with it for solutions and answers is when people lose understanding. You know, if you’ve got a psychological disorder, deal with it somewhere else. It’s not politics’s responsibility to deal with all of these various problems that people have.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: And if you look at the constituency groups in the Democrat Party, it’s one group after another which are not happy. They’re constantly miserable. They just — they — (sigh)CALLER: Blame other people for their problems.RUSH: Oh, yeah. That’s part of it. Victimology.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: So that, to me, nailed it even though it’s one of those things where when I saw that characterization? Bingo! It’s what I’ve always thought, never was able to come up with the words myself to express it. I mean, look at the arguments we are having. I mean, we are shutting down states. We’ve got boycotts of states over the fact that some states wanted to pass a law saying that boys couldn’t use the girls’ bathroom and vice-versa. We’re in the midst of a hearing over whether or not somebody should be denied a seat on the court because he’s been accused of sexual abuse.Yet the same people think it’s okay for little boys and little girls to go to the bathroom together because they have to accommodate the latest fad or cause which is transgenderism and so forth. And it’s things like that… Militant feminism? It’s irrational. These women are angry. Something has happened to them in their lives, and their rage and anger, they take it out now on the country or on all men or men in “the powerful majority,” which is white Christian men and so forth. How do you deal with psychological disorders?You can’t when it enters the political arena, because psychological disorders, those are victims of something, and they are… So politics now has to make an accommodation for all of this, and there just isn’t any common ground. The Democrats are using all of this to win elections and to advance and change definitions of morality and normalcy and so forth. You just try to look at things you don’t understand and rather than say, “That’s just the Democrats.” No. There’s a reason for it, and they are embracing and promoting these various psychological disorders as legitimate political causes.These people in these groups are happy for the Democrats to take it on because the Democrats promise ’em they’re gonna fix it. The Democrats promise to fix it, and fixing it means getting even the people who did whatever was done to them. So it becomes the politics of punishment and revenge and getting’ even with people who didn’t do anything to anybody! Affirmative action! And not just with African-Americans. Affirmative action with women. People who have never mistreated anybody get punished, by virtue of new policy that is enacted to appease the Democrat Party sponsoring this stuff.And it creates an ongoing war in the country.Groups of people end up being pitted against one way or another precisely because of all this, and that’s why there isn’t any common ground. That’s why there is no more crossing the aisle and cooperating and understanding and so forth, because the people on the left have no interest in cooperation or getting along. They want blood. They want vengeance. They want punishment for whoever it is that did whatever happened to them.And the Democrat Party is right there to make them think that they’re gonna get it done. It’s sad. It really is. But look. Kathryn, thank you. I’m glad you called. It’s not easy for you to call here and say what you said and to enter into this discussion. You know, they told Dr. Ford she was brave today for doing what she did. So are you. I’m glad you called.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/27/fords-curious-answers-on-her-polygraph-test/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 27, 2018RUSH: We continue our assessment here of the hearings so far. And, remember, Kavanaugh has yet to come, yet to appear. He will go last, and it’s gonna go on for much of the rest of the afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We, as a note to our affiliates… I know many of you are going wall-to-wall with this. We here at the EIB Network understand. We, obviously, will not. We are interspersing. We are joining it in progress here and there, salient comments from me in real time as the hearings take place.I want to share just a few more observations with you and then we get to your phones because they’re in a lunch break right now and they’ll come back, eh, probably in 20 minutes or so and resume. The media. I have done a quick survey during the break here at the top of the hour. On the media, I don’t care where you go — you go to Fox, you go to CNN, you go anywhere — they think that the Republicans are blowing it.That they’re not accomplishing anything, that the prosecutor and this technique is a total waste of time, that the Democrats are hitting home run after home run after home run after home run. That is the media assessment. If you go to social media and you take a quick perusal there, you find a different picture. I found some Facebook people (and there are some serious discussions out there) who believe — and these are not media people.It’s just the American people watching this on TV who think that the prosecutor is scoring a lot of points because the prosecutor is catching Dr. Ford in a lot of inconsistencies, is exposing a lot of inconsistencies and a lot of what might be lies. That Dr. Ford is making her memory explicitly clear on a few things and on other things not at all. That is an inconsistency. She does appear to remember what she wants to remember pretty well, but it is random. For example, she doesn’t know who paid for her polygraph.I have never taken a polygraph. Mr. Snerdley, does anybody know how much they cost? I don’t know how much a polygraph costs. I didn’t have time to check during the break. You might assume they’re relatively expensive, but maybe not. It was at an off-site location. It was in a hotel conference room near an airport. It was done secretly. She doesn’t know who paid for it. Her description of it was unnerving. Her description of the polygraph was similar to her description of the assault.She was nervous and crying, and she described it as being all over her body and that the polygraph official, the guy who took the polygraph… She described him as being behind her. (impression) “He was behind meeeee.” She felt very closed in in this process. Now, the guy that did the polygraph was on Fox last night and said there were only two questions. Shannon Bream on Fox had the polygraph expert on last night, the guy who administered it, and there were only two questions.But she made it sound like it was a traumatic experience. She doesn’t know who paid for it. No one’s asking about that. There’s a lot of questions that are not being asked here. One really curious thing, to me, is she said she didn’t know that Senator Grassley had offered to send Judiciary Committee staff to California. When they found out she’s afraid of flying and couldn’t come to Washington, she was invited. It was in the media. It was everywhere.It was widely known that the committee had made every effort to get to her, including offering to fly out there. She claimed not to know that! She seemed to be genuinely surprised by that today. Now, why doesn’t she know that? Did her lawyers not tell her that? Did her lawyers withhold the Senate Judiciary Committee offer from her? When this all came up, one of her attorneys jumped to the microphone and the attorney, Katz (the Democrat, Soros-funded activist) covered Dr. Ford’s microphone with her hand and would not let her answer this question.And then eventually they had these little powwows and Dr. Ford said (impression), “Oh, I — I — I would have gladly welcomed you to my home if… I’m…” Look, I’m not… This is just how she speaks. You know me; I’m an impressionist here, folks. She has a speech pattern. I don’t want to repeat myself on that.  I’ve addressed it twice in the previous hour. But she has a definite speech pattern called up-talking, which emphasizes… You raise your tone on the last word of the sentence. It promotes vulnerability, youth. (demonstrating) “It’s how young girls talk?”Everything’s open-ended, unsure. It’s totally innocent. Um… (interruption) It’s $200 to $800 for a typical two-hour polygraph. Walmart sells a polygraph machine for a hundred bucks. If you want the Mac Daddy, it’s 121 bucks. (interruption) “Can you get the Mac Daddy at Walmart?” Yeah, I… (interruption) But is…? (interruption) No. Let me rephrase. Is the Mac Daddy of all polygraph machines available at Walmart, or is it…? (interruption) Well, okay. That’s what I’m getting at. Some polygraph machines cost $2,000.Okay, it’s like an EKG machine. You can get an EKG machine on your watch now, you know, for 400 bucks, but a real EKG machine is gonna seat you back thousands. I don’t know. She didn’t know. She professed not to know that the committee had offered to come to California. So I don’t know if her lawyers didn’t tell her because they didn’t want… The whole point of this has been delay, delay, delay, delay. Here’s another thing. A bunch of leftist media types are saying, “Does this woman look like a leftist hack?“Does this woman look like somebody who’s part of a leftist conspiracy who’s trying to bring down a conservative? She doesn’t come cross that way at all!” She does to me. I’m sorry, but that’s exactly how she comes across. This is who they are, if you ask me! But remember, I am a lifelong student of the left. I know them as well as they know themselves. Maybe I know them better, because many of them are not honest about who and what they actually are. Many left-wing activists don’t think they’re left wing.Many of them don’t even think they’re activists. There is no such thing as liberalism. They just are what’s right. They are just what’s normal. This hearing today does not change my perception that we, on the right, don’t really know what we’re up against. And it’s not entirely our fault. But I do believe that liberalism — what everybody thinks it is — has kind of been taken over by what I think are people who have legitimate psychological disorders, and they have now sought the realm of politics to address those disorders and grievances.So liberalism has basically become the home of people with psychological disorders and problems, and the Democrat Party has become their champion. Part and parcel of this is becoming a victim, and when you become a victim, nothing is ever your fault, and being a failure or being less than you can be or whatever? It’s not your fault. It’s somebody else’s. There’s always somebody to blame for what you aren’t, somebody to blame for what you are, somebody to blame for what has happened to you, somebody to blame for what wasn’t happened to you.It is the normalization of psychological disorders that is what we’re up against here in many ways. This is a woman who has a doctorate in some kind of psychology and did not know what “exculpatory” means. She was being asked… A Democrat senator was setting her up for a grand-slam home run. “You realize coming forward that with an FBI investigation…” The Democrats are making a big deal over the fact there hasn’t been one, and they’re trying to make it look like she’s very brave for asking for an FBI investigation.“Because you realize, Dr. Ford, that an FBI investigation could produce evidence that would substantiate yourself case?” “Oh, yes, sir!” “And you’re aware that an FBI investigation could also come up with exculpatory evidence?” (impression) “Uhhh, I’m sorry, Senator. I — I don’t know what… Exculpatory? What — what is that?” And I’m saying, “How can that be?” But then Ocasio-Cortez, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has a degree in economics from Boston University and doesn’t know the first thing about it.

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/27/remember-this-everything-ford-says-remains-uncorroborated/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 27, 2018RUSH: Here’s the thing to remember here, folks — and I hope that this point is made throughout the day and when this is over. When this is over, every bit of what Dr. Ford is saying here will remain uncorroborated. Every bit of it. When she’s finished, there isn’t a single witness that can or has corroborated what she’s saying. In the interval between now and the end of this, Judge Kavanaugh will have his time before the committee.He’ll have his opening statement, he’ll have the questions, and the prosecutor will not be asking him any questions. She’s just there to query Dr. Ford. So it’s gonna boil down to who you believe. It’s gonna boil down to who has more credibility, and Chris Wallace at Fox News has weighed in that he believes… I’ve already lost the number of the bite. But you’ve got that, I know. Yeah, here it is. This is Chris Wallace during the break about half an hour ago, his initial reaction to this…WALLACE: So far, we’ve heard from six people: Rachel Mitchell three times for three senators, three Democratic senators speaking for themselves. This is a disaster for the Republicans. You’re exactly right. She is treating this like a deposition, like a court hearing. She hasn’t gotten anything from this woman. Meanwhile, the Democrats are landing haymakers. “What do you remember most?” “I remember the laughter of the boys as they were laughing at my expense.” “To what degree of certainty do you know that it was Brett Kavanaugh?” “With a hundred percent certainty!”RUSH: There. So that reaction is probably pretty common throughout the media, and the reason is that there’s so high expectations here. There isn’t any corroborating evidence. The woman’s got holes in the story. Her dates and times are unknown, unconfirmed. And yet none of that has been exposed. None of it! None of her flaws. None of the inaccuracies, inconsistencies in her story have yet been exposed.Some people think, “You know what? This is a bad idea. Senators ought to be asking the questions.” Folks, it’s six of one, half dozen of the other. If male Republican senators were bearing in and bearing down on her, you know what the reaction to that would be. They have decided, I’m sure, that the overall atmosphere here is not going to be interpreted as unfair or the witness being bullied.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Richard Blumenthal is falling all over himself right now in his five minutes, the senator from Connecticut. (impression) “I believe you. This is such a teachable moment. You’re a great teacher and I think you’re very brave. You’re so courageous. I remember when I lied to people about having served with valor in Vietnam, and I believed that lie for a long time until it was called out on me. But my voters don’t care! I was elected anyway.”Now, he didn’t say that, but that’s what I think when I’m watching the guy, because that’s who he is. So it’s hard to stay focused on what really matters here. In some cases, it’s hard to know what does matter. The purpose of this is to get beyond it so that there can be a vote on Kavanaugh tomorrow. Well, is what’s happening here today going to move that forward and facilitate that or not? Now, in that regard, is it the television impact of this or the substance of this (assuming they’re gonna be different things) that will move the vote tomorrow?That’s gonna be totally up to Grassley and how he interprets what all happened today. But so far, in her opening statement and in all of the preguntas that she has been asked and all the things she’s answered, there isn’t a shred of anything new, ladies and gentlemen. There is nothing new. There is not a new memory of anything of substance. There is not a new fact. There isn’t a new recollection that would buttress something previously not quite remembered.There’s none of that.Nothing new.Nothing definitive.And at the end of it, none of it will have been corroborated. Not a single bit of Dr. Ford’s allegations to this day have been corroborated. From the beginning of this, every allegation she made has been uncorroborated. The Democrats, the media even tried to play a trick with that this week by saying, “Well, there’s affidavits from four people who she told the story to. Four people have corroborated what happened!” No, they didn’t “corroborate what happened.” They corroborated that she told them what happened.There isn’t any corroboration for this whatsoever, and there isn’t going to be. Does Brett Kavanaugh have a way of blowing all this up and having people begin to question Dr. Ford’s assertions here and her credibility as Justice Thomas did during the Anita Hill hearings? You know, I’m like everybody else watching this with random observations here, and her voice is one. She sounds very young. She didn’t know what the word “exculpatory” meant. She appeared… I’m not making this up.She appeared not to know that the Senate would be the ones confirming the nominee and the Judiciary Committee would handle this. She also said that she didn’t want to go to the media but did after “beach friends” advised her to go to the Washington Post. So they sent this anonymous thing to the Washington Post. The Washington Post didn’t react to it, which means they must not have thought much of it. So when the Washington Post didn’t react, they said, “Well, why don’t you try the New York Times.” She was asked, “Well, did your congresswoman advise you to do this? “No!” Very quick with the answer “no” on that.

Surprisingly, the Drive-By-Media is actually reporting that.According to Politico, one of Swetnick’s ex-boyfriends filed a restraining order against her. After their four-year relationship ended, he says she threatened his wife and baby. He told Politico Swetnick isn’t credible. “Not at all” he said.Swetnick’s ex is a registered Democrat, by the way. He says he has a lot of evidence that would disprove her claims about Judge Kavanaugh, but wants to talk to a lawyer first.Porn-lawyer Michael Avenatti, Swetnick’s accomplice in bringing her smears forward, responded that he had no idea about the restraining order filed against his client.He accused Politico of attacking a sexual-assault victim. He called the story “outrageous” and slammed the media for “digging” into his client’s past. The porn lawyer thinks nobody should report about Ms. Swetnick’s checkered past.This is today’s Democrat Party at work, folks. Watch how they operate.

That would be mine. I wrote myself a note so I wouldn’t forget the question. The question is… Because they’re telling us here that now we got three witnesses. They can’t all be lying. We have Blasey Ford, we have Ramirez, and now we have Swetnick. The Drive-Bys and the advocates that are against Kavanaugh are saying, “Well, they wouldn’t lie! They must be telling the truth. There’s no way three or four people would lie about the same thing.”Okay.Well, Donald Trump said there was no collusion between him, his campaign, and Russia. Carter Page said that there was no collusion between him and his work and his business and the Russians. Paul Manafort said that there was no collusion. He has no knowledge of any collusion between the Russians and Trump and he didn’t do any. So we got three people there who all day long say that there was no collusion. They must be telling the truth, right?Because there’s no way three different people would all lie about the same thing. Does it work that way? Obviously not. I make a facetious point. But if Blasey Ford, Ramirez, and Swetnick tell three disparate, different stories all with the same conclusion that Kavanaugh is some sexual reprobate?“They must be telling the truth. Three different people would not lie!”Well, Trump, Manafort, Carter Page all say no collusion. I guess they’re telling the truth too.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/26/conservative-caller-blasts-elmer-fudd/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 26, 2018RUSH: Here’s Michael in Brooklyn. I’m glad you waited. You’re next here on the Rush Limbaugh program. Hi.CALLER: Hello, Rush. How are you?RUSH: Fine. Thank you.CALLER: No one in your audience should be surprised or shocked at what the Democrats are doing. They telegraphed who they were in ’91. They nearly destroyed a man — and that was just a black conservative replacing a black liberal. This confirmation was the most important confirmation in our lifetimes, tipping the court. So what did the GOP do? They put Elmer Fudd at the chair. Republicans can’t go for cameras and tell us how flimsy — including Mitch McConnell, how flimsy — Blasey Ford’s story is without, at the same time, telegraphing how incompetent Grassley was. You can’t have it both ways. The Democrats come to fight. They come to battle. Republicans want to be statesmen, and they don’t know how to fight. I’ll ask you one question.RUSH: Yeah?CALLER: If Grassley was bribed to sabotage Kavanaugh’s confirmation, how would it look any different than it looks now?RUSH: (laughing)CALLER: Please, answer me. Somebody… What needs to happen is there needs to be out of this hopefully like a phoenix, conservative —RUSH: Okay.CALLER: We need a national Conservative Party. The GOP’s gone. Conservatives… I mean, I’m from New York, so we have a separate Conservative Party.RUSH: We don’t have that now. That’s an argument for another day. That doesn’t get Kavanaugh on the court. BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Guess what? (laughing) Elmer Fudd has just opened up the possibility of another hearing to handle this babe that’s come forward today. I say “Elmer Fudd” because our caller from Brooklyn referred to Senator Grassley as “Elmer Fudd.”The headline (it’s Washington Times) is “Charles Grassley Opens Door to Second Hearing After Third Kavanaugh Accuser Surfaces.” Now, what the caller from Brooklyn meant was, in the game of optics there’s no way the Republicans win this, right? That’s what he meant. You got Grassley. Take your pick of any of them out there.Jeff Flake is now saying he’s getting death threats, and no matter how this ends it’s gonna be a cloud over everybody when it’s over no matter how the vote goes. People are now starting to dig into Julie Swetnick. Well, they’re digging into her story. You have to be really careful here.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This is Hannah in Hartsville, South Carolina.  I’m glad you called.  Welcome.CALLER:  Thanks for having me on, Rush.  How are ya?RUSH:  Fine and dandy.  Thank you.CALLER:  Good.  I’m a conservative Millennial here in South Carolina, and I just want to tell you I’m so grateful for your voice. It is so needed; we couldn’t do it without.RUSH:  Well, thank you very much.CALLER:  To get on to my question, I wanted to see if you thought that there were any indicators on how Murkowski, Collins, and Flake will vote.  You know, we have this sideshow going, but it really comes down to what happens on Friday morning.  I also want to know, do you think…? Since Grassley went ahead and scheduled the vote for Friday morning, do you think that that’s an indicator that he believes he has the votes to confirm Kavanaugh?RUSH:  Normally, I would say yes to that.  I think for the most part, yeah, you could think that that’s what Chairman Grassley believes.  But this wrench thrown into the mix today is going to, I think, kind of confuse whatever thinking existed.  The hearing tomorrow is just Blasey Ford.  Now we’ve got this latest edition brought to us by the porn star attorney, and it may be the tipping point.  This may be the jumping-the-shark moment in all this.  As for Murkowski and Collins, nobody knows how they’re leaning.  They haven’t said.  Murkowski, however, has backed off one thing.  Earlier in the week, Senator Murkowski was suggesting that an FBI investigation into Blasey Ford’s incident would be very helpful. I mean, if the FBI could look into this and declare something, it would be very helpful.  She has since walked back her demand for an FBI investigation and she is saying this is not about a Supreme Court nomination; this is about whether or not a woman is to be believed.  That was Senator Murkowski.  Senator Collins is holding her decision or cards closer to the vest.  In my mind, I don’t know how either of these women can look at what’s happening today and in any way side with the Democrats on this. But I’m not there and I’m not them.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/26/we-hear-from-a-transmogrified-conservative/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 26, 2018RUSH: Grand Rapids, Michigan. This is Diane. Thank you for waiting. It’s your turn.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Thank you for taking my call.RUSH: Yes, ma’am.CALLER: So I am a converted-by-my-husband conservative. So I’ve been paying attention to this Kavanaugh business. I’m listening, reading, and just looking at this woman, the new accuser and her accusations, the first thing that popped into my head — which you may have already answered in your last segment — was, “If she’s truly seeking justice,” which is what we have to assume they would be doing, “why wouldn’t she have named the man who actually raped her or held her down or any of that, but possibly a couple of guys who were standing in line in maybe another room, if that’s how she described it all? Doesn’t she see that this is just making such a mockery of women who actually have valid…?RUSH: No. I’m convinced that there’s not… People give lip service to that aspect of this, but obviously that’s not a factor or none of this would be happening at all. If people were worried about the effect this is having on women who really, really have been abused and raped and mistreated, that’s nothing but words. I don’t think… It sounds good and it makes you look like you’re thoughtful and so forth, but I don’t think that enters into anybody’s minds on the Democrat side in this. That’s out the window.Your question, however, she is at these “rape train” parties and after the tenth one it happens to her but she only remembers the guy standing around. She only remembers the guy who spiked the punch but she doesn’t remember the guy who did the nasty. Now, maybe because she was scared, panicked, traumatized, drunk, drugged, or what have you. It was dark. There could be any number of explanations for that. But you still do remember two other people.How do you do that? How do you so easily remember the two people that weren’t actually doing that? They just were in the setup phase like the grounds crew, you know, getting the playing field ready to go, and they go to the dugout while the action happens. You remember those guys. But you don’t remember the perp. That’s a good question, Diane. Do you have an answer yourself for it? Can you put yourself in her shoes and how would that be?CALLER: Well, other than stating the obvious, that it seems to be a possible witch hunt and that she’s just being used. Like you said, you had a caller yesterday who they’ve been looking for people to do this all summer. So she just happens to be somebody willing to step up and put herself out there. But to me it’s just unbelievable because she’s a woman and if she had a valid complaint, you would think she would have come forward long before this.RUSH: Well, she had to make sure her coming forward made a difference, mattered.CALLER: Right.RUSH: It had to be after everything else had bombed out. You have an interesting pedigree. You said you were a relatively new conservative. You used to be a liberal; is that right?CALLER: That is correct.RUSH: Okay. How long ago was it that your transmogrification occurred?CALLER: (giggles) Well, it wasn’t that recent. When I started dating my husband, he listened to you daily. We probably still have boxes of cassette tapes of your show in your garage somewhere.RUSH: You need to send those to Legacybox. You need to save those! Can you still listen to those? You still have a cassette player?CALLER: Oh, sure, we have cassette players. (giggles)RUSH: Oh, okay. All right. Okay. Well, the reason I’m asking is because, as former liberal, that’s what you were born as, and so you probably still have certain things that tug at the suppressed or defeated overcome liberalism within your being. Does this tempt you to go back to liberalism? Does this sour you on conservatism or conservatives, that it’s only — not only, but these are the guys being accused, other than Weinstein and the hollered people? Does it worry you or do you think it’s all bogus?CALLER: Oh, it doesn’t worry me in the least bit. It only gives me a stronger conviction of what the Democrat Party is capable of, and the sad thing is, Rush, that they would… You know, I have very good friends, very good friends, family members — very liberal, very snowflakish — and you can’t say a word around them. But the problem is, they don’t actually listen. So the way that I was able to actually continue dating my husband was I started listening to your program because if I didn’t, I had no ammunition to, you know, fight back with. But, you know, strangely enough the transformation happened after I started listening because you start realizing that you’re missing out on a big portion of the story of what’s actually happening. So, no, not at all. This does just the opposite to me.RUSH: Good. I’m glad to hear that, because as a transmogrified conservative, there’s always a temptation to… I have a theory. It’s actually not mine. It’s John O’Sullivan’s, who was an aide to Margaret Thatcher, an editor at National Review. It’s called the Sullivan law, theorem, doctrine, or whatever. It basically says that any person or group that is not actively, daily conservative will become liberal. Because it’s the most gutless choice you can make. It doesn’t take any intellect commitment at all. All you have to do is feel. Conservatism is… Even though it’s just flat-out nothing more than common sense, given the pop culture dominance of liberalism, conservatism is a fight. It’s an active, daily pursuit. And the fact that you’re able to hold on to your conservatism in the midst of all this? This is heartening to me.CALLER: Well, it shouldn’t be that difficult actually. Like you say, it’s common sense, and the information’s out there for everyone, but it’s totally easier to be liberal and just to feel good about, you know, everything that’s going on and that you want to do, but —RUSH: Now, wait. See, that’s very… They don’t. They feel. It’s easy to be a liberal because you look at suffering, “Oh, my gosh, I hate that.” That makes you a good person. Doesn’t take much to be a good person in liberalism. All you have to do is suffer. See suffering and suffer. You don’t have to fix it, you don’t have to solve it, you don’t have to do anything but find out somebody to blame for it. — and it makes you a good person. But I didn’t say you’re happy.They’re not happy. There isn’t a one of them that’s happen. They don’t even laugh! They are in constant state of rage or anger. As discussed yesterday, liberalism is really… It’s encroached on our politics, but it’s a psychological disorder. And they have various psychological maladies and distorted which they have entered the political process in an attempt to get even, fix, punish whoever is responsible for what’s ever happened to people. And in that sense…I just saw Jeff Flake speaking from the floor of the Senate talking about how our politics has just become so debased. Our politics is so low and we’ve got to stop it. This isn’t gonna stop. The debasement of our politics, the debasement of our system is not gonna stop until the psychological disorders that are liberalism are kept out of politics and solved and fixed and addressed somewhere else. But as long as psychological disorders become embraced by the Democrat Party with promises of government solutions…The reason they’re never happy is ’cause they never get any of these problems solved. They never get anything fixed, and when they do get what they want, it’s never enough. So as long as… I’m being literal here. It’s a theory Jim Geraghty had at National Review, and I happen to understand it and I agree with it. As long as psychological disorders become evidence of political bias, discrimination, and unfairness, we don’t have any hope. When the political system is blamed for and then responsible for addressing and fixing what are psychological disorders, there’s no hope. That’s not what politics is. But it is what it’s become.And that is why, you know, decent or normal people, however you… I think most people know what decency and normalcy is, versus indecency and abnormal. But as long as the indecent and abnormal can overwhelm the system with their disorders and demand that the purpose of government and politics is to address these disorders… Remember these disorders result from these people are victims because somebody’s done something to ’em. Somebody was mean to ’em, mistreated them or whatever.“The political system has to fix that!” (sigh) That can’t happen. We’ve been trying. We’ve had the Great Society. We have had you name it. We’ve had government programs to address every freaking liberal problem there is, and all they’ve done is become more widespread. They’ve not become fixed or repaired because it can’t be done. So liberalism now proceeds on the basis that there are people responsible for the unhappiness, the misery, the inequality, the injustice that the psychologically disordered are feeling.That happens to be us, folks. We conservatives, Christians, are largely responsible for the unhappiness and misery because we’re racist, sexist, bigot… You know the drill. So we have to be erased. We have to be eliminated, because we’re mean-spirited and all that, and the political system then has to accommodate. And since the political system can’t fix any of these disorders, they have to be treated or accommodated — which usually is money and punishment aimed at people who are said to be responsible for the unhappiness.So that’s how you get Black Lives Matter hating cops. That’s how you get militant activists on the left hating religion, and any of the other institutions that have defined America and its greatness. It’s why the Constitution is not safe. They believe the Constitution in it has it inbred unfairness and discrimination and so forth. So that pretty much sums it up. But you wouldn’t even find a lot of agreement with the principles I’ve just stated, the concepts. But I think they’re undeniable.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/26/ten-gang-rape-parties-and-nobody-said-anything/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 26, 2018RUSH: Swetnick, by the way, claims that she was at these “rape train” parties 10 times. She partied with the group ten times and she also was gang raped, believes that she was given Quaaludes or something similar placed in what she was drinking. Now, she was there, partied it up with this group that was doing this 10 times. After partying with the group 10 times, she was gang raped. Why would you hang around through 10 or nine “rape train” parties?Why would you drink anything when you know that that is the vehicle for…? If any of this is true, why would you consume whatever beverage these evil guys handed you if all the punch…? Why would you drink it if you knew? After going to 10 parties, then you have it happen to you, and still no names of the gang rapists, other than Kavanaugh and Judge. (interruption) If this happened in my high school… (interruption) Well, no, not everybody. The nerds wouldn’t know about it. Nobody would talk to the nerds and tell them.But everybody at the thing would be talking about it, would be passing notes back and forth. (interruption) Hell, yes, everybody would know about it! The guys would be bragging through their teeth about these parties. Everybody would know! The bookworms wouldn’t know. Nobody’d waste their time telling them. They wouldn’t want them showing up. (interruption) Well, you asked. Ed in Orange County, California. Welcome. It’s great to have you on the EIB Network. Hi.CALLER: Hello, Rush. Thank you for allowing me to be on your show today.RUSH: You bet, sir.CALLER: A friend of mine put it best: The Democrats have jumped the shark. I say the Democrats have started their Tet Offensive. When I was in high school a young lady was involved in a horrible situation like the one described in today’s affidavit by the porn lawyer. Within days, the whole school and the neighboring school knew the story. The police were involved. Families were mad. My football team had a special meeting asking for details. The school talked about it all year. According to today’s affidavit, she attended many parties like this, as you mentioned. Does anyone really believe that six FBI background investigations would not have heard of one party like this?RUSH: Well, you know, that’s what I asked. How does all of this escape anybody else knowing about it? Parents? Teachers? Other students who disapprove of it? (sigh) You know, when I was in junior high school, just to try to relate something here… (chuckles) Maybe the most crazy thing I can remember that I didn’t do in junior high school, is the principal called an assembly toward the end of the day, and nobody knew what for.It was an attempted lecture on the dangers of indiscriminate sex. We’re junior high school students! Now, that was middle school. We were eighth or ninth grade, whatever it was, and when the principal got… (sigh) It was graphic, folks. Okay. Again, I gotta do the countdown, five… four… three… two… one. If you have your young children with you and don’t have to explain certain terms here, then please. But I’ve gotta tell this because it’s got a point to it. This is almost…I mean, if you’ve got “rape trains” going on in your high school, everybody in the world would know about it and everybody would be talking about it. So this principal… Are you ready? Five… four… You’ve got three seconds here to turn it off. Thirty seconds is all it’s gonna be. Three… two… one. Ready? When the principal began to explain “blue balls,” the student body started snickering at each other, looking around. He had the wrong definition for it. It was embarrassing.But the point is, we all went home and told our parents. just that! We all went home and told our parents what had happened, not because we were tattling on the principal. It was just so… It was so outrageous! It was unreal. It was toward the end of the day an assembly for no reason and the guy standing up there and going through all of the horrors that can happen to you and blue balls was one of the things that happened to you if you… He was wrong about it, but the parents were outraged, and this guy didn’t last the week!He did not last the week. I’m just saying that if “rape trains” had been going on, that’s not the kind of thing that never leaks out. It’s not the kind of thing that leaks out, period! Everybody knows about. You think…? The Democrats have wanted to destroy Kavanaugh not just in this nomination, but when he was nominated for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and you think this would have come up long before today? But it hasn’t. And again there aren’t enough specifics to corroborate any of this. They don’t want to corroborate any of this.Talked through another segment where I intended to go to the phones. I did get one call in, but look at what it inspired. So thank you out there, Ed in Orange County.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let me ask you another question. You’re Judge Brett Kavanaugh. You’re sitting on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals from the D.C. Circuit, which is the big circuit. That’s the granddaddy. It’s the mac daddy. I’m the mac daddy of talk radio. The D.C. Circuit is the mac daddy of appellate courts. You’re sitting there, and you’ve been confirmed, and there have been six FBI investigations of you, and so far you have kept the “rape train” secret. Nobody has found out what you were doing on the “rape trains.”But now, Donaldus Trump calls and nominates you to the U.S. Supreme Court, and you’re starting to think, “Okay. I know how the Democrats play. They’re not gonna want me on this court. They’re gonna do anything. They can’t refute my qualifications. I can run rings around ’em judicially, intellectually, but I remember what they did to Judge Thomas. I don’t know how I’m gonna keep the ‘rape trains’ from ’em. I better not accept the nomination.”Would you accept the nomination to the Supreme Court if you had a history of spiking punch with drugs and booze for the purposes of preparing women for “rape trains” minimum 10 times where you went to high school in Montgomery County, Maryland? Would you do it? (interruption) You would? There is no… (laughing) Snerdley’s bobbing his ahead. You’re just agreeing with me, I see. There’s no way! If you have this in your background? There’s no way.By the way, could you even get confirmed for the D.C. Circuit if you had this? And why is it that only a porn star lawyer can find these people who have the evidence of the “rape train”? No evidence! I’m sorry. There isn’t any evidence. What’s the good answer for it? (interruption) Uh-huh. Only a porn star would…? (interruption) Well, that’s… (interruption) The porn star is Stormy Daniels — Stephanie Clifford, for those who think it’s unbecoming to call her a porn star. Okay. Pole dancer. Lap dancer. I don’t know. She’s a porn star. (interruption) Okay. Thanks.  "

There is no evidence. There’s no corroboration of evidence. There is… In fact, the Christine Blasey Ford legal team refuses to send over the lie detector results or the notes that the therapist took in her meeting in 2012 — and get this. This is from the Washington… (interruption)Yeah, yeah, yeah, Snerdley. Be patient. I’m gonna get to the “vagina ghetto” here in just a second. The Washington Post, Jessica Contrera and Ian Shapira: “Christine Blasey Ford’s Family Has Been Nearly Silent Amid Outpouring of Support — The letters appeared within days of Christine Blasey Ford’s name becoming public. One was from her high school classmates. One was from her colleagues at Stanford University.“Her Palo Alto neighbors wrote another letter. Groups of attorneys, statisticians and teenagers wrote too. Then came a letter that began, ‘As members of Christine Blasey Ford’s family …’ It was signed by a dozen people. But none of them were related to Ford by blood. The letter was from the relatives of her husband, Russell Ford. Christine’s own parents and siblings — the Blaseys — have not released any similar statement of support.“As their daughter and sister has become the country’s most talked-about woman for accusing … Kavanaugh of sexual assault while both were in high school, the Blaseys have strategically avoided the press. Voicemails, texts, emails and letters from reporters have gone unanswered. Friends of the family have politely declined to comment on what they are going through. … The Blasey family’s reticence is notable amid the outpouring of support for Ford as the 51-year-old research psychologist from California prepares to testify Thursday…”Her family has not sent in or signed letters of support. What does this mean? Does it mean anything? (interruption) What does it mean, then? If you think it means something, what does it mean? (interruption) Tell me what it means! (interruption) I means…? (interruption) They…? (interruption) “They know her better than anybody else.” Are you saying they’re refusing to sign because they may not think that she’s…? (interruption)So her family and her siblings know her better than anybody else, and from that we can conclude — and then we can have it corroborated — that her family’s reticent, uneasy, nervous about becoming signatories to the, “I know it happened and I know it happened to her,” letter. Okay, Lara Bazelon (I don’t know how to pronounce this), op-ed writer, New York Times: “Man Up, Grassley. Question Blasey Ford Yourself.” This is the convoluted aspect this.When this first came up, when the hearing was first discussed, the left immediately said, “You old white guys, you old white Republicans, you can’t question her. She’ll be nervous enough. You can’t! We’re not gonna let happen to her what happened to Anita Hill. You can’t question her!” So Grassley said, “Okay. We are going to be fair.” So Grassley goes out and hires a female prosecutor with experience in sexual abuse and sex crime cases.And now comes this woman, Lara Bazelon, saying (paraphrased exchange), “Well, you can’t do that! You can’t bring in a woman to answer these questions from outside the Senate. You need to have senators do it!” Grassley’s scratching his head, saying, “Wait a minute. You said and you said and…” So this woman writes, “Dr. Blasey and her lawyers have pushed back, demanding that Mr. Grassley and his colleagues question her themselves. They are right to do so. The Republicans’ attempt to outsource the questioning of Dr. Blasey is cynical, sexist and cowardly. …“They don’t want to be seen grilling Dr. Blasey in front of tens of millions of Americans. We’ve watched that horror movie before, during the Hill-Thomas hearings in 1991, presided over by the Democrats. No one seems anxious for a sequel.” This is like the written word of this Lara Bazelon babe. “But the solution isn’t to remove men from the script. It’s to ask that” these men, these old white guy Republicans, “embody different characters: people who can pose respectful, probing questions, rather than bullies intent on shaming and demeaning the witness.”We reserve that right to do that to Kavanaugh. The Democrats on the committee will shame and demean and bully Kavanaugh. But you can’t shame and demean and bully Blasey! We’re not gonna permit it. “Whether it was female prosecutors clustered in rape and child-abuse units or suddenly becoming very in demand when it came to time to cross-examine plaintiffs … the consensus was that ‘it takes a woman to know a woman.’ Again and again, women are told that these are their only real opportunities in courtrooms — and now, apparently, Senate hearings.”By this, this woman writes about the unfairness of women litigators, women lawyers in court. That’s her expertise, her level of expertise. She writes about the abuse and the unfairness and the impossible mountain to climb that women lawyers have. “Again and again, women are told that these are their only real opportunities in courtrooms — and now, apparently, Senate hearings.“What looks like an invitation for advancement may actually be enclosure in what I call the Vagina Ghetto, a restricted space outside of which women are not welcome. We need to stop reinforcing this tired trope.” If it still doesn’t make sense to you what the “Vagina Ghetto” is, be patient.  "

Rush Limbaugh here behind the Golden EIB Microphone with apologies in advance for where the left and the Democrats are taking the content of this program. Right smack-dab into Smut Central! Right smack-dab into the filthiest, grimiest gutter you can find and whatever is beneath it. On today’s program, we will learn what a “vagina ghetto” is as written about in a New…(interruption) Yes, a “vagina ghetto.” We will learn about this as written about by an op-ed writer in the New York Times. I mean, when you hear that term… What do you first think of when you hear “vagina ghetto”? (interruption) Well, it may be what you’re thinking. (chuckles) We’ll let you know when we get there. Did I say or not say that Christine Blasey Ford would not testify tomorrow? (interruption)Right, and you continued to think that that was crazy because at some point she has to testify, to which point I said, “No, she never has to testify because all of this is about stringing it out.” Well, the latest and the reason why — and again, I apologize, my friends, but we have to go there. The lawyer for the porn star Stormy Daniels (whose suit against Trump may be thrown out of court in Los Angeles) has now produced a woman who claims that at parties back when Kavanaugh was in high school women were drugged and given grain alcohol in the punch so as to set up “rape trains.”The woman has been identity by name and by photograph. Her name is Julie Swetnick, and Avenatti announced all of this on The View this morning. Two sound bites. Here is Co-Host Sunny Hostin asking (stammers), “Did — did — did Kavanaugh do anything to this particular woman, Julie Swetnick, or is she alleging she just had seen him be aggressive with other women?”AVENATTI: The allegation[s], if you read further in the declaration, are far more specific relating Brett Kavanaugh’s conduct towards women in general, including the attempts to drug women by placing grain alcohol and/or drugs in, basically, the punch at these parties. Many of these women ended up gang raped, unfortunately. The details in this declaration are specific. They are shocking. But above all else, they are true, and my client stands behind them 100%. And she’s looking forward to having an opportunity to meet with one or more FBI agents, hopefully, and describe what happened. And she’s also prepared to testify, if she’s permitted to do so, to the U.S. Senate. But under no circumstances should Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court until these allegations and others are fully vetted and all of the facts and the truth are known.RUSH: The next question is from Abby Huntsman, co-hostess on The View. “Can you just explain…?” Avenatti, [c]an you just explain again to our viewers and to all of us, since this is just breaking, what specifically did Judge Kavanaugh do to your client?”AVENATTI: I’m gonna stand on the exact language in the declaration. It’s laid out in detail in the declaration. There’s a reason why it’s laid out in the declaration, and we’re not gonna provide any additional comment on that exact question until further — until the coming days.RUSH: So in this allegation yet again, this particular woman, Julie Swetnick, is not accusing Kavanaugh of doing anything to her! She is interpreting the minds of other women at a high school party. What does “became aware” he spiked drinks even mean? It means she didn’t witness it. She “became aware”? It means somebody told her. When did somebody tell her? Monday? Last week?You’ve heard the story going around now that there are affidavits from four people, one of whom is the husband of Blasey Ford. You’ve heard that there are four affidavits “corroborating her story.” No, they don’t corroborate her story. They corroborate that she told them the story. They don’t corroborate. There is no corroboration! This would be akin, ladies and gentlemen, to me coming on this program today and saying that I overheard Barack Obama admit that he ordered the FBI to spy on Trump. I can’t remember when or where.Now you can corroborate it for me. I’ve just told somebody. I’ve just told you that I overheard Obama admit he ordered the FBI to spy on Trump, and you can corroborate that. Because you heard me say it. But you can’t corroborate that Obama told the FBI to spy on Trump, and this is the trick that is being played here. What we’re learning, if there was ever any doubt, is this third accuser coming forth today on the eve of Blasey Ford supposedly testifying tomorrow, there is no lower limit.There is nothing too ludicrous, there’s nothing too disgusting, there’s nothing too putrid, there’s nothing too perverted that the Democrats will not do to try to smear a person they want to destroy simply because they cannot stand somebody other than one of theirs being on the United States Supreme Court. We shouldn’t be surprised. Hillary Clinton claims that Trump hired prostitutes to urinate on hotel bed that the Obamas supposedly slept on.And we’ve got an FBI warrant, a FISA warrant to spy on Trump based on that allegation in the dossier. This has gotten so crazy. Do you remember when it was first looking like Christine Blasey Ford was going to show up and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee? What did the left say? The left said, “You can’t have a bunch of Republican old white guys question her! You can’t have that. That — that would be horrible. We’re not gonna allow it.“We’re not gonna allow old, white senators to question her.” So Senator Grassley heard that, got the message, and went out and hired a female prosecutor who specializes in these kinds of sexual abuse cases and she’s going to come in and she’s going to ask the questions tomorrow. The Democrats say, “You can’t do that! You can’t bring somebody that has nothing to do with the committee in to ask these questions. Senators ought to be asking the questions!” Well, wait, wait, wait.You just said senators should not be and then Grassley goes out and gets a woman who specializes in this from New Mexico, Arizona, wherever to come in and do it. Now you say she shouldn’t do it, that senators should. It’s in that back-and-forth that the term “vagina ghetto” appears in a New York Times story. The New York Times! We’re not talking here about supermarket tabloids. We’re talking about New York Times, and it’s a lawyer or some person specializing in the abuse of women who has coined the term.So here are details. I have a Bloomberg version of the story about Wall Street Journal and others. A new accuser against Brett Kavanaugh said the Supreme Court nominee took part,” took part, “in efforts during high school to get girls intoxicated so that a group of boys could have sex with them. ‘I have a firm recollection of seeing boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their “turn” with a girl inside the room,’ Washington resident Julie Swetnick said in a sworn affidavit released by [the porn star] attorney Michael Avenatti.“‘These boys [that she remembers seeing lined up outside] included Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh,’ she added.” Avenatti released “a picture of my client Julie Swetnick. She is courageous, brave and honest. We ask that her privacy and that of her family be respected.”
After Avenatti plasters her photo all over the place! “Swetnick said she was a victim of one of those incidents in the early 1980s and that Kavanaugh and Judge had been present, though she did not say whether they had sex with her.“In other instances, she said in the affidavit, Kavanaugh and Judge made efforts to cause girls ‘to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be “gang raped” in a side room or bedroom by a “train” of numerous boys.’ The allegation comes one day before Kavanaugh is set to testify at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing along with another accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, who says…” Does anybody still think that this thing is gonna happen tomorrow?You know, I’m getting close to revising something, folks. The audio sound bite roster today… Cookie gave me a warning. She said, “I know you don’t like it when the show becomes about you. But of course, Rush, everything is always about you.” She’s got sound bite after sound bite after sound bite of Sky News, the BBC, Swahili News. All over the world, they’re playing that sound bite of me (chuckling) claiming the Republicans will lose everything if they don’t confirm Kavanaugh. They’re playing it all over the place.She’s given me a lot of new examples of it. You’ve heard the bite. I mention it. You probably heard me state it originally. With this latest revelation… You know, I don’t use the word “scum” very often at all. Back in my early formative broadcasting days, I got great advice from people who cared about my future and career and there were various things — advice things — I was told. “Don’t say things you don’t believe just to get a rise out of people. Don’t ever do that. Don’t just be outrageous for the sake of it.”They said, “By the way, you don’t have to try to be outrageous. You come by it naturally. So don’t try. Just don’t make things up that you don’t believe, and be very careful of the guttural words, descriptive words that you use to describe people,” and “scum” was one of the words. “Be very careful how you throw that word around. It’s just four letters but it hits people in a very, very bad way. Just don’t let that ever become part of your vocabulary,” and it hasn’t.But I don’t know how else to describe what this is. This is just the scum, the literal scum of the American left that is rising to their surface. And there isn’t a single guilty conscience anywhere in the Democrat Party today that we know of or anywhere on the left for any of this that is being done. We have Senate confirmation hearing that is being looked at as a trial. In the early days of this country and for many, many years after the founding of this country, do you know that the advice and consent roll of the Senate was done by affidavit?The nominees to positions on various courts never showed up. The Senate did not conduct hearings and examinations and this. They just submitted affidavits, the nominees, because the purpose of the advice and consent was to determine the fitness and qualification of whoever the president had appointed. Well, that’s long ago gone by the wayside. That’s not what this is now, as anybody can tell. I may be having to rethink my belief that Kavanaugh not being confirmed would cause Republicans to not show up. I don’t think Republicans would ever vote Democrat. Somebody said, “Rush is crazy. Republicans aren’t gonna vote Democrat.”I never said that! I said they won’t show up. They won’t vote Republican if Kavanaugh doesn’t get confirmed. But now with this, I think the level of disgust and anger at Washington on the part of average, ordinary, decent Americans is near a boiling point. Once they hear about this latest allegation! “This guy Kavanaugh was running rape trains and women getting drunk?” It doesn’t pass any smell test or believability test. The Democrats have just reached the absolute bottom of whatever pit they live in, and here’s the thing.All of this, I firmly believe, has been planned. I think it’s a previously conceived plan that they are in the process now of, in their minds, flawlessly executing. I think they’ve got various things waiting for various other stages to happen. And when it looks like all is lost and Kavanaugh is gonna be confirmed, there they go to the dregs of what they’ve got and bring it all out. I haven’t heard it yet, but it can’t be long now that somebody’s gonna say, “Well, we can’t have this hearing tomorrow. Not with this latest allegation.”Of course, for the Democrats and their thinking, this woman is obviously cannot be challenged. She’s the accuser. It’s the #MeToo movement, and whatever she says, it has to be accepted because we believe the victims. We think women don’t lie in these circumstances, and so there will be a new demand for an FBI investigation and so forth. In the meantime, it’s gonna get lost on people that Avenatti is not — nor his client. They are not suggesting Kavanaugh did anything. At best, this stuff happened and Kavanaugh and his buddy Judge were there and hanging around.But this is the first that anybody has heard of “rape trains,” the rape drug, and getting girls in high school drunk so as to create “rape trains.” That just hit this week with Avenatti alluding to the fact that he had a client that was gonna say so. The Kavanaugh lawyer, by the way, Beth Wilkinson… The Christine Blasey Ford legal team sent over some documents here that are part of the process., and Kavanaugh’s lawyer says that they didn’t send a light detector test or the therapist notes. Yeah, now imagine that.“The attorney for Kavanaugh says that the notes taken during therapy sessions with Kavanaugh’s accuser as well as results from a lie detector test have not yet been turned over ahead of tomorrow’s hearing. Beth Wilkinson was on CBS This Morning today. She said, ‘That information would be very important to corroborate claims that the nominee sexually assaulted Ford in high school. We can’t see the lie detector results?'” No. (chuckles) We’re never gonna see those, folks.“Wilkinson said, “They announced that there were notes and that they’re lie did he talk test but as I understand it they didn’t turn any of those over to the Senate committee even though they were requested. So the information that would have shown what she said at the very first time that she revealed these allegations has not been turned over to the Senate! There’s no way we can corroborate this independently.” But four people have corroborated her story? No, they haven’t! Four people have not corroborated her story. They have corroborated that she told them the story after Mitt Romney leaked that he was thinking of naming Kavanaugh to the court if Romney had won in 2012.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The one thing I think is probably safe to say is that the Democrats knew they were losing. Blasey Ford had bombed out. That didn’t pan out the way they want, and then the Ramirez stories. They weren’t moving the needle because both were designed to make Kavanaugh cave or Trump cave. Make Trump pull the nomination or Kavanaugh to say, “To hell with this.” That didn’t happen. So I think this is the Hail Mary. Avenatti with this babe and the “rape trains” is the Hail Mary, and it remains to be seen…You know, people are gonna start saying, “I don’t know how he can continue with all of this hanging over his head. Even if he ends up being exonerated, even if he makes it to the court, for crying out loud, this stuff is never gonna be forgotten.” They’re flooding the zone for precisely that reason. They are trying to destroy and sully a reputation for the rest of Kavanaugh’s life here. Again, decent people (chuckles) don’t quite know how to deal with this, much less refute it, other than to say it’s bogus.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I’ll tell you something else. I’ll tell you how smooth the operation was to blindside the Republicans today. On Monday we got the story that Avenatti — the porn star attorney — had this babe that knew of “rape trains” in Kavanaugh’s high school. Women were drugged and given adult beverages in massive quantities, and this set up “rape trains” for guys to go in and out of rooms where these drunk and drugged women had been placed on beds. And then shortly after that there began to be on various odd places on the internet (like Forchan and other places) that Avenatti had all of a sudden locked his Twitter account, that Avenatti was pulling back on it.Everybody said, “See? See? He doesn’t have anything, he doesn’t have diddly-squat. He tried, and he launched a blank,” and then this morning here comes Avenatti. On the eve of Blasey Ford’s testimony and Kavanaugh’s, here comes Avenatti, and he’s got a babe, and he’s got a picture. He’s got a name. She doesn’t name Kavanaugh specifically, but he was in the surrounding vicinity lurking around doing whatever, and she is willing — 100% willing — to show up and answer anybody’s questions about it.So the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee… I don’t know who else in the Republican side of things, probably a lot of people — end up being blindsided today. So blindsided within I’m watching TV during the break and people still talking about this hearing tomorrow, even after they’ve reported the Avenatti today. I should say the Julie Swetnick story. They’re still talking about this hearing tomorrow as though nothing has happened. I think people haven’t yet… It hasn’t hit people yet what this is. (chuckles) It will in due course.The name of this game is delay, delay, delay. Make sure there isn’t a vote. If they have to destroy Kavanaugh and his family and his career and his reputation and his life? Well, so be it. That’s what he deserves for being a conservative and trying to get on the court. That’s what they tried to do to Trump, and they’re still trying to do to Trump. But Trump fights back on ’em every day, keeps pushing ’em back and beating ’em. That’s what they try to do to every one of us that attempts to encroach on what they consider theirs by virtue of entitlement.What they consider theirs by virtue of entitlement is a pretty broad swath. It’s power in Washington. They think it’s theirs, and anybody seeking to take it is gonna be destroyed under the premise, “You are not even valid to be here! You do not have standing to even be among us, much less take our power — and if you so much as try, we’re gonna show you how little you matter to anybody anywhere.“If we have to destroy you and make your little girls cry, if we have to destroy their future and make sure they can never go anywhere without being pointed at by people accusing their dad of being a train-rape setter-upper, then that’s what we’re gonna do,” and that’s what they’re doing. They are shameless and without conscience. I haven’t yet met the decent people who know how to deal with this and to beat it back. The only exception is Donaldus J. Trump, who pushes back in his own way and frustrates them.  "

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/25/my-appeal-to-senators-collins-and-murkowski/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 25, 2018RUSH: Yeah, you can make book on this too. Ruth Ginsburg, Ruth “Buzzi” Ginsburg, is gonna hang on as long as she can. Her objective is to hang on ’til 2020. That’s when the Democrats think that Trump will lose reelection. She will retire in 2020 and then the Democrats will say, “Wait a minute here. The Biden Rule! Trump can’t nominate her replacement.”I want to make… This is probably foolish, but I have the opportunity here, and I’m gonna give it just a little bit of a shot. Over the years, I have very rarely made personal appeals to elected officials on the belief that it would be unsuccessful, wouldn’t work. It’s probably still the case. However, if I had a chance to talk to Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, I would like to say just one thing primarily to them. I just saw a little news report that they’re both wavering.Murkowski’s under the idea that it really would be great if we could have an FBI investigation. That would answer all the questions. Susan Collins, I don’t know what specific thing or things that make it impossible for her to openly say she would support Kavanaugh right now, despite how they’ve treated her. They have disrespected her, they have blackmailed her, they’ve threatened her. They have run a GoFundMe campaign, the left has, on Susan Collins, claiming that they’re going to fund an opponent of hers to the tune of a million dollars to start until she commits to voting “no” on Kavanaugh.She stood her ground.She wouldn’t accept that promise.So she started to harass her with cardboard cutouts three feet in length of male genitalia. She openly expressed her disgust for some Democrat tactics and so forth. I know the pressure is on both Senator Murkowski and Senator Collins to look at this as male versus female, and they are being pressured to be loyal to their gender here, and they’re being pressured to acquiesce to the Democrat-leftist line of thought, which is that a woman must be believed regardless and despite no evidence.A woman must be believed because men just naturally can’t be trusted. And if there is even a slithering doubt about this, that Kavanaugh cannot possibly be confirmed. And I would, in probably wasted breath, ask both of them to rise above gender here and look at this in terms of human decency, basic humanity. It cannot have escaped either of you ladies how Judge Kavanaugh and his family have been treated.It can’t escape you how he passed every exam before your committee with flying colors. You cannot ignore his overwhelming qualifications, his judicial temperament. You cannot overlook that he has the characteristics that even brilliant leftist lawyers in this process acknowledge, that just in terms of jurisprudence, there isn’t anybody more qualified or better to put on the Supreme Court than Brett Kavanaugh, at any time — not just now, but at any time.I would ask both of you ladies to just step back and take a look at what this process has been and what its objective really is. It’s nothing about Supreme Court, ladies. The left doesn’t think that Kavanaugh poses a threat to the court. Kavanaugh posed a threat to them and their use of the court. They use the court as a political backstop for when they lose elections. But in terms of confirming or not confirming a human being who’s qualified, you’re not gonna find anybody better than Judge Kavanaugh.And then take a look at what’s being done to him and his family. Do you want to be a party to that? Do you really want to be a party to a…? It’s not just a smear campaign. This is an outright, open, in-front-of-everybody-who-wants-to-see-it-for-what-it-is effort to destroy a fine man and his family, his entire life’s work and future. Does this accuser have that kind of evidence? Does the accuser have that degree of evidence that is worthy of the full destruction of an American life, an American career and an American family that poses a threat to no one?Does this accuser or do any of the others, do they really have…? Senator Murkowski and Senator Collins, do they really have that kind of evidence? If they do, why are you still struggling with the decision? If you think that what these accusers have is true, then it ought not be even something you have to think about. But the fact that you’re going back and forth on this is quite indicative that you don’t think that whatever the accuser has or is saying is sufficient.We’re not talking about just keeping somebody off the court here. We’re not talking about just defeating a Donald Trump nominee. Do you want to be party to what the objective here really is? Does Brett Kavanaugh, American citizen — Brett Kavanaugh’s wife and kids…? Do they deserve, have they done anything that would warrant the ruination of their entire lives? It’s not correct to say that if this doesn’t work out, that Kavanaugh will have something to fall back on.They are trying to take that away too.It appears to me that there isn’t any evidence here, that what we have is a last minute, late-breaking allegation with no substance whatsoever and a reluctant witness, a reluctant victim to come forward and make the case that something that happened 35 years ago that cannot be established and cannot be proved… Even if, Senator Murkowski, the FBI got involved, there is no way any investigatory agency, investigative agency will be able to determine.But even the worst of her allegations do not warrant what the end result here and what the unabashed effort of the Democrats is. Now, I know I’m probably (chuckles) spitting spitballs here at a battleship. But I couldn’t be a party to this, and I think so much of what happens in Washington… Ari Fleischer was right. It’s a sick town right now. I don’t think it actually crosses the minds of people who find themselves in the middle of this, as in senators, what’s really at stake here. And I’m not talking about politics.We’re talking about a human being, an American citizen of great stature who is being destroyed. They’re attempting to literally destroy him, and there doesn’t seem to be any concern about that. Nobody seems to have any guilt or conscience about what the end result of this (with no evidence whatsoever) would end up being. Is it that easy in Washington to destroy people? Is it really this easy? This is all it takes?Yeah, I just saw Bill Cosby sentenced three-to-10 years in state prison as a sexually violent predator, $25,000 fine, and he has to pay the cost of prosecuting it. There’s a lot of evidence there, Senators Murkowski and Collins. There was a lot of evidence there. There isn’t a whole lot of doubt about the Bill Cosby cases. But this? Is it this easy to destroy people? I mean, we outside of Washington see this happening so frequently that we wonder.We hear about humanity and tolerance and compassion. We don’t see any of it in Washington. We’re talking about the… It seems like it’s a one-way street, the destruction of lives here, careers. The destruction of the ability to earn a living. As a human being, you cannot live a life much more devoted than Brett Kavanaugh has, and to see it seemingly so relatively easy to destroy in today’s Washington is really scary. A little bit sobering.You claim to want to see evidence, but there isn’t any, and there isn’t going to be any. The politics of it? You’re afraid to reject the allegation of a woman because you’re betraying your gender. I would ask every senator in Washington to rise above this. We’re not talking about gender and loyalty to genders here. That’s identity politics. We’re talking about humanity, a human being here that didn’t do anything to anybody, by the way, before this all started.There wasn’t one allegation that Brett Kavanaugh had done anything to anybody, harmed anybody. So it just seems to me that… I know you’ve got a tough call to make in your world. You’re women. The pressures here are to be loyal to gender. Of course, there are stories of male abuse and harassment that are true, undeniably so. But just because there’s evidence that it has happened and does happen doesn’t make it so in this case.It just seems so obvious that the Democrats are attempting to continue to thwart the will of the American people every day. This nomination is the result of the American people electing Donald Trump. And despite the efforts of some in that town to say that his election was illegitimate because he colluded with Russia… Look at all of the things for which there is no evidence that Washington, D.C., is operating under.The will of the American people is on display and at stake here, and it just seems that it needs to be treated a little bit more seriously than the politics as usual or the politics of the day regarding the #MeToo movement. None of that seems relevant here. I keep hoping every day that I’m gonna wake up and see that Collins and Murkowski have made up their minds that after looking at this and listening to everything, that there just isn’t enough here to do what would be the result here, and that’s destroy life and career of somebody.Does anybody deserve that who has not committed a crime? Or has he? Has he committed a crime by being nominated by Donald Trump? Has he committed a crime by being conservative? Has he committed a crime believing in the original intent of the Constitution? Has he committed a crime in his various opinions from the D.C Circuit Court of Appeals? Well, no, he hasn’t, unless you allow conservative thought, Republican ideas to be judged as criminal.Please don’t participate in that. I realize you have a tough decision in your minds, and I know the immense pressure you both are under. But having a sense of decency toward humanity and being unwilling to participate in what is so obviously an effort to destroy — not just prevent a confirmation, but to destroy — a human being with innuendo and no evidence. It can’t be easy to be part of that. I hope it isn’t.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: San Antonio. This is Patty. Is that right? Yeah, hi, Patty. Welcome.CALLER: Hi. How are you? It’s great to talk to you.RUSH: Good. Good, good, good. Thank you.CALLER: Great. My thought is that when the day is done, this might actually end up being a good thing in the long run. I mean, it’s horrible now. But we’ve seen that phenomenon where so many Supreme Court justices have been conservative prior to their appointment to the court and then once they get into Washington and get into that Washington bubble, they start going to the middle or even to the left. My thought is that if Kavanaugh does get confirmed, he will know, without a doubt, who they are. I don’t think he’ll ever trust them again, and I think in a way that would almost ensure that he continues to, you know —RUSH: So you don’t think that they’ll be able to buy him off on a case-by-case basis with puff pieces in the Washington Post Style section?CALLER: Exactly.RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: I think he would be like Justice Thomas, who has been just stellar, who has just been, you know, completely right on.RUSH: Boy, are you right about that. Clarence Thomas? What a godsend for the court and for America Clarence Thomas has been. Not just has been, but is. His legal mind and his brilliance are on display with every opinion he writes or concurs with or dissents from. He’s a genuine treasure, and you’re right about Kavanaugh. I don’t think it was ever a problem with him anyway, though, to tell you the truth.  "

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/24/i-knew-theyd-find-another-accuser-because-i-know-liberals/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 24, 2018RUSH: Another email during the break: “Mr. Limbaugh, how did you know, because all weekend I saw people saying on Twitter that you predicted this. You predicted another woman would come forward. How did you know? How did you know?” Well, let’s go back to the audio sound bites. This is last Thursday, me on my program…BEGIN RUSH ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: I’m telling you right now it’s already in the works with, and I know it’s in the works because I heard a Drive-By Media person talking about it. The Drive-By Media person was Karen Tumulty of the Washington Post who says she wouldn’t be surprised if more women surface over the weekend alleging similar acts by Kavanaugh. She’s just telegraphed that they’re out there trying to find women that they can convince to come forward and say what they want them to say. You know they’re working on that.You know that the Democrat Party, you know that the media — they’re working in tandem — are scouring women who went to the same school or went to school where Kavanaugh was seen, you know, lurking around and so forth. And they’re gonna try to find as many women — not too many, find one or two women — to come forward and say, “Yeah, I didn’t want to come forward but I’m watching what’s happening to Christine Blasey Ford, and I can’t stand it.” So don’t be surprised.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Well, and it’s happened. No great shakes here. Predicting this was… If you know the left, as I do, it was simple. I’ll even buttress it further. Ronan Farrow: “New Kavanaugh Accuser Came Forward Because Democrats Came Looking.” What did I say here? You know the Democrats, the media, they’re working in tandem scouring women who went to the same school or went to school where Kavanaugh was seen. Farrow confirms even that. “The accuser came forward because the Democrats came looking,” and they didn’t have to look hard.This woman was a recipient of George Soros funds. Every one of these people, one way or the other, is connected to Hillary Clinton or her campaign. Every one of them! All of this is ultimately going to be traceable back to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. You mark my words. Here is Karen Tumulty, just to show you that this is what… I didn’t need this. I didn’t even need this to tell me that it was gonna be another woman show up before today. But this is Karen Tumulty last Wednesday night on the All-Star Panel of Special Report Bret Baier.TUMULTY: The thing I think we all need to remember is that we still have 4-1/2 days until Monday. And we’re… The way the news cycle works in these times, this — this whole thing is probably gonna take five or six twists and turns.BREAM: Right.TUMULTY: Now, maybe other people coming out of the woodwork either to verify what Judge Kavanaugh is saying or to back up when she is saying. By Monday, this could look like a very different situation.RUSH: Bingo! And here we are at Monday, and it looks like a completely different situation. They went out and they found this woman. This woman’s story has so many holes in it, the New York Times will not run it. This story has twelve holes in it that people now have spotted in analysis. There’s nothing to it, but the left doesn’t care. This is my point from the opening hour. They’ve got nothing to lose with this depravity. They’ve got nothing to lose by taking every bit of American culture they can into the gutter.Their base will applaud them. Their base will reward them for this. There is nothing for them to lose. There is no shame directed at them for what they’re doing. Interestingly enough, if they weren’t trying to get rid of Kavanaugh, their base would be pummeling them to death. Their base is demanding this. Not to say the Democrats wouldn’t be doing it on their own anyway. But my point is that it wasn’t that long ago that this kind of thing in American politics would doom the party trying it.And if the Republicans tried it today it would doom them because the media would turn on them and accuse them of upsetting the Constitution and jurisprudence and ages and ages of case law. They’ve got nothing to lose here. They don’t control the Senate now. They don’t control the House. They’ve got literally nothing to lose. The way of looking at it is there’s there’s no “too low” they can go — and in the process, they’re taking the country right with them, particularly when they’re walking politics. David “Rodham” Gergen on CNN last night with the anchor Ana Cabrera. Question: “Is it fair to have any timeline at this point for getting through any potential investigation and putting Kavanaugh up for a vote?”GERGEN: There has to be a couple days where not only the senators and the White House, but the public can absorb this and begin to make judgments. You know, we need to be a little patient with this process playing out so that… Again, I can’t tell you how important I think it is to the future of the press in this country that if he is going to be brought down, that the press is not seen as complicit in that effort.CABRERA: Yeah.RUSH: Well, now, if you’re even thinking about that, then it must be it’s already hit you that you are complicit. I mean, what a statement. Stop and think of this. David “Rodham” Gergen — who has worked for every president you can think of — says, “I can’t tell you how important I think it is to the future of the press in this country that if he is going to be brought down, that the press is not seen as complicit in that effort.” (chuckles) A little too late for that, don’t you think, Mr. Gergen?The press cannot be seen as complicit? They know — at least Gergen does. They know that they’re damping their reputations. See, the press has a lot to lose. The press has market share, subscriptions, advertising rates, jobs. The press has a lot to lose here. The Democrat Party not so much. The Democrat Party’s deranged base, though, does not spend money subscribing to the New York Times or the Washington Post in great numbers. The Democrat Party base show up and vote, but they’ve got nothing to lose with this depravity. But the press does, and Mr. Gergen knows it.Here’s Jane Mayer, who co-wrote the story in the New Yorker with Ronan Farrow. She’s on the Today show today with the cohost Savannah Guthrie. The question, “Your reporting makes clear that Deborah Ramirez was candid about questions about her own memory,” meaning she doesn’t remember much, and she admits that she wasn’t sober for much of this party, “obviously her sobriety at this college party. The White House has zeroed in on a New York Times story, saying they can’t confirm any of this. “It seems like the New Yorker didn’t find anyone with firsthand knowledge, either. Is there corroboration?”So here you have a media person telling another media person who wrote the story, “Hey, nobody can corroborate what you wrote. Is there any?” and here’s the answer.MAYER: Don’t have to read tea leaves. We’re right out front about it, and they’re saying, “We found no eyewitnesses who would confirm it.” Um, we, uh, found somebody who remembers hearing about it at night or the next day. Um —RUSH: Okay, stop it. That’s all I… Stop the tape. Why did the story run, then? If one of the authors says, “We’re right out front about it saying we found no eyewitnesses who could confirm it,” then why did it run? Well, we all know the answer to that. It ran to provide cover for Democrat senators to cancel the hearing on Thursday. Now it’s gotten too murky, too messy, too dangerous for poor Dr. Ford! She can’t be expected to show up now in this circus.She’s not gonna testify Thursday. Make book on it, folks; it isn’t gonna happen. This story also gives Democrat senators the excuse to claim, “All right. This is it. We’ve got another allegation — and since women don’t lie, and since conservatives have no presumption of innocence, he’s guilty. He needs to withdraw! Trump needs to withdraw the nomination.” That’s what the purpose of this story is. No eyewitnesses — and that’s just the tip of the iceberg about things wrong with this story. No eyewitnesses, and yet it ran. Why?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Anita Hill didn’t have any eyewitnesses, either, ladies and gentlemen, even though she claimed Thomas said the pubic hair on the Coke can and the Long Dong Silver stuff in front of the entire committee. Even though there was no evidence and no eyewitnesses, she still laid it all out for the committee. So the point is the woman doesn’t need evidence. That’s what’s being done to the rule of law by these people. They don’t need any evidence. The Democrats… There will be a new video from Hollywood actresses.“We believe Ramirez! We believe Ramirez! She’s telling the truth,” even though the New York Times and New Yorker say they couldn’t find a single witness. See, it doesn’t matter. The nature of the evidence? No biggie. Seriousness of the charge? Everything. All this is to provide cover for Democrats and the media to demand Kavanaugh just quit and go kill himself. That’d be the best. “Just get out of here. Just leave us alone. You have no business being on the Supreme Court and you’re not gonna be as long as we have anything to do with it.”That’s their attitude.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/24/democrats-destroy-the-rule-of-law-and-american-jurisprudence/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 24, 2018RUSH: Well, my friends, I kind of told you this last Thursday that there was gonna be another woman come forward, and I did not think it would be to buttress what’s-her-face’s story, that it would have to be a new incident. And, lo and behold! Now, a 5-year-old could have made this prediction. But I did it, and it has come to pass, and it’s gotten even worse. Folks, this week has the potential to be brutal, because this week has the potential to prove beyond doubt that the Democrat Party, the left, and the American media are bankrupt.They are bankrupt of everything good, they are bankrupt of everything decent — and, in the process, folks, they are doing such damage to America. I want to elaborate on this a bit. They are doing such damage to the Constitution, but it is America, it is our country that is being damaged here in ways that I don’t think it’s out of line to say few people ever thought would actually happen internally.We are about to witness behavior that should shock everyone. I think that the true face — if it hasn’t been already — of the radical left is about to be revealed in Technicolor. Now, I think it already has been, but it’s obvious that not everybody sees the radical left for who it is, what it is, and who they are. It is ugly, and it is typified by Michael Avenatti. He is the lawyer for Stormy Daniels, and, out of the blue last night, he starts a Twitter storm claiming to represent a woman with “credible information” regarding Judge Kavanaugh and this guy Mark Judge.He claims that Kavanaugh and Mark Judge… Are you ready for this? He claims that Kavanaugh and Mark Judge routinely — at parties in high school and college — got women drunk and gave them pills so as to start a “rape train.” He is demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee and will be demanding that Mark Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify to this and then demands that the nomination must be withdrawn. What is happening here right in front of our faces is the destruction of America.By that I’m talking about primarily the education system I think is where it starts. The greatest evidence for this — and, folks, I have to tell you, I’ve got butterflies here. Call it nervousness; it’s not nervousness. It’s not performance pressure. It’s not that I’m nervous over what I’m saying. It’s that it’s happening. That this is happening has my gut in knots. It literally does. It has my stomach in knots. My heart rate is elevated. I happen to know that because I wear an Apple Watch which calculates it, and I am in touch with my heart rate on a moment’s notice.And it’s elevated right now. It’s in rhythm; don’t worry. But it’s elevated. One of the bedrock principles of America, one of the many things enshrined in our Constitution that sets America apart from everywhere else is in our law, in our jurisprudence, in the rule of law the concept that anybody charged with anything is innocent until proved guilty. Now, I know it’s been bastardized and I know at times it’s been stood upside down on its head in court as lawyers engage in tricks with juries and so forth. That’s one thing.This is an institutional assault that is taking place, and the Democrat Party is literally in charge of this. Essentially, whenever politics is involved — and they’ve politicized everything. Whenever politics is involved, the accused is automatically guilty and must prove his or her innocence. The accuser is automatically believed — unquestionably, automatically believed. This stands the rule of law on its head, and the reason is it’s impossible to prove a negative. It’s impossible to prove you didn’t do it, particularly in courts of law. If you’re innocent, it’s very difficult to prove a negative.Ask Kavanaugh how that’s going. But to turn this upside down, as they are doing, what it is essentially is saying is, “If you are conservative, you are guilty if we accuse you.” The starting point is such that it’s not even worth your time to defend yourself because it doesn’t matter. “We say you did it. We say you’re guilty. We say you’re a rapist. We say you are a serial abuser. We say that you got women drunk and gave them pills to begin rape trains at parties. You’re guilty, and you have to go! You must leave.“You must withdraw. Your supporters must withdraw their nomination of you.” This is the destruction of our rule of law and the American jurisprudent system on steroids. The thing about all of this, folks, is the left… This is the real depressing part of this, to me. They’ve got nothing to lose with this behavior. They have nothing to lose with this politics and everything to gain by it. And what does that say about our country and where it is? Their lunatic, deranged base is applauding this.In fact, I would go so far as to say their lunatic base may be driving this. Their base voters, the people they are counting on to win the House and the Senate are applauding this. They are applauding the turning upside down of the rule of law. They are applauding the literal destruction of innocent lives and great reputations. They are applauding it, and they are demanding it. And the Democrats who participate in it will be rewarded for doing so, and there will be no penalty to them. In their minds, all of America agrees with them — well, a majority.This is another sick thing.In their minds — these Democrats in the Senate, Democrats everywhere — they think that a majority of Americans agrees with them and now accepts that Kavanaugh is a reprobate. Even though the evidence from either Blasey Ford or this other woman, whatever her name is. (interruption) Ramirez, yeah. Even though none of it can be proven, none of it can be established — and everybody claimed to be a witness says they weren’t there. In both instances, the Democrats still believe a majority of Americans agree with them and support this because they believe a majority of Americans want no conservatives anywhere near any elected position or appointed position of power.I believe that this is a ramification of the fact that America, the United States of America as an entity, as a country — our Constitution, our founding documents, the greatness, the uniqueness, the specialness, the exceptionalism of America — is not taught, starting in kindergarten, and hasn’t been taught for a couple of generations. Instead, America is bashed all over education. America is criticized as unjust, unfair, racist/slave. It is portrayed as anti-woman, anti-gay, anti-minority. It is portrayed as a nation founded by and established for white men who discriminate and mistreat everybody else.It’s been that way for 250 years, and it’s time to overthrow it — and that’s what we’re witnessing. And for two generations, they’ve been educating people toward this, that America is at fault. So many of the bedrock principles that distinguish America are going. Some of them are gone already. Among the biggest, as I mentioned, is that the accused now has to prove innocence when politics is involved.And since they are politicizing everything, it means all they have to do is level an allegation, and here come their buddies in the media treating it as though it is gospel, treating it as though it is irrefutable, treating it as though it cannot be denied, it cannot be questioned. It must be accepted, and you must love the accuser to boot. So now the accused — every accused conservative — must establish innocence. They don’t have to prove anything. Their allegation alone is enough to get rid of anybody, and their base voters demand it! Their base voters applaud it.This is the results of this new shift away from the accuser has to prove guilt, and we saw it when Blasey Ford’s lawyer says, “She doesn’t have to corroborate anything! She doesn’t have to prove anything. It’s up to Kavanaugh to prove that he didn’t do it.” Again, when Harry Reid accused Mitt Romney of not paying his taxes, Harry Reid said, “A friend of mine told me that Romney hadn’t paid taxes in 10 years.” The press said, “What’s your evidence?” and Reid got mad at ’em. “What do you mean, what’s my evidence? You need to go ask Romney why he hasn’t paid his taxes in 10 years!”Off they were to ask Mitt Romney why he hadn’t paid his taxes in 10 years. Shortly after they had just finished asking Romney if he believed states should have the right to ban contraception, when such a thing had never been brought up. Nobody believes that, supports that, but they made sure that everybody thought Romney wanted that. It’s so distorted. They have so distorted American education. To young people, you know what American justice is? To young people, the American system of justice is destroying conservatives — however, whenever.That’s what legions of young people have been taught that justice is. They’ve been taught in high school. They’ve been taught in middle school. They’ve probably been conditioned to believe such things as early as kindergarten. Certainly when they get to what are called institutions of higher learning, academe. This is what they’ve been taught justice is. So now we’ve got another accuser, as predicted. And right on cue, as soon as this second accuser…By the way, Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer are behind this story. Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer at The New Yorker. Somebody asked Ronan Farrow (paraphrased exchange), “How did you hear about this woman?” and he said, “Oh, the Democrat Party has been looking for her.” He admitted, “The Democrat Party has been trying to find them, and the Democrat Party found this woman who called me. They’ve been looking for them.” Well, this was also as predictable as the sun coming up in the morning.Now all kinds of senators are demanding that Kavanaugh withdraw. They’re demanding that Trump withdraw the nomination. They’re demanding Kavanaugh quit. “He can’t go forward. He will forever be sullied. There will forever be a cloud. It just would make more sense if Kavanaugh just quit.” Senator Feinstein (who’s behind all of this), Senator Gillibrand, Senator Jeff Merkley (Democrat-Oregon), Senator Claire McCaskill (Democrat-Missouri).They believe that there are legions of independent voters that just can’t wait to show up at the polls in November and vote Democrat because Americans are tired of sexual predators like Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh being appointed to the Supreme Court because predators like these don’t care about women’s rights, especially abortion. And so they’ve gotta go. They’re even saying that if Kavanaugh somehow gets on the court and they win the House and the Senate, they’re gonna investigate him and they’re gonna impeach him.Now you add Avenatti to this. We’ll have details of all these new charges as the program unfolds, but I wanted to set the table and establish the umbrella under which everything is happening today. Now with this Avenatti guy, Stormy Daniels’ lawyer calling the Senate Judiciary Committee staff. He sent ’em an email demanding to be heard. He represents a woman. Not Ramirez and not Blasey Ford.He’s got another woman with “credible information” regarding Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, that they were getting women drunk and plying them with pills at parties in order to start “rape trains” for the guys at these parties. I’ll make you another prediction. Christine Ford, Dr. Ford, will not testify Thursday. That is the latest. She’s scheduled to. You’ve seen that. It’s not gonna happen. She’s not gonna testify, and you can tell right off the bat why. With these new allegations, she can easily say, “This has become a circus. I don’t feel safe. I don’t feel secure.“I — I — I don’t think it’s wise. I — I — I don’t think it’s wise.” Her lawyer will say all this probably sometime on Wednesday.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So I checked the email during the break and somebody said, “But, Mr. Limbaugh, don’t Democrats have sons? Are they not worried about what they’re doing to their own sons by running around trashing every conservative white male they can find?” Yeah, they have sons. But what are they…? (chuckles) What are they creating with their sons? They also have daughters, you see? And they’re conditioning their daughters to believe that normal, male behavior is abuse and harassed.I’m not denying abuse and harassment happens, and I’d probably say that it happens more often than you and I would think in circumstances like parties and high school, college, this kind of thing, things that women think are… But what the Democrats are doing are trying to condition women to believe that just traditional male behavior and abuse and harassment, and if you’re a guy running around thinking that’s what you are, what, then, will become of your behavior? You wuss out.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Somebody asked me in an email, “Rush, it sounds like you don’t believe the second and third accusers here.” Really? What was your first clue? This is a charade here. It’s an absolutely charade. It was a predictable charade. It was predictable last Thursday that there was gonna be another woman coming forward, particularly after a Washington Post reporter pretty much let it be known, Karen Tumulty. This was not a tough prediction.Now, this next accuser, Debbie Ramirez? Her story doesn’t hold water. In fact, the New York Times… Are you ready for this? The New York Times doesn’t even want to run this story because they think it is so lacking. There isn’t any confirmation, there’s no corroboration, and even Ronan Farrow said that the reason the woman came forward is because the Democrats went out and tried looking for these women, tried to find these women. Debbie Ramirez is… By the way, Debbie Ramirez’s story involves…Look what they’re doing to this program. Look what… A dildo. It involves a dildo. Brett Kavanaugh was using a dildo in people’s faces according to this story. Decent people have really no idea how to deal with this. Decent people don’t sit around strategizing how to deal with this kind of depravity. Maybe we should, but people don’t. Depravity and this kind of thing is just second nature to the Democrats and their base.Anyway, Debbie Ramirez’s lawyer is — are you ready for it? — dadelut dadelut dadelut dadelut — “a major Democrat donor and activists who has given thousands of dollars to Hillary Clinton as well as donations to Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing the Kavanaugh case.” There are Democrat donors — there are Democrat activists — at every level of these allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. So now we have Kavanaugh, who, by the way, has undergone, has underwent six FBI background checks.Six of them! So let me ask a question: Six FBI background checks. How does the FBI not find somebody who lived very close to you for every address you had in your life? How does the FBI not find the dildo and the rape train stories and the women who claim that Kavanaugh and his friend drugged them and got them drunk and set these trains up? How does the FBI miss every aspect of this story? How do they miss the Christine Blasey Ford story in six FBI background checks?Have you ever undergone an FBI background check, or have you ever had the FBI come to you as somebody who knows somebody who’s under investigation? Have you ever had the FBI question you? They are very thorough. Do not doubt me. Yet the FBI turned up nothing, and so what are we hearing from these latest jack-in-the-box pop-ups? Demands for an FBI investigation. Of course when the whole idea of that is pooh-poohed, then they say, “See? They know he’s guilty, and they don’t want the FBI to find it. He needs to withdraw, and Trump needs to withdraw the nomination.”It’s how this all works.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Do you remember the Rolling Stone story? They were nearly sued out of business on all the false rape stories that had occurred at that university? You remember that? A woman wrote that story. She made it up, and she admitted she made it up because it’s a serious thing, rape on campus. Even though she had no evidence of it, people needed to know how bad it was. So she made it all up, wrote stories about it. Rolling Stone ran it anyway, defended if after the fact. Now they were programming sued out of exist.Well, this New Yorker story is being reacted to even by the left in much the same way. The New York Times can’t confirm any of it and they’re beginning to ask, “Why did it run?” (chuckles) Why did it run? Ronan Farrow says in answer to the question that the new Kavanaugh accuser came forward because Democrats came looking. Meaning, Democrats came to me wanting to know if there are any women. They came looking for women. They were putting out feelers for women to come forward. The story cannot be confirmed.None of the witnesses can be confirmed as having known or been anywhere near when this dildo was supposedly rubbed in people’s faces, and yet the story runs. There are holes throughout this story. The New Yorker could not find a single witness who put Kavanaugh at this alleged party. The New York Times could not find a single person who could corroborate Ramirez’s claims. In fact, Ross Douthat (who is a columnist at the New York Times) has tweeted, “Seems odd that neither the New Yorker nor my newspaper [the New York Times] could get any of these Yalies…”This all happened at Yale. They couldn’t get “any of these Yalie’s to confirm the story.” Why is that odd? Why is it odd that neither the New Yorker nor the New York Times could find any confirmation? Maybe it’s odd to him because he can’t believe the story ran. If there aren’t any corroborating witnesses, if there’s no corroboration whatsoever why run it? Maybe that’s what’s odd about it. “it seems odd that neither the New Yorker nor my newspaper, the New York Times, could get rid of these Yalies to confirm their story”?Well, only if you think it’s an abomination the story ran despite that. “A third person that Ramirez claimed was at the party says she was not there for the alleged incident. Ramirez contacted her former classmates asking about the incident, admitted she was not sure that Kavanaugh was the guy who exposed himself. A woman who claimed she was best friends with Ramirez says Ramirez never mentioned this story and initially said that her friend’s accusations against Kavanaugh might be politically motivated.”There’s nothing to it! But yet here are the Democrats demanding Kavanaugh resign because, in their new world, he’s guilty. She cannot be making it up! She does not have to prove it. Simply the fact she’s alleged it about a conservative is all we need to get rid of the conservative. He cannot defend himself. He shouldn’t even be allowed to defend himself. It’s same thing with Blasey Ford.  "

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/20/blasey-ford-says-shell-testify-if-terms-are-fair/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 20, 2018RUSH: Breaking news. The New York Times is claiming that Christine Blasey Ford says that she would “testify next week if the terms are fair and her safety is assured.” CNN has now picked up that breaking news. They are trumpeting it loudly. She has said, according to the New York Times, that she will show up and “testify next week if the terms are fair and her safety is assured.” Now, what “terms” could she be talking about? Witnesses? If so, that could delay things right there, since it will take time to get them to D.C.So now we gotta have a negotiation on terms and then we gotta have terms that she is going to decide whether or not are fair. Whatever terms are offered, all she has to say is, “I — I don’t think so. I don’t feel safe. For my safety, no. I don’t feel secure. I don’t feel safe the way you’re setting this up,” and that’s it. The media will report, “Republicans Attempt to Sabotage Willing Witness in Effort to Destroy Judge Kavanaugh and Save the Supreme Court.”You knew, folks, you knew they had something up their sleeves. You heard the last caller said that she’d make a triumphant entrance on Monday. Now she has said she’ll show up “if the terms are fair.” What’s fair? Who gets to define that? What if her terms are outrageously impossible to meet?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, as far as the accuser, she wants “fairness.” You know, is anybody concerned about the fairness to Brett Kavanaugh in all this? You know, all of a sudden now the accuser is the focal point of everything here, and nobody seems to be concerned about whether Kavanaugh is being treated fairly in any of this, and that needs to be an element of this as well.

What is happening with the Judiciary Committee is really I would call it a railroad job, and it’s totally unfair. I’m counting on the members of the press to point out that this is a fast track. They are totally intent on getting Judge Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court come hell or high water, come hell or high water, and you have to ask yourself, “Why?”RUSH: No, we don’t. The answer to “Why?” is eminently simple. He was nominated. This has gone on weeks longer than the average confirmation process. He’s eminently qualified. The story is why you people are trying to derail him. Anyway, here’s Sean in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Glad you waited, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Thanks for taking my call.RUSH: You bet.CALLER: We know Trump very aggressively goes after people that are attacking him, and he succeeds. You’ve identified all the occasions. This is really an attack on his selection. I think he needs to get out in front, make a statement that says Kavanaugh is preeminently the most qualified candidate for this position, but we’ve got people on deck like Amy Coney Barrett and others and get them thinking of the future. They’re doing this for the future. Well, that’s his next pick, given the chance. I think he need to go get out in front of this abortion aspect of this with some subtle tweets or jabs, because I think it would refocus people’s attention on what they’re really trying to do.RUSH: Well, maybe. But they would relish the chance to destroy her. If they take out Kavanaugh, they’re gonna be so energized, they’re gonna beg for him to send up Amy Coney Barrett. They can’t wait to destroy her. Don’t forget, she was the nominee that they were going back and forth, Kavanaugh or Barrett, who should go first. And they decided to go Kavanaugh first because Barrett… See, the original thinking was the Democrats couldn’t go after a woman in the #MeToo movement.But then they quickly properly figured out, went back and looked at Dianne Feinstein interviewing her confirmation hearings for her current judgeship and Feinstein said (summarized), “Boy, the dogma, the Catholic dogma is very loud in you. The Catholic dogma sings very loudly within you.” What that meant, boy, you’re really a devout Catholic. I mean, that governs who you are. You really are anti-choice. That’s not what she said. That’s what she meant.And so they decided to wait for Amy Coney Barrett for the next vacancy, thinking it’s gonna be Ginsburg just by simple age. Nobody knows, of course. But if they take out Kavanaugh, they’re gonna welcome Trump sending somebody else they can take out, because if they succeed, they’re gonna be so armed and ready that they can destroy anybody. So, that kind of thing is one of those be careful for what you wish for. Trump I think is handling this just the right way. He’s making it look like he can’t wait for her to show up.He thinks it’d would be wonderful for her to testify. He really wants to hear what she has to say. I mean, he’s out there saying why would I doubt the accuser? Why are you so surprised? I want to hear what she has to say. He’s gone on to say that if what she says, and if she is credible, then they might have to look at the nomination of Kavanaugh. This is why CNN ran the story that Trump’s employees, his aides are shocked and stunned. They can’t believe that Trump’s not out there destroying her on Twitter and stuff.  "

And this has been a months-long project, this latest reveal, and it’s been totally covered up by the Blasey story, the Kavanaugh story; so I want to spend just a few moments, ’cause O’Keefe and Project Veritas, they really need encouragement and a bunch of attaboys because there’s nobody else doing what they do.And it’s, as such, irreplaceable. I want to recognize them for all of the hard work they’re doing. It’s pretty risky. In fact, what it is is 60 Minutes kind of journalism but aimed at the left. You know, 60 Minutes with their hidden cameras and this kind of stuff from decades ago trying to expose fraud wherever they found it. None of that ever happens aimed at Democrats or the left and so O’Keefe and his group have exposed ACORN, blew ACORN up, the Obama community organizing groupBREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: To the Project Veritas videos. Here is the “Deep State Unmasked.” James O’Keefe released a new video entitled, “Deep State Unmasked, U.S. GAO Auditor Admits ‘I Break Rules Every Day,'” in which he investigates the anti-Trump resistance. This is O’Keefe at work inside the Trump administration. Now, in this hidden camera clip, we have a Government Accountability Office auditor, Natarajan Subramanian, describes how he slows down the Trump agenda from the inside. You’ll also hear briefly unidentified Project Veritas reporter.SUBRAMANIAN: (background restaurant noise) If you’re in an executive branch agency, um, you can slowball things to a degree, that’s it’s, like, ineffective. And maybe you get in trouble, and maybe, you know, you get fired or you resign or whatever.REPORTER: Yes.SUBRAMANIAN: But you know you slowed them down.RUSH: “Slowed them down.” This is Natarajan Subramanian admitting, “If you’re in an executive branch agency, can slowball things to a degree, that’s it’s, like, ineffective. And maybe you get in trouble, and maybe, you know, you get fired or you resign or whatever.” But this was after yesterday when people said you can’t get fired, federal employees can’t get fired. So we have here deep state operatives admitting that they are working every day to stop or slow down the Trump agenda. The next bite, the same guy Natarajan Subramanian admits to falsifying disclosure forms to disguise the real agenda of his outside organization’s work, which would be the Democratic Socialists of America.SUBRAMANIAN: (background restaurant noise) I filed all the paperwork I needed to file. I was purposely a little bit vague —REPORTER: Yeah.SUBRAMANIAN: — about what kind of organization I was in. I’m like, “It’s a community organization. We do this; we do that.” I wasn’t like, “It’s a socialist organization and we want to, you know, destroy capitalists.”REPORTER: Right. Yeah.SUBRAMANIAN: I explicitly had the discussion with myself about, “Do I care more about having this job, or do I care more about, like, the movement,” and I was like, “Obviously the movement.” … I break rules every day. At any point, I could get fired.RUSH: “I break rules every day” in our efforts here to “destroy capitalists.” This is at the General Accounting Office.

Debbie’s one of my top 10 all-time favorite female names, by the way.CALLER: Oh. Fabulous! So, I’m wondering if the reason that Ms. Blasey passed her lie detector test is because she actually had that exact situation happen to her but perhaps not with Kavanaugh?RUSH: It’s quite possible. Did you hear me earlier reference the fact that the high school yearbook for this particular year in question has been scrubbed from the internet? Did you hear me mention this?CALLER: Yes, I did.RUSH: Okay. Well, it’s been scrubbed because it is replete with the girls in the class writing about stories of all the keg parties they had and the fun times they had when their parents weren’t around. So I’ll get into details of this after the break at the bottom. But the bottom line is if this is all true, it means it was a party school for the women as well… The men… It was a private school.

You think that something did happen along these lines but that she’s not sure it’s Kavanaugh, but somebody convinced her to say it was Kavanaugh?CALLER: Yes.RUSH: And she agreed to do this why, in your opinion?CALLER: Because she’s a left-wing, crazy, radical lady.RUSH: She’s a sweet, nice, thoughtful left-wing Democrat activist; right.CALLER: Yes. Exactly.RUSH: Okay. So it happened, but it wasn’t Kavanaugh. But you don’t think that she’s honestly disremembering this; you think she knows it wasn’t Kavanaugh but somebody’s convinced her to try to sell that it was Kavanaugh?CALLER: That is correct.RUSH: Okay. Debbie in Dallas, I appreciate your call. I have titillated you enough with this yearbook story, so let me share the details of it with you when we get back right back here.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Two things before I get to the yearbook story. First one here: “Kavanaugh Accuser’s Classmate Makes New Claim and Then Backtracks and Deletes Everything.” There’s a lot of deleting going on out there. The New York Times had to issue a major, major correction. Do you know what they did? The New York Times ran a story about this guy Mark Judge (I think it’s his first name), Kavanaugh’s friend, who doesn’t remember a thing about this incident. It was claimed that he was there and so forth.The New York Times ran a story in which they said that this guy — this friend of Kavanaugh’s, the judge — remembers the incident! It was on their website for 40 minutes! “Judge,” da-da-da-da-da, comma, “who does remember the incident, says he…” He does not! They left out the word “not”! It was up on their website for 40 minutes — an abject lie — until they corrected it. Their correction alluded to the fact (paraphrased), “Well, you know, there’s a lot of people out there promulgating fake news. Sometimes even we get caught.”They didn’t get caught with anything. They knowingly tried to get away with it. That’s why the media has become the chief strategists of the Democrat Party, and it’s been that way for a long time. They are the power makers and breakers, and they’re the ones that are leading the charge. That wasn’t a mistake! They put it up there for as long as they could get away with it because they know in 40 minutes or 30 minutes a lot of people are gonna see it and will never see the correction.The New York Times story made it look like that Kavanaugh’s friend is lying because he told them that he does remember the incident, when he has always said he does not, that he does not remember where it was, when it was. He doesn’t remember being in the room when anything like this happened. But the New York Times ran a story that he does, on their website, for 40 minutes. Now, here’s the other. “A woman who claims to have been classmates in high school with Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday that the “incident did happen” and it was talked about at the school for several days after it allegedly happened.“The story quickly went viral after NBC News published a report on the claim from Cristina King Miranda — who lives in Mexico…” Cristina King Miranda writes “that the ‘incident did happen’ and it was talked about at the school for several days after it allegedly happened.” NBC’s headline was: “Accuser’s Schoolmate Says She Recalls Hearing of Alleged Kavanaugh Incident.” Well, that Facebook post has been deleted. Here’s what it said:“‘Christine Blasey Ford was a year or so behind me, I did not know her personally but I remember her. This incident did happen. Many of us heard a buzz about it indirectly with few specific details. However[,] Christine’s vivid recollection should be more than enough for us to truly, deeply know that the accusation is true. If Kavanaugh truly has the integrity mentioned by those who support him, then he should be just as courageous as Christine and stop trying to dodge the accusations, admit his actions from so long ago, speak from the heart, and apologize.’“However, by the time NBC News published its report, King had already appeared to start walking her claim back, writing in a now-deleted Facebook post: ‘To all media, I will not be doing anymore interviews. No more circus for me. To clarify my post: I do not have first hand knowledge of the incident that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford mentions, and I stand by my support for Christine. That’s it. I don’t have more to say on the subject. Please don’t contact me further.'”So she writes: Oh, yeah! Everybody remembers this! People were talking about it. So the media says, “Oh, wow! We gotta track her down.” They track her down; she said, “I don’t want any part of this,” and starts deleting everything. Here’s the yearbook story. Now, the website where this first appears… Let me say up front here that I pass this on to you with some guarded knowledge. Whenever I have not heard of a website, it’s dicey, it’s tricky. But other people have cited this now and on their websites are publishing parts of it. So it may pass the test.The website is Cultofthe1rst.blogspot.com, and the headline: “Why Christine Blasey Ford’s High School Yearbooks Were Scrubbed: Faculty Approved Racism, Binge Drinking and Promiscuity.” Now her yearbook has disappeared. Whoever had the power to do it has taken it down, and the person who wrote this story at this website saw this yearbook and writes that he was convinced that it was gonna be taken down. So he cached a bunch of pages and made copies and has it and is now running a story even though the yearbook has been taken offline.That has to mean something. I don’t know what the website is — and, shockingly, the Drive-By Media has ignored this. But here we go: “On Monday Sept. 17th, Christine Blasey Ford’s high school yearbooks suddenly disappeared from the web. I read them days before, knew they would be scrubbed, and saved them. Why did I know they would be scrubbed? Because if roles were reversed, and Christine Blasey Ford had been nominated for the Supreme Court by President Trump, the headline by the resistance would be this:“‘Christine Blasey Ford and the drunken white privileged racist playgirls of Holton-Arms.'” That’s the school. The yearbook portrays story after story after story of these girls laughing and joking about their beer parties, keg taps, partying while the parents are gone, whole entries in the yearbook while the parents were away, and then detailed subscriptions of the parties. This guy says, “And it would be an accurate headline. That’s why the yearbooks have been scrubbed.“They are a testament to the incredible power these girls had over their teachers, parents and the boys of Georgetown Prep, Landon and other schools in the area. In the pages below, you will see multiple photos and references to binge drinking and the accompanying joy of not being able to remember any of it. These yearbooks are, therefore, relevant to the national investigation now being conducted in the media, in homes, and in the halls of Congress. And they should not have been scrubbed.“If Brett Kavanaugh’s yearbooks are fair game, so are these. And you will wonder while reading them, why the hell did the faculty approve of these yearbooks? Why did the parents take out paid ads in these yearbooks? Animal House had nothing on the infamous ‘Holton party scene.’ The resistance media has been singularly focused on Brett Kavanaugh’s high school yearbooks, which imply that he got drunk and threw up. There’s no need to imply anything from the Holton-Arms yearbooks.“It’s all there in focus, and the written word too. All of the sordid details as approved for publication by a ‘look the other way’ faculty. And now it’s available for historical/evidentiary review. It is to this wild Holton culture we must look in order to shed light on the last minute accusation by Christine Blasey. And in the official high school chronicles of this era, we find many names of people who can provide relevant evidence. Christine ‘Chrissy’ Blasey alleges she cannot recall the exact date, place or names of people who were at the party in question.“This research is intended to refresh her recollection and the recollections of others who may recall key facts. (In this report, last names have been redacted and faces obscured, other than the picture of Chrissy Blasey seen below.) The yearbook title is SCRIBE. The relevant issues are SCRIBE ’82, SCRIBE ’83 and SCRIBE ’84, corresponding to Blaseys’s sophomore, junior and senior years, when she and her classmates … were 15-17 year old juveniles.” Anyway, it goes on. There are pictures of the students while participating in beer parties, drinking parties — looking disheveled, looking drunk, happy — describing what it was like to be able to party when the parents were not around.Here’s one: “While the parents were out,” and it’s an annual screenshot of what looks like a school newspaper story. It seems to indicate that these parties were frequent and all that. So this is out there. It will be totally ignored by the mainstream and Drive-By Media. But it does dovetail. You know, Debbie in Dallas called and said, “I think it happened. I think this all happened. I think she just may not remember with whom it happened. And this yearbook and the fact that it’s been scrubbed, all three of them, ’82, ’83, ’84, do you cause you to raise eyebrows. “Why scrub the yearbooks?”(interruption)Were high schools partying like this in Cape Girardeau when I was coming up? Well, yeah, I mean, there were… It was a big deal to get a six-pack when you were in high school. I, of course, wasn’t. I started work when I was 16. But, yeah. It was a big deal. The difference is, none of those parties made the yearbook. (chuckling) You know, we didn’t take pictures and publish stories about the grand parties. We did not make public all the great things we did at our parents’ homes when they were away — which apparently is all over these yearbooks.(interruption)Well, I don’t think that’s different from any high school at any other time. Teenagers are always gonna flit around, play around, try to partake of things denied them because of age or what have you. There’s nothing abnormal about that.(interruption)So what? What’s the point? (interruption)Mmm-hmm.(interruption)Go ahead. Just ask it.(interruption)“What were the boys like…?” What do you…? In terms of what? Let me just tell you this. Let me just tell you this. You’re asking me about… In no way do I remember the girls leading these parties. They might have had them amongst themselves and we didn’t know. But what are you getting at here? “What were the boys like?” Well, you’re asking me. Mine were in the sixties. This is in 1982, ’83, ’84 — and today, it’s 36 years ago! Which makes this even that much more absurd.  "

That’s really creative. You have a repetition of the lyric line. It’s a bunch of Hollywood actresses there. Among them were Gabrielle Union, Julianne Moore, Eva Longoria, America Ferrera, and there are several in there that are unidentified. They don’t even know her. They haven’t the slightest idea who she is. They never heard of her (like all the rest of us until a few days ago. Here now are a bunch of Hollywood actresses out there saying, “We believe you. You and your testimony are credible. Signed, your sisters.” Your sisters. They don’t know her!She doesn’t know them.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way… It’s a good catch. I missed it. These actresses in that sound bite we played said, “We believe your testimony! We believe your testimony!” There wasn’t any testimony. Hasn’t been any testimony. All we’ve got is a letter. We don’t have a single spoken word from this woman yet, just a letter. She hasn’t shown up. She hasn’t gone under oath. The lie-detector test is not under oath. There hasn’t been any testimony! That’s the whole point, folks! They’re trying to railroad a guy out of a Supreme Court nomination based on a letter.She doesn’t want to show up and testify, and she hasn’t. You stop and think of this. They’re saying… Go through the qualifications Kavanaugh has. Think of the people who would not pass qualification test as the Democrats have set it up. Do you realize Martin Luther King could not pass the test that they have established here? Tell me, Mr. Snerdley, why is that? Martin Luther King couldn’t pass the test. He’s got episodes of sexual harassment and infidelity all over his young life, correct?Well, I know we’re not supposed to talk about it, but in a Supreme Court confirmation hearing, if it came up, the Democrats would have to oppose Dr. King. Same thing with Mahatma Gandhi. Yep. He’d be toast. For those of you who are Christians, there’s not a single disciple who could pass the Democrats’ test. Jesus himself might not be able to pass it, but that’s okay. They don’t believe in him. I mean, that’s how ridiculous all of this is.  "

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/19/anita-hill-became-rich-and-famous-by-trashing-clarence-thomas/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 19, 2018RUSH: Okay. Here’s Ellen in Altoona, Pennsylvania. I’m glad you waited. You’re next. It’s great to have you here. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Long, longtime fan since 1988. Great to talk to you.RUSH: Thank you very much. You’re a lifer too. You’ve been since very beginning. That’s amazing to me!CALLER: In ’89 you were actually in Altoona, and my husband and I got to come see you. So…RUSH: I remember, one of the early Rush to Excellence stops was Altoona. I remember flying in there too. It was great.CALLER: Yeah. It was a great event. Anyways, I’m just livid over Christine Ford’s false claims. I wonder if she realizes that, the liberals realize that as much as hurting the Kavanaughs, she is hurting women everywhere. I believe there are true victims. When you have all these women coming out, making false claims, that just gives discredit to the women that have actual claims.And I think people turn their ears off more quickly after all this… These ridiculous claims and they won’t be taken as seriously. And, really, so the bleeding heart liberals, the compassionate people, they’re the ones that are discrediting women more than anybody over playing this kind of cry wolf game for political gain. I just think: Shame on them. You know, women have struggled for so many years to be taken as seriously in the workplace.RUSH: Yes.CALLER: And now we have women going around making these false claims, making us look unstable and using this card to get gain from… You know, from these accusations —RUSH: So it sounds to me like what you’re really saying is that you’re not all that certain Democrats really care about the plight of women, if they’re this willing to put somebody up with this lack of credibility that’s going to then redound to other women and make them seem less credible and the Democrats may not even care about that.CALLER: The Democrats only care about themselves, and they’ll use any person as a tool for their credit, for their gain.RUSH: No question about that.CALLER: They do not care about us.RUSH: You know, I’ve heard this argument, and on paper it make sense. Ellen, thanks for the call. And really thanks… It’s been 1988, ’89. That’s a lifer. Something like 30 years. You know, we have audience research, you would be stunned to learn how many people are in that category, out of our….You know, weekly audience here is up to 26 million. You’d be stunned how many. I was when we found out. Anyway, I hear this argument that, ah, this is really going to harm other women, who’re gonna be reluctant to come forward because they’re not gonna be believed.And I’ve heard the argument about rape, same time. If a woman comes forward with a false allegation that is demonstrated to be false, that that then harms other women to whom it did happen, who may not be believed. And, as I say, logically on paper it makes sense. I’m not sure I’ve seen any evidence of it. I would love to be corrected on this.But, for example, there have been other women… Did Anita Hill stop Christine Blasey Ford from coming forward? Quite the contrary. Anita Hill… I have a story that details the stardom that she has received following supposedly risking it all to come forward about Clarence Thomas! And this is another myth that these women… “They really run the risk of becoming fools forever and destroying their lives and losing it all, Mr. Limbaugh.”Well, you know, Anita Hill kind of bombed out in her effort to keep Clarence Thomas off the court, but books by Anita Hill: “Speaking Truth to Power. Reimagining Equality: Stories of Gender, Race, and Finding Home. In popular culture: In 1999 … Strange Justice, a film based on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy. Her case also inspired the 1994 Law & Order episode Virtue, about a young lawyer who feels pressured to sleep with her supervisor at her law firm,” based on Anita Hill.“Hill was the subject of the 2013 documentary film Anita … which chronicles her experience during the Clarence Thomas scandal. Hill was portrayed by actress Kerry Washington in the 2016 HBO film Confirmation. Hill is mentioned in the 1992 Sonic Youth song Youth Against Fascism. Awards and recognition … American Bar Association’s Commission on Women in the Profession’s Women of Achievement award in 1992.“In 2005, Hill was selected as a Fletcher Foundation Fellow. In 2008 she was awarded the Louis P. and Evelyn Smith First Amendment Award by the Ford Hall Forum.” That’s not even half the page of the awards and movies and books that she has written, appeared in, or been portrayed in. She’s wealthy. She has jobs at major universities. There’s not one negative thing that happened to Anita Hill for losing!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Jean in Ponca City, Oklahoma. You’re next. I’m glad you waited.CALLER: Hi. I found the names of at least 10 women — there’s more — that said they were abused by Bill Clinton, and I’m concerned about where they could go to get a do-over and be believed. I was wondering if you could direct them to anywhere.RUSH: (chuckles) That’s been tried. Juanita Broaddrick is one of them. By the way, I think now people credibly accept that she was raped by Bill Clinton. The left doesn’t even deny it. Juanita Broaddrick is saying, “You know, why doesn’t the FBI come and investigate what happened to me? I remember exactly what happened. I remember where I was. I remember what he did. I remember everything about it,” and the only network that ever gave this the time of day was NBC. Only one reporter. Everybody else ignores it — and the Clinton women were destroyed. Remember James Carville talk about Paula Jones?CALLER: Right.RUSH: (impression) “This is what happens when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park! Ha-ha-ha!” You know, and Hillary Clinton was right in there destroying all these women that came forward that had detail after detail after day about what Bill Clinton had done to them.CALLER: Right. It’s a long list. It’s a long list here, and all the accusations and I just wish they could be heard.RUSH: Well, some of them have been, but the point is, after they’re heard, they’re ignored. Nobody does anybody about it. The media actually continues trying to make people not believe them, and here we have an allegation that doesn’t have any substance to it at all, and it’s being treated as gospel. It’s maddening. I just saw on Fox, by the way… This is stuff, when I hear this, I say, “This can’t be true. It just can’t be.”But some infobabe on Fox said that internal White House polling shows too much complacence among Trump voters leading into the November elections, that they’re not all that hepped up to vote. Trump voters think, “Trump won. Trump’s continuing to do good things. What do I need to care about?” Now, I just… That does not compute with me, unless there is… There is one way. Unless these people have just tuned out the news ’cause they’re so fed up with it.They just don’t watch it, in which case they may not be even aware what’s going on here with Kavanaugh. But, see, that doesn’t make sense to me, either. Of course, the Trump administration might just be feeding that news to reporters so that their voters hear it and don’t get complacent. I don’t know. I know I’m daily immersed in this and I’m emotionally attached and invested in it, and so that does tend to warp your judgment if you’re not careful.You think everybody is, and then you realize a lot of people do not follow this stuff as do you and I. You realize if more people did, there might be a bigger backlash. I just… But this is not a one-off. This is what we’ve been dealing with for three years now if you go back and include the campaign. We have been dealing with this kind of literal injustice and and stark unfairness. Whatever else this is, it is the epitome of a stacked deck, unfairness.It is fueled by lies and perversion and distortion, and anybody paying attention to it would have to be outraged by it if they have any decency in them at all! See, that’s the naive me speaking. You would think that would be the normal, everyday reaction. But I don’t know that it is. Grab sound bites 10 and 11. Yesterday we learned that the lawyer for the accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the lawyer Debra Katz said, “It’s not up to her to prove anything. The accuser doesn’t have to corroborate anything!”That caught me flat-footed.I said, “What? The accuser doesn’t have to corroborate. Go talk to any prosecutor. The prosecutor has to damn well corroborate, confirm, prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, all that” in a court. Now, in the court of real life, yeah, defendants often have to prove they didn’t do it even though proving a negative is practically impossible. But in this case this woman comes forth after 36 years of nothing and lays out this allegation and now does not have to offer proof?In what world?Well, in this world, because here is none other than “An-ee-tah,” as pronounced by Judge [Susan] Hoerchner back in 1991. Anita Hill was on Good Morning America today with George Stephanopoulos. Yeah, she’s so traumatized! Anita Hill still quivering in fear, cowering in the corners over what happened to her. Stephanopoulos said, “You’ve said that Judge Kavanaugh bears the burden of persuasion here. What does that mean, exactly?”HILL: It is an honor and a privilege to be nominated and to serve. It is not an entitlement, and so a person coming into that position on the Supreme Court for a lifetime really has to have the full confidence of the American public. We need to be able to believe in the integrity of our courts, and that means believing in the integrity of the individuals who are on it.RUSH: Stephanopoulos said, “Your hearings famously came just five days after the allegations went public.”HILL: (haltingly) These… take time … to evolve. So six days is not enough for the senators who probably know very little about these kinds of claims.RUSH: Right.HILL: It’s not enough for them to inform themselves, and so that’s why it’s important to have an investigation.RUSH: See?HILL: It’s important for them then to call on experts to help them shape credible questions to ask both Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh and then to move forward. There is no reason for them to rush this.RUSH: The hell there isn’t! The hell there isn’t! Anyway, so, here you have “An-ee-tah,” saying that the burden of persuasion is on the nominee. This guy is gonna serve for life. It’s up to him to convince us that he’s worth it. So anybody can come along at any time and say, “He abused me! He sat on top of me! He laid on top of me! He smelled of booze! He was drunk and so forth and I’ve been traumatized for 36 years,” and that, with no evidence backing him up, can stop everything?That’s where we are. Craft questions. Investigators can craft questions. Meanwhile, she doesn’t want to show up. She’s got an open invitation to show up — by the way, not just in public. If she wants to testify behind closed doors, they’ve offered that. Grassley… According to an anonymous source at CNN, Grassley’s even willing to go to California to interview her. The United States Senate Judiciary Committee on the road. When’s the last time you think that ever happened?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This does it. John Danforth, senator from Missouri, big friend of Clarence Thomas He loved Clarence Thomas. Clarence Thomas worked for him. He sponsored Clarence Thomas. He remembers the Anita Hill-Thomas hearings. He was on Wolf Blitzer this afternoon. Jim Acosta accosted him and said, “You were against the delay in the Thomas hearings. Do you think a delay now is out of order? Is it unacceptable, in your view?”DANFORTH: What I said back then, and it definitely was true, was that the whole thing was torture. And for a human being, Clarence obviously controversial. But he was a friend of mine, and everything that he lived for was under attack. You know, it was really awful, and he was just humiliated by the whole darned experience. So this is like reliving that. I don’t know Judge Kavanaugh, but for him. I mean, here’s a man who’s had just a sterling reputation, and clearly his reputation means a great deal to him, and now all that’s in the trash.RUSH: “All of that is in the trash.” Precisely. It’s all in the trash, and the left is happy. The left is applauding. By the way, folks, if you think that you can encounter a liberal or a leftist and have a rational discussion with them about this, I want to warn you in advance: You can’t. Now, there are exceptions to everything, but my experience guided by intelligence is that you do not want the frustration of trying to discuss this reasonably. You, as a decent person, are gonna be talking to someone who is poisoned with political hatred for Donald Trump and thus is incapable of reason and is more easily led to believe that Brett Kavanaugh is scum than the truth about Brett Kavanaugh.If you’re gonna try it, just be warned.It’s not gonna turn out the way you think.

She’s a Democrat senator. The Democrats had a press conference yes. We’re at sound bites 5 and 6 here. An unidentified reporter said the senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat, Hawaii, “You’re one of just four women on the Senate Judiciary Committee. How does that impact the proceedings on Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford if at all?”HIRONO: Of course, it helps if there are women on that committee. But, you know what? I expect the men in this country and the men in this committee and many of them, believe me, because we all signed on to this letter to, uh, demand an FBI investigation. But really, guess who’s perpetuating all of these kinds of actions? It’s the men in this country, and I just want to say to the men of this country, “Just shut up and step up. Do the right thing for a change.”RUSH: “To the men…” Now it’s gone beyond Kavanaugh. Now it’s not just Kavanaugh who’s reprobate, it’s all of us men. “I just want to say to the men of this country, ‘Just shut up and step up.'” What, this is reasonable, “Just shut up and step up”? Can you imagine if I went on TV talking about, “Just shut up, ladies. Just shop and go away and stop bugging us. Everything was fine until 1970. Just shut up and go away.” What would happen to me?(interruption)People are nodding in there ’cause they know. What would happen to me? She’s applauded for this! She’s applauded! “I just want to say to the men in this country, ‘Just shut up and step up. Do the right thing, for a change.’” Something must have happened to Mazie Hirono when she was young to make her hate men like this. Something had to have happened. I refuse to believe people are born this way. Something had to have happened. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s a family member that abused her.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We go to Charleston, South Carolina. This is Eric. Welcome, sir. Great that you called. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Hey, love the show, longtime listener. I do have to disagree with you on one thing about this whole Kavanaugh thing. I know you’re saying that it’s to delay, delay, delay. I disagree. I think the whole #MeToo movement, the whole segment you just played about the senator saying, “Shut up, men,” I think all this is about removing the men from the public sphere. You know? I think that’s the whole… I mean the whole concept of what’s going on right now is to make every man out there scared to death. And, you know, that way they can kind of know-tow us all and make us just say, uh, “Well, look it’s not worth it,” and then even when you have somebody like Collins who, you know, is a moderate Republican. You know, it’s still female voices. I think Kavanaugh gets through, but I think the next judge has to be a woman.RUSH: You think that has to be because of what women are doing? You think the only way that we can get somebody on the court is for her to be a woman?CALLER: Oh, yeah.RUSH: Well, you know, there was a woman that was on the list, equally as high on Trump’s list as was Kavanaugh. And they didn’t go for her first. I forget what the thinking was. I’m having a mental block on her name, but she was and is highly reputed. My memory is that though decided to go with Kavanaugh first on the basis of his qualifications being such that there couldn’t be any reasonable opposition to him. Ha-ha-ha-ha.But more importantly, they wanted to wait for a female nominee for the next opening. (interruption) Yeah, Amy Coney Barrett is the name that was being bandied about, coequal with Kavanaugh. They decided on Kavanaugh because, A, “He’s impeccable! Can’t get anybody better. There’s nobody better judicially, intellectually, emotionally. Nobody better. No legitimate reason to oppose the guy,” was the thinking. They didn’t want to throw Amy Cohen Barrett up until there was maybe a vacancy, say, from Ruth Ginsburg or Elena Kagan or Sonia Sotomayor.And they thought it would be more advantageous to her to have her nominated to fill a seat vacated by a woman. Now, I think all this kind of thinking is cockamamie, and it does demonstrate what we’ve all known for years, and that is the Supreme Court is just a political institution. It’s long since been abandoned as what it was originally intended to be. But your thought that what this really is, is an all-out assault on men everywhere and a desire to keep a men out of positions of power.Folks, do not discount that as being something that several literally (sigh) lunatic people on the left think. They’ve been taught this in years and years of Women’s Studies courses. “All sex is rape, including the sex in marriage.” I mean, women in two straight generations, if not more, have literally been poisoned with male hatred, hatred for men on college campuses across the country. So there is an element of truth to that.But I do believe that this particular instance is about delay and specifically rooted in polling data that makes the Democrats think they can win the Senate. Mazie Hirono from Hawaii — who said men should just shut up and go away or step up and do right thing. She said that the Democrats could keep the seat open on the Supreme Court vacant. They could keep it for ’til after the 2020 election if Kavanaugh’s nomination collapses.“If the Democrats regain control of the Senate in November,” she said (paraphrased). “We can keep this seat open ’til Trump’s gone. We don’t have to fill this seat. We don’t have to. Whoever he sends up, we don’t have to vote on ’em ever.” So this is a plan. Believe me, folks, Kavanaugh is seen as not an Anthony Kennedy. Anthony Kennedy was the centrist moderate, go with the left. Now, Kavanaugh’s not that. They are petrified of Kavanaugh and losing any semblance of control over the court, and then the next nomination after that? They are petrified.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Yeah, there was one — Amy Coney Barrett — and there was one other thing. She was the nominee that Dianne Feinstein said, “The dogma lives loudly in you,” meaning your Catholicism, your dogma. “You really believe the dogma!” Of course, that was code lingo for, “This woman is way too anti-abortion.” That’s why they withheld her.

I want to share some things with you that may be fake news, but if they’re not fake, I want to be on record as having had them for you. There’s a Twitter thread out there. I have no idea the veracity because, as you know, I do not “twit.” But this particular thread claims that the reason that Dianne Feinstein was reluctant to go public with Christine Blasey Ford’s letter is because she received a similar letter from the woman about Judge Gorsuch. No idea whether this is fake news or true.But given who we’re talking about here, I can believe that it would be true, ’cause I think we’re dealing with genuinely disturbed, emotionally depraved, poisoned-with-hatred lunatics. I have no idea if it’s true. There’s another bit of news going around that has a little bit more credibility but still it doesn’t pass the “definitely happened” test. It is that Peter Strzok Smirk and Lisa Page were caught destroying evidence on their final days at the FBI. Neither two bits of news can be confirmed. But let me tell you something.The New York Times and the Washington Post and USA Today and all the rest of them are publishing fake news and lies every damn day without one bit of concern whether they’re true or not, and half of them they didn’t even bother to correct. And it’s not something normally that I get into. But these two things have the tinge of believability to them, and I just want to get them out there in case it eventuates that they’re actually true. I can’t confirm either one.But you know, I’m sick and tired of being hampered here. These people get to lie and distort and do whatever they want under the banner of premier journalism each and every day, making up sources, making up quotes, writing such things as, “President Trump, without evidence, today claimed” blah, blah. But they never say, “Christine Blasey Ford, without evidence, claimed today that Brett Kavanaugh pinned her down in a high school room in a house and so forth 42 years ago when they both were…” Who knows.

I don’t want anybody to misunderstand, because this is real. The Democrats are trying to destroy Kavanaugh. They’re trying to keep him off the court. This is real.But while this is going on, do you know what else is happening? The Senate just authorized the biggest and fastest spending bill in the history of spending bills. The United States government’s collecting record tax revenue. We’ve had Republicans running for office for years claiming to want to get control of spending. That’s why the Tea Party came into existence in part in 2010.

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/18/my-gut-response-to-this-susan-collins-tweet/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 18, 2018RUSH: There is a development… I don’t know what I think about this. I have my gut reaction to it, and then I backed off and I started thinking about it. It’s a tweet from Senator Susan Collins. Susan Collins is from Maine. She is buddy-buddy with Lisa Murkowski from Alaska. They’re two Republican senators who are constantly thought to be on the bubble, and whenever there is a judicial nominee for any position, but especially the Supreme Court…It is said that if there is any, the slightest indication that that nominee might not be thinking the right way on abortion, then Susan Collins and Murkowski will vote with Democrats to kill the nomination. And because of this, the Democrats are constantly applying pressure to both of them. And they have been working overtime to try to pressure Susan Collins to commit to voting against Kavanaugh because of their claims that he would reverse Roe v. Wade and all that paranoia that the Democrats have.And she resisted. So the next thing they did is they created a GoFundMe campaign for a phantom candidate to oppose her in the Senate campaign for Maine. That GoFundMe campaign or however they funded it reached a million dollars. They were trying to blackmail her. They were telling her, “If you will commit to voting against Kavanaugh, then we’ll pull this money out of the race against you and we will not assist the candidate who opposes you.” She didn’t buck to that. So when that failed, they sent her — and I’m not making this up.I’m sorry I have to tell you, but they sent her a-three-foot cardboard cutout of male genitalia in another attempt to — I don’t know what — bully her or offend her, and she said, “This is it. I’ve had enough of this. I’ve enough of these anti-Kavanaugh tactics.” So that’s Susan Collins, and she has been, as I say, target for much bullying and manipulation by the left. So she sent a tweet out a little over an hour ago. Her tweet says, I’m writing to the Chairman [and ranking member] of Judiciary [Committee]…” That would be Grassley and Feinstein.“I’m writing to the Chairman & RM of Judiciary Cmte respectfully recommending that at Monday’s hearing, counsel for Prof. Ford be allocated time to question Judge Kavanaugh & counsel for the Judge be granted equal time to question Prof. Ford, followed by questions from Senators.” My first reaction when I saw that was, “Why don’t we just cash in the chips now and say the country as we knew it is over?” We’re now officially the Jerry Springer Show in the United States Senate, or take your pick.Whatever daytime soap opera fare that people watch. Are we serious about this, that lawyers for Professor Ford be allowed time to question Kavanaugh, and that his lawyers be allowed time to question her? By the way, she’s still has not responded to the invitation to show up to this thing on Monday. I think they ought to bag this and just do the vote on Thursday. To hell with it! Just bag it and do it. But they won’t because they’re afraid of losing it now. But that doesn’t matter. The committee vote doesn’t matter.Mitch McConnell can schedule a full Senate vote on this nominee without the committee voting. It’s just Senate protocol that the Judiciary Committee has a vote and then that’s supposed to inform the rest of the Senate that it’s okay to vote for the guy or that they shouldn’t. I mean that’s how silly it is. The Judiciary Committee vote is not gonna determine how people in the general population of the Senate vote. We’re actually…?Because somebody sent Dianne Feinstein a letter, we’re gonna have a circus on Monday, and Code Pink and every leftist protest group is gonna be in there. If you remember the embarrassment that happened during the confirmation hearings for four days… Kavanaugh’s parents with their heads in their hands. In a moment that any other time in American history would be one of the proudest, most glorious days for an American family, that one of their children had succeeded and achieved in life to the point of being nominated to be an associate justice on the United States Supreme Court.It was turned into… “Circus” is not even the right way to describe what they did, with the Democrats’ acquiescence and letting it happen, I am certain. What should have been a moment of great pride and overwhelming love and excitement was turned into a despicable, embarrassing spectacle that was beneath all of the decency this country is known for. And it was by design. If they allow that to happen during confirmation hearings, can you imagine what this thing on Monday would become? So lawyers interrogate her; then other lawyers interrogate him.This man is a nominee to be on the United States Supreme Court! An allegation that her lawyers say she doesn’t even have to prove? And then after all that, blowhard senators get their turn asking questions? Dianne Feinstein, Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin? Susan Collins then tweeted, “Such an approach would provide more continuity, elicit the most information & allow an in-depth examination of the allegations.” (sigh) That is just… Folks, whatever it is, it is a gigantic come-down.At any rate, all this notwithstanding, her tweet probably will send the Democrats into orbit with rage, ’cause they were counting on flipping her. They were counting on her saying before this even began that she’s had enough. “This is the last straw! I can’t support the guy. Look at what’s being said. I can’t possibly…” That’s what they were hoping Collins would say. Now she wants to see a circus. Kavanaugh’s lawyer… He’s hired a lawyer; I should tell you this. Brett Kavanaugh’s hired Beth Wilkinson. Does the name ring a bell?Does anybody know who Beth Wilkinson is? A, she’s the wife of David Gregory of CNN/NBC. B, she represented Hillary Clinton staffers during the FBI investigation into Clinton’s private server. Those staffers were Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan, Heather Samuelson, and Philippe Reines. She’s also said to be a stellar lawyer, and apparently one of her specialties is defamation — attacking and defending defamation accusations — which is exactly what this is.This is an up-front attempt to defame and destroy Brett Kavanaugh. I was just saying yesterday, “We opposed some of the nominees the Democrats put forward. When is the last time you remember anybody on our side trying to literally destroy the life and career and reputation of a political opponent, any more so than they already had?” I mean, with Bill Clinton there was evidence. He did it. Nothing was made up.And all those people defending Bill Clinton saying it doesn’t matter, it’s just sex– Hillary Clinton and all these other people responsible for trashing these women that came forward — are now the same people claiming that Kavanaugh is scum and that this woman (who’s never said a word about any of this for 36 years) is eminently believable.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now back to Doug in Chicago. So let me read… You’re still there, right?CALLER: Yes, sir.RUSH: Right on. Let me read her tweet. This is what Doug thinks is genius. Susan Collins says, “I’m writing to the Chairman & [ranking member] of Judiciary [Committee] respectfully recommending that at Monday’s hearing, counsel for” the woman, lawyers for the woman, “be allocated time to question Judge Kavanaugh & [lawyers] for the Judge be granted equal time to question [the accuser], followed by questions from Senators.” Now, as you point out, there are no female Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee. So what do you think is a stroke of genius about this?CALLER: Well, I think that you let those attorneys go back and forth, and then all the Republicans can come back and play off of points that the female attorney had already raised. In theory… I mean, I think I heard that Arlen Specter told Anita Hill that she had perjured herself. There’s no way any man on that committee could do that in this environment. But this attorney can, and I believe that she is taking the teeth out of the Democrats and the women —RUSH: Oh, you’re talking about Kavanaugh’s lawyer!CALLER: — and will prevent them from doing a Spartacus moment.RUSH: I see. You’re talking about Kavanaugh’s lawyer, Beth Wilkinson. You’re saying that she can do what no male senator can do today that Specter did with Anita Hill.CALLER: And she can serve up points, so all the senator do are following up on a point that she raised. It’s not their bigot, the misogynism. It’s a point that she made to another female. I just don’t see how they can sit there and say, “These men, these old Grumpy Old Men,” when the point has been raised by a female attorney in the course of the conversation.RUSH: Okay.CALLER: I think she’s probably more of a litigant attorney than the woman’s attorney.RUSH: Okay.CALLER: So I think Kavanaugh does great and —RUSH: Okay. I got you. But beyond the… Let me just ask you a question. You obviously think that what Collins is tweeted here sets up a very advantageous circumstance for Republican senators on the committee which, otherwise, they’d be hampered. What do you think of the whole concept here of this spectacle on Monday where you have the accuser…? You’ve got Judge Kavanaugh about whom nobody has ever said anything like this, and here he is on defense. By definition, he’s on defense with lawyers running around in there plus all these senators on this committee. What is your overall opinion of the whole spectacle that it would be?CALLER: I think it’s a disgrace, and it makes the original hearings look passive, and I think it was a ploy. I think it’s a ploy; it’s gonna backfire. I think it’s absolutely wrong. I just think it’s disgraceful. I’m like you, it just bothers me to some extent. You know, that’s one thing about being conservative. We’re not gonna go out on the streets and wear black masks and backpacks and start throwing things at people or yelling out obscenities. It just seems so un-American that a guy of this reputation. And the fact that it came at the last minute?RUSH: I know.CALLER: I’m sorry, there are so many ways —RUSH: One letter! One letter can do this! (Snort!) I keep going back to this because I’m truly incredulous. I realize in matters like this I still sometimes come across as naïve, and I don’t care. I really don’t. The idea that these people run around and broadcast proudly the idea that the accuser doesn’t have to prove anything, that the accuser doesn’t have to corroborate? You realize what all of this means? You realize how easy it is now to derail anything the United States Senate is doing?A letter to Dianne Feinstein, or pick your senator, and we can bring everything to a screeching halt in utter defiance of common sense and utter decency and turn this into an absolutely… If there isn’t a backlash against the Democrats on all this, then I’m gonna be wondering, “Where is justice?” This, to me, is just so beyond the pale. I loathe this. I detest these people. These people are just despicable. And listen to A.B. Stoddard! “You think that a left-wing activist would actually want to ruin her life by doing this?”Ruin her life!It the Emmys last night there were already premade pins that people could wear, “I Believe In” whatever this woman’s name is. Ballsy? Ballsy? What’s her name? I can’t remember her name. Any, I believe — and then their companion, “I Still Believe in Anita Hill.” Anita Hill is still a heroine to these people on the left. (interruption) Right, Christine Blasey Ford. That’s what it is. I believe Christine Blasey Ford, these little pink pins that they were passing out in the crowd at the Emmys last night, and, “I Still Believe in Anita Hill.” The idea that somehow Christine Blasey Ford is gonna be damaged by this? Even so, whose fault is that?Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.Let me get one more call before we go.Alice in Greenville somewhere. Great to have you on the EIB Network. Hello.CALLER: A longtime listener and absolutely thrilled to be able to talk to you.RUSH: Thank you very much. It’s great to have you here.CALLER: Uh-huh. I’m gonna get to my point very quickly. I was telling the screener that the postponement ’til Monday of the circus that’s going to come only gives people who support Kavanaugh a time to build him up, as has already started and his attorney time to unravel some of the things that are truthful things. They don’t have to make stuff up. They don’t have to pull anything. They just have to present this accuser’s lifestyle, her demonstrations that she’s been involved with. I’ve heard some things about possibly a grudge thing with her parents and —RUSH: That turns out to be not true.CALLER: Okay.RUSH: That’s another thing. You’ve got to be very careful here.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: We had that story yesterday. Kavanaugh’s mother did not foreclose against this woman’s parents. It was just, in fact, maybe the opposite. It was fake news that was out there yesterday.CALLER: But I just think it gives them some extra days to do some truth checking on those things and her testimony and her personality will come to light just as Brett Kavanaugh’s will.RUSH: Okay.CALLER: I just think that it gives them extra time to unravel her testimony. You know, I’m on his side. I really support him.RUSH: Oh, I understand. I just don’t think Democrat senators are gonna allow what you just described to happen.CALLER: Even if Brett Kavanaugh’s lawyer is asking the questions to her?RUSH: The Senate runs the show, and it’s not a courtroom. It’s the United States Senate. It will be the Judiciary Committee hearing, and they can shut down anybody any time.CALLER: I see.RUSH: If they think that Kavanaugh’s lawyer is being mean, unnecessarily contentious, accusatory, other legal terms, they can shut it down. Of course, you think Dick Durbin won’t stand and do head stands? Look, I realize what you’re saying. The theory is that with Beth Wilkinson as the lawyer for Kavanaugh that she will be more easily able to really bore into and expose the accuser as a fraud, if she is, whereas a male senator couldn’t do it because of the #MeToo movement and feminism and all that. But another woman could. (sigh) Look, it may be true, but then the question becomes, “Would Kavanaugh’s female lawyer do that anyway?” I don’t know. We’re dealing with swamp-dwellers here, folks.That’s as much as I’m gonna say.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/18/democrat-strategist-lies-in-response-to-your-host/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 18, 2018RUSH: Your host was once again savagely attacked on television last night. On CNN International’s Newsroom, they were talking about the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. The anchor, John Vause, was talking to Democrat strategerist Caroline Heldman.VAUSE: Here’s how Rush Limbow (sic) put it on Monday on his talk-back (sic) radio show…RUSH: If this woman did not want this taken any farther, then the Democrats are betraying her — and I don’t believe the Democrats are betraying her. I think she is part of a cabal doing everything they can to stop Kavanaugh or, if they can’t stop him, to cast such a cloud.VAUSE: What’s the likelihood that she made it all up?HELDMAN: The likelihood that she made it up, according to the FBI, general statistics is 2 to 8%. But in her particular case, she’s taken a lie detector test. And of the 65 women who came forward to support Brett Kavanaugh, when Politico went to speak with them, only two of them still backed up their claim that he was a good guy!RUSH: That’s not true!HELDMAN: If somebody murders somebody you can find 100 people to say that person’s a good guy.RUSH: Wait a minute! Stop it! That is not true! That is not what happened! (sigh) Here we go again. Okay. So this is Caroline Heldman, and she is a Democrat strategist, and note the way she says that we can trust the allegations. Well, the likelihood that she made it up according to FBI statistics is 2 to 8%. So there’s a 98 to 92% chance that she’s telling the truth, and that’s we on the left need, FBI statistics. And then she launches in: She took a lie detector test.Yeah, given to her by her lawyer, who’s funded and paid off by George Soros.“And of the 65 women who came forward to support Brett Kavanaugh, when Politico went to speak with them, only two of them still backed up their claim that he was a good guy!” That’s not true! Only two of them wanted to go public. None of them withdrew their claims about Kavanaugh being upright and a decent guy. None of them changed their minds. They just didn’t want to go public ’cause they don’t want to be part of the circus. Two of them did and they appeared last night on the Fox News Channel.So they’re just outright lying here about the statistics and the degree to which the accuser may be telling the truth and making up things about the women that are supporting Kavanaugh kind of peeling off now. That number is not 65. It’s 200. There’s a scholar at the Hoover Institution (which is part of the Stanford campus out in Palo Alto) Richard Epstein. He’s a brilliant guy, and he’s written about this.I want to give you some excerpts of what he has said about this, ’cause I’m sure this is one of those things when you read it, when you hear it, you’re gonna be saying, “Yeah, yeah, yeah! I wish I had said that.” This last-ditch decision to sabotage Kavanaugh at the 11th hour is a disgusting piece of political propaganda. By the way, I’m leaving parts out where he says she’s to be believed and we give her the benefit of the doubt. He’s been totally open and fair-minded about her. But now he gets into the tactics.“Christine Blasey Ford behaved wholly improperly when she decided to write a letter only to ‘a senior Democratic lawmaker,’ in which she made the most serious allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh. At the very least, she ought to have handled matters wholly differently. If she wanted to keep matters confidential, she should have sent that letter to President Trump and to Senator Chuck Grassley…“She also should have sent it to the FBI for investigation. And she should have done all of these things at the earliest possible moment, in time for a principled and neutral examination to take place before the Senate hearings took place. Then, she should have sat for a cross-examination.” Well, he’s exactly right. She didn’t do any of this. “Putting the information exclusively in the hands of key Democrats thus invited the wholly corrupt strategy that has now unfolded. First, the Democrats would try to discredit Kavanaugh by engaging in a set of procedural antics and obnoxious substantive questions during the hearing, without mentioning this letter. When that strategy abjectly failed, they knew they had to go to Plan B, which was to release the letter and the allegation days before the confirmation vote.“A perfect sandbag, for the Democrats knew full well that there was no time to respond to them, without causing an enormous delay in the confirmation hearings. Their hope was, and is, to create a huge media circus that would take weeks if not months to sort out. Shipwreck this nomination.” Wave goodbye to Kavanaugh. “Make it impossible for the current Senate to pass on any subsequent nominee before January. Then take control of the Senate and create a stalemate that could run on until the next presidential election.“And for what? Ford, Kavanaugh’s accuser, maintained a stony silence on these allegations for more than 35 years. At no point did she raise them in connection with the Senate confirmation hearings before Kavanaugh was confirmed in 2006. Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegations. Late last week, Mark Judge, his alleged accomplice, denounced the allegations as ‘absolutely nuts.’ No other woman has ever made any allegation of this sort against Kavanaugh, and 65 women,” now 200, by the way, “have written an explicit letter in his defense.“Kavanaugh is right not to respond beyond his categorical denial, knowing full well that further comment would only draw him further into a vortex on which credibility determinations would be unending. And the Senate is right to continue with the confirmation vote” on Thursday, especially if they do not have an acknowledgment from Christine Ford that she’s even gonna show up for this my call hearing on Monday.Now Chuck Schumer and the Democrats are saying, “Wait a minute. You can’t just do a hearing with her and Kavanaugh. We need all kinds of witnesses! We need Mark Judge in there. We need all kinds of witnesses. You can’t just have her and him in there.” Well, wait a minute, I thought that’s what everybody wanted at first. We’re gonna have her in there and we’re gonna have him in there and we’re gonna make a decision as to who’s telling the truth, right?Do you realize what a circus that’s gonna be Monday, if this were to actually happen? Do you realize? How many Code Pink people the Democrat senators gonna let in! What kind of an abject, humiliating, embarrassing-for-the-country circus do the Democrats have planned if this hearing on Monday actually happens? This is an abomination, what they’re doing. The destroying the life and career of a great American, sullying and erasing the basic tenets of the United States Constitution. It just pains me that more average Americans are not livid about this, outraged at this, and ready to punish Democrats like they’ve never been punished at the ballot box in November.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, does the FBI keep statistics on rape? I’m asking because I didn’t know they investigated that crime. But where does that come from, 2% of…? What is it, only 2% lie, only 2% of women lie? I think that’s statistics from that Susan Brownmiller book. Brownmiller. She wrote the definitive book on rape. It’s not about sex. It’s about power and violence. I forget the name of the book, but I don’t think that’s an FBI stat. Anyway, this Democrat strategist cited it on CNN International last night.  "

Great to have you up first today. So, welcome.CALLER: Hi.RUSH: Hi.CALLER: Very nervous. Always wanted to talk to you. So, I was calling in because this whole thing really has me so up in arms because it’s a mockery of all women, Number one, —RUSH: How so?CALLER: — that have been raped. Well, if they have been raped, they should be listened to. And when there’s any doubt cast upon it, it’s just making those women look silly.

Anybody who ever came to a high school party at my house better not ever be nominated to be a judge anywhere, ’cause all kinds of this stuff… I mean teenagers are teenagers, and women… The thing about this, the thing that gets me is that in this era of feminism, the left still wants to portray women as helpless, besieged victims of predatory men. I would say feminism has totally bombed out in whatever its objective was, because now the #MeToo movement is predicated on the fact that whenever a woman says this happened, by golly, by gosh, it did! And you have to accept it, and you…Now, in that sense, maybe feminism can claim a couple of scalps and some success.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I’m just telling you, this is so obviously a manufactured event that I cringe when I hear people taking this seriously.

It just does.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Ashley in West Palm Beach. Great to have you with us. Glad you waited.CALLER: Hi. Mega dittos. I’ve been listening to you since 1998.RUSH: Well, thank you very much. I appreciate that.CALLER: Okay. I have a question to the feminazis that are out there. I would like them to answer to me and other women who may have been victims of anything related to this. What kind of damage are you doing to the American women in general by bringing up an accusation that you cannot prove that is most likely completely bogus? The American people can smell BS a mile away. They’re a good-natured and fair-minded people, and this smells to the high heavens, first of all.And second of all, it is a huge disservice to actual victims. They won’t ever be believed, and this will go on and on and on, unless this congressional Senate puts a stop to it. I agree with you that they need to vote on Thursday, and I would bet… I don’t have a lot of money, but I would bet this woman will not show up because the world is watching, and she’s weighing her options, trying to figure out how she can come across as believable when she’s probably lying. And the actual people in this country who will never come forward with their stories are being done a great disservice by someone like Dianne Feinstein and the entire Democratic Party. And I’m infuriated.RUSH: You’re right. And, by the way, this is not the first time. There have been similar examples involving race. This one happens to involve sex. But there have been numerous efforts the Democrats have made which have actually resulted in real victims not being believed when they’ve come forward because of the circus that attached itself to something that was bogus like this. So you really…? You don’t believe this woman?CALLER: Not at all. I am a woman, and I did have a similar experience to her allegation in high school. And being that I was somewhat drunk as a teen and I shouldn’t have been, I don’t actually have a very good memory. But I am the exception, not the rule. And I have… I can’t believe this woman based on her background… But you have to put into perspective that she does (unintelligible). She is an activist.You have to put all that in perspective. You have to put in the fact that Dianne Feinstein knew about this apparently six weeks ago and didn’t say anything. In closed sessions, she didn’t say anything. They are using this because they will use anything, they will do anything to destroy anyone that Trump puts forward. If they get rid of Kavanaugh, he puts up somebody else.They will use somebody and somebody else to come up in the last hour to accuse that person. And honestly, I think that they want to use this (unintelligible). I think they want to make this the reason why get-out-the-vote, because if they can get-out-the-vote and generate their liberal activists to come out and vote, (unintelligible) better Supreme Court justice, then (unintelligible).RUSH: I think they’re running the risk of a backfire in terms of getting out the vote. If you’re right, you said the average American is repulsed by this and can see what’s going on. If you’re right about that, then this is not good for the Democrats and their midterm desires and expectations. Look, Ashley, great call. I’m glad you made it through.  "

She said if Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh lied when he denied sexually assaulting this accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, then obviously he’d be disqualified from advancing to the Supreme Court.“If he lied.” Despite his impeccable character, a lifetime of distinguished accomplishments, his unquestionably honorable government service, it’s now up to Judge Kavanaugh to somehow prove he’s not lying. Against a last-minute allegation that came totally out of left field.“If he lied.” Well, here’s a better question. How about: “if she lied”? What happens if this Democrat Party donor and activist, following the Anita Hill playbook, is lying? Will she be “disqualified” from anything? Will any of the Democrats, like Dianne Feinstein, who orchestrated this ambush, will they be “disqualified”?To many of us, there’s no question what’s going on here. It’s transparent. It’s despicable. It’s desperate. It’s evil. And it’s not the first time we’ve seen it. Certainly not from Democrats. Now they are saying she doesn’t have to corroborate her lie– her statement. What is this folks?This is nothing but absurd.  "

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/17/my-email-from-a-victim-of-attempted-rape/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 17, 2018RUSH: “Dear, Mr. Limbaugh, when I was in college, 19 years old, I went on a date with a guy I did not know. He was older; a grad student. Afterwards, he took me to his apartment and tried to rape me. I got away unscathed, but I remember precisely where it happened. I don’t remember his name, as I never had another encounter with him, and I did not know him before the date. But to not remember the house, to not remember the street, to not remember what the room looked like, to not remember where it happened is inconceivable to me. Kavanaugh’s accuser does not remember the house where the party was. Well, I remember, Mr. Limbaugh, where I was accosted.“And, Mr. Limbaugh, I am proud to say the experience did not scar me for years afterward. In fact, I was proud that I had figured out how to get away. I was proud that I sent the guy packing. I was proud that I did not succumb to any psychological or emotional trauma. Signed,” XX. And I know the identity. I know who sent it, but the person requests anonymity. And, admittedly, it’s sent in refutation of Christine Blasey Ford.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/17/an-orchestrated-democrat-smear/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 17, 2018RUSH: Okay. So Kavanaugh has been saying… By the way, Kavanaugh went to the White House today. The White House is standing behind Kavanaugh. They are continuing to sponsor his nomination, as we would expect to be the case. This accuser has covered a lot of ground in a very short period of time. As recently as last Wednesday, last Thursday, she didn’t want to be known. She didn’t want this carried any further than the letter she wrote to Senator Feinstein.She didn’t want the FBI looking into it. She didn’t want any part of it. And then on the eve of the vote that would lead to the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Dianne Feinstein held the letter up and said (paraphrased), “I got this letter here! I got this letter from a woman, who said unspecified horrible things happened to her. I’ve had it for a while here, and I think I’m gonna refer this to the FBI for investigation.” The FBI took a look at it and one of the first things I saw, anyway, was the FBI was not going to investigate it.It didn’t take long for a woman who did not want to be known and the details of her story she didn’t want known to now she has said she wants to come testify as well. Senator Grassley, who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has said (summarized), “Well, we’re gonna treat her with all the respect we would treat anybody else who’s been invited to testify. We’re gonna bring her up here, extend the invitation.” There is some talk that she might want to do her testifying behind closed doors.Now, that is not usually afforded. If you’re gonna do something like this, you testify in public, under oath. Now, where it stands now is Kavanaugh has said he’ll go anywhere, anytime to tell anybody whatever it is they want to know about this. He maintains he didn’t do it, he didn’t even know who this woman was. He hasn’t the slightest idea what this is about. Which is very close to what Justice Thomas said, except that he knew Anita Hill.He couldn’t figure it out because Anita Hill practically had a crush on him, was following him everywhere he went. Every new job he got, she tried to tag along. In this case, Kavanaugh is saying he didn’t even know who she was — and he’s not sure now that he knows who she is. Kavanaugh has a friend, a guy named Mark Judge, who was, according to the accuser, in the room at the same time Kavanaugh was doing the nasty, allegedly doing the nasty. And this guy says that didn’t happen.(summarized) “I’m telling you, whatever she says, I don’t remember a thing of this. None of this happened.” But the problem is that Mark Judge has written a book about what a drunkard he was in high school (chuckling) and reliving his days about how they were all just drunk and happy and doing whatever whenever they wanted to and so forth. So it’s kind of… Ah, it’s a little bit of a weakening of his testimony here when he says he doesn’t remember because he admits that similar times in high school he was one who consumed significant quantities of adult beverage.So I still maintain… You know, the committee hearing vote, the Judiciary Committee… The way these things normally happen is the Judiciary Committee votes on a nominee, and if the nominee passes the committee, then the vote goes to full Senate. Mitch McConnell, if he wanted to — The Turtle. He could go for a full-fledged Senate vote without a committee vote. He can do that. He is the Senate leader. So he can schedule a vote on the nominee whether there is a Judiciary Committee vote or not.The question then becomes, “Would he violate tradition and the gentlemanly, courtly rules of the Senate in such a fashion?” And if he did, what would be the outcome of that vote? Would there be so many senators, courtly and gentlemanly outraged that this violation of Senate etiquette that they would vote against the nominee just for that reason alone? Where do we stand on senators? Well, we’ve had the brave and courageous Senators Corker and Jeff Flake at the first opportunity they could say, “Whoa. We need to pull back.“I don’t think I can vote for this nominee now until I learn more.” Now, with both these guys, I’m pretty safe in saying that what is governing them is their Never Trumper status — their genuine, undiluted animus for Donald Trump — and thus their desire to screw with his every plan, be it a judicial appointment or be it an agenda item or policy, if these guys can. Flake, of course, is leaving the Senate. He would not have been reelected had he tried, probably would have lost even in the primary.But there’s a lot of bitterness. There’s a lot of lingering bitterness and rancor in the Republican Party over the fact that Trump won. And there’s still an effervescing desire on the part of some Republicans to pay Trump back and deny Trump any victories so that they can join the Democrats in trying to get rid of Donald Trump. But every Republican vote would be needed in order to confirm Kavanaugh. If they lose two, now we’re down, you know, to 50-50. There’s some red state senators that were gonna vote for Kavanaugh.Particularly if it appeared that Kavanaugh was gonna be confirmed, Schumer was gonna quietly tell a bunch of red state Democrats that if it’ll little help here in your reelection, go ahead and vote for the guy. So we were looking at potentially 55 or 56 votes for Kavanaugh, which would include some Democrats like Joe Manchin from West Virginia. But if Corker and Flake peel off then that will give these red state Democrats all the cover they need to also peel off. And we could now be beyond the point where the vote of the vice president would put Kavanaugh over the top.So look. If she’s gonna make the allegations, I guess you have to bring her up and let her testify. The question then becomes, “Will she?” Says she wants to. But does anybody think she’s actually gonna show up this week and do it? The committee vote is Thursday. They want to get Kavanaugh confirmed before the midterms, the Republicans do, the Senate — and the Republicans run the Senate right now. So if they want the vote to occur before the midterms, that’s when it’s gonna occur, if the Republicans maintain testicular fortitude.We’ll just have to wait and see. The Democrats want to delay this until after the midterms for the obvious reason they think they’re gonna win everything. They think they’re gonna win the House and now they think they’re gonna win the Senate because of the generic ballot polling. And if they win both, then they’re gonna impeach Trump within six months of the new Congress being sworn in in January, and there won’t be any new nominees ’cause they’re gonna block anything Trump would send up there because they are still seething over Merrick Garland.Barack Hussein O nominated Garland to replace Justice Scalia after he passed away, and the Republicans said, “Wait a minute. We’re not gonna have hearings in an election year. We might have a new president get elected; Hillary might lose. We’re gonna wait for a new president to have this nominee.” Democrats were fit to be tied! Because the Supreme Court seat remained vacant for close to a year. Then of course Trump won, and that gave him the opportunity to nominate the placement for Scalia, and he nominated Neil Gorsuch.The Democrats have been seething ever since, and so calls for a quick appearance by the alleged victim — demands that she show up this week and get this testimony over and done with — Democrats are gonna say, “We’re in no hurry. You weren’t in any hurry in order to confirm Merrick Garland. You delayed and delayed and eventually his nomination had to be pulled.” So we have a combination of things here.We have just standard, ordinary, everyday operational political strategy going on here combined with an attempt yet again by the left to destroy a decent person and his family. And that would be Brett Kavanaugh. The Democrats don’t trust to be able to win on politics alone — and it’s not just Kavanaugh. They need to destroy anybody credible who opposes them. They need to ruin them. As such, I don’t think decent people quite know how to deal with this. Decent people don’t spend their day strategizing like this.And, as such, they don’t end up being prepared for it. By definition, decent people are not prepared for this kind of thing. Not that they’re ignorant to it. It’s just they don’t go through each and every day studying and prepping on how to get ready for the next smear job from the Democrat Party. A couple of more little factoids about the accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. As I mentioned to you, she is a left-wing political activist.She has worn one of those vagina hats at some anti-Trump marches. She “has taken part in events opposing President Donald Trump, including a science march in California last year where she donned a version of the ‘p—y hats’ worn at the January 2017 Women’s March. She “is cited in a San Jose Mercury News article as wearing the hat at the march, which the newspaper said was held because people were ‘angered by the Trump administration’s proposed cuts to research.'”She also “Signed [a] Letter Fighting Trump Border Enforcement — Christine Blasey Ford “signed a letter fighting Trump’s ‘Zero Tolerance’ policy at the U.S.-Mexico border. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) — an open borders advocacy organization — letter was written and sent to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June.“Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor, signed the ACLU letter as ‘Christine Blasey Ph.D. Psychologist…'” So clearly she’s a political activist. She’s an angry political activist. She’s much more than just a victim of alleged attempted rape. She seems to be a little bit more politically attuned and aware than was Anita Hill. Now, remember Anita Hill, they had to drag her out of wherever she was. She did not voluntarily come forward.It was the wife of Illinois senator Paul Simon working with Howard Metzenbaum that went out there and dragged Anita Hill up, and they coached her. They got her fired up eventually, but they went out and found her at the last minute. This woman apparently sends the letter all on her own. But look, it all boils down to just what do we want to believe about the left? And the idea that any of this is spontaneous needs to be rejected.None of it is. The Democrats have been holding this. They’ve been holding it for use at precisely this time, and I’m not sure I believe that Christine Blasey Ford never wanted to be made known. I don’t believe she didn’t want to go public. I don’t believe that she sent a letter to Feinstein and then said, “Please do not do anything with this. Please do not forward this to the FBI. Please do not name me.” Why send it? I don’t believe any of this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. Back to the phones we go to Bath, Michigan. This is Ray. Welcome, sir. It’s great to have you. Hi.CALLER: Hi. Yeah. I just wanted to make a quick point, and it ties right in with the “not-prepared” thing you were saying a moment ago here, and it’s that this seems like it’s lacking a lot of context. ‘Cause what we’ve got is half the context where we’ve been told a pretty ugly story about how she maybe was forced down onto a bed. But what’s the end? If you put it together it sounds like it ended with him not raping her, not doing horrible things to her, getting off the bed and respecting her boundaries.You know, in high school, all kinds of stuff happens, and sometimes guys and gals are on a different page. But it doesn’t sound like if you tell the story in its full context that he did anything all too bad. It sounds like he didn’t do a lot of bad things. And I think that’s why Kavanaugh didn’t want to bring this forward, because it really isn’t anything in its full context. It’s an assault from 36 years ago.RUSH: You think this is why Kavanaugh didn’t bring it up? You think Kavanaugh remembered this, but thought it’s not worth mentioning because —CALLER: Oh, no, no. I’m sorry. Dianne Feinstein. I’m a little nervous on the radio.RUSH: Oh. Oh, you think Feinstein knows that there’s really nothing to this and that’s why she was reluctant —CALLER: Right.RUSH: — to bring it forth except when there was no other option?CALLER: Right. And, if you finish the story, well, there’s a lot of horrible ways it could end, but they’re not leading with he did those horrible things, they’re leading with that something inappropriate happened, but in the end it sounds like there’s a lot he didn’t do.RUSH: Well it’s —CALLER: That’s my thought.RUSH: Wait. Wait, wait, wait. It’s ending with her being completely traumatized, with PTSD and finally going to a therapist six years ago after holding it in for all of those years. She finally went to a therapist. Her husband was in the therapy with her; she told the sordid details. Did she mention Kavanaugh’s name to the therapist or not? I don’t think she did.It came out later, but, anyway, the point is, whether he did anything or not is not the point. She said she was ruined by it. That’s all it takes. This is the #MeToo environment, don’t forget. And a lot of Democrats have bitten the dust here. We’ve got Harvey Weinstein. We got Les Moonves. There’s a whole bunch of them that had been taken out. The Democrats thinking it’s time for some vice versa here, among many other things.The #MeToo movement’s claimed a lot of people, most of them Democrats, and the objective here is not what really happened. In this case, it’s how did she feel? If there was no completion of this abuse or whatever, but she still was psychologically scarred for the rest of her life by it, then it must have been typical brutish predator male behavior that we are not going to tolerate in this cisgender patriarchal society anymore, you see.CALLER: The bar has to be higher than things that happened in high school 36 years ago that did not get reported as crimes or weren’t serious enough to yield reporting 30 years following. That’s —RUSH: What bar has…? There is no bar. We’re talking about the Democrat Party here. We’re talking if there’s a bar, it’s how low it goes, not… I know what you’re saying.CALLER: Yeah. Yeah. I know what you’re saying. Yeah. Yeah.RUSH: But, I mean, you’ve got Republican senators already caving and flowing off the reservation on this. They’re already accepting it for a host of other… Look, this is my point. See, here, this guy, Ray, from Bath, Michigan, is a decent guy; it’s perfectly reasonable to say, “High school? Are you kidding me?” You know what happens when hormones are flowing in high school and young people are just discovering things and messing around, playing around and so forth?The bar has gotta be higher than that. There’s not a person among us who was clean and pure as the wind-driven snow in high school or any other time in our lives, is his point. But, you see, that’s all mitigated by the fact that the left, the Democrat Party has an army to carry forth and conduct their war, and that’s the media. They’ve got weapons upon weapons. The media fires them constantly day in and day out.And in the process, a circumstance has been created, a narrative has been created, that men have gotten away with being brutes and predators, mistreating women for centuries. And it’s about time it came to a stop. And wherever the left says they find it, they’re gonna stamp it out. There’s no statute of limitations. If somebody claimed that Kavanaugh did whatever he did in kindergarten, the Democrats would be doing the same thing with it today as they’re doing with this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, folks, I should share something with you that I heard this morning from a secret source, and it is… Just take this for what it’s worth. It’s that the mind-set today at the U.S. Senate is that this is just a predictable and expected little speed bump and that Kavanaugh’s gonna end up being confirmed and that everybody knows it. He’s just gonna have to go through some motions here while the Democrats… This is a Republican source. Actually, I’ve heard it from two different places.There’s also a leftist commentator who shared with me that while everybody’s making a big deal about this that the quiet money on Capitol Hill that this really isn’t gonna change anything. It’s just the last gasp. Just sharing that with you. You know, Grassley was ready to go and schedule it. Grassley’s initial reaction to this kind of indicates that that mind-set really is the case. Grassley’s original mind-set, original reaction to this was, “Well, if we’re gonna… Last minute stuff like this? We can’t allow this to derail the scheduling and the normal functioning of the Senate.“Last-minute stuff like this, unconfirmed, untested?” That was his initial reaction. Now he’s saying, “Well, uh, if she wants to testify, she will of course be allowed to testify according to several precedents and Senate rules and decorum and so forth. So I think it’s probably true that even now the general mind-set is that this is not gonna derail Kavanaugh. But I think that’s subject to change hour by hour. You might also say, “That’s… (laughing) These people are pretty naive if they think that,” and that could be true, too, but I wanted to pass it on to you.What else? Well, let me get back to the phones. I wanted to make this point anyway and it’s come up right on schedule. It’s Frank in Atlanta. Welcome, sir. You’re next on the EIB Network. Hi.CALLER: An honor to speak to you, Rush, after decades of listening to you. I’ll get to my point. I read an article today on TheFederalistPapers.org and they say that they’re saying that Kavanaugh’s mother, who’s a judge, was the judge involved in foreclosing on the parents’ home of this lady that’s the accuser in Montgomery County, Maryland. I’m curious if you heard that. They’re showing pictures of the docket and —RUSH: Oh, yeah. I’ve got all that, and I’ve seen it two different places. If you know, there’s a reporter and columnist for Townhall.com named Kurt Schlichter. Anyway, he’s looked into it. He confirms that it’s every bit true. Here are the details of this. Christine Ford, Christine Blasey Ford, her “parents were defendants in a case that was presided over by Brett Kavanaugh’s mother” who was the judge.“Christine Ford’s parents Paula K. Blasey and Ralph G. Blasey were the defendants in a foreclosure case in Maryland in 1996. … [T]he Judge was … [n]one other than Brett Kavanaugh’s mother, Martha G. Kavanaugh. … It appears there was an ongoing judgement starting at least in 1990…. [seven court] cases culminating in a foreclosure case in 1996, for which Martha Kavanaugh was the judge.“There was also a 1982 contract case but [this source] can’t determine the details there. … Her father [Ralph G. Blasey] appears to have been an attorney … tons of cases referencing that. His relationship professionally with Kavanaugh should be looked I as well.” There are screenshots of the court documents here. So what do we have here? The accuser is by her own admission… I mean, by her own bio, and she has spent the weekend scrubbing her social media sites. She tried to erase that she is an anti-Trumpist activist.She tried to delete and erase that she’s a left-wing activist. She tried to get… She wants to be seen as a college professorette who was traumatized by your average, run-of-the-mill white guy brute back in high school. And it turns out that this average, run-of-the-mill white guy brute now is nominated to be on the Supreme Court, and she’s outraged. So she doesn’t know what to do. Come forth or not? She sent Senator Feinstein a letter but didn’t know whether to go public with it or not., “But, gee, this is so unfair.“This guy brutes me and now he’s gonna be the Supreme Court!” She doesn’t want anybody to know that she wore one of those vagina hats at an anti-Trump March in January of 2017. She doesn’t want anybody to know that she was an activist signing an ACLU letter opposing Trump’s attempts to shore up the southern border. She doesn’t want anybody to know of her left-wing activism. But we do. She’s a far-left, social justice warrior professor, and she has a grudge. It doesn’t mean she’s a liar. But she has a grudge.Now, you combine who this woman is with the Drive-By Media and Dianne Feinstein’s months-long holding of all these ancient allegations for political advantage, and it is pretty clear that we have an orchestrated Democrat smear right out of the Anita Hill, Clarence Thomas playbook. They have no proof. They don’t have a pattern, by the way. This is the only allegation of its kind about Brett Kavanaugh. They don’t have anything. Every woman that’s ever worked with Kavanaugh has sung his praises.When this woman made known her allegations when her identity was forthcoming, women to the tune of 65 of them signed a letter in refutation what this woman was saying, that this is not Brett Kavanaugh. He’s not capable of this, he didn’t do this, he doesn’t think of women this way, doesn’t treat women this way. There is no pattern. With Bill Clinton? Whew! We had a pattern, and they tried to sweep it under the rug. With Harvey Weinstein, we had a pattern. With Les Moonves, we have a pattern.With all Democrats who have benefit the dust, we have a pattern. We don’t even have a pattern with Kavanaugh. We have a one-time allegation from 35 years ago from high school. What the Democrats have is something, again, absent any evidence. We don’t have any evidence. We’ve got her word versus his. We don’t have a shred of evidence. In fact, we’ve got a third person in the room, Mark Judge, friend of Kavanaugh says it didn’t happen. He’s befuddled by it. He doesn’t remember any of this.Kavanaugh says (paraphrased), “I never heard of this woman until today. I don’t know who this woman is. I’ve never met this woman. I don’t know where this thing happened.” The woman can’t pinpoint the exact year it happened, by the way — and from what I’m told, she’s not sure where it happened. Let me find that email. I got an email from somebody who wanted to weigh in on this. I may have to find it after the break. But it’s a woman who had this happen to her, and she remembers everything about it.And she doesn’t believe somebody who really felt like they been raped and abused in this way would forget so many assailant details. Anyway… So we don’t have any evidence. We don’t have any pattern. We have the old Democrat Party standby, “the seriousness of the charge,” which mandates in their world an investigation. It’s the same thing. If Republicans cave to this depravity, they’re guaranteed to get more of it in the future. They will be enabling sick, depraved, indecent, leftist zealots. It’s time to stand up to this.The Republicans stood up to it with Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill, and it was none other than the late Arlen Specter shocking everybody. It was Arlen Specter who blew up the entire Democrat case. He ended up becoming a Democrat later in his life. I don’t think he ever lived it down. But at that moment in time, he was awesome in defense of Justice Thomas. And in defense of the Senate for what was being done to it by this late-breaking thing with Anita Hill, nobody ever heard of in this light, in these kind of allegations, same thing here. Now we find out that Kavanaugh’s mother was the foreclosure judge on property owned by Christine Blasey Ford’s parents.So there couldn’t be any kind of a grudge there, right?  "

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/14/caller-wants-republicans-to-go-on-offense/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 14, 2018RUSH: Nick in Greensboro, North Carolina. I’m glad you took the time to call, sir. Hello.CALLER: Hey, Rush.RUSH: Hey!CALLER: Great to speak with you. Thanks for taking my call, and thanks to President Trump for listening ’cause I know he listens to you every day. So I got a blue wave analogy I wanted to get you to comment on, and I think it’s relevant. In the Super Bowl this year, anybody that watched it, will remember there was a fourth down trick play where Nick Foles caught a touchdown, but I don’t think that was the fourth down play that won the game.There was a fourth and one late in the game about 5:44 to go and the Eagles were down one, and Peterson called a quick play. They completed a two-yard pass to Zach Ertz, and that was on the go-ahead scoring drive. And my point is, they didn’t punt the ball even though conventional wisdom and establishment type coach would say punt. They kept the offense on the field in the waning time ’cause they knew the other team had Brady. And in my opinion, and what I wanted you to comment on, is I think the Democrats have their own Tom Brady, and that’s the media.But the Republicans still have the ball, and it’s fourth and two months to go; they got the House, the Senate, the presidency. So if they want to prevent a blue wave, don’t punt it to Tom Brady and the media. Go on offense, bring back Obamacare appeal, border wall spending, tax cuts permanent, confirm Kavanaugh, win on your own terms. I think if they do that, they don’t have anything to worry about. But I wanted to hear your comments on it.RUSH: I’m searching for something because you have just inspired a memory of something I have here in the Stack, and I know what it is even if I don’t find it, but I want to try to find it to be able to share it with you almost on a verbatim basis. And it’s gonna be in this other Stack and it’s about the Puerto Rican hurricane. Now, hang on Nick, don’t hang up. I want to be back to you here in just a second.He’s right about one thing in the Super Bowl. He was talking really fast there, but the Eagles did have a fourth and one and every rule in the book says punt, but it was late in the game, there’s no way they wanted to give the ball back to the Patriots. They wanted to keep it.They were definitely on offense. They wanted to convert a fourth down to first down and just keep ramming the ball down the throat of the Patriots and basically get a touchdown, which they did. It was a gutsy call, and it did precede the trick play, was which was the Philly Philly Special, which was the rollout pass to the quarterback.But that wasn’t the big play. The big play of the Super Bowl was the way the Eagles executed that touchdown pass to their tight end, Ertz. There might have been some controversy over whether or not it was a catch. But that play is a play the Eagles had been running a certain way all season. They chose to run that play out of a different formation with motion for the first time all season, the Patriots had never seen it on tape.And the Patriots cornerbacks are running into each other trying to defend that play. That was the play of the Super Bowl. But it wouldn’t have been made possible without the Philly Philly Special and the guy Foles that he’s talking about here.But the lesson is offense, stay on offense, don’t punt the ball back, don’t trust the defense. Here we go. You say the Republicans need to go on offense, Nick. I want to ask you what this is. I’m holding here in my formerly nicotine-stained fingers a story from Reuters. Now, you’ve heard that Trump claims there are not 3,000 deaths in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, right?CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: Okay. You’ve heard that Trump’s tweet says it’s made up by the Democrats to make him look bad. You know the media is having a conniption fit over this because they claim that the estimate of deaths from George Washington University cannot be disputed. Trump is saying, “Show me the bodies. There aren’t 3,000 people that have died.”“House Speaker Ryan Does Not Dispute Puerto Rico Death Toll — U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday he had ‘no reason’ to dispute Puerto Rico’s official death toll of 3,000 from last year’s Hurricane Maria…”Well, you want the Republicans to stay on offense, and here’s the Speaker of the House siding against Trump and with the media on a very important story about Trump believability and credibility. Then Jeb Bush has weighed in on Trump’s Puerto Rico tweets, calling them “incredibly disheartening.” “Jeb Bush criticized Trump’s controversial tweets about the death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.“Bush tweeted Thursday, ‘Incredibly disheartening comments from our president.'” Meanwhile, folks, George Washington University hasn’t counted any 3,000 dead bodies. Nobody’s been to the morgue. Nobody’s been to the funeral homes. These are estimates. These are guesstimates based on computer models comparing previous storms. Trump said when he left Puerto Rico the guys that run the country said maximum 16 people had died. Shortly after, the count becomes 3,000, 2,975, something like that. So what’s your reaction to that, Nick? You want ’em to go on offense, but it seems like the Republican establishment doesn’t want to help Trump out in this particular fight.CALLER: Well, I appreciate that, and my thought when you were speaking through that was Paul Ryan was on the same ticket as Mitt Romney, who didn’t go on offense and lost, and Jeb spent $130 million for an exclamation point. So —RUSH: No, he spent $100 million for three delegates. They looked like an exclamation point, but I can see why you’d think that. Yeah.CALLER: But he was on defense the whole time, and he got three delegates. Trump got over 300 Electoral College votes, and so that’s my point. Trump went on offense, and he won. Trump’s offense is what’s gonna get voters to turn out. So if the Republicans sit back and do nothing, then I just really think —RUSH: Do you think they want to hold the House?CALLER: (chuckles) I think, uh… I think that they do. I think that their mind-set on how to do… I don’t think they want to fight. I think they want to hold the House by not fighting, and that’s not true of all of them. President Trump’s the exception to what I was talking about, but in Congress, like, I think they want to, but if they have to go fight and put up with the media? I don’t think many people can stomach in the House what Trump has to put up with every single day.RUSH: There’s no… It’s not just the House. There’s nobody in the country who could put up with it. Nobody.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, folks, this blue wave, red wave is all moot anyway. CNN called the election yesterday. Some of you may not have been with us, but it was breaking news. CNN announced that the Democrats were gonna win the House because of a poll they’ve got. They have a generic poll out that shows the Democrats lead by 10. It’s a poll of likely voters. CNN pointed out the Republicans do their best in likely voter polls, and they’re down 10; so effectively the November elections are over. CNN has called it.The Democrats will win. We did that. (interruption) You were traveling back. You didn’t hear this yesterday. We broke into regular scheduled programming two or three times to announce this yesterday. CNN has called the November elections. The Democrats have won, based on polling data. They’re not even waiting for the exit polls. (laughing) They’re just using pre-election polls?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Mr. Snerdley was not here yesterday, and I just… He was staring at me with disbelief when I mentioned that we had to interrupt the program four different times yesterday with breaking news that CNN has already called the November elections for the Democrats. Here is how it happened yesterday…KING: A brand-new poll out today, as we approach 50 days to the midterm elections, to show it is now increasingly likely the Democrats will take control of the House. What are the numbers to back that up? This. The first time we’re using likely voters in our CNN polling. A 10-point advantage for the Democrats when voters are asked which party do you want to run the Congress? Which party will you vote for come November? 52 to 42, the Democrats with a 10-point edge among likely voters. Likely voters tend to move Republicans’ way. Not in this poll. A 10-point edge for the Democrats here. If this is the case on Election Day, the math tells you Democrats will take back the House.RUSH: There it is, and they ran with it all day yesterday that the Democrats win. It’s effectively over because of their poll. I did not take the time to refute the poll. A generic poll is rendered meaningless when you start adding names to it. When there are individual races, then people’s opinions change dramatically. By the way, how hard would it be for an outfit like CNN to find a sample of 52% Democrats and 42% Republicans? But, anyway, this is a sign of the cocksure arrogance and the overconfidence — and maybe even a little bit of the hope — that they have invested. "

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/10/mrs-clintom-praises-incivility-proving-what-ive-said-about-democrats/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 10, 2018RUSH: You know what? Hillary Clinton went out the other day in an interview with Christiane Amanpour and pretty much admitted everything I have been trying to warn people of about the American left and the Democrat Party! She went out and in her best Maxine Waters impersonation. She was encouraging people to be uncivil, and she was saying that it was justified being uncivil, given the opposition, the Republicans.And, if they win the House, then they can go back to being civil. If they win the Senate, then they can return to civility. I mean, they’re making the case, they’re proving the point, and there isn’t… I don’t see in all of this… In all of this crazy, deranged, unhinged behavior of left-wing activists, I haven’t heard one elected Democrat denounce it. I haven’t heard one elected Democrat attempt to distance himself or herself or the party from it.I haven’t heard one elected Democrat suggest to these deranged protesters to dial it back. I haven’t heard one. They are all encouraging it. My point is: This is who they all are — and with Hillary Clinton now advocating this incivility. What did I tell you yesterday? We’re not in a battle of ideas anymore. We’re not in an argument over ideas. They don’t… They’re not even looking at any of this as about ideas.They see America today as flawed and illegitimate and, therefore, in need of a new set of defining values that will serve to unify the people who want to be part of America. Not anything to do with our founding. Not the Constitution. Not the Declaration. That’s out the window ’cause all that’s tainted. All of that was written by a bunch of privileged white guys who were setting up a system for themselves and their families and their descendants.And they didn’t care about minorities. And they didn’t care about transgenders. Where did I see…? Some state. I’ve got it in the Stack. I’ll have to find it. Some state, on birth certificates, is now going to offer a third option, a third gender option on the birth certificate. They’re crazy! They’re literally nuts! They are at war with science! They’re at war with biology! They’re at war with physics! And they are at war with common sense. Hillary Clinton is not helping them with any of this.It’s okay to be uncivil.It’s okay to claw at the doors of the Supreme Court and try to get in to stop the swearing-in ceremony of Brett Kavanaugh.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I mentioned this at the beginning of the program. Hillary Rodham Clinton did a TV interview with her bud, Christiane Amanpour, on CNN yesterday, and Hillary Clinton said that this is a time for incivility.This is a time for people to be mean and rude and violent against Republicans! This is a time for it! And the time for this incivility to end will be when the Democrats take back the House or the Senate. Hillary Clinton discussed President Trump, the Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh, and civility in politics with Christiane Amanpour on CNN. Amanpour said, “Last night…” This happened yesterday.“President Trump had a sort of ceremony for now Justice Kavanaugh at the White House., and apologized on behalf the American people for the immense amount of pain and harm that he said that the judge had been put through by this system. What do you make of that and what message, including the president’s mocking of Christine Blasey Ford for her allegations, what message does that send to women? And remember, went for President Trump in 2016.”Hillary said, “White women.”Amanpour: (paraphrased) “Yes, that’s right. White women! I forgot. White women. We don’t like white women, right, Hillary?”(Hillary impression) “That’s right; we don’t, even though I am one.“White women. All women went for me. White women went for Trump. And look, White women have been voting against Democratic presidential candidates for decades now. The White vote has only then won twice in the last 60 years. My husband being one of the two. Lyndon Johnson being the other. So, it’s not a surprise. It’s a disappointment but it’s not a surprise.” (translated) It’s a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me, but it is what it is.And therein Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved into a truth. Except for the very exceptional election year of 1964, which was following the JFK assassination, the Democrats have not gotten more than 50% of the white vote in a presidential election since 1932. Now, when you look at it that way, you can understand why in Democrat Party circles there’s hatred for “white people.” White people, white women, have been rejecting them. White, married suburban women have been rejecting them.This is why the feminazi movement sprang up. This is why the left has started concocting all different categories for nonwhite suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrat constituents. And, by the way, this is, again, why in 1965 Ted Kennedy and the Democrats reopened the floodgates to immigration. I need to remind everybody again from about 1921 to 1923 through 1965 we shut down immigration. Not to zero. But we put very strict limits on it.The reason was to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that had come into the country the late 1800s through the 19, early twenties. Assimilation was key to American immigration policy. Arriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens, by the way. And there were things they had to do to become citizens. They had to learn the language, and they had to learn the history of America, they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test.And they had to swear and pledge their loyalty and devotion to the United States. And they were eager to do it. And they were happy to do it. Now, they maintained their ethnicity, the Irish, the Italians, you name it. But they wanted to become Americans. And they did. And it took a number of years to assimilate them all. Well, 1965 is when Ted Kennedy led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates, which then, of course, led to…Once that happened, illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way. And that wave of immigrants starting in 1965 came from Third World socialist countries. The Democrats realized they could only win the White House if they changed the population of America. They were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing white women. And Mrs. Clinton just admitted it here to Christiane Amanpour of CNN.It never occurred to them to change their policies. What they had to do in order to attract white voters, what they had to do was change America. So back to Hillary. She said, “What was done last night in the White House,” meaning Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh. “What was done last night in the White House,” she said, “was a political rally. It further undermined the image and integrity of the court. And that troubles me greatly.”“[I]t saddens me, because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government.” BS! The judicial system has been viewed by you as election insurance. The judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs. Clinton, the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge. You have looked at the court as a place you can stock like-minded leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America.That’s why they want the courts. If you want to really get frustrated, and you’ve heard me say this, and you probably heard a lot of other people, but stop and think about this. Outside of Obamacare, practically every liberal mistake, every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed. Liberalism and the Democrat Party’s ideas have never been mass popular.The only way that we have bastardized pop culture laws and reality today is because Democrat activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions. Roe v. Wade is the most sterling example of this. But there are countless others. The simple fact of the matter is, the Democrat Party has never been capable of winning legislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people, when they know what’s at stake, don’t want them.That’s the value of judges, that’s the value of courts to the Democrats, when Mrs. Clinton says that what happened in the White House the other night “saddens” her “because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government.” BS. Not by you. In fact, to Hillary Clinton and people like her, the Constitution’s an obstacle as well! It’s certainly not something to revere.Christiane Amanpour: “[D]o you see any way…? Even a conservative who I was speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America is try to get back to some civility and to try to make it that even if we have political disagreements, we’re not going to war with each other; we’re not trying to destroy each other.” Hillary Clinton: “Well, certainly I would love to see us return to civility,”Christiane Amanpour: “Listening to one another, working out our differences. That is not the Republican Party that exists today, and that is certainly not the administration that we have in power right now. When the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland,” and we are we go off to the races again mischaracterizing that. Blue in the face. That’s a Joe Biden rule! The Democrats invented that rule that presidents don’t get to name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened in the last year of their term.That’s a Democrat-instituted rule, and she knows it. But the Republicans didn’t destroy Merrick Garland. The Democrats didn’t have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy him, as they did Kavanaugh. Anyway, the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it’s a time for incivility. It is a time for this kind of extremism because that’s what we’re up against. Steve Scalise, who was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice, cannot believe it.Bill Cassidy, senator from Louisiana, responded to Hillary: “At a time when Republicans are being shot, stabbed, doxxed, beaten, mailed powder, run out of restaurants, and sent death threats, Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more uncivil. What an irresponsible statement. Every Democrat should denounce.” They’re not gonna denounce her. They privately, publicly encourage her. They applaud it. They support it. That is who they are.This is the party, by the way, that has been railing against all this incivility for I don’t know how long. This is why… I look at average American voters paying attention to this, and I don’t understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democrat Party is doing, how they’re doing it. I know it happens, but it’s a mystery to me. My hope is, my faith is that this incivility, this insanity, this unhinged Democrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats. That the Kavanaugh effect, pro-Republican…I know that’s real. The polling data indicates that that’s real if you want to believe polling data. But we’re never gonna get a poll of people who disapprove of Democrat Party tactics and techniques. That poll is never gonna be run. And if they did, if somebody on the left did run that poll and the results came back that it was quite harmful to the Democrats, they wouldn’t run the results.They would get hold of Democrat leaders, the media would, say, “Look. This is not working, you guys. You better get hold of your people and dial ’em back.” The problem is the Democrats can’t dial these people back. The Democrats don’t control these left-wing radicals. That’s why you don’t see any public statements of disapproval.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I mentioned this at the beginning of the program. Hillary Rodham Clinton did a TV interview with her bud, Christiane Amanpour, on CNN yesterday, and Hillary Clinton said that this is a time for incivility.This is a time for people to be mean and rude and violent against Republicans!

Steve Scalise, who was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice, cannot believe it.Bill Cassidy, senator from Louisiana, responded to Hillary: “At a time when Republicans are being shot, stabbed, doxxed, beaten, mailed powder, run out of restaurants, and sent death threats, Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more uncivil. What an irresponsible statement. Every Democrat should denounce.” They’re not gonna denounce her. They privately, publicly encourage her. They applaud it. They support it. That is who they are.This is the party, by the way, that has been railing against all this incivility for I don’t know how long. This is why… I look at average American voters paying attention to this, and I don’t understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democrat Party is doing, how they’re doing it. I know it happens, but it’s a mystery to me. My hope is, my faith is that this incivility, this insanity, this unhinged Democrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats. That the Kavanaugh effect, pro-Republican…I know that’s real. The polling data indicates that that’s real if you want to believe polling data. But we’re never gonna get a poll of people who disapprove of Democrat Party tactics and techniques. That poll is never gonna be run. And if they did, if somebody on the left did run that poll and the results came back that it was quite harmful to the Democrats, they wouldn’t run the results.They would get hold of Democrat leaders, the media would, say, “Look. This is not working, you guys. You better get hold of your people and dial ’em back.” The problem is the Democrats can’t dial these people back. The Democrats don’t control these left-wing radicals. That’s why you don’t see any public statements of disapproval.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Yeah. Don’t think for a minute that elected Democrats disapprove of these radicals. They think that’s their base. They know that’s their base. They don’t dare disapprove. They don’t dare call these people out. They’re not gonna come down against them at all. That’s why Hillary’s out there encouraging more of this. That’s what they think! Look, the Democrat Party thinks — and the media believe — that these protesters clawing the door at the Supreme Court and all of this genuinely insane, unhinged behavior…They think, folks, that that’s pretty much 50% of the country. Because that’s how they feel. They’re mad. They hate Trump. They can’t stand any of this. They can’t stand it that Trump won. They can’t stand that they can’t get rid of him. They can’t stand that Trump is succeeding; they can’t stand these Trump rallies. They’re convinced that half the country hates Trump as they do. So when they see these deranged, hinged people with severe mental disorders running around doing what they’re doing, the Democrats think that’s who they’re playing to and that that’s who they have to play to.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Dennis in Le Mars, Iowa. Great to have you, sir. How are you doing?CALLER: Doing well. Thank you. Longtime listener. First-time caller.RUSH: Thank you, sir.CALLER: Thank you. Say, I just wanted to comment on the Hillary thing. As I listened to it last night — and I can’t quote it exactly, but she said, “If you disagree or if the party is destroying the things you believe in and love then you should be uncivil.” Would that not apply to the Democratic Party as well, Republicans, conservatives, being uncivil to the likes of her?RUSH: Sure it would. Sure it would. If that’s the standard. If the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life, then you must be uncivil against the it. But (sigh) — and you know this — in the Hillary Clinton Democrat Party world, our world should be destroyed. That is justice. That is what’s called for: Conservatism, Republicans being destroyed. That is the new morality. And we have no business fighting back or resisting it. We deserve what we get.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here’s Ken in Oklahoma City. We head back to the phones. Great to have, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hey. It’s great to be on, Rush. Not only are you El Rushbo, but you are the lead voice of the mainstream media. You should have the best app in podcasts.RUSH: Should have the… What pod —CALLER: Best app in podcasts, yeah. (laughing) Hey, my point is today, with Hillary’s comments that basically liberals don’t need to be civil to conservatives anymore, it reminded me of a profound quote I came across years ago and maybe even you said it. But here’s the quote: “A society is either moving toward civility or barbarism. And I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society. And it’s apparent that the liberal left is embracing barbarism again.” Just wanted to get your thoughts.RUSH: So, but the question is, do I agree that our society is always trending toward barbarism… Barbarism and what?CALLER: A society —RUSH: Barbarism or civility. We’re trending one way. We’re not in the middle of the two. We’re either trending toward civility or barbarism.CALLER: In constant flux.RUSH: And the… Oh, it’s a constant flux. And so what, what is your question where Trump is in it?CALLER: Well, it seems as if the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working, you know, towards law and order or restoring it, and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism.RUSH: Right.CALLER: With all of their character assassination attempts on Trump and Kavanaugh, the Antifa violence, shootings —RUSH: Yeah, there’s no question about, it’s an active choice. I mean, Hillary Clinton’s endorsing it.CALLER: Yeah, absolutely. And it’s sad to see it, because this is not the Democrat Party of my mother and father. And I remember so well, you know, the conservatism here and Oklahoma where I live, in fact, in most of the states —RUSH: Well, let me ask you this. When was the Democrat Party the Democrat Party a good…? When was it when that was all good and fine and dandy? What were they then?REPORTER: I think it was before the 1940s and 50s —RUSH: No, no what were they? Not when. What were they? What were they like, when the Democrats were the Democrat Party of your dad or your grandpa, what were they? What were they doing?CALLER: Well, the Democrats at that time, their basic issue was labor laws. And when —RUSH: Yeah. For what purpose? My point is the Democrat Party hasn’t changed that much, is my point. The Democrat Party has always been rooted in the modern era, in our lifetimes, in this century and the previous century, the Democrat Party has been rooted in anti-capitalism, has been rooted in pro-socialism and Big Government. They’ve just now abandoned any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all-in on militant and violent socialism to achieve their means. My point, they’re not that different. They’re just masking less today.  "

You’re so right, so often, it’s scary, and you’ve convinced me that the left is right. Rush, I have to confess. My son, Eddie, came out of the womb peeing all over everybody, female doctor, nurses, even his own mother. Sure enough, my son appears to be growing up to be a white guy. See? What you say is true. The white patriarchal power structure at work.”I love these satirical reactions. That’s what the left is asking everybody to believe. Folks, I’m telling you, these kids that have now become adults, that maintain this adolescent degree of rage, psychological disorders and what have you, they have been taught this stuff, and they really have been taught that the founding of America was one of the greatest injustices in all of humanity. And anybody other than white men are victims. And if you are a white woman happily in a relationship with a white man, then you’re part of the sellout, you’re part of the problem, you’re letting everybody down.You are subordinating yourself to patriarchy for the benefits that you get. You get a relationship, you get an income, you get a nice house, you get a family, and so you are a sellout. And I’m not exaggerating! This is what they’re teaching! And this is what these young people believe! Go to the audio sound bites. We’ve talked about this woman before, Rebecca Traister. She was on C-SPAN2 on Saturday, Saturday night, a show called After Words. What is this… She was running for attorney general or is an attorney general, and she said something outrageously stupid that we highlighted here and I’ve forgotten what it is.But it’s in the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez vein. And it’s just asinine stupid. I wish I could remember it. It’s in our show archives. But this the first…I think maybe we’ve got a sound bite of her before, but this is an appearance about a book that she has written called, Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women’s Anger. And the host of this C-SPAN After Words show is Rutgers University women’s and gender studies professor Brittney Cooper.Question: “It feels devastating to me that if white woman cannot have a public life, private life, professional life or in protest then what are we to do?” Let me read that question again. “It feels devastating to me that if white woman cannot have a public life, private life, professional life or in protest then what are we to do?” And here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister…TRAISTER: Are we angry that it has to be white women before we take these stories seriously? Or, or, I think it’s “and,” do we all acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and if their power, their proximal power can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed than in fact is this strategically necessary? And this goes back to the question: “Do we need white women?” That’s an electoral question that every candidate needs ask.RUSH: “It’s an electoral question that every candidate needs to ask … ‘Do we need white women?’” Now, this wouldn’t be happening if it hadn’t been for the realization that a lot of white women supported Kavanaugh. And I don’t know if it was so much that white women supported Kavanaugh as that they were scared to death at what they saw being set up against men. They have sons. They have brothers.And anybody with half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind to see that the Democrat Party had aligned itself in such a way that men were automatically guilty simply because they exist! Simply because they are capable! In fact, let’s see. There’s actually a story with that exact point made here. And I think I moved it to the bottom of the Stack. But it is a woman making the point that Kavanaugh is as good as guilty because he could have done it!And he could have done it because he’s a man. He could have done it because he has male genitalia. That’s all this woman in this story requires to believe Blasey Ford, that Kavanaugh could have done it. Well, if you’re a woman with sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you’re watching this, you wouldn’t miss what is transpiring, that men are automatically guilty. All it takes is an allegation. The allegation doesn’t require any evidence.In fact, the fact that there’s no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened, because that’s what men do, because men can, and men can because they have the genitalia necessary to do it. Well, if you’re an average, ordinary, decent woman watching this stuff, how in the world do you want to sign on to that? Well, you don’t. And so now these leftist women are enraged when they have discovered that they failed to persuade a bunch of average, ordinary white women to join their cause, anti-Kavanaugh. So now these women are sellouts and their uteruses are sellouts and their wombs are sellouts and they’re selling out to the patriarchy.And, as such, they become worthless and even a liability to the point now that here we have a sound bite with two women experts in gender studies saying, do we need white women? It’s an electoral question every candidate needs to ask. Let me remind you, in November of 2011, the Obama presidential campaign, was written about by Thomas Edsall in the Washington Post, might have been the New York Times, announced that they were forgoing the “white working class” as a voting bloc and instead were going to put together a winning coalition of a sum total of every minority group they could find.They were gonna combine all these minority groups and make that the Democrat base because white working-class voters were becoming less and less dependable, because they weren’t buying Obama and Obamacare, and because of that, they were becoming racist. The traditional Democrat little guy voting bloc, they expressed no interest. This is simply an evolution of that! So while the white working class was told to go pound sand by the Obama campaign in 2011, now in 2018 do we need white women? It’s an electoral question that every candidate needs to asking S. Folks, don’t misunderstand what I’m doing here.I’m not doing this simply to express incredulity at this. I’m doing this under the auspices of how in the world can a majority or mainstream of Americans in any way support this party? I realize I’m setting myself up here for what may be a major shocking disappointment the day after the election in November. And I’m not making any predictions here. I’m genuinely curious. I just don’t see how the actions, the words, the policies, the attempts to inspire and persuade… I just don’t see how any decent, normal people fall for this. I realize the Democrats have educated a lot of people in the last two generations. I realize a lot of college educated people have come out of these institutions, and they have been corrupted and polluted with this crap.And since most people are not what they wish they were, most people are not as successful as they want to be, most people do think about what they don’t have rather than what they do. And if that’s who you are, if that’s the personality type, then it’s not very big step to start blaming somebody else for what you don’t have. Becomes very easy to blame some faceless patriarchy, some faceless white privilege power structure, some faceless bunch of meanies depriving you, denying you, discriminating against you.So all the left has to do is get a hold of people who have not amounted to what they want to amount to, don’t have what they had hoped to have, in any way, materially, professionally, you name it. In other words, it’s not hard to run into unhappy people. It’s not challenging to find a bunch of people that are beating themselves up. And all you have to do is convince those people that somebody else did it to ’em, the Republicans, the white privilege power structure did it to ’em. And there’s only one way to fix it, and that’s to wipe ’em out.I know they’ve educated a lot of people who believe this now.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/08/the-turning-point-was-trump-telling-the-truth-about-fords-story/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 8, 2018RUSH: Donald Trump — and, by the way, a lot of people think Susan Collins was the turning point. No. Susan Collins was not the turning point. Susan Collins’ speech didn’t change any votes, but she did something far more important. The votes were already cast by the time she gave her speech on Friday afternoon. She did something far more important than that, which we’ll discuss as the program unfolds.Now, what turned this was Trump. Trump in his rally where he was accused of “mocking” Dr. Ford. He didn’t mock Dr. Ford. He didn’t imitate her. He didn’t make fun of her. He simply repeated the truth of her testimony! She doesn’t know who, what, when, where, why, she doesn’t know how, she doesn’t know when, she didn’t know where it happened, what floor, second floor, what room, she didn’t know any of that. The reason that was important is because nobody that reads the Drive-By Media knew any of that.In the hearings, Christine Ford’s assertions were not challenged. So in the broad-based media coverage of the hearings, the fallacies and the unprovable allegations in her testimony were never brought up. So the average Joe Blow out there never knew that she couldn’t identify where with it happened, when it happened, how she got home, who took her home, what happened afterwards. She couldn’t even identify the year or the month.They didn’t know this. They didn’t know that everybody she placed in the room failed to corroborate what she said. The average Joe Blow reading the average Drive-By Media didn’t know that until Donald Trump pointed it out. That was the turning point, and that’s why the media turned on Trump for this for mocking her because Trump gave up the ghost. Trump spilled the beans on what they were trying to hide in the rest of the Drive-By Media. And it was a turning point for public opinion. Make no mistake about that.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Donald Trump was on with Judge Jeanine Saturday night after his rally, and she asked him why he did that — why did he call out the fallacy of her testimony — and this is what the president said…THE PRESIDENT: There were a lot of things happening that weren’t correct, they weren’t true, and there are a lot of things that were left unsaid. And I thought I had to even the playing field, ’cause it was very unfair to Judge — now I can, you know, very nicely say Justice — Kavanaugh. It was a very unfair situation. So I evened the playing field. Once I did that, it started to sail through. He was treated very, very unfairly.RUSH: This is exactly what any prosecutor would do and what fearless Republicans would have done during the hearings!“How’d you get home?”“I don’t remember.”“Well, how did you get to the house?”“I don’t remember.”“Well, where was the place that this happened to you?”“I don’t remember.”“How many years ago was it?”“I don’t know.”“What year did it happen?”“I don’t know.”“Well, what neighborhood was it in?”“Uh, I don’t know.”“Where’s the house?”“I don’t know.”“Upstairs, downstairs? Where was it?”“I don’t know. But I had one beer!”She remembered everything about that. She had one beer. All Trump did was tell the nation her answers to the seminal questions of the event. She couldn’t answer anything, and the four people she said were there all denied it. The mainstream media had reported none of that. Trump did it, and that was the turning point, folks. Do not doubt me.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/05/its-undeniable-the-left-targets-white-men/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 5, 2018RUSH: Over the course of many recent months, I have made the point that one of the objectives of the modern American left is to transform America away from its intentions and its designs as founded. And in many ways, this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration, although to do it in a stealth way. Obama couldn’t come out and say it beyond that his policies were “transformative.” He couldn’t define what that meant.There would have been a revolt — and he wouldn’t have been elected if he’d been honest about what transforming America meant. So what he claimed it meant was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this, transform America. But what they really want to do is transform America away from our unique founding, convert it to a socialist democracy.Some of the radicals even want to go further and have this country become totally communist. In fact, there’s a poll out here today. This is from The Daily Caller. The poll is BuzzFeed news: “31% of Millennials identify as Democratic socialists, according to a study” that has been taken. You know, you’d like to not believe this. But the facts on the ground, just what you see — even though it may be anecdotal evidence — indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this.“Millennial men were far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist than women. A total of 40% responded affirmatively to the question.” Now, how in the hell can that be? ‘Cause there’s one thing — something doesn’t just jibe with socialism. You know what it is? Self-reliance! Self-reliance, taking yourself seriously, standing up for yourself, believing in yourself, relying on yourself. Being a man just does not jibe with socialism.Socialism does not work well with self-reliant people. Socialism and communism attempt to erase self-reliant people. Self-reliant people — people that do not need, do not depend on anybody but themselves, their immediate circle — are huge threats to socialists and communists. So how in the hell has this happened? How is it 40% of Millennial men have become socialists, more than women? It ought to be the exact opposite.Well, hello, modern era feminism, which has had as one of its targets the demasculinization of men. And they’ve been very open and honest about that. They’ve even conjured up terms for it: “toxic masculinity,” “dangerous masculinity.” They are doing their best to erase natural male characteristics from as many young guys as they can, and since guys want to pal around with women within whatever women want is what men end up doing, on balance.I mean, you have individual exceptions, of course. You got Clint Eastwoods or you’ve got James Caans that tell everybody to go to hell when they’re told how to live and how to act. But, on balance, men do what women want ’em to do. If a big book is famous and hot and women dig it, men are gonna go say they’re reading it or try to become conversant in it. It’s just the nature of things. So they’re being highly, highly successful — and it’s targeting America and its founding.I’m not just targeting capitalism. They’re targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most in a representative republic. The de-emphasis of government, the getting government out of people’s lives. It’s just the exact opposite with communists and socialists. So I have an evidence piece here. Not just flapping my gums.There’s a New Yorker story by Michael Lista, a guy, published yesterday. “The Tears of Brett Kavanaugh” is its title. It is a horrible piece, and it does exactly that which I have been warning people. It goes all the way back to the founding of America to trash “white men.” Oh, that reminds me. Hang on here. You need to grab an audio sound bite here. It’s (muttering) 6 and 7. Pull quote: “Kavanaugh has no avenue of appeal, though, except his own hurt feelings. He is in touch with them, as he was taught to be.“And so he’s seemingly weaponized crying, the way a little boy does when he’s in trouble.” Another pull quote: “But Kavanaugh’s performance last Thursday was something entirely different, distinctly contemporary. It combined the postwar attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings, to the point that they may cry, with the intrinsic American ideal of white male privilege.“Because Kavanaugh is accused of sexual assault, and may be denied the career elevation that he has long plotted, he blubbered like a newborn.” He has “plotted” his career, you see? He hasn’t had a series of goals and achieved them. Oh, no! The guy is a dangerous schemer. He has “plotted” to get on the Supreme Court, where he can rule against minorities and women and Latinos and Hispanics and gays and lesbians and transgenders, don’t you know?This has been the lifelong “plotting” strategy of Brett Kavanaugh, and when there was the least bit resistance placed in his way, he was reduced to tears, started crying. And then this pull quote: “Kavanaugh’s “tears make a kind of sense. From a single phrase by Thomas Jefferson — that public life is about ‘Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness’ — the fulfillment of the white American man’s atomized desires assumed the force of a fiat, and became the ultimate purpose of this country’s society.“If a white man didn’t get what he wanted, it was nothing short of a constitutional crisis…” This is what this clown saw in the Kavanaugh hearings! But you’ll notice the references here. “From a single phrase by Thomas Jefferson — that public life is about ‘Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness’ — the fulfillment of the white American man’s … desires assumed the force of a fiat,” meaning an automatic, “and became the ultimate purpose of this country’s society.“If a white man didn’t get what he wanted, it was nothing short of a constitutional crisis…” Bingo! These people prove me right each and every time I go analyzing them. So the trouble with America is that it was established by white men for white men and the pursuit of happiness and life and liberty was only intended for white men — and if any white man was obstructed in the pursuit, then there was something wrong with America.Do not minimize this. I’m telling you, this belief is animating the last two generations, informing the last two generations of kids going to high school and college. This is the kind of drivel that they are being taught, that America is corrupt from its founding days, that it was founded for an exclusive group of people: White men. Nobody else need apply.And when they don’t get their way — in other words, when minorities start taking over. Latinos, lesbians, gays, transgenders, you name it. When those people start taking over, that’s justice. When white men have their lunch handed to ’em and have to listen to what their pursuit of happiness has meant for everybody else: Misery, death, destruction, discrimination. This is what this sick bunch of people believe!Go to the audio sound bites. More documentation. Last night on CNN Tonight with Don Lemon talking about the protests against the Kavanaugh nomination and your beloved host, me…LEMON: There’s a (pause) not-at-all subtle undercurrent to all of this. This is not just an attack on conservatives. It’s an attack on white men. Rush Limbaugh, come on down!RUSH ARCHIVE: These women are angry. Something has happened to them in their lives — and their rage and anger, they take it out now on the country or on all men or men in “the powerful majority,” which is white Christian men and so forth.LEMON: Hmph! He said it. So don’t get mad at me and say (high-pitched voice), “Ooh, Don Lemon, everything’s about race!” Rather than searching for the truth, the president and his party, they’re appealing to their base, people who feel — feel — victimized, who fear the world is passing them by. Feel. Fear. People who see all of this as a zero-sum game. If women or people of color or LGBT advance, it must be at someone else’s expense.RUSH: No, no, no, Don. That’s what you people are doing. I’m merely chronicling what’s happening out there. It is undeniable. I just shared with you one of countless examples I could cite. This guy Michael Lista in The New Yorker suggesting that Kavanaugh’s crying because he’s a white man targeted, singled out for advancement in America by other white men, and when it’s not going his way he breaks down and cries.This piece justifies the attack on white men! It says it’s about time. The whole country — the assault on the whole country is validated because it’s actually an assault on a white male majority which has caused tyranny and sadness and misery and death and destruction for everybody else! All I said was, “These women are angry.” The #MeToo movement.“These women are angry. Something has happened to them … their rage and anger, they take it out now on the country … ‘the powerful majority,’ which is white Christian men…” That’s the target. You can’t deny that white Christian men or just white men period are the target of modern feminism, of modern American liberalism and the American left. Somehow, Don Lemon converts this into a racial issue. It isn’t race.We’re talking about the structure of America as founded and what’s to become of it, and the justification the left sees for getting rid of it and transforming it! He wants everything to be about race. There was no racial component in my comment at all. I’m simply identifying the targets today of the American left. See how easy it is for me to make my case here? They help me. They make my case for me. All I have to do is read to you what they say or play audio of what they say.  "

Wage growth has hit a 17-month high. Job growth has hit a seven-month high. The stock market has hit another record high. One-hundred-and-two record highs during the Trump presidency. Service industry growth, Mr. Limbaugh, has hit another record high — and trade deals recently negotiated by Trump are helping everybody, particularly farmers.“My question, Mr. Limbaugh, is do people feel this and know why it’s happening? Does anybody know this is happening? The media isn’t talking about it. Trump is doing all of this. Does anybody know it?” Good question. Good. Question. The economy is perking along at a rate Obama never envisioned. In fact, Obama told everybody this couldn’t happen! The Democrats and Obama told everybody it couldn’t happen. In the politics of yesterday, this would be all Trump needed to survive and withstand anything.It’s why the media is not reporting it. CNBC has the details. “‘Rip-Roaring Hot’ Jobs Market Sees Private Payrolls Surge by 230,000, Highest Since February.” It’s “well ahead of expectations.” The experts predicted 185,000. “Moody’s economist Mark Zandi said the current pace suggests an unemployment rate of close to 3% in a year.” So all the economic news is out of this world, and it’s because of the Trump presidency! It’s because of the Trump agenda.The Democrats have told everybody this could not happen. In the midst of all of this, there are two new independent generic ballot polls out. The big one is Quinnipiac. “Quinnipiac University poll shows the Democrat generic ballot lead has been cut in half in months. It’s gone from 12% to 7%,” basically 50%.The generic ballot lead, the Democrats are losing it. Even Frank Luntz is tweeting this out. Quinnipiac showing the Democrat generic ballot lead has been cut in half in a month. You know why? You know why? Kavanaugh. The experts are saying it’s Kavanaugh. It’s a backlash to Kavanaugh, and there’s another story here about suburban women turning to Trump in droves because of Kavanaugh. Suburban women used to be a deadlock of the Democrat Party, college-educated suburban women.  "

Interestingly, none of the cable channels covered it wall-to-wall as they usually do, but that’s not a big deal. I had people sending me notes. “Fox isn’t even covering it, Rush! What’s up?” Doesn’t matter. These are local events, folks. They’re local events. They are intended… These Trump rallies are intended to influence local voting, local interest, local participation.“Campaign Estimates 20,000 Trump Supporters at Massive Overflow Rally in Tennessee — Trump’s new campaign manager Brad Parscale estimated that there were 20,000 people at the rally — 7,000 inside the arena, 2,000 in the overflow room, and thousands outside. ‘Big numbers!’ he exclaimed on Twitter. Rep. Phil Roe of Tennessee said 92,000 had requested tickets to the event. Some supporters arrived Sunday night to stake their position in the line.”&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;<U+FEFF>&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
That’s like a new iPhone release!“The rally was held at the Freedom Hall Civic Center, with large screens set up by the campaign for the overflow crowd. ‘Watching outside on the big screen with all these fine folks is still better than watching at home!!!’ wrote one Trump supporter…” Another tweeter wrote, “‘Trying to estimate precise crowd size was impossible on the ground, as the line snaked various ways up and down the hill, around the parking lots, etc. But I’d still place it as enough to fill at least one and probably two more Freedom Halls.'”So 92,000 tickets requested, 20,000 people in attendance in little Johnson City, Tennessee. What’s going on here? How does that translate to any kind of a blue wave? Now, I realize it’s Tennessee, maybe Trump country and so forth. But it does not suggest that there’s any lack of enthusiasm on the Republican side. Now, let’s go to the audio sound bites, and we’re gonna start with audio sound bite No. 1 here. We have CNN sounding the alarm.House races are tightening! CNN says there could be a GOP wave in the Senate and that Kavanaugh is energizing Republicans. The show is CNN’s Newsroom. The co-host, Jim Sciutto, was asking their senior politics writer, Harry Enten, about CNN polls on various Senate races that are within or close to the margin of error. The question: “Polls are tightening out there…” No, the question was (impression), “Oh, my God! Oh, no. Oh-ho, no, Harry! The polls are tightening? (hyperventilating) Oh, my God. No! What does that tell you? (sputtering) What — what — what’s going on, Harry?”ENTEN: There are so many races that are within the margin of error.SCIUTTO: Mmmph!ENTEN: Missouri, Nevada, Tennessee, Florida. The list go on his and on and on. We have all of these close races which means we have a best estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November, but it really could be a Democratic wave but or a Republican waves if the polls are off in one direction or —SCIUTTO: (shocked) Republican wave in the Senate — in the House? (sputtering)ENTEN: In the Senate. Not in the House.RUSH: Republican wave in the Senate? Oh, no! That means no impeachment of Trump. Well, that means an impeachment if the Democrats get the House. Don’t think so, but if they do, it would die in the Senate unless there’s a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there ’cause they would never vote to convict if the Republicans hold the Senate or even swell the ranks. So the paniced host, Jim Sciutto, couldn’t believe what he heard there, “Red wave in the Senate?” He says, “There was discussion of a blue wave, big generic ballot advantage for Democrats. Do you notice a tightening there as we get closer to the election?”ENTEN: I will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which —SCIUTTO: Oh!ENTEN: — was actually good news for Republicans.RUSH: Oh, no!ENTEN: You know, there’s a lot of talk, “Oh, with Brett Kavanaugh and this whole confirmation mess that, in fact, that might hurt Republicans.” But it doesn’t actually seem to be so far. We’re actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we’re seeing tightening in the House races.RUSH: I’m gonna give you a little side observation about this. But what did I tell you? These generic ballots way back last December — that’s when they first started harping on this. Back then, you know, nine months ago, the Democrats had a 12-point advantage, and that’s when all the talk of a blue wave began. And that’s when all the talk of the Democrats winning back Congress began. And it went all through the year. The Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was 12, five, seven; then the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them.The Democrats once again broke away. All during it, I, your host — I have been doing it in a long time — said, “It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t mean anything.” Let me remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England Patriots, one Bill Belichick. Prior to one of the Super Bowls the Patriots were in… They might do it frequently. I know of one time, he gathered the players for a team meeting and said, “We’re gonna have a little fun. We’re gonna watch a horse race.”He had videotape of a horse race that nobody had seen. It was not a big race. He was gonna allow the players to make friendly bets and wagers on who was gonna win. So the players made their bets, and Belichick starts the tape of the race and stops it at the first turn. He said, “Okay, lay your bets. Tell me who’s gonna win.” Players go nuts making their choices. Tape resumes; Belichick stops it at the halfway point. “Anybody want to change their bet? Anybody want to double down?”Players go into gear making their bets. At the final turn, Belichick stops the tape of the horse race again, asks the players if they want to make additional bets or get out of ones they’ve made. Players do what they do; Belichick resumes tape to the finish line. He makes the point, “It didn’t matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape. There’s no way anybody could have known — at the first turn, at the halfway point, or at the final turn — who was gonna win. Yet look what you were doing. You were making bets. You were guessing. Some of you probably were certain.“The bottom line is: Finish. You never know before it’s over who’s going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you.” It was a motivation technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter, halftime, third quarter? Finish. Do your job. Same thing here. Polls in January in front of a November election doesn’t mean anything. Polls in June/July don’t mean anything. They’re interesting for the media which is trying to shape public with these polls, but the polls do not give any indication of the final outcome.A poll in July or August would not have contained any of the Kavanaugh news; so how relevant could it have been? Answer: None. Zilch, zero, nada. So now here we are on October 2nd, and CNN is panicking. Races are tightening in the House. This wasn’t supposed to happen! Why, they had all their preelection polls. They had the generic ballot. They’ve had this in the can. This has been in the bank since last December. In their minds, it’s been over. It’s just a matter of letting the calendar play out.Now all of a sudden, House races are tightening, and there could be a red wave in the Senate. Red wave in the Senate! Republicans could come out of nowhere at the final turn and take over. Well, we don’t know if the Republicans were ever really far behind. We don’t know anything, because there wasn’t a vote back in December or January or July or August! We don’t know anything! And we don’t know anything now. And we won’t know anything until the day after Election Day or maybe later that night. Now, one other brief observation here.Massive crowd for Trump rally in TN. CNN panics: Polls tightening, GOP wave in Senate? Races fighting in House? Polls don’t matter right before the election. Kavanaugh smear falling apart, backfiring on Democrats. NYT prints story on Kavanaugh throwing ice at a bar in the 80s, never reported on Clinton telling Juanita Broaddrick to “put ice on that” after alleged rape. Rush encourages McConnell to take charge and he does, says vote by end of week. DiFI: Friday too soon to vote.OUT: been through inside out.Once again, do you notice Mr. Enten snuck it in there? “You know, there’s a lot of talk, ‘Oh, with Brett Kavanaugh and this whole confirmation mess that in fact that might hurt Republicans.'” It doesn’t seem to be so far. Ladies and gentlemen, I am the reason he’s saying this and everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if the Republicans don’t confirm Kavanaugh that the Democrats are gonna win everything. That prediction of mine went viral. The Drive-Bys loved it!They love it when the leader of the GOP (in their minds, me) starts ripping the Republicans. When I start predicting them to lose, that’s when I become totally credible. That’s when they run sound bites of me predicting it all over the world. You notice how easy it would be to trick them? They run with that and they run with it. Now all of a sudden, it’s just the exact opposite! It’s just the exact opposite. (impression) “Why, all of this attention on Kavanaugh and what the Republicans are doing is actually gonna help ’em? How can that be? Limbaugh just said they were gonna lose!”They are totally, totally confused. As I said yesterday, “What is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win?” You know, people say, “Well, let Kavanaugh go down. That will really fire ’em up! That’ll fire everybody up.” No. The way you get on the bandwagon, the way you get people on the bandwagon, the way you get people wanting to be on your team is win, including winning the Kavanaugh nomination.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/01/trump-teaches-the-world-a-lesson-on-trade/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 1, 2018RUSH: The Drive-By Media, the legacy media, the mainstream media, the Democrat Party all said that it was not possible for economic growth to ever be above the best it was under Obama, which was 1.8 to 2%. Obama had one outlier quarter a little over three, but those were extraneous circumstances there. Obama’s GDP average 1.8 to 2% on the upside, and everybody said, “It can’t possibly get any better than that, and it’s foolish to think so. It’s a new day in America, and those days of rabid capitalistic economic growth are over.”Just like Obama and the media said the jobs that we’ve lost, manufacturing, otherwise, would never, ever, be coming back. Obama goes out to Elkhart, Indiana, telling people in the campaign year of 2016 not to think of their jobs coming back, that Trump’s lying to them about it, asking (impression), “What’s he gonna do? Wave a magic wand? What’s the policy? How’s he gonna do it? Ain’t gonna happen! I don’t want you all, uh, uh, with false hopes out there.”Well, we got an economic growth now sustained of 4.2% and climbing. The stock markets approaching a new record high because Donaldus Trump last night, the deadline that he had set. We have a new trade deal with Canada to be added into the deal already reached with Mexico. It is what gets rid of NAFTA, just as he said he would do, just as he promised on the campaign trail. The new name of this thing is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.Trump has been speaking about this for the last half hour outside the Oval Orifice, and he’s in a fine, fine mood, as is everybody gathered there. It is a major, major achievement. Again, it is something that the Democrat opposition (which includes, of course, the media) all said could not happen. “It couldn’t be done. It was a waste of time to try,” as they said, scratching their heads, “Why does Trump care about trade deals anyway?” And they’ve never understood the Trump voter caring about trade deals.They’ve never understand the connection made and maintains with voters on trade.And it’s not just NAFTA; it’s any number of other things. Jared Kushner has come in for a lot of credit on this deal, which means he’s gonna be in the crosshairs right along with Brett Kavanaugh, about whom we will get to in due course. But the NAFTA news is gonna be buried, which is one of the reasons why Trump is spending so much time talking about it, giving the Drive-By Media a tough time in ignoring it.But for Trump it’s electoral politics in addition to making America great again, as he defines it, something he promised, something he claimed could be done, that would be done, and it has been done, and it is to the benefit of people that voted… Well, to the benefit of millions and millions of Americans in countless numbers of ways, and he’s making sure that as many people as possible are made aware of this. It had to kill the Washington Post to write about this.Headline: “Canada Agrees to Join Trade Accord with U.S. and Mexico, Sending New NAFTA Deal to Congress.” So we’re renegotiating NAFTA. Canada… Canada, which said they wanted no part of it? They asked in at the last moment! “Hey, hey, don’t forget us! Can we be part of this, too?” Trump said, “Come on in.” A reporter just asked Trump, “Does this mean the end of tariffs?” Trump said (summarized), “Hell, no, it doesn’t mean the end of tariffs.“If the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United States, we’re gonna slap tariffs on it. Remember how the Drive-Bys and the Democrats said that slapping tariffs on Chinese goods was gonna provoke the ChiComs? It couldn’t possibly be good! It might mean the end of whatever arrangement we’re making with the North Koreans. It might destroy existing good relations with the ChiComs!Breaking news! “China to Cut Import Tariffs on Wide Range of Products. China [the ChiComs] will cut import tariffs on textile products and metals, including steel products, to 8.4% down from 11.5%, effective Nov. 1, the [ChiCom] finance ministry said on Sunday. Beijing has pledged to take steps to increase imports” that means products from us “this year amid rising tension with some of its biggest trading partners, such as the United States.”Bottom line, Trump said he was gonna do X, Y, and Z and A, B, and C in trade, and if we started A, B, and C, I think he’s pretty much closing in on C. He has rebuilt the economy, he has created new jobs; his economic policies have. The elimination of onerous regulations, which is an ongoing thing, continues to show vast benefits for every ordinary American who makes this country work. And it’s something he said could be done that only he could do and in fact, he was the only one that thought it was necessary to do, and it’s now done.Here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden. We have three sound bites….THE PRESIDENT: I have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made. Since NAFTA’s adoption the United States racked up trade deficits totaling more than $2 trillion, and it’s a much higher number than that. With Canada and Mexico it lost vast amounts of money and lost 4.1 million manufacturing jobs and one in four auto jobs. It’s about 25% of our auto jobs, even more than that. Throughout the campaign I promised to renegotiate NAFTA, and today we have kept that promise.RUSH: For the last half hour, the president… Maybe even longer than that, maybe 45 minutes. You know, an extended statement, he only recently started taking questions. I’ll tell you what Trump is doing here, which is something that I’ve long advocated. He wasn’t just announcing the deal got done. He was teaching why it was important, including to the Drive-By Media, who, for the most part, are clueless, don’t understand capitalism, think that it’s a big, bad, meany.Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works and how the United States has been victimized over the course of many, many years because of American leadership believing, “Well, you know, we’re the superior in the world. We’re the richest. We can afford to take it in the shorts now and then if it promotes good relations with our allies,” and Trump stood up and said, “There’s no reason we should have our back pockets picked.“There’s no reason that we should just let people have whatever they want from our treasury. There’s no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy. It doesn’t mean because we are so much wealthier and powerful, that those who are not have dibs on what we’ve produced. Those days are over. That way of thinking is over.”He went through the whole process of explaining how trade works, why it is important, how the United States was getting the shaft. But more importantly, why it matters to ordinary, everyday people and their jobs and their careers, including farmers and a number of other type people about whom Washington thinks not very often and thinks very little. It’s been a masterful performance.There is no question that Trump not only knows what he’s talking about, he is the architect of what he’s talking about, and he can run rings around people in discussing the process and in discussing the substance and the details of this new agreement. It puts anybody else that’s ever tried this to shame. Everybody that has the chance to listen to this is gonna understand exactly why it was important what happened, why it happened, and why we benefit, and why that’s good.You know, teaching as well as announcing is fundamental. I believe that’s why the Republican Congress 1994 actually squandered its majority after a while, it’s because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it. They made the fatal mistake of believing that the Republican victory in 1994 meant somehow that a majority of the country had overnight turned conservative. So when they began to announce this cut, that cut, this reform, that reform, a lot of people didn’t know what they were talking about, got scared to death.That lesson has been learned by none other than Donaldus Trump. Here’s the next bite. Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us. This kind of thinking, we haven’t seen. We’ve seen thinking, both parties, who believe that it’s up to us to earn the respect of others. It’s up to us to show them that we don’t intend them any harm. It’s up to us. And Trump’s turning this 180 degrees around, said it’s a privilege to trade with us. We’re the world economy. We’re the future of the world economy. We’re the future of the world freedom and liberty. The days of America as the world’s piggybank are over.THE PRESIDENT: This deal will also impose new standards requiring at least 75% of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets. It’s a privilege for them to do business with us, and I’m not talking about Mexico-Canada. I’m talking about everybody, everybody. It’s a privilege for China to do business with us. It’s a privilege for the European Union — who has treated us very badly, but that’s coming along — to do business with us. Japan, every country. It’s a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggybank.RUSH: Yeah. It’s a privilege to come in now — and, as I say, folks, it’s a new way of seeing ourselves and our country without the need to make excuses, without the need to apologize. We really haven’t seen this. You know, you can see evidence and signs of this in our own culture of the achieved and the accomplished somehow feel the need to apologize for it or to downplay it, as some sort of new definition of humility, rather than having it used as a teachable moment, as something inspiring.As Trump points out, we want every country making their country great. We want every country putting their country first. We want everybody doing it that way. That’s the whole point, for everybody to do better, but not by piggy banking the United States, by doing it on their own. These kinds of things are just… They’re foreign to the United Nations types, diplomatic types. Here’s the final bite. Don’t forget who told you this was not possible. Do not forget. It was Barack Hussein O who said none of this could be done.THE PRESIDENT: If you remember, the previous administration said, “We’re not gonna have manufacturing jobs anymore,”” essentially. We’re not gonna have…? We’re not gonna make things anymore?” “No.” Just the opposite. We’re gonna be a manufacturing powerhouse and allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been offshored to the world because of unfair trade issues.RUSH: So there you have it. It’s not a sexy subject. NAFTA never was. I mean, it commanded a lot of attention. You know, it was very controversial when it was ratified in the early into the mid-1990s. But in terms of being a subject, if cable news announced they’re gonna do two or three panels tonight on NAFTA due to the trade deal, they’re not gonna have a lot of people tune in. It’s just wait of the world.So Trump is making sure with this extended event in the Rose Garden today that people get its importance. In terms of its importance as an election issue, it’s crucial. It is… I wouldn’t say crucial. But it’s very important in terms of Trump being able to say to his voters, “Stick with me. I told you I was gonna do this. I told you it could be done, and I told you the United States was gonna come out as the champion in the subject of world trade. Don’t doubt me.”And, in that sense, it’s confidence-inspiring that Trump — left alone in the Oval Office, free and in charge to be who he is — will mean a bunch of great things happening for the country. This can be parlayed into any number of campaign ads for the upcoming midterms, because it’s gonna be about a lot of things, not just the Kavanaugh nomination and other things. This is gonna be a fundamental aspect in terms of turning out the Trump base.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/28/democrats-couldve-called-the-fbi-in-july/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 28, 2018RUSH: So I just checked out the Senate Judiciary Committee session here before they vote — less than an hour, supposedly. Cory Booker, Democrat — “Senator Spartacus” from New Jersey — is going on and on and on. “This is not partisan! This is not a partisan thing, Senator.” He’s talking to the chairman, Grassley. Not a partisan thing? Everything they do is politicized and partisan. It is precisely that. He talked about the heroism of Dr. Ford coming forward. Heroism? The way Dr. Ford’s appearance is described…“She was so helpful, they said. She was so cooperative, and she was so nice and so thoughtful, and she admitted to being terrified! She was so terrified she didn’t know what ‘exculpatory’ meant.” None of that matters! None of that matters. At the end of the day, this is about evidence. If you’re gonna destroy somebody’s life, you better have the goods, and they don’t — and neither did Dr. Ford. She can’t tell ’em where; she can’t tell ’em when. The people she says were there all swear under oath that they were not there, and yet this goes on.And yet Booker is still trying to say that this is not partisan. He just compared it to Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill. He said, “That was a blemish but even they had investigations. Even that committee took time to do the investigation! We’re not even doing the investigation. We won’t even call the FBI.” This is driving people nuts. They had that letter in the middle of July! They could have done anything they wanted between then and now.They chose not to. When certain elements of her story were investigated, as was revealed yesterday, not a single Democrat member of the committee showed up to participate in it, because this is not about evidence. Once again, they’re trying to take a Democrat activist, a professor, and turn her into an abused average American citizen and attach labels such as “heroine” and “brave” and “courageous,” and it all happens under the premise that her allegations are not challengeable. You cannot question her.“She says it happened.” That’s the basis under which we’re operating: It happened. And if you refuse, you’re the bad guy. You’re the racist or bigot or sexist or whatever the Democrats want to throw at you. Dianne Feinstein had the letter from Dr. Ford. What did she do with it? She recommended Dr. Ford get a couple lawyers. (impression) “Lawyers? Uhhh, don’t they cost moneeeeey?” DiFi said,” Don’t worry about that. We’ve got you covered,” and she called a couple of Democrat activist lawyers, Katz and Bromwich, who then took the case pro bono so that Ford would not have to sell either her house in Santa Cruz or Palo Alto, or would not have to fly coach on her next trip to Hawaii.But she couldn’t turn that information over to the FBI. She called a couple of hack activist lawyers and told them what happened to Ford or what Ford said happened, but she couldn’t call the FBI, Dianne Feinstein. She didn’t alert the rest of the committee that she had the letter. She just called a couple of lawyers. The Washington Post did not believe Blasey either. They were contacted first. She sent the letter (probably under advice to somebody) to their tip line, the Washington Post tip line.They never got back to her because they didn’t believe it, and they wanted to believe anything! Now, when the Washington Post didn’t believe it, it doesn’t mean they didn’t believe her story. What it means is the Washington Post looked at what her claim was and thought it was not useful in getting rid of Kavanaugh. That was the studied reaction by left-wing activists disguised as journalists at the Washington Post. If Dr. Ford’s tip had been presented in a way that made the Washington Post think it would be useful in getting rid of Kavanaugh, then they would have scarfed it up.But they didn’t. And again, not because they didn’t think she wasn’t credible or not because they… It’s just something about it, I’m convinced, did not turn them on. But they were contacted first, and it was after that when the Washington Post didn’t reply that someone said, “Okay, well, let’s go to the New York Times.” They didn’t call the FBI. They didn’t call Montgomery County police. They sent a letter to Feinstein. Feinstein goes out, hires a couple of hack lawyers who then start marshaling forces with the media.Throughout all of this, nobody calls the FBI to demand an investigation, ’cause I’ll guarantee you they didn’t believe it, or it wasn’t detailed enough, or it didn’t have what they really wanted — and that is, a way of using it to get rid of Kavanaugh. I guess the pubic hair on the Coke can version of Ford’s story didn’t match the intensity of the pubic hair on the Coke can in the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill story. And nobody wants to frustrate Trump and his Supreme Court nominees more than the Washington Post.Now, I guess in some ways it takes a lot of courage to accuse somebody of attempted rape and even attempted murder. She said she feared for her life at one point! It might take a lot of courage to accuse somebody of that when you don’t have a shred of evidence! That would scare the hell out of me! Let’s just set the table here. Let’s say that I am a Republican political activist and I sent a letter off to some Republican bigwigs, and they come to me, and they say, “Okay. You say this happened to you, but you can’t tell us where or when.“You can’t really say who, not for sure? Well, we want you to go before one of our committees, and we want you to testify what happened to you, even though you can’t say where it happened or when.” And I’m saying, “You’re asking me…? I…” Boy, that would take a lot of courage, if you’re asking me. It would take a lot of courage to go tell a story with a whole lot of holes in it. So I guess on that basis we could grant that there was some courage involved. When you don’t have a shred of evidence, not even the details of time and place? You got no witnesses, nothing.So, yeah, might take some kind of courage to try to destroy somebody without any corroboration. It might take some courage to try to join in the effort to destroy a life and a career. As was said over and over and over again yesterday, the FBI will only interview the same people who have already been interviewed. The FBI would then hand over the same interviews to the Senate. The Senate would just be back where they were before. The FBI doesn’t reach conclusions except… What is it that’s percolating in my memory?Oh, yeah. The FBI did reach conclusions! The FBI… I’m sorry. James Comey and Strzok Smirk and McCabe, they reached a conclusion that Hillary was innocent. But they did that before examining the evidence. They did that before even interviewing Hillary. Hillary Clinton was exonerated of all crimes before they even interviewed her about her suspicious server and trafficking in classified data and documents. So whereas the FBI might not reach conclusions, we can point to FBI leadership having done so in order to clear Hillary Clinton.But in the normal scope of things, they don’t. People making this claim are absolutely right.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal just asked (paraphrased), “In good conscience, Mr. Chairman, you delay this vote. We cannot do this in the United States Senate without an FBI investigation. Please delay the vote!” He’s still begging. He’s still asking.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/27/christine-ford-is-a-product-of-a-democrat-party-operation/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 27, 2018RUSH: I want to get observations of mine on the record so they will be at RushLimbaugh.com now and forever into posterity. In no particular order here, earlier on in the day Dr. Ford kept referring to her “beach friend.” I said, “What the hell is a ‘beach friend’?” Her beach friends told her to do this, her beach friends told her to get the Washington Post, beach friends sent her to the New York Times, beach friends said get a lawyer, beach friends said, “Don’t pay for it yourself.”It turns out that “beach friends” are her buddies in Santa Cruz, California. This woman who can’t afford to pay lawyers has a home in Santa Cruz, California, and a home in Palo Alto, California. Those are two of the most highly expensive real estate areas in the country, not just California. If you live in Santa Cruz, your buddies are beach buddies. You are beach friends. Santa Cruz is the most radical left community in the country, maybe a smidgen. And if it isn’t, it is. And everybody there is political active radical left!It has now become clear to me what the Republican prosecutor is attempting to do here! The Republican prosecutor asking questions of Dr. Ford instead of Republican senators is attempting to establish that Christine Ford has come forward because the Democrat Party has brought her forward. She is attempting to establish that she’s not who she says she is. I mean, it may have happened. But that all of this is happening because the Democrat Party is behind it. Democrat Party political operatives and hacks are behind this! That’s what the prosecutor is attempting to establish.People say, “What does this matter who paid for your lawyers?” It’s part of the attempt to establish… Remember who the audience for this is. The audience for this is a couple or three Republican senators, folks, not you and me. Well, you and me in a sense, but in trying to establish that all of this is not an aggrieved woman who because of her heart and her conscience has come forward. She’s being dragged forward and put in the public eye by the Democrat Party who may have instigated this from the get-go!That’s the attempt that is being made. Whether it’s effective yet or not, I don’t know. But I think that is one of the objectives, shall we say, of the woman conducting the interrogation or the interviews of Dr. Ford for Republican senators. Now, both of her lawyers that we see here… She’s got four. There are two prominently on display here, Michael Bromwich and the Soros lawyer. That would be Debra Katz. Anyway, they just admitted that they are both working pro bono.This woman has the money to pay them, but they’re working pro bono, and Bromwich — are you ready for it? — is also Andrew McCabe’s lawyer! So this guy, one way or the other, is determined to frustrate Donald Trump, to get Trump, one way or the other. Now, I personally — as a man of great decency and compassion — am glad that Dr. Ford will not have to sell her two houses in Santa Cruz and in Santa Fe in order to pay for her lawyers and legal bills.Unlike Michael Flynn and Michael Caputo, who have had to sell everything in order to pay their legal bills because of Robert Mueller’s investigation, Dr. Ford here is free and clear because her lawyers are pro bono. Democrats continue to make a big deal out of the fact that there was no FBI investigation and that Kavanaugh has refused to call for one. (chuckles) Kavanaugh’s undergone — SIX! — FBI investigations.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/27/my-early-thoughts-on-senate-judiciary-show/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 27, 2018RUSH: I know what the Republicans are trying to do. They’re trying to make it look like they are not bullying this woman at all. They are not bullying, they are not gonna treat her unfairly, and they are going to such great lengths to do this that they are not even questioning her. They’ve hired a prosecutor — a female prosecutor, sex-crimes prosecutor — to come in and conduct questions. But it is wholly ineffective if you’re looking for immediate points scored or immediate gain, because you cannot do what she’s doing in five-minute intervals.It just isn’t possible. The way it’s going, she’s asking five-minutes worth of procedural questions that are designed to point out Blasey Ford’s questionable and curious memory and memory lapses. And right as she gets going, the five minutes ends, and then the Democrats take over. And the Democrats simply say, “You’re not making it up; right? You remember it enough to know that it happened to you? You’ve been deeply affected by it?”“Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.”And then it goes back to the Republicans and the lawyer — the prosecutor — picks up where she left off five or six minutes prior. In the midst of all this back-and-forth, the Democrats are getting their shots in on Grassley for his supposedly ineffective investigation, lack of taking it seriously. He then comes back and rebuts all of that and says they’re wrong, he did it, and starts reciting every bit of behavior on the part of the committee majority to do the investigation. The problem here is — and, look, I know what’s going on.In addition to not trying to be appearing like a bully, or being unfair, they also know this thing’s gonna go on all day. And this prosecutor is laying a foundation and a case to eventually be able to say in a summation that, “We just can’t trust what the witness is saying ’cause she doesn’t remember enough. There are too many contradictory memories. There are too many things here. We couldn’t go to court with this case,” something of the sort. But, in terms of this being a television event, that is going to be lost on everybody watching this, and it’s a television event.The fact is that it is going to determine the public reaction, which is gonna be highly determinant in whether or not there is a vote on Kavanaugh tomorrow. Also Kavanaugh has yet to appear. He will go last, and he will have a chance to refute all this, and there is talk that he is indignant and angry and will portray that in his appearance. But the way this is happening here — since they agreed to-five-minute questions, five-minute question period — there’s nothing…I don’t think Grassley can change the rules in the middle of it because his five minutes are not effective, his five-minute intervals. But you see, there’s a different way that you question a hostile witness in a deposition, which is how the Republican prosecutor is treating this. She’s treating this as a deposition and not a hearing, and it isn’t a deposition. It is a hearing. And in a deposition, you ask open-ended questions because you’re looking for information.In a hearing, you do the exact opposite. You ask leading questions because you’re trying to make a point. You’re trying to make points, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. In a deposition, nobody ever sees it. You’re preparing for trial. It’s recorded on video in an office somewhere, never in a courtroom or never in public like this. Depositions are rarely actually seen in toto, and it’s to prepare for trial. This is the trial! This is, even though it’s not, the moment of truth.There is no preparation for down the road here, and yet that is how this is being conducted. At a hearing, you don’t ask, “Do you remember how you got home that day?” You don’t ask it that way. You ask, “Isn’t it a fact that somebody had to drive you home after you say you were assaulted? Isn’t it a fact that you can’t or won’t tell us who drove you home?” The witness has to be put on the spot. But I think maybe it’s entirely possible the Republicans have told the prosecutor, “Don’t do that. We can’t appear to be bullying her. We can’t appear to be unfair.”Questions like, “So you’re saying this traumatic event happens and you can’t say what happened right afterwards? You’re saying this traumatic event happened, but you can’t say where? You’re saying this traumatic event happened, but you can’t say when for certain? You won’t tell us who drove you home and what you told that person right after this traumatic event?” Those are the questions that this prosecutor, if this were in court, would be asking.But treating this as a deposition, i.e., the collection of witness evidence and testimony for later use? There isn’t gonna be any later use! Rachel Mitchell is the prosecutor’s name. It’s frustrating, folks. It’s maddening to watch this. She asks five minutes of questions, but nobody knows what she’s driving at unless you arrive at this with some information and knowledge beforehand. Well, we can’t rely…I don’t know how many people across the country are watching this. I’d assume it’s a lot. It’s a big stretch to assume that most people in the public watching already has a baseline of information so that her questioning would be understood in context. You can’t do that this way. Despite how repulsive it might be or seem, this is theater. This is performance. All trials are. All hearings are. It’s just the extent that you want to go there or even admit it is an aspect here.But with these little five-minute periods of questions, nobody knows what she’s driving at because she’s asking open-ended questions in a very polite and I-don’t-want-to-offend-you, schoolmarm kind of way. Right at the moment she starts to get someplace, bam! The five minutes are up and they gotta go to the Democrat whose turn it is next, and people forget where she was. We go back and it’s her turn again, and she picks up where she left off where nobody can remember where that was.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I don’t know whether this is studied and rehearsed or whether what we’re getting is the real deal. But Christine Blasey Ford comes across as very, very young and even her speech pattern. I don’t… She’s what is called an “up-talker.” You know what an up-talker is? Some call it “up-speak. ” People that speak this way end their sentences with an upward inflection. (impression) “I think, so sir. Uh, uh, well, I — I… No, but I was thinking about it when I did.”It makes the speaker sound teenager-ish, very, very young. Uber-nice. “Vulnerable” is the key word. Vulnerable and sensitive. When you talk to somebody… Some people say it’s annoying. But as a speech pattern, that conveys innocence, youth, vulnerability, valley girl-type thing. “I don’t know, Senator, but I would hope soooo. Uh, I — I think I did, but I…” That’s why I don’t know if this is practiced or if it’s the way that she speaks.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I found it very strange that Dr. Ford did not know that the Senate committee had offered to come to her in California. She said that she didn’t understand that, that if she had known that, that she would have welcomed them to California. Of course, she was on vacation a bunch of places in August. She was in New Hampshire and where else? New Hampshire and one other place. But she had to fly there. I mean, it’s the East Coast. She lives up in the Left Coast.How come she didn’t know that the committee had offered to fly out there? Did her lawyers not pass that on? She openly professed to being very confused by that, like she was hearing it for the first time that they had offered to fly out to see her since she didn’t like to fly. It seemed like she didn’t know it. Also, just her manner of speaking, folks, is gonna be a big obstacle. She’s coming across… With that up-talker, up-speak technique that she has, it comes across, she sounds like a very, very young girl, very innocent, very vulnerable, very sensitive.(impression) “And wants to do the right thing, um, I — I — I think?” She felt like… One odd thing, too. She’s a doctor. Doctorate in psychology. She acts like she’s totally unfamiliar with polygraph, and she was reduced to crying during the polygraph and said she felt like it was just all over her body, which was similar to how she described what happened to her in the room. Anyway, people have been waiting patiently on the phones to get in. They’ve taken a recess here probably, luncheon recess. So we’ll start in Lewiston, Idaho. This is Phil. And I’m glad you called, sir. What’s your take on all this?CALLER: Hi, Rush. Thanks for taking my call.RUSH: Yes, sir.CALLER: Hey, I was struck when Dr. Ford mentioned run into Mark Judge at a grocery store several weeks after the incident and said that she said hello to him. That struck me as really odd, because I’ve talked to a lot of women in my life about bad encounters that they’ve had with men. Whether it was a bad date, whether it was a sexual type of a thing. Whatever it was, any time they saw that individual later, it was either anger or a frown or, “I’m getting out of here as fast as I can. I don’t want to be seen.” But she talked about how she said hi to him and almost kind of indicated the friendliness they’ve had in the past, like she expected a conversation or something. And then he, you know, looked pale and so forth. It just seemed really odd that if she was take advantage of in the way that she describes, that she would have reacted that way when she saw him.RUSH: You know, that’s a good point. I was watching and listening when that happened, and I didn’t make that connection. But you’re right. You’re absolutely right. I mean, I’ve known people that didn’t have any kind of trauma with people. They just dated ’em and broke up with ’em and see ’em someplace and don’t want to go anywhere near ’em for some reason. It’s very common. I’ve seen that. You’re absolutely right. When you add trauma and abuse to it, yeah, that’s a good observation. I’m glad you called.I realize many of you have been listening to the hearings wall-to-wall and many of your affiliates have been carrying the hearing from the beginning. I just want to share a couple observations with you that I’ve already shared with the audience that was listening to the program before we get back to the phones. That is to say that when we started a little bit after noon Eastern Time today, the hearings had been going on for an hour or so.I was struck by the Republican strategy here of having a female prosecutor take over the questioning for Republican senators. It seemed to be not what was called for. It seemed like that prosecutor was questioning Dr. Ford as though it was a deposition here, in preparation for something later like a trial or a hearing before a judge, and that’s not what this is. This is not… There’s no time for a deposition here. You gotta get in, get it get it, and get out. It’s a different way… You question a hostile witness in a deposition as opposed to the a hearing.In a deposition, which is what this looks like, you ask open-ended questions because you’re looking for information, and you might be trying to set up contradictions. You might be trying to, you know, spread or lay what are called perjury traps. There isn’t time for that here unless there’s a grand strategy that will only reveal itself later in the day. In a hearing, which this is, you do ask leading questions because you are trying to make a point, and you’ve gotta do it quick. You gotta get in there and get it.So in a hearing like this, you do not say, “Do you remember how you got home that day?”“Uh, well, I — I think it was in a car. I — I do.”You say instead, “Isn’t it a fact that someone had to have driven you home after you say you were assaulted? Isn’t it a fact that you can’t or won’t tell us who it was that drove you home?” Because the point would be in a hearing, “So you’re saying this traumatic event happened, and you can’t say what happened right afterward to somebody? You can’t tell us who drove you home so we can go ask them what you said? You can’t tell us what you said?”“No. I — I — I my memory.”But she’s not being asked questions like that. She’s being asked open-ended questions. “So, do you remember how you got home?”“You won’t tell us who drove you home and what you told that person right after the traumatic event?” should be the question.So the Republican prosecutor’s name is Rachel Mitchell. She asked five minutes of questions but knows what she’s driving at because they’re open-ended. We don’t know what notes she’s taking. We don’t know what she’s balancing the answers against that she has as her baseline there. She’s asking these open-ended questions almost in a friendly schoolmarm kind of way, like Dr. Ford’s been called to the principal’s office. And by the time the prosecutor, Ms. Mitchell, gets going — by the time she starts to zero in on what may be some contradictions — her five minutes are up and we gotta shift over to the next Democrat senators who says, “I believe you! I believe you! Are you sure it was Kavanaugh?”“Yeeeees.”“How much?”“One-hundred percent! A 100%. I remember I remember 100%.”But she doesn’t remember anything else 100%.  "

He’s wipin’ the floor with the Iranians. He’s wipin’ the floor with the little Trudeau guy up in Canada. He’s wipin’ the floor with the “Macaroni” guy in France. He is letting it be known that the economic wave sweeping across the globe today starts in the United States, is maintained in the United States, and will continue to spread and grow from the United States. Trump today also announced… He was chairing the Security Council meeting.It was his turn. It’s the United States’ turn. So Trump chairs the meeting. Do you know how the deep state was panicking over this? Conservative, Never Trumpers? “You mean we’re gonna have this guy up there chairing a meeting at the U.N. at the Security Council?” They were… Oh. They thought Trump would start throwing his shoe through glass windows and stuff. Trump pretty much led off by saying, “The ChiComs are trying to interfere in the 2018 elections. The ChiComs are trying to destroy Republican chances,” and Trump said, “You know why?“Because I’m wiping the floor with them on trade deals. The ChiComs are very unhappy at the success of my administration, at the success of the U.S. economy.” So now Trump has thrown a wrench into the gears. Usually it’s he being accused of colluding, collaborating with the Russians over 2016. Now Trump says the ChiComs are trying to steal the 2018 elections away from the Republicans. So, while all this is going on, Trump is literally making tracks at the United Nations.About the only things the Drive-Bys have been able to say is that they laughed at Trump when he talked about how his administration has done more good in two years than any other administration in the history of the planet. Well, they’re lying to you about when the attendees or the audience started laughing. There was some chuckles, just a little few chuckles when President Trump made commented that he’s done more in two years than most administrations have done ever. There were some chuckles and Trump said, “Well, that’s not quite the reaction I was looking for.”That’s what got the big laughter, not Trump’s claim, but his reaction to the initial little wave of chuckles. And that’s it. That’s all the Drive-Bys have. The Drive-Bys other than that are ignoring Trump at the United Nations. They are ignoring economic data. They are ignoring everything going on that Trump is touching, other than Kavanaugh, because there’s nothing they can do to destroy it. There’s nothing they can do to take it down, and I don’t think they even want to try to convince people.So, all they’ve got is to continue to portray Trump as they always have been, that he’s a boob and a dunce and doesn’t know what he’s doing and the world is laughing at him. Don’t doubt me. The world is not laughing at Donald Trump. The Iranians are not laughing at Donald Trump. The ChiComs are not laughing at Donald Trump. Vladimir Putin shirtless on the horse wherever he is, he’s not laughing at Donald Trump. That little pot-bellied dictator in North Korea, Kim Jong-un, is not laughing at Donald Trump.But the Never Trumpers in conservative media circles in the United States are continuing to try to laugh and act mock shocked and afraid.

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/20/the-world-waits-will-she-testify/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 20, 2018RUSH: Okay. So I see where Senator Grassley has given the accuser Christine Blasey Ford until 10 a.m. tomorrow to decide whether or not to show up on Monday, right? Grassley may want to get his new iPhone, may be what that’s about. I’m just kidding. By 10 a.m. tomorrow she’s gotta decide, and all the Democrats go, “Well, they’re bullying her! They’re bullying. You can’t… You can’t bully the accuser in these situations! You can’t do it!” I tell you, folks, Robert Bork once said that we’re “witnessing the end of civilization” while watching the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings.His buddy Irving Kristol walked by and said, “What are you doing?” Bork said, “Watching the end of civilization.” And Irving Kristol said, “Yeah, no question about that but at least we can still live well until it all goes kaput.” (chuckling) I think people are starting to get frustrated now because the Republicans have been bent over backwards to tell Ms. Blasey Ford and her supporters what they want from her, and the president has been bending over backwards. He said it would be wonderful if she would show up and testify.But, you know, there’s breaking news. There are new details emerging practically by the hour. Here we have the latest. It will unfold before your very eyes and ears as the program does. You know, Byron York had, by the way, a very good little tweet here. As these people are comparing this to Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill, and he points out some things that make it clear we’re not talking about the same thing here. Anita Hill testified. She testified in the hearings in October of 1991 that Thomas harassed her with a pubic hair on a Coke can in 1981.(interruption) That’s what it was, folks. I mean, Snerdley is bowing his head in there, can’t believe it. Well, I mean, that was the big deal. Remember, the media was going to video stores like Blockbusters trying to figure out secret porn movies that Thomas may have rented. I kid you not. And what was it? There was Long Dong Silver, that’s what it was! Somebody claimed that Justice Thomas had rented Long Dong Silver. (interruption) This is what a Supreme Court confirmation hearing was reduced to.Anyway, Byron York reminds us that Hill testified in October 1991 that Thomas harassed her in 1991 and ’82. That’s like ten years before, far more recent than Christine Blasey Ford’s 36-year-old charge against Kavanaugh. Also, Hill and Thomas were both adults when the alleged pubic hair was left on the alleged Coke can in the workplace. They were both adults whereas we’re talking about teenagers in high school here with Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford. Now, the Democrats are livid. Grassley…We were one of the first to point this out yesterday. Grassley even tried to get hold of the accuser and her lawyers, and they’re not responding to him. She, of course, isn’t, but her lawyers are not responding to Grassley. Grassley said (paraphrased), “I’ve tried smoke signals and I’ve tried SOS. I’ve tried Morse code. I’ve tried email. I’ve tried text. I’ve tried SMS. I’ve tried EMS. I’ve tried everything I know to do out there and I can’t get a call-back from them.” So Mazie Hirono from Hawaii — who obviously is seeing this as a moment to raise her national stardom — is starting to utter profanity we’re not used to hearing from senators.She’s saying (paraphrased), “You go to hell! You go to hell! That is BS,” except she’s not using the initials. And she says, “Grassley, who are you to reach out and contact with woman without any of us know? You can’t do that!” Why, is that bullying, too, the chairman of the committee trying to get hold of the lawyers? Anyway, what Grassley’s offered… This is unprecedented. We were among the first to pass this on to you yesterday that Grassley even offered to take the Senate Judiciary Committee staff to California wherever Christine Blasey Ford is holed up.And they’re rejecting that. And of course I predicted they would reject it. You know why they reject it? Because they will say she’s in hiding. She’s afraid for her life because wacko Trump supporters are all over her. So this is just Grassley trying to find out where she lives so he can leak it to people and further endanger her. We can’t let Grassley and his staff know where we are. (This is the tone that they are taking.) But it raises some questions. Why does an accuser claiming firsthand knowledge need more time to testify about her story?What kind of preparation is necessary here? We’re talking about an event that took place in less than seven minutes if it happened. Seven minutes. Maybe not even that long. So what the hell else is there to remember? What really is there to prep for? Is the preparation designed to sound credible when you don’t know what you’re talking about? Is the preparation designed to cover up for periods of time you don’t recall? What could possibly be necessary here? She took a lie detector test. She wrote it all down. She was there.And her lawyers say she passed the lie detector test that they gave her. The Republicans desperately want to hear from her, and I don’t think this is an act. You have the president saying (summarized), “It’d be wonderful if she showed up. We want to hear what she has to say.” The president said yesterday, “Look, if she shows up and credible, we’re gonna have to rethink this whole thing.” I mean, they’re practically rolling out the red carpet for her. (interruption) What are you frowning at? (interruption) You think it’s a sham? (interruption) You think it’s a track? (interruption) What are you laughing at in there?They want to talk to her. They want her to show up. They want to hear her story. (interruption) Well, Snerdley says, “So you say the only reason they’re acting eager to hear from her is because they know she’s not coming.” Okay, let me tell you. They know she doesn’t have what? The story? She doesn’t have the details? She doesn’t have the goods? Is that what you’re gonna say, “She doesn’t have what she claims to have”? She’s not gonna show up? That’s what you think? (interruption) Okay. If she doesn’t show up, I’m gonna tell you what’s gonna happen.I’m telling you right now it’s already in the works with, and I know it’s in the works because I heard a Drive-By Media person talking about it. The Drive-By Media person was Karen Tumulty of the Washington Post who says she wouldn’t be surprised if more women surface over the weekend alleging similar acts by Kavanaugh. She’s just telegraphed that they’re out there trying to find women that they can convince to come forward and say what they want them to say. You know they’re working on that.You know that the Democrat Party, you know that the media — they’re working in tandem — are scouring women who went to the same school or went to school where Kavanaugh was seen, you know, lurking around and so forth. And they’re gonna try to find as many women — not too many, find one or two women — to come forward and say, “Yeah, I didn’t want to come forward but I watching what’s happening to Christine Blasey Ford, and I can’t stand it.”So don’t be surprised. That would be the cover if she doesn’t show. (interruption) You’re sitting there thinking that the Republicans and you know she’s not gonna show. Well, that means the Democrats know she’s not gonna show. The Democrats are not gonna let the fact that she doesn’t show kill their effort to wipe out Kavanaugh. So in replacement for her not showing, don’t be surprised, don’t be surprised if later today or tomorrow — sometime before this 10 o’clock tomorrow morning headline — that another woman surfaces.But I want to remind you one thing. We had audio yesterday from a friend of Christine Blasey Ford. Her name was Guerry, G-u-e-r-r-y. I forget her first name. Doesn’t matter. We played the sound bites, and she was talking about how when they were in school that this kind of thing happened a lot. But not with Kavanaugh! She did not have any firsthand knowledge of anything Kavanaugh did, but she did say that all the boys — a lot of the boys — this is how they behaved. A lot of the boys did.“You mean Brett Kavanuagh?”“No, no, no! I — I –”“She made it so clear she never saw Brett Kavanaugh. She never heard his name in any of this. Well, to me that’s all anybody needs to know if we’ve got a friend of Christine Blasey Ford coming out there trying to establish that Christine Blasey Ford is not making it up. But this woman, this friend of hers went out of her way… Cookie, grab that bite again from yesterday. I mean, no mad dash hurry. Just whenever you get it. She made a point twice in the audio sound bite we played to make sure no, she’s not talking about Brett Kavanaugh here.There’s also a little bit of news here. There’s a website. There’s a guy that runs a website. I don’t have it right in front of me. I can’t remember the name of the site. I’ll find it here in a second. I’ve not heard of the website before. But I’m gonna go ahead and tell you, the guy running the website claims that he knew that they… He went and looked at the yearbook, the high school yearbook from the year in question here at the yearbook where Christine Blasey Ford went to school.What he saw, he writes, convinced him that they were gonna have to scrub that yearbook from the web. They’re gonna have to delete it. They’re gonna have to erase it. So knowing that that would happen earlier this week, he made screenshots and copies and so forth and cached it. The yearbook for the year your question here at Christine Blasey Ford’s school is all… (laughs) Well, not all about, but there are numerous references of the girls having keggers, keg party after keg party.There are stories, “What we did when the parents were gone,” complete with pictures, making it look like the girls in this school knew how to party with a keg just like guys did. And it establishes that, you know, many of the entrees or entries in this particular yearbook make it clear that people didn’t remember the next day what had happened the night before in perfect detail and so forth. So he writes that when he saw it, he predicted that they would scrub this. They’d have to get rid of it. They’d have to wipe it off of the Web.And it is. It’s gone. So we have that little bit of detail. But back to this whole thing. Republicans want to hear from her, despite the smirks from Mr. Snerdley. The Republicans want to hear from her. They’re making it clear. The media believes her. I’m asking here why doesn’t she show up? Here. Grab sound bite No. 22. Cookie came through. This was yesterday afternoon on Wolf Blitzed on CNN. Jim Acosta was Acosta-ing Christine Blasey Ford’s friend and ex-classmate, Samantha Guerry. And Acosta said, “What Dr. Ford is alleging, is this the first time you heard anything like that about Judge Kavanaugh?”GUERRY: It’s not the first time I’ve heard anything like that in terms of the community of women I know, and not regarding him but —ACOSTA: Those sorts of things went on?GUERRY: A lot… You know, one of the things that’s surprising to me as I’ve gotten involved in this in the last couple days is how many women of my class have come forward to me in this last few days and said, “I had similar experiences in high school,” and this hits me very deeply and it’s very —ACOSTA: Not with Brett Kavanaugh, but with other boys?GUERRY: Not with Brett Kavanaugh! But with other boys in our community, and we all feel that if we were in her shoes, we’d want (chuckles) to be taken seriously as well.RUSH: Okay. Fair enough. But, look, there’s some questions here. This woman is 50-some-odd years old now — same age as Christine Blasey Ford — and she says, “You know, one of the things that’s surprising to me as I’ve gotten involved in this in the last couple days is how many women of my class have come forward to me in this last few days and said, ‘I had similar experiences in high school’…” Well, if you went to high school with ’em, why wouldn’t you know it when they happened? So much of this doesn’t pass the consistency test.But the primary thing here is, “It’s not the first time I’ve heard anything like that in terms of the community of women that I know, not regarding him.” Meaning: I don’t know anything about Kavanaugh. And then Acosta, after she describes how women of her class have come forward the last few days and told her they had similar experiences in high school and it now hits her very deeply ’cause because I know all this was going on while she was in high school. But now she’s hearing about it from all of her friends who say, “Oh, yeah, it was going on in high school.”But not with Brett Kavanaugh! She makes it clear twice here that in all of this debauchery that was supposedly going on at this private school, she never heard the name Brett Kavanaugh mentioned. Yet she’s coming forward here in support of Christine Blasey Ford. Now, does that… To me, this is the kind of thing that gets passed over. The Drive-By Media conducts the interview, they hear the answer, doesn’t even register. To me, this is close to bombshell.You got a good buddy exonerating Kavanaugh from the type of behavior she says she’s now learned was commonplace. Not Kavanaugh though. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! Not Brett Kavanaugh. So why does she need more time to testify when she’s got firsthand knowledge? Why does she need more time when she took a lie detector test? She wrote it all down. She answered the questions. The Republicans desperately the want to hear from her. The president said it’d be a wonderful thing. The media believes her.The media wants to believe this woman so bad that they already do. So why is Kavanaugh — who is portrayed as a creepy liar by the media. Why is he ready, willing, and able to testify and Ford isn’t? Could somebody explain that to me? He said he’ll show up anytime, anywhere. She will not! I think Senator Grassley’s handled this well. For people following the story, it’s clear what’s going on. Knee-jerk identity politics haters and abortion zealots. Nothing matters to them anyway other than that.Republicans are evil because they’ve got minds of their own. It doesn’t matter how accomplished and achieved and impeccable their reputations are like Kavanaugh. It desn’t matter how much charity work they do. It doesn’t matter how many people vouch for them. It doesn’t matter how many people love and adore them. It doesn’t matter how stellar their lives and career and work has been. It doesn’t matter if they’ve led normal, productive lives. Nothing matters except removing them as obstacles.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. So the reason that she needs more time is what? (interruption) This was so traumatic that she has been trying to forget it. She’s been trying to…? (interruption) Right. She’s been trying to forget it her whole life, and, now, because of these dastardly Republican senators she’s being forced to try to remember it? That’s what they’re telling us is why she can’t show up and testify immediately because she spent all this time trying to forget it? Now she’s being forced to remember it? Okay. So what evil, dastardly Republican made her write her letter to Senator Feinstein?I mean, she started this process, did she not? In fact, if we’re to believe something, the Democrats and the media are really to blame for her trauma here. She wrote the letter to Feinstein, but she asked that it not be made public and that her name not be mentioned. And somebody — either on Feinstein’s staff or some colleague — on the Democrat side leaked all of this against Christine Blasey Ford’s wishes. Meanwhile, the Republicans are catching all the heat here, but it’s the Democrats and the media who want this woman to put her psyche at risk in order to nail this nominee.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Senator Grassley is trying to convince Kavanaugh accuser to testify on Monday. He said, “What I’m focused right now is do everything we can to make Dr. Ford comfortable with coming before a committee either in an open session or closed session, public or private interview.” He even offered to go to California. No matter what Grassley has offered, the answer has been, “Nyet, nyet, nyet.”He was even willing to send committee staff to California to speak with the Kavanaugh accuser. Mazie Hirono, the Democrat senator from Hawaii, says Grassley’s office hasn’t really tried to contact the illusive doctor, professor, Ph.D. He hasn’t really tried! He hasn’t really tried! He’s just saying he’s try. He doesn’t really mean it, according to Mazie Hirono. In an interview with ABC News, “she called the assertions that Republicans had exhausted every method to contact Blasey BS,” except she didn’t say “BS.” She said the word.“‘I would like for us to come together and figure out what’s the best way to proceed,’ Hirono says in the video. ‘Not this seat-of-the-pants stuff,’ she added.” She doesn’t like this. “A communications aide for Grassley’s office responded, however, calling Hirono’s claim ‘nonsense’ and stating that the committee had made multiple attempts to contact Ford directly. ‘This is such nonsense. The committee has sent nine emails and left two voicemails,’ communications adviser Garrett Ventry wrote on Twitter.”Now, Mazie Hirono’s out there saying Kavanaugh’s fudging the truth. She doesn’t know what the truth is here. You know, we’re back to this. We’re back to a woman says it, you gotta believe it, except that’s only in force when the Democrats are not in power or when the women doing the accusing are accusing Republicans. But when the women were accusing Bill Clinton, they were targeted and destroyed. The double standards are rife.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This Jerry in upstate New York. Welcome, sir. Great to have you here.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Been a listen since around 2012. I’m what you can call a surprise a Millennial by age. Had a quick theory for you on the Blasey Ford-Kavanaugh situation.RUSH: Okay.CALLER: So I’m thinking that obviously Democratic Party’s pushing for this FBI investigation before she testifies so that they can be sure that whatever she has to say during the testimony, that it aligns with what the FBI is, you know, so-called gonna uncover.RUSH: Oh. You’re saying they want the FBI to go first so that she can coordinate with what she tells the FBI and be consistent with it?CALLER: Correct. Yeah. I haven’t heard anybody mention anything, you know, regarding that. But that’s just a theory I was thinking about.RUSH: You mean that they’re trying to make sure she doesn’t get convicted of lying to the FBI and going to jail like Martha Stewart or Michael Flynn? I don’t think… (laughing) I marvel at the… It’s very fascinating the way people think. That’s an interesting point that you’re making. The whole idea of the FBI investigating a high school event from 36 years ago. It’s not exactly what they do. But the left is saying, “Trump could make ’em! Trump… Trump could tell the FBI to do anything,” except Trump can’t make them (chuckles) declassify documents.Trump is now declassifying some of this stuff and the Democrats are running around saying, “He can’t do that! That… That… He can’t do that! That’s a violation their security.” On the other hand, “Trump, you make the FBI investigate this.” They’re so all over the ballpark and all over the place. Jerry, I appreciate the call. Find audio sound bite No. 12. This is what I alluded to, if she doesn’t testify, if she doesn’t accept the invite by 10 a.m. tomorrow. Here’s Karen Tumulty last night, Fox News Channel’s Special Report, Shannon Bream. This is the All-Star Panel and Karen Tumulty talking about what could happen to change the Kavanaugh story between now and Monday.TUMULTY: The thing I think we all need to remember is that we still have 4-1/2 days until Monday. And we’re… The way the news cycle works in these times, this — this whole thing is probably gonna take five or six twists and turns.BREAM: Right.TUMULTY: Now, maybe other people coming out of the woodwork either to verify what Judge Kavanaugh is saying or to back up when she is saying. By Monday, this could look like a very different situation.RUSH: All righty now. How do you translate that, folks? I’m gonna tell you what it means. Karen Tumulty is expecting that by time Monday comes around the media will have found additional women to come forward and say, “Oh, yeah! Kavanaugh did this to me. I know Kavanaugh did this to a bunch of women.” That’s what she’s telegraphing here.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: John in Cape Canaveral, Florida.  I’m glad you waited.  I really am.  And welcome to the program, sir.  Hi.CALLER:  Thank you, Rush.  Mega law enforcement dittos, longtime listener, first-time caller.RUSH:  Thank you.  Love hearing from law enforcement.CALLER:  Well, I tell you, we used to have to have our own little transistor radios bungee corded to the dashboard because back in the late ’80s there were no commercial radios in the patrol cars.RUSH:  Yeah, I remember that.  I remember hearing about that.  Airline pilots also had to listen to the program on the HF radio up in the cockpit.  People going into… Yeah, had Rush rooms in the restaurants and everything so people wouldn’t miss anything when they went in to eat.  Transistors in the cop cars.  I remember hearing about that.CALLER:  Yep, you had to actually strap ’em onto the dashboard because, you know, occasionally there were some interesting turns and the transistors would end up in all sorts of strange places.RUSH:  (laughing) Well, you know, I used to do that when I was 12, 13, riding a bicycle. I had a little transistor radio that I taped to the handlebars and it’s how I listened to radio driving around, riding around on my bicycle.  I know exactly what you were doing.  Absolutely.CALLER: (garbled cell) Well, sir, anyhow, you know, this ongoing debate with this professor or doctor has been orchestrated, since it became public. The Democratic Party has really been doing this thing just real methodically.  And I think (unintelligible) it’s pretty common knowledge that it’s gonna be a he said, she said.  So what I think they’re doing is they’re setting us up on this (unintelligible) and all these commentators, and TV, and so forth that are saying that she’s been bullied, she’s been railroaded, (unintelligible) and all these white guys on the judiciary committee are against her.RUSH:  I like this.  For those of you having trouble hearing, your cell connection is probably worse than that transistor radio you used to have in the car.  But this is actually a brilliant observation.  What John thinks is happening here is that we’re all being set up, as we’re talking about what a bunch of bullies the Republican senators are. With the deadlines, she’s gotta say whether she’s gonna show up on Monday by 10 a.m. tomorrow or else!That what they’re planning all along is for her to make a dramatic entrance on Monday, at the last moment, displaying bravery and courage that we haven’t seen since Anita Hill, and that she will take her place and submit to an interview and questions.  This is what he thinks is being assembled right now.  I wouldn’t be surprised by anything, but I… They’re obviously planning something and still, folks, do not discount that they are looking for and have found other women to claim the same thing about Kavanaugh between now and Monday as well.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I mentioned about a half hour ago that I was watching something. (laughing) I was just cracking up watching it on CNN as they were reporting — one of their infobabes, Kaitlan Collins, was reporting — how stunned Trump’s own aides are at how gentle and nice he’s being to the accuser! They can’t believe it! Trump’s own people, the people who know him best, cannot believe that he’s a nice guy. I wanted you to actually hear it. This is Kaitlan Collins talking about Trump to Wolf Blitzer, who asked her, “What are you hearing about the White House strategy and how the president handled this problem and all the problems surrounding the Kavanaugh nomination?”COLLINS: Aides back here in the West Wing are quietly stunned by just how respectful President Trump has been when talking about this woman who has accused his Supreme Court nominee of sexually assaulting her when they were a teenager. (sic) Aides really thought on Sunday that when President Trump read that Washington Post interview where she first came forward detailing this allegation that he may have that sense of volcanic anger that we’ve seen from the president before.President Trump himself has been boasting this week to allies and outside advisers about the positive coverage he’s getting in response to the measured response that he’s had about these allegations. And aides say they think (gulp) that that has helped encourage him to continue responding in such a measured way. But also, they think that a lot of that restraint, Wolf, has to do with the fact that this allegation isn’t made against the president. The president is gonna leave the White House here in a few hours. He’s going to Las Vegas for a rally tonight. Of course, Wolf, know those rallies are where the president is often not very scripted and not usually on topic sometimes — and he’s often in a room full of supporters who are chanting and cheering him on!RUSH: So what the reporterette here is expecting is for Trump to become who he is again. Once he’s in Vegas and with his supporters, he’ll start ripping into his accuser, he’ll start ripping into the Democrats, and he’ll blow this new persona that he’s established that nobody can believe. (interruption) Yeah. I… (interruption) (interruption) Yes. Snerdley asked me, “Do you believe there are Trump aides that talk to CNN?” Yes. I think Trump’s got one of the leakiest West Wings we’ve ever had.I think there are a lot of people in there that are out for themselves to this day still. I don’t have any doubt that they’re leaking in there. I don’t have any doubt that they would make something like this up. People that know Donald Trump know that… It’s not news that he’s a nice guy! Believe me. It’s not news that he treats people with respect! He’s got no animus about this woman. He’s not.. This isn’t anything about him and he’s treating this in the exact way he should.But the point of this is that even when he’s behaving in ways that all of these establishment people think he should — with the proper decorum, a proper morality, he’s being presidential — even then, it isn’t real. Even then, he’s faking it. It’s so unreal that his staff doesn’t even believe it, and then they throw bit in (impression), “Yeah, he’s so excited with the coverage he’s getting, he might continue being a nice guy.“But that’s until he gets to Vegas tonight, Wolf! As you well know, Wolf, the president goes off script — and he’s in that room with those literally insane supporters of his — and that’s when anything can happen, Wolf. And we will be there, Wolf, to chronicle every instance of Trump not being this fake nice guy that he’s been acting the past three days.” That’s what her report meant.  "

Welcome, sir. You’re up first today.CALLER: Well, thank you, Rush. It’s really an honor to talk to you. Longtime listener, first-time caller.RUSH: Thank you very much. I appreciate that. You bet.CALLER: You’re welcome. Okay. The reason I’m calling you is I’m a retired Defense Department federal employee, and, during part of my career, I was the family advocacy officer at a large Air Force base here in the United States.RUSH: What does a family advocacy officer do?CALLER: Well, we investigated cases of suspected child abuse, child neglect, and spouse abuse, and we accepted referrals from anybody in the Air Force or the local community.RUSH: Oh, okay.CALLER: And we had a standard which was called “reasonable suspicion.” And it was a fairly low standard where if it even looked like there might be a hint that something really happened, we would open a case, do an investigation, receive reports from other agencies, medical reports, interview all the people involved. But if we didn’t feel that it even met a minimum standard, we closed the case and called it “no reasonable suspicion.” My experience tells me this case has “no reasonable suspicion.”RUSH: Well —CALLER: There’s no information. There’s no dates. It’s just — I hate to use the word “bogus,” but basically there’s not even a minimal threshold that we would use to open it. We would stamp it “no reasonable suspicion” and file it in the archives.RUSH: You come from a world of decency and honor and common sense. It’s a bygone era. We’re now in the #MeToo movement, where there are exceptions, but for the most part the woman says it and you have to believe it, at least in terms of how you approach it. You have to believe it. It is political suicide not to accept it as true or likely. You just can’t…Your standard of reasonable suspicion, try that term out. (Laughing) This woman you could say she wouldn’t past the old Department of Defense reasonable suspicion test, and look what happens to whoever tries to say that. We live in a different era now.CALLER: We sure do.RUSH: The nature of the evidence is everything. I mean, the seriousness of the charge is everything and nature of evidence doesn’t count for much at all.CALLER: I agree with you totally, Rush. And it’s really sad, because a good man’s reputation and his life are being ruined. That’s why we had the standard that we did. And we were audited by all kinds of people, we cooperated with all kinds of local agencies on and off the Air Force base. We had to have good documentation for everything that we did. And this thing is totally bogus with no facts. I mean, where do you start an investigation with this other than interviewing this lady, which she is refusing to do?RUSH: Right.CALLER: It’s just ridiculous.RUSH: Yeah. Well with you… She’s realizing… So much here. This is not about what really even happened. This is about simply delaying Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote.CALLER: Absolutely.RUSH: An added bonus is they get to destroy his character and reputation along the way, and, if they get away with this… I’m just gonna say it. If they get away with this, you can say good-bye to decent people wanting to find their way to Washington to spend any serious time. The only people gonna be left are gonna be deranged progressives running everything. Decent people aren’t gonna want any part of this. Decent people haven’t the slightest idea how to deal with this and don’t want to.CALLER: You’re absolutely right, Rush. And it’s really sad that our society has come to this level. But thank you for doing what you do. We’re with you, Brother.RUSH: Well, thank you. I appreciate it. That’s an interesting… I’ve never heard of “reasonable suspicion.” Reasonable doubt everybody’s heard of. Reasonable suspicion. It sounds like that was a mechanism that would allow for an agency to investigate something before a crime happened, you know, which a lot of people… When you’re talking about spousal abuse or bullying or this kind of thing… How often has your child been bullied or you have been abused as a spouse and you go to authorities and, “I can’t do anything unless something actually happens to you.”This sounds like it was a way to actually look into something before a serious event happened. “Reasonable suspicion.” Well, as he points out, this wouldn’t pass that test. That’s a great… There’s no reasonable suspicion here other than her coming forward 36 years later, and that’s not… There’s nothing… Well, there’s nothing reasonable, period. And that’s what has people so frosted here. Don, thank you again. Let’s see. Where are we headed next? Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. Well, Chesapeake, Virginia, next. Susan, great to have you. Welcome to the EIB Network. Hello.CALLER: Uh da da da da da da da da, as Elmer Fudd would say, dittos, Rush. I waited a long time to say that. But, yes. I needed to call because I also am one of those angry women who’s mad at the angry women because I was attacked when I was younger, 11 years old, by two boys, and I just wanted to say I can remember the exact place I was, every bit about the incident. And then a year later, one of the same boys attacked me again in a bathroom at a rec center and thankfully the janitor helped stop that situation. But, I can remember exactly that I was in a school, exactly where I was, and I have to say that my memory was 55 years ago because it happened when I was 11, and I’m now 66. So this woman saying that her repressed memories she just… You know, she’s just now coming out. My question was, in 2012, when she got the help and she knew he was a judge, why didn’t she do something when he was a big judge then? I just, it just baffles me.RUSH: Obviously. Well, because the rule in Washington is you can be a reprobate and be on the DC Circuit. But when it’s time to go to the Supreme Court to affect the balance, then that’s when the left is gonna step in and, if you’re not a reprobate, make up the fact that you are. One quick question with 30 seconds here. You say you remember everything about it. This woman claims she didn’t report it until 2012. And now they’ve got a bevy, they have an army of therapists saying, (paraphrasing) “Well, the fact that she can’t remember is probably the best proof we’re ever gonna have that it did happen, because the more traumatic something is, the more it is tended to be forgotten and suppressed.” So I think they’re saying in unison, (paraphrasing) “We ought to believe this woman precisely because she has no details.”CALLER: Well, if you look up some of what the clinical researchers say… Yesterday my husband was looking it up: 70% do not believe that repressed memories are valid. And he looked it up again today, and what he found out was that the 70% of research psychologists say that the —RUSH: I appreciate the call. I gotta go. I just saw the clock again. I’m up against it, but I do appreciate your taking the time.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/19/is-the-media-in-a-death-spiral/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 19, 2018RUSH: I have spent many, many moons on this program detailing for you what I think is an actual crack-up of the deep state and the media over this totally phony investigation into Trump and collusion with Russia.I’ve done my best to express how genuinely outrageous and beyond that it is, how unprecedented it is in terms of arraying the forces of the federal government against a singular person and presidential campaign and then presidency. We’re in the middle of it. We follow it each and every day; so the impact may be not as great as it should be. But this is a genuine abomination what is happening here, what has happened to Donald Trump for the past two years. I have a story here — actually, a column.It’s by Julie Kelly at AmGreatness.com, and the title of her piece: “Media Continues Its Slow Suicide,” and her opinion is that despite the appearance, despite how it looks on television every day that the media and their partners — their willing accomplices — are in the process of destroying themselves. They are destroying respectability. They are destroying their own credibility. They are in the process of literally a death spiral because of their contempt for Trump and their efforts to destroy a duly elected president.I realize a lot of you are not buying it. “That’s crazy. The media is not destroying itself! The media is only destroying Trump, only destroying Republicans. The media isn’t hurting itself.” I know it’s hard to see, and I know it doesn’t feel like the media is losing anything, and I know things look depressing. That’s by design. But the Drive-By Media and the Democrat Party are on the same desperate mission, and it is a death spiral fight for survival for them right now.They are slashing, splashing, smashing out, doing everything they can to save themselves. They do not run Washington. Donald Trump does. They are beside themselves that they haven’t been able to take him out. They’re beside themselves they haven’t been able to drive him out. They’re beside themselves that they have not been able to split you away from him, and they’re going more and more insane over their failures each and every day. The Woodward book. The Omarosa stuff!All of this has come out and Trump is still there, and he’s still leading, and he’s still dominating, and has a still triumphing. These questions got themselves talked into this business that they’re gonna win the House, they’re gonna win the Senate, they’re gonna impeach Trump. Today they’re gonna impeach Kavanaugh! If Kavanaugh gets confirmed, if they’re not able to stop him… This is from Eric Swalwell from California. (paraphrased) “If Kavanaugh gets confirmed and as expected, the Democrats win the House and Senate, then we’re gonna impeach Kavanaugh as well as impeach Trump!”They are convinced that what they are doing is lauded and being supported and applauded by the vast majority of the American people. They continue to conduct and publish what I think are crazy polls that they end believing, just like Hillary believed the polls that she was gonna win in a landslide. The latest polls that I saw is from Reuters/Ipsos and you know what it says? The American public is losing faith fast in Brett Kavanaugh.The American public may not support Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court! Well, that doesn’t matter, number one. But No. 2, I just refuse to believe that. I refuse to believe that a majority of the American people are watching what’s happening here and supporting it and applauding it. I think that there is so much disgust out there, I think there is so much outrage, I think people are livid at what they’re watching being done to Kavanaugh!After having seen it happen to Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork and after having seen this… Kavanaugh’s only getting now what Trump gets every day. Trump gets this every day and d I think people are fed up with it. I think a lot of people are fed up with it. I know the polls are out there, Democrats are gonna sweep this and that. But then something got in the way, folks. I don’t know if you’ve heard about this, but there was a shocking special election win by a Republican last night in Texas.Voters elected political newcomer Pete Flores to the Texas Senate on Tuesday, flipping a Democrat district red for the first time in 139 years and bolstering Republicans’ supermajority in the chamber ahead of November elections. Wait a minute. I thought Beto, whatever his name, was gonna beat Cruz, that the Texas Republicans were gonna lose Texas, the Senate, everything else, and Texas was on the verge of becoming a blue state! Why, that’s what all the polls say.Texas is in the middle of going like California and New York and so forth. And then this happened. This is a district that Hillary Clinton won. I forget the majority here,but it’s 73% black and Hispanic. It’s 23% white privilege, and they elected a Republican for the first time in 139 years. “A retired game warden, [Pete] Flores defeated former state and U.S. Rep. Pete Gallego for the Senate District 19 seat after receiving backing from some of the state’s most prominent politicians, including Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, and U.S. Sens John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. …“According the secretary of state’s website, Flores won with 53% of the vote, Gallego at 47%, there 44,487 ballots cast.” This wasn’t supposed to happen. Remember, Texas is going blue! This is a blue district in Texas that the Democrats have held for 139 years, and a Republican won it. How in the hell does that happen? Now, my overall point with this is that I think that Julie Kelly has a point. But I have to take a break, as always. We see right… And I really just get revved and ready and I get right to the sweet spot; then I look at the clock and go, “Damn it.”BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I have cited the work of Lee Smith several times. He’s worked at a website called, I think, Tablet. His work has appeared a lot of places. He’s done some of the best investigative work along with a lot of other people in uncovering the hoax and the scam that is the Steele Dossier, Papadopoulos, the entire lies, series of lies that Trump colluded with Russia.He has written a piece called “Extinction Level.” Well, it’s not what it’s called, but he describes in this piece what he says is an “extinction-level event” for the media. And it consists of much of what he has been reporting on, text messages between Strzok Smirk and Lisa Page; just the general collapse in trustworthiness that people have for some of these law enforcement institutions, DOJ, FBI, the intelligence community, and so forth.But Smith believes that the media’s in the process of literally crashing and burning here and sacrificing every bit of credibility and reputation they’ve ever had in service to the advancement of agenda, and that more people than ever before are now seeing what the media is and what it’s becoming. And as that continues to expand, they lose more and more credibility and believability. I know it’s hard to believe, but there are people out there actively who think this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Carmel, Indiana. Tracy, welcome. Glad you waited. You’re up next for the EIB Network. Hi.CALLER: Wow, Rush. What an honor.RUSH: Thank you!CALLER: Mega dittos from the great unwashed Midwest.RUSH: (laughing) Ha-ha-ha. Right where I’m from, by the way.CALLER: Absolutely. So, I was giving my daughter the CliffsNotes version on Brett Kavanaugh, and then I tuned in and you were talking about the media and how they’re all-in and they’re selling it and giving it all they got. And I just want some reassurance from you about what percentage of people do you think are buying that schlock? You know, a lot of people are disgusted about politics, they don’t want to hear about it anymore, but if we don’t pay attention, this stuff keeps going on.RUSH: Well, I don’t know.CALLER: So I just wonder, should we pay attention than not?RUSH: Well, let me answer this. The first thing I have to tell you that is that nothing, nowhere, no how, any ways, is going to change the way the media is doing, what it’s doing about this or any other story. They, in any number of public opinion polls, the media is like sitting there with 2 to 5% respect. It’s lower than Congress in many polls, just as an industry and as a business, as a political entity. The media doesn’t care. It’s the one business where they don’t give a rat’s rear end what the customer think because they have a disdain and a contempt for the customer. Look at CNN! CNN has been hemorrhaging audience for two years. They don’t care. It doesn’t matter to them.CALLER: I know. But I still see it on in my bank. When I go into the bank in the red county, in the red state where I live, I see CNN. I don’t get why there isn’t more of public outrage about it.RUSH: Well, we don’t know that there isn’t. The polling data is suggestive that people are not buying what they see. Look. This is a real tough one. It’s a tough thing to answer. That’s why, I’ve got this piece here that ran in American Greatness by Julie Kelly who thinks that the media, and she’s got some assists here from a column, great guy called Lee Smith. They think that the media is committing suicide specifically with the way they’ve been conducting business since the presidential campaign and after Trump was elected. But you don’t believe that, I can tell, ’cause you go into your bank and there’s CNN, you don’t see anybody committing suicide, you see ‘em still on the air.CALLER: Absolutely. And I’m really surprised there hasn’t been another major upstart of a conservative news outlet. I get Breitbart and all those things. I just mean besides Fox, I’m surprised nobody’s built a website like Twitter for conservatism.RUSH: Well, I… Look, I can only guess. I could only guess at that.CALLER: Well, I’m gonna get on and drive my school bus. I have to go. I’m so thrilled to talk to you, but I want to tell you thanks for the Rush Revere books. My homeschooled daughters have really enjoyed them; so thanks, and I hope they keep coming.RUSH: Well, thank you very much. You even said homeschool. You drive a school bus.CALLER: I did!RUSH: Awesome. Awesome. Well look, I’m glad you called, Tracy, thank you very much. Folks, I wish I had confident, comforting predictions about the media. What I know is that no matter how bad it gets for them, no matter how much audience they lose, no matter how much money their parent companies lose, they’re not gonna change. The last thing they’re gonna do.They’re gonna remain who they are and what they are and how they do it regardless, because they are a political entity in their own minds. They’re not a business entity. The people that work in media don’t care about profitability. In fact, most of them think that the news divisions of the companies for which they work ought not even be subject to bottom line consideration because they have a constitutional duty.And there should be any limits on money, and there shouldn’t be any profit pressures. But in terms of it affecting their content, it ain’t gonna happen. They’ll just keep playing people off, if they continue to lose money, but it’s not gonna have any kind of impact that you would expect any other business losing customers would adapt and change. Not the media. So however bad it gets for them, you’re really not gonna see the evidence of it because they’re gonna keep doing as they always have.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let me read to you just a couple of excerpts from Julie Kelly’s piece, “Media Continues its Slow Suicide.” Now, you’ve heard much of this from your host. Her uniqueness here is that she is predicting that all of this is gonna lead to the media imploding and destroying itself, and I’m just… I would love to tell you I agree with her about this. You know, there are a lot of people… During the Clinton years and all through Obama years I can remember the number of moralists, for example, on our side — good people — who wrote that Clinton doing this or Obama doing that or now the FBI, DOJ doing this is going to destroy the their collective reputations and so forth.And it didn’t happen. It was like these people were stuck in a period of time in the past where there was such a thing as public shame and that a reputation was subject to one’s own integrity or lack thereof. But people with no integrity and dishonesty who are able to pull that off in a likable way would keep getting away with it. Here you got a guy, Kavanaugh, who has an impeccable reputation and virtually every aspect of his life, every aspect. His reputation, character, unassailable — and now, where is it?What would you say they have done to his reputation? While Ted Kennedy kills a woman, has a habit of abusing and disrespecting women, abusing them sexually down here in Palm Beach with his nephew, William Kennedy Smith. Mary Jo Kopechne! What’d they do? They turn him into the lion of the Senate. He becomes one of the most respected, revered Democrats ever. Bill Clinton, ditto. Meanwhile, Clarence, there was never a shred of evidence he did anything that they said — and zilch, zero, nada for Kavanaugh — and yet look what happened to them.You want to tell me that there’s any justice in this? There isn’t any justice in this whatsoever. The left doesn’t care. They are happy! They’re more than happy to destroy people. They attempt it every day, depending on who they think is in their way. So, yeah, a lot of people over the years have expected the kind of behavior to come back and haunt these people and bite ’em in the rear.But the last I looked, Ted Kennedy passed away with glowing hero worship by everybody in the Democrat Party. You couldn’t get them to talk about his at all teammate of women, show any kind of disrespect for him whatsoever. Ditto with Bill Clinton — and the list on the Democrat side’s longer than just those two. So the belief that somehow there is a moral code that ends up meting out, handing out justice? I don’t think people believe that anymore.I don’t think people believe that there is a set of standards that define goodness and decency and that they triumph. I think what people are seeing is that indecency, perversion, lying, character assassination and assault are what is winning. They are the champions of political life in America today. So you can forgive people if they don’t believe that all of this is eventually gonna come back and bite people and hold them accountable. But here we have…Conrad Black is one of those people. Conrad Black is insistent that these people gonna pay a price they can’t even imagine paying, that the American people are gonna be the ones to let them know what a bunch of reprobates everybody think they are. Conrad Black has untold faith that this is gonna happen. So does Julie Kelly writing in American Greatness, and so does Lee Smith. Here’s an excerpt of what she’s written. You’ve heard much of this on this program.She says, “[T]here is a more sinister agenda behind this collective media cacophony: To hide their complicity in the biggest political scandal of all time, which included the weaponization of the nation’s most powerful government agencies to spy on a rival presidential campaign; the illegal leaking of classified information to friendly journalists to defame American citizens associated with the [Trump] campaign; and the sabotage of an incoming presidency, the media is happy to distract us with manufactured non-scandals that advance the political interests of their friends.”Look there’s been there’s no question, I believe the Mueller investigation is, in large part, a massive cover-up of the real crimes committed by the people that run that town — the Democrats, the media, people in the Washington establishment. That’s all to be covered up. They’re the ones that committed real crimes, and they continue to commit them against the Trump presidency. She continues here.“Each week, new details emerge about how the media seeded the Trump-Russia collusion hoax.” That has been uncovered, by the way. They ran… I’ll tell you how they did it. They ran a test program on this with the Iran nuclear program. They fed a bunch of journalists a bunch of garbage to see if they would repeat it and report it, and they did! They didn’t even question what they were being told!The Obama administration actually told a journalist that Russia was responsible for the destruction of a dam in Vermont, and the guy rehab the story. The dam has not been destroyed. It’s still functioning. So the Obama administration seeds journalists with a bunch of garbage just to see if they run it. So they ran it during the Iran nuclear deal news cycle; so they figure they could get away with leaking a bunch of stuff not true about Trump and collusion Russia — and they were right, because the media is a bunch of liberal Democrat sycophants!So she writes, “Each week, new details emerge about how the media seeded the Trump-Russia collusion hoax. High-level federal officials acting in bad faith schemed with reporters eager for a scoop to spin nefarious tales about the president and his aides. Some of the resultant articles were cited as evidence to persuade a secret court to allow the U.S. government to spy on private citizens.“Former FBI Director James Comey admitted he had a friend leak a copy of his internal memo to the press to help prompt the special counsel probe into Trump-Russia collusion.” This writer, Julie Kelly, thinks all this stuff is gonna come back and bite these people and sink them. And my question is, “With who? Who’s gonna sink ’em?” The American people? The American people, if they lose respect for the media, does that sink the media?I don’t think so because that’s already happened. What’s gonna sink the media? RICO lawsuits? (laughing) I don’t know! What’s gonna sink the media? What’s gonna shame these people? There ought to be piles and piles of shame over what is being done to Brett Kavanaugh. Dianne Feinstein should be ashamed. Chuck Schumer should be ashamed. These people ought to be literally embarrassed about what they’re doing!But they’re not.They’re patting each other on the back.They’re already throwing advance parties because they think they’re gonna delay this and win Senate and deny this nomination. They applauding each other on the back for subscribing a wonderful man and his family. They ought to be ashamed. They ought to have guilt complexes just bollixing them up so they’re unable to function! Most normal people wouldn’t be able to live with themselves pulling off stunts like this over and over and over again.“Well, it’s what the Republicans did! It’s what the Republicans did to Merrick Garland.” Republicans didn’t do anything of the sort to Merrick Garland! They just delayed the vote, that’s all, because it was an election year for which there was Democrat Party precedent? Thank you, Joe Biden.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/17/how-do-decent-people-deal-with-such-dastardly-attacks/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 17, 2018RUSH: Okay. So I have a question, folks. How are decent people ever prepared to deal with these kinds of never-ending allegations, destruction, perversion? I mean we’re dealing with a genuine sickness here with people on the left, and it’s not right. Something about them is just not right, and I was sitting here saying wondering. This never ends, and it’s getting worse and worse and worse. Decent people are blindsided by this stuff every time it happens, and there’s a reason for that. Decent people do not wallow in this kind of mire.Decent people are not calculating and plotting how to destroy people, how to ruin them. Decent people don’t do that. Decent people might get into arguments with people, try to find out how to win the argument or defeat a political opponent or whatever, but destroying people is not what decent people do. And, as such, decent people — it seems like — are always surprised. I myself, I have to tell you… Back during the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill situation. Back then, this program… Don’t misunderstand me.This program was it as far as opposition to the left was concerned. The only cable news network at the time of Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill was CNN, and they had a much larger audience than they have today. They went wall-to-wall with this, and this situation is almost identical! We’re gonna run through some of the parallels here. It’s almost identical! Almost identical. Particularly in terms of the timeline. I remember I was thinking about this and I was just livid when this happened.I was so mad, and I didn’t hide any of my anger. During the heat of the moment here, I had a Rush to Excellence Tour appearance in Tulsa, I believe. It was either Oklahoma City or Tulsa. I’m pretty sure it was Tulsa. And I spent the entire, almost 90% of the two-hour stand-up that I did on Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas. I was looking at people’s faces in the audience — and there were thousands, five or six thousand people there — and I could tell that some people were not even aware what I was talking about. Most were, but some weren’t.But I just remember being so livid, and I remember devoting every ounce of energy I had every day on this program to exposing what I knew was a pack of lies about Clarence Thomas. I did not know Clarence Thomas at the time. I had not met him. I only know who he was. I knew friends of his. I knew people that vouched for him. I knew that no allegation like this had ever been made about him. What I learned about Anita Hill, what I learned about all this was this was just a Democrat trick.It was the next stage of Borking that was started by Robert Bork, and it was interesting to me to get introspective and go back and relive it. So we’re talking 1990, thereabouts, and I was remembering just how wired I was every day here and I was fit to be tied. I was just livid. After the Borking thing, I was hell-bent on blowing the Democrats up. I was hell-bent on exposing them for what they were doing — and Judge Thomas ended up being confirmed. But then what happened after that?What happened after that is that we got a series of books, a series of television miniseries, and a couple years ago an actual HBO movie reliving Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill. And every book and every television series and the HBO movie is devoted to the lie that Clarence Thomas was guilty. So even if Kavanaugh survives this, he has the rest of his life to look forward to being smeared every year. There will be books by Jane Mayer or somebody taking her place.HBO will come up with a movie at some point, and when a young generation is about to come of age, that’s when HBO or somebody like them will do their movie to inform them of what a reprobate Brett Kavanaugh is. Because the left doesn’t stop in their efforts to destroy people with whom they just disagree. Judge Kavanaugh hasn’t done anything to anybody, other than his job, other than render rulings as a judge from various courts on which he has sat.He hasn’t done anything to anybody. He’s a decent person. It’s obvious he’s a decent person. He may define what a decent person is. He may be the epitome of decency. Same thing for his family. Yet here comes the left targeting — once again — another decent human being who happens to be Republican and conservative for utter destruction. Ruin his career, ruin his reputation, ruin his life and all of those who speak up and try to defend him. How do decent people deal with this?I’m not just talking about Kavanaugh. How do you? How do I? How does anybody? How do any of us in what I consider to be the decent people population of this country, deal with this? My point is we’re never prepared for this because we don’t wallow in it. Even I, who was livid, who was devoted during the Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill scenario defending him, to beating back whatever little bit I could do here. I was committed. Yet I was caught off guard by this Kavanaugh thing last week when DiFi brings it up!I should have been expecting them to do something, but I wasn’t. We thought Kavanaugh was nearing the vote; he was gonna sail through and be confirmed despite the Democrats’ efforts. How stupid are we? Now, some of you may have seen it coming. I can’t speak for all of you. I’m only speaking for myself. I didn’t see it coming, and I should have! But then I started to asking, “Why did I miss it?” The reason I missed it is because I don’t wallow in this stuff. I don’t sit around and wait.I’m not trying to calculate when somebody’s gonna come out of the woodwork and try to destroy somebody else. Even though I’ve been the target of these kinds of efforts. My point is that decent people do not spend their time in this kind of mind-set. Who wants to? And this is something else that the left takes advantage of. I mean, where to start with this? The parallels between this and Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill are stunning. But let’s… Before doing that — and maybe even instead of doing that — let’s just recap with recent history.Last Thursday we were under the impression that Kavanaugh had withstood what everybody knew was gonna be an onslaught and an attempt, if not to derail him, to put a cloud over him so that everything he does the rest of his life is now questioned by the media and the American left. Make no mistake: Even if he gets on the court, that is going to continue. This guy’s life as he’s known it is over just like Justice Thomas’ was. Last Thursday we were told that Kavanaugh’s accuser didn’t want to go public.We were told that she didn’t want to be named. We were told that she didn’t want to Senator Feinstein to pursue anything. How do we know this? Because Senator Feinstein told us. Then we found out that Senator Feinstein had had this letter from this constituent of hers for months, dating all the way back to the early summer — and Dianne Feinstein, senator from California, sat on it and didn’t do anything with it, presumably because the accuser didn’t want anything done with it.I have to tell you, when I heard that, I said, “Well, then, why send the letter?” If the accuser doesn’t want to be named, if the accuser doesn’t want to make an issue of it, if the accuser doesn’t want to go forward, then why the hell send the letter to a United States senator, for crying out loud? But despite all that, we were told that she didn’t want to pursuing anything. We all believed it! See, that’s the thing. Decent people believe what they’re told no matter what. We ought not believe a single thing they say!Because if this woman did not want this taken any farther, then the Democrats are betraying her — and I don’t believe the Democrats are betraying her. I think she is part of a cabal doing everything they can to stop Kavanaugh or, if they can’t stop him, to cast such a cloud. They want to delay the vote ’til after the midterms. The Senate might flip Democrat, which would change everything. This is what they’re thinking.Now, that’s politics. That I can understand. Destroying somebody who’s not…? Just outright destroying, which is what they do. Anyway, after last Thursday learning that Kavanaugh’s accuser didn’t want to go public, didn’t want Senator Feinstein to pursue anything, we now learn that she had already scrubbed all of her social media so none of her partisan activities could be found. (interruption) What do you mean, “What partisan activities?” I’ll tell you who she is.None of this means she’s not telling the truth. This is the thing. Nobody knows. That’s what’s so dastardly about this. Nobody knows. “Kavanaugh Accuser Is [A Typical] Unhinged [Deranged] Liberal Professor who Former Students Describe as Dark, Mad, Scary and Troubled. Her name is Christine Blasey. She “spent all weekend” shredding her online activities, Facebook and Twitter accounts and all this.She “scores a 2.9 in competency from former students on the Rate My Professor website. The student reviews are brutal and suggest she has severe psychological problems.” She had already obtained the services of another radical left-wing Democrat Party lawyer, somebody named Katz. I didn’t know the name when I first heard the name but when I saw this woman on TV, this woman’s on TV constantly as a Democrat activist lawyer. She’s already hired an ex-FBI agent to give her a lie detector test which the Washington Post claimed that she passed with flying colors.And she had arranged to have a counselor release notes of her sessions in 2012 where she finally divulged the trauma of this incident that happened in high school and has led to posttraumatic stress disorder and all. Now, why didn’t any of this come out during the hearing? Feinstein knew about it. Why didn’t any of this surface, particularly when you had Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski out there looking for any excuse whatsoever to vote against this guy? Let’s be honest.They were looking for any excuse to vote “no,” any #MeToo excuse, any sexist excuse, any pro-abortion excuse — any excuse they could look for — and there wasn’t any. The left got so panicked they began to do things that offended Susan Collins, and she began to say so. Why didn’t this stuff come out when there were two Republicans willing, two Republican women willing to vote against Kavanaugh? Why didn’t this stuff surface then? And I have a theory. I have a theory.I think they’re rolling the dice big time on this. Because what has to happen now is this woman has to come before the Senate committee and testify, which her lawyer and she herself are saying that she’s willing to do. But today, tomorrow? They have to be brought to town, they have to sit and they have to be interviewed. They have to testify this afternoon, tonight, or tomorrow. If they don’t, if they refuse, then we’re gonna know what’s up here.If she refuses to come tell this story and unburden herself, if she refuses to help the United States Senate Judiciary Committee figure out just who it is that’s been nominated — if she’s got this story and if it’s the truth and she refuses to come here this week — then we’re gonna know quite a bit about what the real motivation is, which we already do. And I think the Democrats and all of her sponsors are rolling the dice that that’s not gonna happen. I think they’ve waited ’til the last minute because they don’t want this woman on public display, for whatever reasons.I think they fear that this outrageous charge would be seen for what it is. I think she… I think they’re afraid. I think the Democrats didn’t bring this up any time before today, last week, because this is the only time it will work, when there isn’t sufficient time to actually hear from her before any vote. And, by the way, right on schedule, here comes the loyal and devoted Jeff Flake — the outgoing senator from Arizona — claiming there’s no reason we should hurry into this vote.This guy has got Trump Hatred Syndrome just oozing out of every pore in his body and his epidermis. This guy is so governed by his hatred of Donald Trump that anything he can do to derail what Trump wants, he will do — including participate in a bogus procedure to destroy a decent person. There isn’t a soul in the world outside of this woman who has ever said anything even close to this about Brett Kavanaugh. The women who have worked with Kavanaugh have all lauded him in just the opposite terms.When this woman was made public in her allegations are made public, 65 went who went to high school with Kavanaugh and have worked with him immediately wrote a letter claiming all this had to be untrue. This can’t be the guy they knew and know. This letter writer, this woman has to be confused, they said. We’ve got one woman the Democrats do not want anybody to see under oath, obviously, versus everybody else who’s ever known the man.And we’re on the verge of derailing a decent guy with an impeccable resume, with impeccable qualifications simply because the American left and the Democrat Party don’t like him. And because of that, they now have to destroy him. It’s the only way they can keep him off the court is to literally destroy him. Even if they have to use lies and innuendo. So, once again, we’re faced with exactly what Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill was. The seriousness of the charge versus nature of the evidence. The nature of the evidence here is very thin. The seriousness of the charge, #MeToo movement, pretty big. So they’ve rolled the dice that they’re gonna be able to accomplish this without any further testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let’s go to the phones and see what people want to weigh in about this.We’ll start in San Francisco. Jim, great to have you. Always love getting calls from out there. How are you doing, sir?CALLER: I’m the only one, Rush. (laughing) I’m the only conservative.RUSH: Ha-ha-ha! You’re not that alone. You can’t be that alone.CALLER: I fight the best fight that I can. But here, Rush, I really think Kavanaugh is done. I’ve been racking my mind through this and I don’t see a situation, any scenario where it plays out in our favor and simply because all you gotta do is flip one Republican and then the other Democrats will fold, and then it’s a 50-50 vote. I just can’t imagine even an unproven “he said, she said” in this era of #MeToo isn’t gonna completely peel off at least one, maybe even two Democrat votes.Corker and Flake are there are indicating that they’re gonna vote “no,” and then you got Collins and Murkowski. I just don’t see how it’s gonna go. You flip one of them, all the Dems go. And Rush, I was gonna point out, you know, Republicans need to get in the mud and play hardball. I think these Republican senators still have this idea that they’re the courtly gent, “my friend across the aisle,” those old rules still apply.RUSH: Some of them do. Some of them do. What you’re dealing with with Corker and Flake is sheer Trump hatred. That’s what’s governing their behavior. They know exactly what they’re doing. The personal animus, I couldn’t believe — and I’m really, you know, getting close to the edge when I say this. I couldn’t believe what people allowed the McCain funeral to become for the same reason: This irrational hatred for Donald Trump, what he’s done, what he means, the fact that he won. That’s why Corker is doing what he’s doing. Same thing with Flake. Flake couldn’t even win reelection. He’s gone. He’s leaving. Collins is not gone yet, Jim. Collins is out criticizing the way the Democrats are doing this. She’s got a bigger set than Jeff Flake’s got if you get my drift.CALLER: Republicans need to be getting down in the mud, and I tell you what, Rush. You know, they need to be using these same tactics. Where are Republicans? They should have been hiring private investigators to look at Mueller when he was in junior high school. I’ll bet the kid was a bully! You know, they should be looking at every single Democrat that’s up for election and going back to high school because that’s fair game now, and when things are peaceful with the Democrats, that’s when they need to be digging up dirt and smacking ’em in the face with it.They need to keep punching a guy when he’s on the ground until he’s done and dead. That’s the bottom line. The only one that knows this is Trump. That’s the only Republican that knows what we’re up against and how to fight back. He’s been giving us how to do it for two years and Republicans just aren’t catching on ’cause they’re naive little… You know, they think themselves above this kind of stuff. Well, guess what? If you fight gentlemanly, you’re gonna get your butt kicked.RUSH: I agree with that, but I still don’t think that’s what’s going on. I don’t think they’re that naive. I just think they’re scared to death of the media. They live in Washington; that’s where the media is. I think they’re afraid of what the media’s gonna say about them next. They don’t want to be Kavanaugh’d. They don’t want to be Borked. They’ve all gotta get reelected. Probably a combination of both. I think the courtly, gentlemanly, “I am a United States senator and there is decorum here and we…”Sure. I’m sure that they tell themselves they’re doing the right thing by playing in that regard. But look, let me run one other mitigating factor by you. You say — a lot of people agree with you — let’s go out and dig up some dirt on pick your name. Mueller? “I’ll bet he was a bully when he was in school! I wonder how many women accused him? I wonder how many women they’ve abused.” I’m not opposed to it, I’m just telling you it’s gonna be ignored or covered up by the media. The media isn’t gonna help you expose whatever it is you find. In fact, they’re gonna set out and try to destroy you for daring to bring it up.CALLER: Well, you know what? They will. They will. But it doesn’t matter. It’s open warfare. This is why Trump keeps doing what he was because he realizes this is the only way to fight. Trump, by the way, is the only guy the media can’t ignore. When the president of the United States tweets something, they can’t ignore that. So he kind of has the upper hand on it. But, yeah, you’re right. I mean, he’s got all these things.You got the deep state, you got the lower courts lined up against you, you’ve got the media lined up against you, the legislature. Every aspect is lined up against you. But playing it by the rules trying to appease them? They hate you anyway. There’s nothing you’re gonna do to make them not like you. So you just have to fight. If we go down, I want to be the little mouse giving the finger to the eagle that’s about to eat me.RUSH: Right. (chuckles)CALLER: I don’t want to be sitting hiding under a rock.RUSH: Yeah, I agree. I just don’t think we have that many warriors in elected office on the Republican side. We just don’t. But, you know, it’s fascinating too. If you listen to Michael Moore right now, Michael Moore thinks… Now, this to me is fascinating psychologically. Michael Moore literally believes the Democrats are losing everything. Just because Trump won and continues to stay in office as far as Moore — and I think this is true of a lot of Democrats, Jim.No matter how much they succeed with Kavanaugh, they still think they’re losing ’cause they haven’t gotten rid of Trump. So Michael Moore says that he spent two hours with Steve Bannon. Stick with me on this ’cause I want to get your reaction. Michael Moore thinks that he had a revelation talking to Steve Bannon. He said he asked Bannon, “How did you pull this off?“You’ve got a genuine idiot — or a guy that tries to come off as an idiot who’s never been in politics — who wins the presidency. How did you guys do this?” Michael Moore said that Bannon said, “This is easy. You guys do pillow fights and we take head shots.” Now, Jim, do you think that Bannon is right? Do the Republicans take head shots? Do they go for head shots with people and the Democrats are out there just fighting pillow fights?CALLER: No. I think it’s the reverse.RUSH: That was Michael Moore’s view. Michael Moore thinks the Democrats are a bunch of wusses, don’t have the guts to fight Trump, and yet you and many of us think the same thing about our side.CALLER: I actually… This might surprise you, Rush, but I actually don’t mind Michael Moore so much because he is what he is. He shows who he is, what he’s about, and I think the guy genuinely is honest about his curiosity about Republicans. I mean, I disagree with everything he is about. But I actually kind of respect him a little bit because of his honesty. What I think —RUSH: I think you’re just falling for the fact that he wears baseball caps to make himself look like he’s from Flint, Michigan.CALLER: Yeah. He occasionally comes through San Francisco too. But I just think that the Republicans, it’s the duplicitous, sneaky Democrats, the ones like Dianne Feinstein, who plays this nice… You know, she’s from San Francisco. You know, I had a lot of respect for Dianne Feinstein as a middle-of-the-road liberal. For a lot years I had respect for her. I started losing it, you know, more recently. But it’s the sneaky ones that we have to realize and they’re not taking pillow shots. They’re taking head shots. And Republicans need to start not just taking head shots. They need to be kicking-in-the-nuts kind of shots.RUSH: Right.CALLER: They need to be getting down and dirty, into the mud, and I think they should start with Bob Mueller. I think that guy’s a bully. My instincts, I bet you, are dead on. I bet that guy was absolutely a bully in high school — and guess what, Rush? Anything puberty on is now fair game.RUSH: It would seem so, especially on the right. Okay, Jim. I’m really glad you called. I could continue this but I have to take a brief time-out. But just to reiterate, I find it fascinating that left-wing activists think their party is as big a bunch of wusses as we think ours are. Now, in their case it’s all because they haven’t been able to get rid of Trump and they’re mad that no Democrat, nobody has found a way to stand up to Trump and make Trump stop what he’s doing. So they’re a bunch of wusses.We think our guys are a bunch of wusses for the reasons that you gave.Anyway, it’s all fascinating.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: “Sen. Collins Criticizes Democrats’ Handling of Christine Blasey Ford’s Accusations…” Jeff Flake didn’t and Corker didn’t. Susan Collins, Senator Collins has suggested that they both show up and testify. Look, that’s the only way to deal with this. I mean, you might say, “Why should Kavanaugh? He already has! They didn’t bring any of this up.” Nah, it’s come up. She could be… There could be something to this. We can’t reject it out of hand no matter (chuckles) what your common sense and your political instincts tell you.If she’s serious, get her up to that committee today. Get her there tonight. Get her there for testimony tomorrow. Kavanaugh will go. He’s already said he’ll go anywhere, answer any question whatsoever. The White House is standing by him. So get her in there. Get the accuser in there. If the accuser refuses to show up before the committee vote, which is scheduled for Thursday, or was, then that will carry quite a message. If she’s unwilling to show up so that the vote can go off as planned, then this is all about delay.The delay they want to make ’til after the midterms ’cause they believe they’re gonna win the Senate, they believe they’re gonna win the House, and they can stop Trump from nominating somebody that they don’t want to confirm, i.e., somebody like Kavanaugh. If they win the House and Senate then they’re gonna start on impeachment proceedings, and (in their dreams) are gonna get rid of Trump in six months. So that’s what this is about, and if this woman refuses…Here’s the thing to look at. If she’s got the goods, if she can prove irrefutably — and I’m told, folks, that she can’t even remember the exact date this happened. I got an email from a woman today who said that she was a victim of attempted rape in high school, college. She remembers everything about it. This is her point in the email. Thirty-five years ago, 40 years. She remembers everything about it like it was yesterday. Attempted rape is a traumatic, terrifying thing. You remember. But this woman can’t pinpoint the year, the date. She’s not sure. She gives a date range from what I understand.But if… If she’s got incontrovertible evidence that could destroy the nomination, why wouldn’t she want to be up there this past July? Why did they hold off on this? As I’ve said, I think the Democrats know that what they have here is probably not slam dunk for whatever reason. But if they think they’ve got whatever it takes to destroy this nomination, wouldn’t she want to be here today or tonight or tomorrow and seal the guy’s fate once and for all?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So Breitbart says today that Kavanaugh’s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, wore one of those vagina hats at anti-Trump march. So she’s one of those. The legal adviser, her lawyer, Katz, Debra Katz, is a big-time Democrat donor and has spoken in defense of Clinton and Al Franken. So clearly the hypocrisy is running rampant. But this is politically a repeat of the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill scenario. It’s a hail Mary.  "

Let’s all admit it. They were hoping for disaster. They wanted it to validate their politics-based hysteria on something like the weather. See, a Category 5 hurricane would be seen as validation for global carbon taxes, massive regulatory control of the economy, and getting rid of Trump. You could blame Trump for a Category 5 hurricane. Thing is, Trump’s a Category 5 every day anyway, so what would be the big deal?JOHNNY DONOVAN: And now, from sunny south Florida, it’s Open Line Friday!RUSH: “Mr. Limbaugh, don’t you feel the slightest bit hesitant making these kinds of charges?” No, I don’t, folks.

The headline: “Media Politicize Florence, Blame Trump for Storms, Predict Mass Death.” Subheadline: “Trump is ‘actively making the problem worse.'” Subhead: Limbaugh assisting Trump making the problem worse.Trump and I both said to be complicit in Hurricane Florence because, you know why, Rachel? Because we don’t agree with climate change, and since we don’t agree with climate change having an impact on this, then we are responsible for people who may not be leaving. Oh. That’s another thing.

That the hurricane is weather, in fact, and that there are meteorological explanations for everything that’s happening. There are statistics galore that indicate the severity. In fact, the 36 — ready for this? — the 36 most damaging, strongest storms since 1940 have decreased in intensity while at the same time we have been told they should be increasing in intensity because we are polluting our atmosphere with CO2s, creating the greenhouse effect.It’s like pretty much everything else. I’m approaching that point where I don’t know what to do about this. Everything they’re saying is not true. Pretty much everything they pass off as fact isn’t true. What do you do with this? How do you reach people who are soaking all this up and accepting it and believing it? I mean, it’s been the challenge of this program since it began. It’s been the challenge of conservative media since 30 years ago.But as they go on, they are getting even more extreme, less connected to the truth. And it’s almost on purpose. It’s as though they know the truth is damaging to their assertions. And when it comes to climate change, I need to make this point again. The storms are decreasing in intensity. They are occurring less frequently. I mean, we went 10 years without a major hurricane hitting the United States coastline. We’ve had global temperatures declining. Why aren’t they claiming credit for this?They’ve been out there demanding policies, and there have been policies implemented because of their demands. Why aren’t they claiming credit for this progress? Why aren’t they claiming credit? Why instead do they want to lie? Why do they have to lie about things that are demonstrably not true? And the answer to that is politics.The Democrats today want us to believe that Brett Kavanaugh was a high school bully. At age 17, he locked a girl in a room that she was able to get out of. When he was 17. This is something like 35 years ago. The Democrats are making fools of themselves except the Drive-By Media is joining them in this effort to destroy Kavanaugh. It is almost a redux of the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas scenario.So the media, the Democrats want you to believe that Brett Kavanaugh and Mitt Romney also, high school bullies. Remember they ran a story on Romney that he beat up some kid at a prep school because he didn’t like his hairstyle or some such thing. I don’t remember what it was. Meanwhile, Democrats who have actually murdered and sexually abused women are celebrated and lifted to the top of the Democrat star ranks, Teddy Kennedy and Bill Clinton.Kavanaugh locks a girl in high school in a room? How many of you have not pulled high school pranks? If I spent some time here detailing my high school pranks — we’ve done this over the years, but it’s been many, many moons since I have described some of the things I did. I loved it. In fact, I took some of those pranks to the radio as a struggling young disc jockey way back in the early days. I mean, this is just absurd. I feel like it’s crazy to even address this stuff and try to refute it point by point because it feels — I don’t know — worthless. Because it keeps happening.There’s not a single thing to stop these people from their abject lies. There’s another example out there today. Nikki Haley, as you know, is our ambassador to the United Nations. When Susan Rice was our ambassador to the United Nations, she lived in the 35th floor, 50th floor, whatever, way up there in the Waldorf Towers. Now, for those of you who don’t know, the Waldorf “Hysteria” hotel on Park Avenue is one of New York’s greatest of all time.And right next to it, in fact part of it, is something called Waldorf Towers. They are apartments, condominiums that you can rent as a home for any length of time that you want. They routinely go for something like $135,000 a week, sometimes, depending on the size, $135,000 a month. That’s where Susan Rice lived. Susan Rice lived at Waldorf Towers. The federal government paid an exorbitant amount of money for her to live there. Many actors who are doing stints on Broadway stay there.I was at Waldorf Towers one day. I had a meeting up there, believe it or not, with CNN people way, way back. And the head honcho at CNN happened to be staying there. So that’s where I had to go for a meeting with CNN. I come out of the meeting room — well, the apartment, and there’s Tom Selleck. Tom Selleck is staying there. He was playing somebody on Broadway. So he stops, says hi, says, “Fancy seeing you here.” I said, “I could say the same thing.” It was 4 o’clock in the afternoon, he was on the way to his gig on Broadway.Anyway, the point is that while Susan Rice was living there, they ordered something like 75,000 or $50,000 of new drapes and $35,000 of motors to open and close them! But they didn’t happen to arrive and be installed until Nikki Haley moved in, so Nikki Haley is being blamed.And even that little Camera Hogg kid from the school down in Parkland, the little Camera Hogg kid’s out there tweeting that she is making irresponsible appropriations while people are being shot and while people are starving and while people are being destroyed by hurricanes and so forth. The story has been corrected.The truth of the story is out there that Obama’s administration is the one that ordered the exorbitant drapes and was paying the exorbitant price. Nikki Haley’s saying her rent is nowhere near what the Obama Regime was paying for Susan Rice, and yet it’s all over the media. The media knows the truth and refuses to withdraw it. The media refuses to correct it. They’re running the story that Nikki Haley and Trump ordered this massively expensive set of drapes and motors to open and close them when it all happened during the Obama administration!They didn’t even know it.Nikki Haley and her crew didn’t even know it ’til the installation crew shows up one day and said, “Okay, we got these curtains now; it’s time to put them in.” What does that say about it that you order curtains and two years later they show up to be installed? Anyway, the truth is that Nikki Haley had nothing to do with the expenditure. She didn’t even know anything about it. And everybody reporting this knows that they are lying through their teeth, that this is a Trump-Nikki Haley exorbitance and that it illustrates how they don’t care about the little guy.In the midst of this hurricane devastating people, Nikki Haley saw fit to install 55- or 75- (or whatever it is) thousand-dollar curtains in her temporary home ’cause nobody stays at Waldorf Towers. Well, I guess there are people that live there. I don’t know. They’re basically apartment rentals, but… (interruption) Are they worth a hundred thousand…? Well, it’s like anything else. It’s where it is. It’s Waldorf Towers. There’s nothing in there that sets it apart from any other luxurious place. I mean, the price is not… Not that I recall, anyway.Hell, you know, there are New York businesses that keep apartments at Waldorf Towers for visiting clients from out of town who want “company.” Ahem. Ahem. Waldorf Towers. You have your standing… I was offered one once way back when I first became an investor. (interruption) Oh, yeah. Anyway, that’s just one of many examples, and here you’ve got Donald Trump fighting every day pushing back against all this. And as he pushes back, they ratchet up the fact that he’s the one lying and can’t tell the truth.This ridiculous controversy over number of people died in the aftermath of the Puerto Rico hurricane? This is classic! This is pure politics. We have a computer model used by experts at George Washington University claiming 3,000 people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. There isn’t any evidence of it. It’s just a bunch of experts and their computer models, and Trump is accusing them of making it up, of a nobody that isn’t real, that the Democrats are behind it to make him look bad. He’s exactly right.But now, because this involves Puerto Rico, you’ve got down here in Florida… You’ve got Rick Scott who’s running for the Senate, Ron DeSantis running for governor. They’re having to distance themselves from Trump on his claim here that he’s not responsible for 3,000 people dying. That’s what the Democrats and the media are saying, that Trump didn’t care enough, didn’t do enough after the hurricane in Puerto Rico; so 3,000 people died because Trump doesn’t care. Trump’s saying, “The hell with these peopling! I’m not gonna sit here.”It’s standard operating procedure for him. You lie about him and he pushes back. Well, because of a lot of Puerto Rican residents in Florida — Puerto Rican people in Florida and friends of Puerto Ricans here — Ron DeSantis running for governor and Rick Scott running for the Senate have had to kind of distance themselves from Trump on this. Not because they disagree with him, but because the media is hammering this, and these guys can’t take the chance.They’re gonna have to go with the flow, they’re gonna have to go with what the conventional wisdom is, and that is that 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico — when they didn’t — and that Trump may be responsible. So these guys have to distance themselves just to show the Puerto Rican voters here in Florida that they’re not anti-Puerto Rico. Just absurd. Just make these claims, 3,000 people after…? Can somebody name me a single hurricane where 3,000 people died?(interruption) Galveston, Texas. When was that? It was 1900. I think there’s another hurricane where 7,000 people died way back. You do have to go back 75 years where we didn’t have nearly the kind of warning systems that we have today to get people out of there. We didn’t have nearly the kind of tech recovery, any number of things. “Well, they didn’t in Puerto Rico, either, Rush, because Trump didn’t care. Trump didn’t care.” We were the only nation that did go down there. We’re the only ones that did try to assist. So the Democrats…When I mentioned earlier… You know, I hate doing this. I really do because I know how it sounds to some people. I told you earlier in the week this storm was not going to hit as it was predicted to, not because of anything other than that’s the way it always is. It’s tough to predict these things far out. As a hurricane expert here, there are only two of them in my memory since 1997 that, if they were forecast to hit you say Category 3 or 4, they did. Most of them become much weaker where they get where they’re going to hit.And the track changes constantly. You can’t deny that earlier this week, “It’s Category 4! Maybe Category 5!” We even had a guy saying it was gonna be so bad, we may need to have a new category, Category 6, because of Trump and because he doesn’t believe in climate change. And when I happened to remind people, “There’s a good chance this thing might weaken. There’s a good chance it’s not gonna go where they say right now,” I was lambasted all over TV as the irresponsible, because I was not following the mandated government-speak on what the hurricane was gonna do.Meanwhile, everybody else in the Drive-Bys? It was sick. They were excited by it because of the politics of everything, because everything has been politicized. This ongoing, expanding hatred (which is just an outright poison) that they have for Trump is causing them to distort what is already a dangerous level of hatred that they harbor. The hatred’s fully on display in this Kavanaugh circumstance. Even Ruth “Buzzi” Ginsburg has essentially said this is enough. You know, she loved Antonin Scalia. He loved her.They spent New Year’s Eve together. They liked opera. It was odd to a lot of people, but they were best buds. She said (paraphrased), “You know, he was confirmed 98-nothing. That’s the way it always should be.” She was confirmed by a similar high number. Democrat numbers when they’re nominated generally get confirmed by a decent number. Pretty much every Republican nominee they try to destroy, try to ruin. Clarence Thomas, Robert Bork, Kavanaugh. They tried to destroy Alito. They tried to do some damage to Roberts but they didn’t have much success there.But this business with Kavanaugh? he locked a girl in a room in high school, 35 years ago, 17-year-old and she got out? How seriously could it have been? He’s categorically denying it, by the way. Dianne Feinstein’s had this letter from this anonymous studied all these years, didn’t do anything about it. Yeah, months. Oh, and the FBI has declined to investigate (chuckling) because there’s nothing to investigate. But they’re trying to create this gigantic cloud.The left is also so upset they have not been able to move Susan Collins into voting “no,” that they sent her a giant cardboard cutout of male genitalia. Three-foot-long male genitalia cardboard cutout to try to intimidate her into voting against Kavanaugh and claim… (interruption) Well, I’ll tell you what do you mean, “What’s the symbolism of it?” The symbolism you’ve got a three-foot-long cardboard cutout of male genitalia.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Minor correction. I misspoke when I said that there had been no major hurricanes in 10 years. I meant in a 10-year period. We had two major hurricanes last year, Harvey and Irma. It was 2006 through 2016, 11 years that we had no Category 3 or greater hurricanes striking land in the United States. In 2016, right in the middle of massive climate change, massive carbon dioxide pollution, and all that. My point is, why not take credit for their policies working instead of getting mad? And the answer is politics.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/09/seething-with-jealousy-bill-and-hillary-launch-stadium-tour/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 9, 2018RUSH: Have you ever heard, ladies and gentlemen, that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour? Bill and Hilary want to get in on all this Trump action. Now, I’ve been wondering how long it was gonna be until somebody in the Democrat Party tried this. Trump’s rallies dating back to the 2016 campaign…Do not doubt me on this, either.The Democrats and the media publicly acted unconcerned, uninterested, and would always say a variation of, “You can’t judge voter interest on the basis of rallies! You can’t predict how people are gonna vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies! These Trump rallies are not telling us anything. It doesn’t mean anything. These are just rabid people upset with their lives, and they think Trump I’m gonna kick all the people out of the country they don’t like. It’s nothing. It’s not anywhere near representative of the population.”This is what they all said at every Trump rally. Privately… Do not doubt me. Privately they were jealous as they could be, and they were seething because there’s not a one of them on the Democrat side who could come anywhere close to equaling that kind of excitement, that kind of loyalty, and those size crowds. Obama couldn’t do it. Not in 2016. Hillary couldn’t do it ever! But certainly not in 2016. She couldn’t draw flies to her book-signing ceremonies!Hillary Clinton couldn’t draw a crowd anywhere! People knew she might not be able to stand up for a full 25 minutes without some aide coming out to prop her up by the elbows. But seriously, I guarantee you they were looking those crowds, they were looking at those Trump rallies, and they would never say so publicly, but they were scared to death by ’em. They would never say so publicly. They would never admit it publicly. They would say just the opposite.But they’re human beings, and any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty, that equals jealousy and envy and anger and all things that attach to jealousy and envy. They hated Trump to begin with. And the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down, the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn’t, just in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign, interested in the candidacy.And those rallies, 20,000, 15, 25,000, as many people lined up outside who couldn’t get in, wanted to get in. Trump with his airplane perfectly placed so that “Trump” in giant letters on the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas. So I’ve been wondering how long it’s gonna be before somebody on the Democrat side triest to get in on this action. And I always thought…You know who I thought it would be that would make the first stab at trying it? Joe Biden. I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy to try to replicate this. Then I thought maybe Michelle (My Belle) Obama. But then I thought, “No, they’ve got too much to lose if it doesn’t work.” Maybe Kamala Harris. Maybe… But somebody’s gonna do this. Somebody’s got to try it. They’ve got to be able to show… The Democrats are thinking, they’ve gotta show that there’s as much excitement, as much loyalty, as much attention as Trump can draw.Up ’til now, nobody on the Democrat side has even given it a prayer. Until the Clintons. The Daily Wire has the story: “Washington power couple, Bill and Hillary Clinton, announced Monday that they’re embarking on a nationwide ‘stadium tour,’ bringing their stage show to 13 cities this fall. ‘An Evening with President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’…” That’s the actual title of the show.It “will feature the pair sharing ‘stories and inspiring anecdotes that shaped their historic careers in public service, while also discussing issues of the day and looking toward the future…’ The tour, sponsored by Live Nation (which is also hosting a stadium tour for former First Lady Michelle Obama), begins in Las Vegas on Sunday, November 18 — after the midterm elections — and criss-crosses the country, ending in Los Angeles next April. Tickets go on sale Friday, October 12, but they aren’t cheap.“If you want to see the Clintons’ ‘joint speaking tour’ at the Park Theater in Las Vegas, for example, the cheapest seats will run you just a little over $70 each. Where the pair are more in demand, like Boston, seats start at $120 and can cost as much as $745.50. The tour, oddly enough, will not make stops in Wisconsin, an interesting oversight given Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential campaign plan also missed the state. Hillary will, however, finally visit Pennsylvania and Michigan.” I’m telling you what’s going on here.They’re seething with jealousy. Bill and Hillary, on those rare moments when they’re home at the same time and together, they sit there, and they look at these Trump rallies… Don’t doubt me. They do. They look at ’em, they watch them, and they just sit there and they say to each other (impression), “Uh, I can’t believe it. I just…. Hillary, I can’t… I can’t. You know, I thought we were popular back in the 90s, and we couldn’t draw crowds like this if we’d ever tried to.“We could have done that. Hell, we could have done it better than Trump’s. Can you believe this?” And they start talking about getting in on it and doing their own stadium tour. So they call Live Nation, which is a rock music promo agency and ticket seller and so forth. Does anybody think…? Including on the Democrat side, is anybody excited about this? (interruption) You think the Democrat Party’s excited? The Democrat Party…Oh, folks, I am here to tell you this is the last thing they want is Hillary and Bill Clinton running around as the presumed front-runners for 2020, ’cause that’s what this is about. They don’t want the Clintons any more to be the face of this party. They just got through with this Kavanaugh business and now the Clintons are gonna head out there, Mr. and Mrs. Bimbo Eruption? I wonder if this show will feature James Carville running across the stage or through the audience trailing a hundred-dollar bill and asking any interested women to meet Bill backstage after the show.

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/08/in-a-sane-world-democrats-would-suffer-a-landslide-defeat/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 8, 2018RUSH: One thing to keep in mind, folks, when you hear any leftist talking about “whiteness” or “white privilege,” what that translates to is power.Remember what the American left is — and it really serves to understand this. The American left today despises America as founded, and this may be a bit of a simplification, but I do this in order to communicate and be understood. At its very essence, the modern-day American left — as taught and educated over the past two generations through middle school, high school, and college — has been taught to hate America because America is unjust from our founding days, because it was founded by white men.White men founded a place for themselves and excluded everybody else, and everybody else has been getting the short end of the stick for over 200-plus years. Only now is the awareness and sensitivity to this being realized. Only now are the victims of this white privilege, of this white power — only now — are they standing up and demanding to be heard. Only now are they rising up in righteous indignation and demanding fairness and redress.
And the only way that can happen is for the white power structure of white privilege to be destroyed and replaced by a coalition of all of those who have been victimized, segregated, punished, mistreated, abused, what have you, by them reclaiming — or not reclaiming, but claiming — what is justly theirs, and that is America and its political systems. And that’s what young people have been taught.Now, as evidenced by that column I read by Alexis Grenell — or any other of these militant feminists, militant leftists — it is essentially the product of the classroom and the campus which has now grown up and matured and become the, quote-unquote, “mainstream” of the Democrat Party. This angry, agitated base of people that spends the sum total of every day in a permanent state of rage and anger. In their minds, they are powerless within American systems to fix anything, because white privilege has a death grip on every institution, on every election, on everything that matters.They have a death grip on the money. They have a death grip on the economy. They have a death grip on everything. And in releasing this death grip, they must get violent and they must get in your face. People are taught this way. Hatred and rage and anger have to be taught or inspired or mobilized. You don’t come out of the womb this way! Everybody comes out of the womb smiling and happy.Now, when a baby makes a mess of itself in a diaper, yeah, there’s anger. But you get my point here. The natural state of a human being is not rage and anger. The natural state of humanity is not that as epitomized by the Democrat Party. Yet that has become the Democrat Party. I firmly believe — and I said this Friday, and even if it makes me sound naive, I’m gonna say it again. In a sane world, in a decent and just country, the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democrat Party’s lifetime.There is not a single thing in a decent and just country that the American left, that the Democrat Party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants the stamp of approval of winning elections. Yet they win them within their closely contained bases, districts, and states — their enclaves — which is actually a very small portion of this country in terms of square mileage. It’s population centers of the big cities on the coasts and in the Great Lakes.Here’s the… It’s not a dirty little secret, but it’s something to always keep in mind. And, frankly, I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it’s a point that’s been true for as long as I have been doing this program and longer. We say constantly that the left uses the courts to act as insurance policies against losing elections, that the left cannot succeed in implementing its agenda nationwide except via the courts, and that’s why the courts are so important, and that’s why the courts…Liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts, federal appellate courts as they can with leftist-activist judges, not just plain old, simple judges who rule on the law. And there is a dirty little secret behind this, folks. The Democrats simply do not have the numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress. They do not have the numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively. In other words, they cannot get their beliefs, their ideas passed as laws in America.They have to rely on activist judges to do it. Now, you might be say, “Well, Rush, I’ve heard you say that before. Nothing new there.” Well, there nothing new about it, but particularly its relevance, its power and its importance has been magnified in this current Kavanaugh fight and explains in one way why this is so important to them. They are, in their minds, on the verge of losing the highest court in the land. They’re on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land rubber stamp their policies.If you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue — these issues they’ve roiled our culture, turned our culture upside down — you won’t find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare. Abortion? The American people haven’t decided that. That was forced on the American people by a leftist, activist judge and a majority on the Supreme Court.Any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this “white power structure” that the left so despises and so hates that they cannot beat, they cannot win. They cannot do this legislatively. They need activist judges nominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on everybody! This is the point. What they believe in, the ideas they have must be forced on the rest of us if they are to happen. They cannot withstand legislative tests!It’s the same reason why every Democrat president, up to and including Obama, never tells the truth about their agenda. They would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do. If Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was gonna end up and how much it was gonna cost you and how much you deserved to pay for it because you’ve been getting a free ride all these years… If Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was gonna cost you or anything, he would have never been elected.And no Democrat ever would be. They routinely soft sell what they really believe. They do not imagine out and advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns. They will do it, as is the case of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose lunacy is on display in a leftist district in New York is harmless. But you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it. We have not lost this country, and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding.But the left wants everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust, unfair, that it is also racist and sexist and misogynistic and all these other things that are despicable. “We must do away with it!” They don’t have the ability to win any of these issues legislatively. Now, you leftists can get mad at me all you want out there, but you cannot refute this. Everything they want — everything they have achieved outside of Obamacare — has been forced on the country.The country has been bludgeoned into accepting it. The country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way. And if you don’t look the other way and if you fight it, then what do they do? They sue you, they try to ruin you, or they bully you or they harass you or what have you. This is not the behavior that does win things legislatively, and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this is going to lead to this gigantic blue wave. I don’t care… Even today there are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on ’em, you’re gonna find a story saying, “Yep. It’s over!“Democrats win and win big — and even the Republicans think so.” AP has ’em. Reuters has ’em. New York Times, CNN. It doesn’t matter where you go. There’s always gonna be a story where Republicans agree it’s over. “The Republicans deathly afraid! Republicans scared to death! No way they can resist the coming the blue wave.” Sorry. I don’t buy it. It may happen; I don’t buy it. I don’t trust anything I see in the news anymore, and I certainly don’t trust a bunch of polling data, given what fallacies existed in both the news and polling leading up to 2016.Here is a story of a website called the Babylon Bee. “Democrats Shudder At Idea Of Having To Legislate Through Congress Should Supreme Court Lean Right.” I don’t know if this site is legitimate or not. If it’s a hoax site, what they’re doing is satire on the truth, because it absolutely is the case. They are petrified of Kavanaugh being on the court simply because of the shift in the court that it represents. But it is undeniable, folks. It’s factual. It’s right in front of us.They have not been able to succeed implementing the leftist, socialist, communist agenda via the United States Congress. They can do it in their state legislatures; I give you places like California and so forth. They haven’t been able to do it nationwide. It has to be forced. And of course for that to work — for the use of force to work — you have to cave to it. You have to cave to the bullying, which has happened on gay marriage; it’s happened on transgender bathroom issues.It’s happened on every oddball leftist cultural demand out there. They count on everybody caving. They count on everybody suing for peace, until Donald Trump came along. Donald Trump doesn’t cave, he doesn’t sue for peace, and he doesn’t cower to them. He calls them out. It makes perfect sense they would despise Donald Trump. It would make perfect sense if they feared Donald Trump. It makes perfect sense that they hate him. He refuses to play ball. Look at what they’ve attempted to force on the country with this whole Russian collusion thing.Trump-Russia collusion? That’s a classic illustration of the left attempting to force what they want people to think happened on the American people using everything in their arsenal. They have the media. They have the deep state. They had Never Trumpers on the Republican side. They had all kinds of allies! They had a special counsel with an eliminated budget, 16 or 17 Trump-hating lawyers/investigators — and still nothing! Because there has been pushback.When there is pushback on the left, they will fail. They can fail. They have gotten accustomed to there being no pushback. They’ve gotten accustomed to Republicans being afraid of them and afraid of the media. It’s this pushback — Trump having the audacity to run and the audacity to win then the audacity to actually do what he said he was gonna do in utter defiance of all these people. It’s rendering them unbalanced and insane.By the way, Paul Sperry (who writes columns at the New York Post and other places), tweeted yesterday afternoon at 2:06 p.m.: “Washington Post national security correspondent Greg Miller spent the last 2 years writing a book on Trump and Russia, and yet he found no evidence that Trump or any member of his campaign conspired with Russia to hack the election. Zip. Zero. Zilch.” Nada! You won’t hear about this. I don’t know if this guy is bragging or talking about it.But a Washington Post correspondent spent the last two years writing the book on Trump-Russia collusion, and there’s a problem. He can’t find a shred of evidence that anybody within any Trump circle or Trump himself had anything to do with Russia at any time for any reason during the campaign. None! Stop and think of all of the abject lies the left forces on this country via, supposedly, legitimate news stories each and every day. It’s nothing but the use of force. The use of force flooding the zone because they do not have facts on their side.They do not have majorities on their side, and they know it, which is why their reliance on the courts is so strong. Let me take a brief timeout. I’m just telling you, folks, if everything were just and decent here, these people would receive the biggest electoral punishment in the history of the Democrat Party in November. For all of the grief, the misery, the lies, the destruction — the attempted overthrowing of all of these things that make America great — they should be punished with minority status so low that it would take ’em decades to get it back.That’s what ought to happen.I know it’s not going to.That’s what should happen.That’s what they deserve.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The Babylon Bee is a conservative satire site. I’m being inundated with people informing me that it’s not only great, that it’s Christian, and it’s filled with people of white privilege. So we heartily endorse it, the Babylon Bee. Anyway, their point proves my point about humor and satire. For it to be true and funny, it must have an element of truth in it. And it does. The Democrat Party is very much aware that they cannot and do not implement their beliefs via Congress.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Look, I’ll go so far even in my continuing attempts to be pervasive on the point I’m trying to make. I don’t think Democrats care a whit about sexual assault, folks. I don’t think they care a whit about it. It was just the most convenient way of attacking and getting rid of Kavanaugh. There are too many Democrats who commit sexual assault that they never complain about for the Democrats to really care about it. Bob Menendez, senator in New Jersey, was caught and went to trial over having sex with some underage women in the Dominican Republic.He’s got a 10-point reelection lead.Democrats don’t care about that. Look at Bill Clinton, Ted Kennedy, any number of Democrats that you can point out. They’ve had their sacrificial lambs like Harvey Weinstein. But they don’t get rid of too many actual elected political people unless they are convinced that getting rid of them isn’t gonna hurt them. But they stand by the ones they think they need. But Kavanaugh was not even about sexual assault, folks. That was just the hook. That was just the train they decided to ride to derailing the nomination.Anyway, Derek in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. You are up. Great to have you, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hey, Rush. So at the beginning of your show, you had a rhetorical question about do the Democrats really believe in this new tactic with the mob. And, I mean, the Democrats, they’re an insurgency. They’ve become a political insurgency. And, as you know, when insurgencies are defeated, they just change tactics. And the new tactic, you know, they employed with Judge Kavanaugh with Christine Blasey Ford, they had a twofer. They had someone that not only educates our youth, but they had someone that was willing on put a suicide vest for ’em. Now, I just think that this is the new battlefront, and thankfully we have Trump who can — who has — put some steel in the spine of Republicans.RUSH: Well, true. True. (sigh) But maybe I’m silly for trying to force this issue. But let me just ask you point-blank, all right? You have talked and are willing to address the issue. Do you think that this “insurgency,” as you’ve described it, which is this behavior that we’ve seen the last two weeks…? Do you think that kind of behavior, which was widely publicized…? The Democrats loved it. The media loved it. They tried to make heroes out of these people. They didn’t try to hold them back.When they wanted to disrupt the Senate vote, they disrupted the Senate vote. When they wanted get in the halls of the Russell Senate Office Building, they did so. They got in elevators. They shouted these people down. The Democrats have not once called out that activity. They’ve never once told that side, their side, to stand down. Do you think the American public watching that is going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it, or do you think the American public doesn’t care one way or the other and doesn’t even really notice it?CALLER: I think it’s largely gonna be turned off, but like you said, they’ve completely changed their base now. They’ve given up on the working blue-collar class, and they’re now trying their hand to see if they can somehow increase the numbers with women on these types of issues. But I think largely that the American people are gonna be turned off, and I think it’s all gonna come down to who’s able to get out the votes in a month. But that has no bearing on 2020.RUSH: Okay, this is my point. I don’t think, given what we’ve seen the last two weeks… Among people in the public who watched it, I don’t think the Republicans need to do any get-out-the-vote. This was it! In my sane and just world, the Democrats just succeeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it’s ever been for a midterm. I know I’m probably wrong about that. But that’s how I look at it, that’s how it ought to be, and I’m the king of books titled The Way Things Ought to Be.It ought to be that people were outraged by this! It ought to be that people can’t wait to go punish this bunch of scum for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone! The Republicans ought not have to spend a dime getting out the vote based on this. But I know that’s not the reality. It’s kind of frustrating to me, but that’s the case.CALLER: Right.RUSH: Democrats think that they’re gonna have turnout here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election. Democrats think they own the whole country agrees, except they really don’t. They know they don’t have enough Americans to win legislative battles. But they think that they’re gonna be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is. And they’ve got news stories predicting that very thing. So people are gonna be reading it. People gonna be reading Republicans don’t have a chance.CALLER: (silence)RUSH: You may reply.CALLER: No. I agree. And I think they energize… I think they energized the base and they did exactly what need to be done. And I think that this is the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago that the event hadn’t happened. And with 29 days left, it happened.RUSH: True. Yeah. When I said, “The events are gonna shape the midterms hadn’t happened” 30 days ago, I was exactly right. And there are some people saying that this is gonna be forgotten by the time the election comes around. A lot of people. I saw ’em on Fox today. A lot of learned pundits and commentators, “Aw, this is gonna be so old by then!” I actually heard a couple people say, “The things that people are gonna vote on probably haven’t happened yet.”(chuckling) I just had to chuckle. Now, I can see with the passage of time. You cannot maintain this uber-passion for long. Nobody can! (interruption) Well, but we’re talking about… I’m talking about reasonable people. I’m saying it’s understandable to me that some passion on our side is going to fade. There’s still a month to go! The other side? They have been chomping at the bit since election night 2016, and they’re only getting more enraged.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/05/grassley-and-the-turtle-fired-up-like-weve-never-seen/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 5, 2018RUSH: I mentioned Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He has… I’ve never seen him this animated. I’ve never seen the Turtle this animated. This week, the Turtle and Grassley have been fit to be tied. Grassley still is. Grassley sent a letter late last night. Grassley sent his letter at 4 a.m. today to… I guess he sent it to Schumer, he might have sent it to Feinstein, and in this letter he calls out Mazie Hirono, the senator from Hawaii, and Feinstein by name. Let me read just a portion of Grassley’s letter.“Indeed, if the evidence supported your client’s allegations, you surely would produce it as quickly as you could. But you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate. In doing so, you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr. Ford’s allegations. I don’t know what other inference we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr. Ford’s allegations in quite the way you have claimed.”This is the polygraph he’s talking about, the notes with the polygraph, and the therapist notes. Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced those, even though Blasey Ford admitted that she took a lie detector — well, her lawyers did — and that she had seen a therapist. And Grassley’s been asking for that evidence, and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it. He’s saying, “You have repeatedly refused to produce this, and in doing so, you’re preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr. Ford’s allegations.”She passed a lie detector? We want to see it!They won’t let him see it.“I don’t know what other inference we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support [her] allegations in quite the way you have claimed.” It’s a reasonable thing to say. They’re out there saying she took a lie detector, that she passed a lie detector, that she told all these details to her therapist. Well, let’s see that stuff! And they won’t produce it!Grassley’s saying: You must have something to hide.Then, he writes, “I urge you once again, now for the third time in writing, to turn over the therapy notes, polygraph materials, and communications with the Washington Post that Dr. Ford has relied upon as evidence. In addition to the evidence I requested in my October 2 letter, in light of recently uncovered information, please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr. Ford or her representatives and any of the following:“(1) U.S. senators or their staffs, particularly the offices of Senators Feinstein and Hirono… (2)the alleged witnesses identified by Dr. Ford (Leland Keyser, Mark Judge, Patrick ‘P. J.’ Smythe); and (3) Debbie Ramirez, Julie Swetnick, or their representatives.” What Grassley’s getting at here is: How much consultation have you had with this witness? Senator Feinstein, Senator Hirono, how much time have you spent with this witness discussing her testimony or coaching her or whatever?I mean, he’s loaded for bear. This is the kind of collegiality violation — and I shouldn’t call it that. This is the kind of decorum that you don’t see broken. Senators don’t challenge each other. They don’t call each other out. It’s almost… It’s Senate rules. And Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference…He kept running back to the microphone to rip into these media people as using bias and so forth. In fact, grab audio sound bite No. 5. This was… I don’t know if this was at a press conference or not. It may be exactly what I saw, but it is an example of Grassley with his finger on the pulse here. This is… Nah, it’s not what I’ve seen. This is this morning in Washington. But let’s listen to it.GRASSLEY: What we have learned is the “resistance” that has existed since the day after the November 2016 election is centered right here on Capitol Hill. They have encouraged mob rule! When you hear things about “get in their face,” bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member? These are coming from public servants! They ought to set an example of civility in American society, and it’s been made worse by what has happened to Judge Kavanaugh. I hope we can say “no” to mob rule by voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. I yield the floor.RUSH: That was during his Senate floor remarks today in favor of Kavanaugh. He was singling out, by the way, Maxine Waters for promoting this, as he called it, “resistance.” But he’s calling them out here and chastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the “resistance” leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill! And he’s right! The leadership of the resistance is the Democrat Party. The resistance is over at the Democrat National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress — members of the House and so forth.I’ve never seen this before! I’ve never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this. I mean, they’re fit to be tied.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/04/my-brothers-new-book-will-whet-your-appetite-for-the-bible/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 4, 2018RUSH: Hey, folks, I beg your indulgence here for just a brief moment. I want to talk about my brother’s new book, and, if I don’t make time to do it, there isn’t gonna be a good time. I don’t want to… (sigh) There isn’t gonna be a time to break topic for the next three or four days, and his book just came out, and I want to — if you’ll indulge me — just tell you a little bit about it. It’s called Jesus Is Risen, and it’s about Paul and the early church. And it’s now available anywhere you get books. It’s on Amazon. It’s at Apple, iBooks, Barnes & Noble. There’s an e-book version and all that.Now, my brother is devout. He is a devout Christian and is an evangelist in the sense that he spreads the Word. He wants everybody to know it, to understand Christianity, and it’d be great in his opinion if everybody accepted it because it would make for a much better culture and society. So what he’s done… He knows the Bible is an intimidating thing to read for people who haven’t read it. There’s the Old Testament and New Testament, and where do you start?And then which version do you get to even be able to understand what you’re reading? And how do you follow it and so forth? So what he’s done in this book and a couple previous ones is almost like a primer. It is his telling of some of the key elements and stories of the Bible to whet your appetite for it, to make you curious, to get you interested in wanting to read the Bible. Every devout Christian thinks the Bible is the key, and the more people that read it and understand obviously the better.Now, Christianity was originally confined to a very small circle of people in Jerusalem, and it went from a small, little movement to the world’s most popular religion. And it is a fascinating story how that happened, which he attempts to explain in the book. It’s called Jesus Is Risen, and it’s about the birth of Christianity using the Book of Acts. It’s all in the Book of Acts, folks. I mean, when I say, “It’s all there,” it is. I mean, it’s not a substitute for reading the Bible, but the Book of Acts, it’s all there.So he uses the Book of Acts, and six New Testament epistles as the introductory guide here to get people who want to read the Bible but are intimidated by it to actually get started doing it. So it’s sort of a primer that when you finish this book and start the Bible, you’ll have a head start, and you’ll be more likely to stay with it. It details the suffering and the sorrow, the joys and the triumphs of the apostles and all of the key figures in Christianity following the death and resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ.Which, if the resurrection doesn’t happen, then Christianity doesn’t exist. And that’s one of the toughest things to make people believe. How in the world that…? You can’t physically put your arms around that, resurrection from the dead. But it’s a key element of Christianity. It’s one of the big stumbling blocks that people have. I can’t even imagine that. I mean, I heard (I don’t want to mention any names) a liberal talk show host really berating a Christian. “Do you really believe that? That can’t be! That’s why you people are nuts.“You can’t really think that somebody died and came back to life. That’s why people think you’re crazy!” Well, for Christianity to be what it is, that had to happen. And my brother, David, is devoted to helping people believe that it happened by accepting what’s in the Bible. But before you can accept what’s in the Bible, you have to open it. Look, it’s not simply a primer; it’s its own story. It has its own telling of the tale. But it’s designed to be sort of like an introduction to the Bible and to Christianity, both testaments.But this focuses on the Book of Acts because that’s where it all is. Now, don’t just read the Book of Acts and forget everything else, but it’s all there in the Book of Acts. That’s why David chose the Book of Acts to start. Again, I thank you for giving me the time to mention this. It would not be timely at any time in the next two or three days because of all the other news happening out there. But, again, it’s Jesus Is Risen. It just hit on Tuesday.I think it’s been hovering around 13 to 19 on Amazon, and he’s busy doing all of his interviews about the book now. He’s had a bunch of them scheduled on Fox and he’s been broomed because they can’t leave the Kavanaugh story. So I thought I would do what I could here to help make people aware that the book is out. Jesus Is Risen by David Limbaugh — and, believe me, I think it will serve its purpose if you have any interest at all in getting into this. It’ll give you introductory how to do it, where to go, and not be intimidated by any of it.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/02/the-curious-case-of-dr-fords-uptalker-voice/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 2, 2018RUSH: Kansas City, Missouri, Yvonne. You’re next. I’m glad you waited.CALLER: Thank you, Rush.RUSH: You bet.CALLER: We love you here in Kansas City. Wish you would come back.RUSH: Well, you know, I have a lot of friends in Kansas City, and I have been back periodically, but I do it on the down low.CALLER: Right. Right. Well, the reason I’m calling is I think sometimes I’m the only woman in the whole country that thinks that Dr. Ford’s testimony was not credible, that her whole demeanor and her body language, it was just so rehearsed and coached. From the way she acted behind the microphone like she had never seen one before in her life… Her voice was quivering and I don’t mean to sound cruel, but, I mean, that was… I can’t believe that, you know, an intelligent and well-educated world traveler, public speaker, can get behind a microphone and act like it’s like she was just the most frail and wilted flower in the world, you know.RUSH: You know, we had… I didn’t get to this yes. I had an audio sound bite. A Hollywood actress or an actress somewhere that I’ve never heard of did a video impersonation of Dr. Ford, and it was so spot on, and it was exactly… I noticed her speech pattern. Those of us whose profession involve the voice know very well the various vocal techniques that professional vocalizers use, and she used to a great effect what is called uptalking or up-speaking, and that means to end every sentence on an up note.It promotes the idea that you’re young and innocent and vulnerable, and it’s what you say was the little girl type voice. This Hollywood actress did a perfect impersonation and is being destroyed. She put it on Twitter. She’s being destroyed. She had to apologize for it and tell everybody she supports Dr. Ford, she just was amazed and she wanted to do her impersonation to show her talent, but it got taken down, and I didn’t get a chance to get to the video. Maybe we can drum it up from yesterday’s archive and play it for you.But it’s a perfect illustration of how she speaks. I have to tell you something. Yvonne, you’re not the only woman who doesn’t believe her. The female prosecutor the Republicans hired, Rachel Mitchell, has put together a devastating forensic analysis of Dr. Ford’s testimony, and it is… I’ve got that here, but it prints out to eight pages. There’s no way I can… I mean, I guess I could share various excerpts of it with you. But, I mean, it is just devastating on the substance. Forget the way she spoke and how she appeared and so forth. And the Democrats are acknowledging it as (impression) “Well, she’s partisan. We can’t we can’t take seriously a thing that that woman says.” And they’re so rejecting it. But, no, you’re not the only one, Yvonne, who has your opinion.CALLER: And, you know, I just didn’t buy it for a minute. I really did (unintelligible) little, you know… That’s what she wanted us to believe she was. And also in her testimony, we watched it all day long. We just couldn’t get away from it. But her testimony, when she was talking about going into the Safeway store with the mother, she went into the store at another door, and then she confronted or she saw this Judge —RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: — character that said at… Okay, she said she went up to him and said hi and was friendly and how he just acted like he didn’t want to have anything to do with her.RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: Why would you do that? If he had just done what he supposedly had done just a few weeks earlier and it traumatized you, why would you go up to him and try to be a friend, then? You know, nobody has touched on that, and I thought, that’s crazy!RUSH: I did it…Just to show you’re not alone on this, Yvonne, I had a caller yesterday or maybe Friday, that made the exact point that if you really have been traumatized by a guy and you see him in the Safeway, you don’t, you don’t run up and say hi. In fact —CALLER: Go the opposite —RUSH: Not even that. I know people who won’t even talk to people they’ve broken up with! See somebody nearby that they broke up with a year ago, six months… I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see that person. By the way, the use… Her saying “Safeway” is very, very important, folks, where she saw Judge, ’cause Judge has written a book. It’s part of his recovery therapy for drug addiction and alcoholism and depression, and he was told by the therapist to write a book, not a memoir, but to write a book about his problems, and he placed himself in Safeway stores as an employee.So she just happens to say she runs into him in a Safeway. And it’s thought that that was strategy after having read his book that it would give Ford credibility to cite the fact that she saw him in a Safeway store since he had written about it. It was designed to give herself proof or some measure of proof. But, Yvonne, you’re not alone, and you’re right on the money to out of this. We were able to get the audio of the actress impersonating Dr. Ford.You’ll notice here the uptick. I’m not gonna mention the actress’s name because she’s taken this down and she’s getting a lot of heat and I had never heard of her anyway. I’m not trying to insult her here, I just had not hurried of her. But I don’t want to mention her name and cause her any more grief, but she did her imitation of Christine Blasey Ford and this is it.ACTRESS: I don’t know if anybody is listening to the Dr. Blasey Ford testimony about Brett Kavanaugh, but this is how I sound. I know it’s a surprise to even me that I talk this way and I’m a doctor and a grown woman. I sound like I’m still back at that high school party. Um, I can’t help it. I just have this kind of a voice, like a baby, even though I’m a doctor, and I’m on this media circus political stage, and I have kids myself that I don’t know why I speak with vocal fry (sic), but you can listen to my testimony and hear that a grown woman sounds this way, Dr. Blasey Ford, thank you.RUSH: Well, that’s… I mean, that’s so spot on, you’d think it’s her! And that woman, Twitter destroyed her; so she’s pulled that down. But you notice, you hear the uptick there. It is said that this is how valley girls, California valley girls speak. It’s not just them. It’s young girls, teenage girls sound this. And very vulnerable. That’s key to this. The key to Blasey Ford’s speech pattern was sounding vulnerable and scared and just totally innocent and, (impression of Christine Blasey Ford), “Why am I here? I, I, I think sooooo. I, I, I’m not suuuuure,” and it just works. It makes you think that whoever you’re hearing is scared to death, is very vulnerable; couldn’t possibly be lying.But how many 53- or 55-year-olds do you hear speaking that way?  "

(chuckles) Attila, welcome to the EIB Network. Hello.CALLER: Thank you. I’m a lifer! In 1989, I was in high school and I started listening to you while mowing my yard.RUSH: Well, I appreciate that. It’s always great to hear from lifers. Thank you very much.CALLER: Yes. We need lions in this day and age, not lambs — and you, sir, are a lion who inspires a lot of folks in the younger generation like Ben Ferguson and John Muir of our Green Bay radio station, young conservatives. Anyways, to my point, sir, I feel kicked in the gut, and I want your reaction. Reason guided by experience and wisdom. What is your take, Rush, on the retraction of the declassification order by the president for the text messages between Peter Strzok, Donkey Teeth Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr and Andrew McCabe and the FISA?RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: I was so excited, and then the retraction came. The wind is out of my sails, and I wanted your reaction.RUSH: You’re not alone in that. A lot of people are, and especially people like Devin Nunes and Mark Meadows. Members of Congress had a lot of invested in this stuff being declassified and made public. Declassification is one thing. Making it public is another. Here’s what happened. Supposedly, some of our allies appealed to President Trump to not make this stuff public because it would be so embarrassing to them. Translation: The Brits.Translation: Cambridge and Oxford professors who do double time at MI6 and MI5, plus people (the spies and so forth) that work there. Because there is no doubt in my mind, given Stefan Halper and Joseph Mifsud and some of the others at the FBI hired as embedded spies in the Trump campaign — there’s no doubt in my mind — that they are up to their necks in this stuff themselves! And what’s in these documents proves the coup!It establishes what was going on! The deep state is witnessing this unravel in front of their faces. That’s why all of this is happening with Rosenstein, and there obviously was an appeal made to Trump by our allies to not make this public for fear of damaging the allied relationship. At some point, that has to go by the wayside. I was disappointed like you and a lot of people were because we’ve been led to believe that these documents will put an end to all this and bring to light everything we have thought we’ve known that’s been going on — that it will prove it, and even more.I am a firm believer that this stuff is gonna be made public at some point. I really do believe it is. I think Trump acquiesced to the wishes here of our allies for the time being, for the sake of other elements of his foreign policy that he wants to achieve — for example, at the United Nations today, this speech of his. It was strong. It was America first. He told Germany not to be dependent on one source of energy. This is Russia. But he didn’t ream ’em. He just pointed out the mistake that they’re making.He really laid out Iran, all of the horrible things that Iran has done. He made a joke about Rouhani. He said, “Everything I hear about him is he’s very, very nice guy. But no, I don’t expect to be chatting with him this month or this week.” You know, Brexit is still a mess, and Trump has a desired outcome with that. So I think this is Trump balancing the alternatives and realizing he can make it public at any time. The Brits made a request; he’s gonna honor the request for whatever foreign policy considerations he thinks are important.But I think he’s gonna publicize it at some point. Remember, we’ve still got, well, 40 days before the midterms. Take 10 off ’cause you need enough time out there and permeate. Say we got 30 days. I do believe… I don’t know anything, but I do believe that it’s going to happen. In fact, I think there’s so much going on… I mentioned earlier that the Mueller investigation, and I just have a sense. I got these instincts, these gut feelings that pop up now and then.And I really believe that the wind is gone from the Mueller investigation, because there isn’t anything there! They knew even before Mueller started that there wasn’t any collusion, so they were looking for ways maybe make people think was. They couldn’t even find that! They couldn’t even find fake evidence. They couldn’t even manufacture credible fake evidence, after all of the newspaper stories, after all of the attempts that have been made.I don’t think Mueller is winding down for any reason other than he knows there’s no “there” there. But I think these documents have to come out, because that would end this, and it would end this quickly. This needs to be ended like the Kavanaugh confirmation vote needs to happen quickly. There has been so much government misconduct and corruption that it needs to come to light and people need to know just how extensive it was.People need to know exactly what happened from the files made by the conspirators and the people involved in this coup themselves. People need to know that there was indeed — from the upper echelon of the Obama Department of Justice and the Obama intelligence apparatus — a purposeful, coordinated effort to undermine a campaign first, a transition second, and a presidency third. This needs to come out. It needs to be made public.The American people need to see the evidence. Not written by newspapers, not manufactured by anonymous sources, but actual documents created by the participants who had to (because of numerous regulations and laws) document what they were doing. There’s also something else. You know Sidney Powell, the author of a great book, License to Lie, which I have cited and quoted here on numerous previous occasions. She makes the point…Remember the Weiner laptop that Comey used to reopen the Hillary email investigation on October 28, 2016? The Democrats erupted over this. It was because some of Hillary’s State Department emails were found on Huma Abedin’s husband’s computer, “Carlos Danger.” That would be Anthony Weiner! This is the guy that was texting — another Democrat, by the way, who was texting — nude photos of his penis to young girls. Why men do that, I’ll never know, but I guess he thought he was particularly beautiful in that way.He’s sending them out there to teenage girls and Huma is embarrassed and humiliated but Huma stays with him for the duration following the great example of Hillary Clinton. She did so, but on that computer remember they told us in that week that there were tens of thousands of emails, and in two days they told us they reviewed them all? “Nothing to see here! We are officially closing the case.” They didn’t read those emails on that computer.And point has been made that we need to see that laptop, we need to see what was on that laptop because on that laptop perhaps the names of every person in the House or Senate for whom misconduct claims were paid from a congressional slush fund. Have you heard about this fund, folks? The members of Congress created a fund. They control the purse strings of the government, the budget.They created a fund, a pile of money from which mischaracterize claims against them would be paid. So if you are an abused woman or an confused employee and mistreated and whatever and you charge them, file suit, the money to pay off the accusers came out of this slush fund. Supposedly the Weiner laptop has some of that evidence on it, and it’s elsewhere as well as. But especially at this juncture with what they’re trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh, it would be highly helpful and informative to find out the names of every person in the House or Senate for whom misconduct claims were paid and how much and what the allegations are.We need it before voting starts — early voting, absence voting. That needs to happen, too, all of this. While everybody’s focusing on what Kavanaugh did or didn’t do — and he didn’t do it because nobody has any evidence that he did. We have a slush fund, and we have a money pool from which misconduct claims have been paid. For whom, how much, and for what were they accused? The double standard here seems like it’s the only standard that exists in Washington.You’ve got a guy Kavanaugh who hasn’t done anything, nothing close to what he’s been accused of. Certainly, nobody can prove it. There isn’t any evidence for any of these allegations — and yet evidence for mistreatment of women and abuse abounds elsewhere, but it’s hidden and swept under the rug and paid off privately with government money. And a lot of this could be learned easily with the declassification of certain documents. So I’m with you out there, Attila, that it needs to happen.The only thing I can think of is that Trump’s foreign policy concerns, policies desires need cooperation from some of these allies. But I hope this is just a temporary delay. That’s why at every Trump rally, what is the No. 1 sign they see, outside of Make America Great? What’s the number one sign you see at a Trump rally, Mr. Snerdley? (interruption) Nope. “Drain the swamp.” “Drain the swamp” is the No. 1. “Build the wall,” No. 2. (“Lock her up” is really a chant.) But “drain the swamp” is why Trump was sent there, and declassifying these documents would be a giant step for mankind in draining the swamp.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/24/where-does-the-right-to-be-heard-end/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 24, 2018RUSH: You know, one of my big bugaboos, ladies and gentlemen, is this business of “right to be heard.” People misconstrue the First Amendment’s right to free speech to also mean right to be heard, and we’re hearing it now in the case of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford that she has “a right to be heard.” This is all part of the left trying to stand our system of jurisprudence upside down and on its head. “Ford should be treated with respect, and she deserves an opportunity to share her story.” Well, she did. She wrote about it in the Washington Post.
The Drive-By Media has been repeating her story ad infinitum for how many weeks now? Even our good friends, some conservative commentators, are hell bent showing the media/left that we can be open-minded. Even as conservatives, we are suggesting that she should be treated with respect and she deserves an opportunity to share her story. Well, let me ask this: Once it becomes pretty obvious that a person’s making false claims of attempted rape, at what point do we draw a line and say, “We no longer have to grant this opportunity to be heard and share a story”?Let me call your attention to the accuser in the Duke lacrosse case. Remember how that panned out? Here’s the accuser, and the white Duke lacrosse team guys were automatically guilty. Why? Because they were white and because they played lacrosse. (impression) “Lacrosse is considered a sport for rich Republicans and people that belong to country clubs — and therefore, they’re not real people. They’re not average, ordinary people. Who plays lacrosse? Lacrosse is a phony, nose in-the-air game. Who cares! Duke lacrosse players!”And the accuser was a poor black woman who made her living by dancing with few clothes on next to a pole whenever people hired her to do so. She was assumed to be automatically credible and believable. Why? Because of who she was accusing and because she was a minority. Minorities are always gonna be believed by the left. They wouldn’t make it up and the left wants them to be telling the truth. Remember how that played out? Those men on the Duke lacrosse team’s lives were targeted for destruction.You know what I remember about that? Even when it became obvious that the accuser had made it up, it was one of the hardest things in the world to get the charges dismissed anyway because once prosecutors… In this case, his name was Mike Nifong. They got rid of him. But once charges are made, getting them withdrawn seems like something the system isn’t equipped for. You can attest to this, Dawn. You’ve been in court. When there are charges, they have to be dealt with. “We don’t withdraw the charges!“Even if there’s evidence to prove that they’re wrong, we have to see it through.” It took weeks to get those charges withdrawn, even after it was learned that she had made up the whole story. That’s what I remember about that: A newfound appreciation for people falsely accused. The charges don’t go away, even at the moment it’s discovered that they’re made up. It took, I think, the governor a new prosecutor — and even when they withdrew the charges, they did it in such a way as to cause as little damage to the department that did it. I mean, they did dump all over Nifong. But, boy, it took a long time.So do we respect the Duke lacrosse accuser? Do we respect the woman who accused an entire fraternity in Charlottesville? That’s the Rolling Stone story. The writer just made it up with a woman who was claiming she was gang raped by all these people. Do we treat her with respect? At what point…? is my question. At what point do we turn from hearing a person out over and over and over again to then rightfully condemning them for making it up and telling a lie to destroy innocent people? Ask the Duke lacrosse guys if they will ever…Once it’s learned… As they go through life, once it’s learned who they are, the first reaction is, “Oh, you’re the guys accused of rape. You’re the guys that they said raped that that poor dancer.” Even though they know that the guys were exonerated! That’s how you’re known. This is what they are attempting to do to Brett Kavanaugh, and now this despicable Michael Avenatti is accusing Kavanaugh and Mark Judge of participating in the targeting of women with alcohol and drugs in order to allow a train of men to gang rape them!We don’t even know who this accuser is, and Avenatti — at this moment — is demanding to be heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee. And he’s using the personal pronoun “we” demand to be heard. We don’t know who “we” is. Here’s the sticking point: If the Republicans just hold together, they can cram all of this right back down the throats of the Democrats in a vote to confirm Kavanaugh. If they hang together. Now, over the weekend… Because I’m a powerful, influential member of the media, therefore people attempt to influence me into doing their bidding.I have to be very wary and very careful of all of these come-ons to me, and they’re… Oh, some of them are so flattering, you wouldn’t believe! Anyway, scuttlebutt over the weekend was that Jeff Flake, the outgoing senator from Arizona, was gonna vote “present” for Kavanaugh on the committee. We don’t know about the whole Senate. And then I think Flake was out saying, “No, no, no, no! That’s not true. It’s not true.” But, you know, Jeff Flake until Trump came along was actually…I mean, some of you will argue with me on this. But for the most part, Jeff Flake was a conservative. I mean, it’s questionable to say reliable, but he was a conservative. He’s not that anymore, which is why he’s now a hero to the Drive-By Media and the Democrat Party. Kavanaugh also, by the way, has calendars from 1982 that show he was out of town nearly the entire summer, which is when the alleged incident with Blasey Ford is believed to have happened.You know what they will say? “He made ’em up! He created those calendars in the past two weeks! He’s a lying skunk is what he is!” That’s what they’ll say, or they’ll refuse to admit them on the grounds of they can’t be verified. I think it’s time to end the flexibility on this. Grassley has got to call the vote. Be done with this and take it forward or this circus is never gonna end. By design. I will just tell you this again.If Grassley gives the Democrats enough time, they will eventually produce a woman who claims to be Kavanaugh’s secret Russian wife who Trump paid to urinate on the Obamas’ hotel bed in Moscow. Oh, yeah! Kavanaugh is a bigamist too. Nobody knew but he’s got a wife in Russia. She’s gonna come forward. She’s gonna say she’s Kavanaugh’s wife. She’s been Russian for as long as she been born, and she was paid by Trump to hire a bunch of prostitutes and go urinate on the bed Obama slept in. They will pull out all the stops.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, here is my point on the Duke lacrosse case guys. “On April 11, 2007, North Carolina Attorney General [and now Governor] Roy Cooper dropped all charges and declared the three lacrosse players innocent of the rape allegations.” The attorney general, Roy “Cooper stated that the players — Reade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty, and David Evans,” rich white guys, obviously Republicans ’cause they play lacrosse. Actually, it’s namby-pamby. (sigh) Never mind. They “were victims of a ‘tragic rush to accuse.'”You know when event happened? March of 2006. March of 2006 to April 2007. After 13 months, the charges were dropped. There are stories that the case was settled for $60 million, $20 million to each of three Duke lacrosse players. Their lawyers deny that their settlements were anywhere near that large. These three guys — Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans — to this day have not talked about it. You talk about a gross miscarriage of justice? They didn’t do it! They never did do it. It was made up from the get-go — and the left?The faculty at Duke University… I forget what percentage. It was a large percentage of the faculty wrote letters admonishing these kids and claimed they should be expelled! Just like the Hollywood actresses in this case: “We believe her.” On the basis of what? “Well, she said so!” Right. So can’t question that, and the accuser doesn’t have to prove anything. The burden of proof is on the accused. There’s a reason why that’s not incorporated into our system of justice.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Scott in Staten Island in New York.  I’m glad you waited, sir.  Hi.CALLER:  Oh, thank you, Rush.  It’s an honor speaking to you, sir.RUSH:  Thank you, sir.CALLER:  Rush, you made a great point before how, you know, back in the day that had the left been acting like this, you could take a bunch of votes away from them and the midterm, you know, we take 10, 20 votes, and we would have the seats.  But today is a different day, Rush. You know, with these kids in college now, you know, that are able to vote. And even the people that are like in their thirties and forties, their thinking is a lot different.  And it’s just… That’s how their crazy thinking is.  I mean, you would think that we would get a lot more votes, you know, to our conservative side. Because I can’t see how anybody would want to vote Democrat with how great the president’s doing, and the garbage that the left is doing to the president and to Judge Kavanagh.RUSH:  Well, get this.  Let me interrupt you.  I’m sorry, but we’re running out of time, and you’ve said something here I want to react to.  One of the reasons is — and I can’t tell you how it bugs me to have to admit this! But one of the reasons is people don’t know how good the country’s doing. The press is not filling them each day with news of the recovering economy.  There was a story I saw over the weekend of some Republican, elected Republican.They had taken some polling, internal polling, and they discovered… It was said to me, “Republicans have learned that the tax legislation, tax cuts are not helping them at all, that people are blaming the Republicans for tax cuts because they think the only people that got tax cuts are corporations and the rich.”  Now, the tax cuts and the wiping out of regulations is why this economy is burgeoning, because everybody — and a lot of people — got significant tax cuts resulting in more disposable income.Which encourages economic activity, which we are seeing.  But because the media (and probably their teachers in school) are out there saying, “Only the rich and corporations ever get tax cuts.  You never do!  The Republicans don’t care about you!” If that’s all people hear, that’s what they’re gonna believe.  Now, part and parcel of this is the Republicans just don’t know how to do PR — and they don’t even try ’cause they think they will not succeed getting their message out because of the media blockading it.

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/18/flashback-1991-rush-on-charlie-rose-debating-clarence-thomas-and-anita-hill/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 18, 2018RUSH: We’ve been here. We’ve been here before, folks.We have been here. Yesterday on this program I cited and shared with you how livid I was back in 1991 when this Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill thing was going on. I made mention of this because I’m feeling the identical sense of anger and outrage now. But there are substantial differences. In 1991, CNN was the only cable news network and this show (and some other local conservative radio talk shows which had begun to spring up) was it.There was no blogosphere. There was no Fox News. There was nothing. This show and other related local radio talk shows were it in terms of conservative opposition, and when I was talking about how angry I felt yesterday, it triggered something in Cookie’s mind. Cookie controls the archive of audio sound bites of this program, not just sound bites we’ve used, but actual sound bites of me. And it triggered something. She went back to our archives and she found in 1991 in October an appearance I made on Charlie Rose.It was after this show, by the way. I’ve never been invited back by Charlie Rose and PBS. Not that I’m whining about it. I’m not. It’s just historical fact. I want to play these sound bites for you because what they show is we’ve been here before. It is the same exact playbook. It is the identical thing. Back in 1991, I had to go on TV to refute these clowns. I don’t have to do that now. But back then I did. I was so livid, I can’t tell you. I didn’t know Clarence Thomas, but I knew what this was.I knew this was not about sexual harassment with Anita Hill. This was about denying Clarence Thomas a seat on the United States Supreme Court. One of the most easy, instinctive things I have ever done is defend Clarence Thomas. I had people saying to me at the time, “Rush, you’re really way out there. You don’t know the guy.” “I don’t care. I do know the guy. I know plenty of people who know him. I’ve seen him talk. My instincts on this are this is a fine, decent man. I know he’s being railroaded. I know this is a typical, left-wing trick.”I had no doubt then; I’ve got no doubt now. Let’s go back. I just want to share this with you for the purposes of demonstrating to people that this is just another page from the playbook, that we’ve been here before, that there’s nothing even really unique about this in terms of Democrat strategy. So it’s October 15, 2001, Charlie Rose’s show on PBS.It aired at 11 o’clock at night live on PBS back then. He had me on with the executive director of the New York Urban League, whose name was Harriet Michel. We’re talking about Thomas’ appointment to Supreme Court. Charlie started by saying, “What should the Senate Judiciary Committee have done if somebody comes to their attention and raises the issue of sexual harassment? What should the committee have done?”BEGIN ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH ARCHIVE: The thing that has to be done is the American system of jurisprudence has to be consistent in focusing. I kept hearing people talking about “the seriousness of the charges.” The seriousness of the charges is irrelevant. The nature of the evidence is what’s relevant. The presumption is always with the accused and just ’cause someone comes forth at the last moment and claims that something happened, her accusation cannot be regarded as evidence. And, if there’s nothing to corroborate it, there is no way — just because she charges it — any weight should be given it.ROSE: All right, it’s evidence but it doesn’t have corroboration, but — but —RUSH: No, it’s not evidence! An accusation is not evidence. It can’t be evidence.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: It can’t be! An allegation is never evidence, it cannot be evidence — and, notice, back then they didn’t care. It was evidence. It was the seriousness of the charge. They didn’t care about it being corroborated, just like today. Her lawyer is saying, “It’s not her job to corroborate the charge. The charge is enough! The allegation is enough. When we say it, that’s what happened.” That’s their cock-certain, arrogant attitude. “When we say it, it happened, and it’s up to investigators to prove that it didn’t.”Why hasn’t the woman come forward before now? Why has she not accepted the invitation to come to the committee? F. Chuck Todd’s out there saying, “Do you people who think that a woman of her age would destroy her life by coming forward like Christine Blasey Ford is now, you don’t understand left-wing…” What do you mean, destroy her life? Has Anita Hill’s life been destroyed or is she become a hero? Anita Hill’s become a heroine! They still make books about her.They take something that didn’t happen, they make it look like it did happen, and they make her a hero victim. They’re now trying to say that Anita Hill was actually at the forefront of the #MeToo movement. There has yet to be a shred of evidence that Clarence Thomas did what he was alleged to have done, and yet look what they’ve done with it — and they’re in the process of doing the same thing to Kavanaugh, and I’m afraid we don’t have an Arlen Specter this year.Oh! In fact, if you forgot… I got three more of these Charlie Rose sound bites. Hang on. Arlen Specter back in 1991 just took it to Anita Hill. Legally. I don’t mean in an unfair way. He just destroyed her as a witness, and I think it had such a profound impact on him. It’s one of the reasons why he became a Democrat much later on in life. I heard somebody say on Fox that that couldn’t happen today. It was last night. It was last night. Somebody on Fox was saying, “Yeah, there could not be the kind of interrogation of Anita Hill by Arlen Spector in this #MeToo movement.”See? So a woman makes an allegation and we cannot probe her as though she is a human being. Arlen Specter ripped Anita Hill apart, demonstrated that a lot of this could not be backed up, had no evidence — and he got creamed for it; don’t misunderstand. But the idea that today we couldn’t do that? Like if this woman were to show up and be interrogated or questioned, we couldn’t do to her what Arlen Specter did to Anita Hill.Which means because of the #MeToo movement we pretty much have to go with whatever a woman who claimed to have been abused says. We can’t investigate too much, we can’t probe too much because that then is potentially harming psychologically to the victim and all this.” All of this is part of the plan too. To soften any attempt to get to the truth of these things has been long part of the strategy. Let me go back to the Charlie Rose sound bites. After that bite where I made it plain to Charlie Rose that an allegation is not evidence because it doesn’t have corroboration, Charlie said, “Well, it is evidence. It just doesn’t have corroboration.”I said, “No. It is not evidence. It cannot be evidence.”BEGIN ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: I think that what’s happened here is that liberals fear the democratic process because people vote against liberal things. Liberals cannot win the White House. When the referendum is conservatism versus liberalism, liberalism loses in landslides. The Supreme Court is the most important political branch of government to liberals. That’s where all of liberalism has found its way into our society and they’ve lost it now and they feel they have no recourse. It’s sheer panic out there, I think, Charlie, and I don’t exaggerate here. I think that they are palpably worried —ROSE: Yeah.RUSH: — that they now no longer have a route to the mainstream of society.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Right, and this kept going. The next sound bite here is… Let’s see, what is it? I asked Harriet Michel of the New York Urban League if she believed Anita Hill.BEGIN ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Do you believe her?MICHEL: Do I believe her?RUSH: Why do you believe her?MICHEL: Yes, I believe her.RUSH: Why would you believe her? Can I ask you why you believe her?MICHEL: I — I — I believe her — I be —RUSH: She offered no evidence, Harriet. There was no —ROSE: You asked the question. Let her answer.MICHEL: That’s exactly right. I believe that for everybody to make this assumption that Clarence Thomas, the public persona, cannot possibly — under any circumstances, in a room one on one with a female — be gross and be obnoxious is out of their minds.RUSH: Wait a minute. What’s dangerous is assuming he did it with no evidence.MICHEL: I don’t — I don’t assume that he did it. I believe —RUSH: If you believe her, you have to.MICHEL: I believe that it’s possible that he did it, and I believe that four —RUSH: So we convict him on that?MICHEL: — lawyers coming forward —RUSH: We convict him on the possibility?MICHEL: This wasn’t a trial though!RUSH: Oh, it was.MICHEL: And the fact that the possibility… I happen to believe there is a cloud that follows him.RUSH: Because what?MICHEL: I happen to believe it.RUSH: Because what?MICHEL: Because I don’t think…RUSH: She wants there to be a cloud.MICHEL: I think that she was a credible —RUSH: I think you want there to be a cloud.MICHEL: No, I think —RUSH: That’s what this is all about.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: No evidence. No reason to believe her. She just chooses to believe her. It’s where we are — exactly where we are here — with the same kind of thinking, the same kind of thing. Well, there’s no reasoning going on here. This is pure politics. None of these people know this woman, I don’t think. (chuckling) You know, before this is all over, we might find out that this woman’s family had something to do with Perkins Coie, which had something to do with the Steele dossier. I mean, anything is possible with this group of people!Would you be surprised if this woman was found to have roots by virtue of people she’s known to the Steele dossier and to the effort to get Trump kicked out? Would you be surprised if, after all this shakes out, we found out this woman is actually a resistance activist? I’m not saying so. Although if I wanted to be like a liberal, I could I could make an allegation right here. “I don’t have any evidence but I could start making the claim this woman is a left-wing activist.“She’s got ties to the Steele dossier! She’s part of the effort to get rid of Donald Trump and has been from day one.” “You can’t say that!” “Why?” “Because you don’t know it to be true.” “Well, you don’t know that what she’s saying is true, either, but you’re choosing to believe her.” It’s a one-way street with this stuff. So here’s Harriet Michel who doesn’t know Clarence Thomas and look at what she said. There’s a lot of talk-back there.But she said, “I believe that for everybody to make this assumption that Clarence Thomas, the public persona, cannot possibly — under any circumstances, in a room one-on-one with a female — be gross and be obnoxious is out of their minds.” Meaning you’d be crazy to assume the guy has any morals. You would be crazy to assume that Clarence Thomas behaves himself. In her world, it’s totally reasonable to think that Clarence Thomas would force himself on women, one-on-one in a room! That’s what she’s running around claiming she believes.Is it any different today?Here is the final sound bite, and this is basically Charlie Rose and Harriet Michel. Just listen to this. It will be self-explanatory.BEGIN ARCHIVE CLIPMICHEL: Don’t you think that some men were struck by the fact that if this woman’s charge had prevented, uh, Clarence Thomas from going on the Supreme Court, that that would then, a lot of men interpret that as perhaps encouraging some other women to come forward and make similar charges? Don’t you think if they could get him there and settle this, that means that they’re not as vulnerable? They didn’t feel as vulnerable themselves about similar charges?ROSE: Let me disagree with that. I think, Harriet, that this at least — among other things — has raised a consciousness on sexual harassment and therefore it’s not so much getting men getting behind them. But it raised the consciousness, and I suspect that there’s a different kind of conversation taking place in the workplace in America as a result of this.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Ah, right, of course was. And that’s Charlie Rose out there saying that this will change the way men view sexual harassment. It didn’t change the way Charlie viewed it. I think CBS had to get rid of him, right? CBS is trying to erase any awareness that Charlie Rose ever worked there! They’re getting rid of all the pictures of him in the lobby and all of that. Yet here he was carrying the water for the left back in the Clarence Thomas days. So you see, my friends, we’ve been here and done that. There isn’t anything new except the players are different and the race is different. Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill were both African-American. Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford both white privilege.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Those sound bites of me on Charlie Rose are 27 years ago, folks. That’s 27 years. And you’ll notice that what I believed and stated back then is identical to today, rock solid because my core is my core. My core beliefs are not calculated daily or weekly or monthly or annually. They are what they are. You’ll also notice that nothing changes with the left. It’s the same things that motivate ’em and animate ’em and it’s the same strategies and tactics that they use. "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/17/lisa-page-no-evidence-of-collusion-at-time-mueller-appointed/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 17, 2018RUSH: We are not gonna be sidetracked by this thing with — ignoring other news out there. There’s really, really big news. Another bit of news about Lisa Page, who was the paramour of Peter Strzok Smirk. She “testified investigators had no proof of collusion when Robert Mueller was appointed — Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page admitted earlier this summer that more than nine months into the federal Russia probe, investigators had found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.“‘I think this represents that even as far as May 2017, we still couldn’t answer the question,’ Page told lawmakers during a closed-door deposition…” This is just icing on the cake. There was no reason to appoint Mueller. Mueller has not found any evidence of collusion. Lisa Page says that even when Mueller was appointed they hadn’t found any evidence of it, and there isn’t any evidence now, after two years!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, in addition to Lisa Page telling congressional investigators this past summer that they had no proof of collusion when Mueller was appointed, no proof of Trump or Trump campaign collusion with Russia… This is the FBI and her buddy Strzok Smirk and McCabe and Comey and all these other conspirators — Christopher Steele, Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS, Clapper, Brennan.None of these people! There was zilch, zero, nada, evidence of collusion when Mueller was appointed! Quick. Do you remember why Mueller was appointed? Because Comey engineered it! Comey took notes of his meetings with Trump. He then leaked those notes to a lawyer friend of his — I think at Columbia — with the express instructions to leak them to the media. This was to show Trump attempting to obstruct justice in the Flynn case.This was to trigger an independent counsel. It’s the whole reason they wanted an investigator or special counsel looking at this with no specificity. “Just look! Just search for a crime, find as much as you can for as long as you want,” but there was no crime specified. So this has never been a criminal investigation. They’re trying to turn counterintelligence investigations into criminal investigations. Those two do not lap over or cross over, because counterintelligence investigations generally do not produce evidence that can be used in court.But, anyway, she’s admitted that there was no collusion the day Mueller was appointed!This whole thing has been bogus from the get-go.The public was led to believe that the reason Mueller was appointed was to find collusion between Trump and Russia because we knew it happened; we just couldn’t prove it! Well, now we have yet another assertion on this episode. It comes from none other than Bob Woodward Friday on the Hugh Hewitt radio program in the morning. Listen to this. Question: “Did you, Bob Woodward, hear anything in your research that sounded like espionage or collusion?” You’re in there in the White House, you got people telling things left and right and you’re making up things that they tell you, Bob. Did you hear anybody talk about collusion?WOODWARD: I did not — and, uh, of course, I — I looked for it, looked for it hard and —RUSH: Oh, yeah!WOODWARD: — uh, so, you know, there we are. We’re gonna see what Mueller has.HEWITT: But you’ve seen no collusion?WOODWARD: I have not.RUSH: “I looked for it. I looked for it hard.” Bob Woodward. Folks, if Bob Woodward didn’t find any collusion, I think it’s safe to say there wasn’t any, because Bob Woodward could have made it up like he made up the quotes from William Casey, who supposedly came out of a coma for 10 minutes to talk to him about Iran-Contra. No collusion. He looked hard! So we have Lisa Page (paramour of Peter Strzok Smirk) saying that when Mueller was appointed, they didn’t have any evidence at the FBI or anywhere else of collusion between the Trump campaign or Trump and Russia, and now Bob Woodward.I mean, he looked hard! However many years he spent on writing this, he looked really hard. And he didn’t find any collusion. So we’ll have to wait and see what Mueller has. Mueller doesn’t have anything, because there wasn’t any, and yet look at that. Look what that is. Look at what that became. No evidence of the primary reason people think Mueller was appointed. It’s gone on and on and on, and what is its purpose now?To destroy as many people as Mueller can using the criminal justice system for things that didn’t happen in their lives related to the Trump campaign or the Trump presidency. Now, over here we’ve got the same group of people, same type — a bunch of Washington, D.C., establishment types now trying to destroy Kavanaugh. Not just defeat, not just keep Kavanaugh off the court. They want to destroy him and his family.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  By the way, just to repeat this because it’s gotten lost in the shuffle today: Lisa Page, it has been learned, told congressional investigators that — the FBI, the CIA, the DOJ — nobody had found any evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia on the day Mueller was appointed.  There wasn’t any.  They had found nothing, and that means there was no reason for Mueller to be appointed because the regulations require that a crime be listed for Mueller to pursue.  There wasn’t one, and they haven’t found any.  Bob Woodward (the other part of the story) was being interviewed and he said he’d been looking for it. Writing this book, he looked for it. He looked really hard, folks! Bob Woodward looked really, really hard for Trump-Russia collusion and in two years of looking he didn’t find any.  Bob Woodward, who the left takes as gospel, said there isn’t any.  There wasn’t any, from both Lisa Page of the FBI and Bob Woodward.  It’s being overshadowed with the Kavanaugh news today, and I wanted to make sure I passed that on twice.    "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/13/twitter-bans-term-illegal-alien-use-code-words-to-get-around-it/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 13, 2018RUSH: In addition to the news that we had on Google today and the not surprising news that they are an adjunct to the Democrat Party — and again, it’s a video, a one-hour video of Google high-ranking execs and employees unable to keep it together soon after the election. We posted it, exclusive video sent to Breitbart. We’ve linked to it at RushLimbaugh.com.If you have time, you really should watch it. And especially if it’s surprising to you to learn that Google is the Democrat Party. If that kind of surprises you, you really need to watch this. But it doesn’t mean that Google is hogging all the news. Twitter is in the news today. Twitter has announced that they are blocking posts that use the phrase “illegal alien” as hateful.So if you are going to be tweeting today or tonight, do not use the phrase “illegal alien.” Whatever they do to you, you’ll be shadow banned, deleted, or whatever, because now at Twitter they are saying that is a hateful comment.The federal government, U.S. Supreme Court, lawyers across the country use the word “illegal alien” to describe immigrants who are here illegally, but it is illegal to use that term on Twitter now. In fact, the Trump administration is reinstituting the phrase in their rules and regulations after the Obama Regime had tried to erase it from all federal records.Twitter is now blocking posts from promoting any messages with the phrase, which its moderators apparently consider hate speech. Quote, “Twitter is not allowing us to promote any tweets, including the phrase ‘legal aliens,’ citing it as hateful content, says the Center for Immigration Studies.” Twitter rejected a total of four ads from the center but provided only vague reasoning for the decision.So illegal aliens are now a protected group. Social media has become its own sanctuary city. Twitter and Google and Facebook are essentially sanctuary cities. So here’s what’s gonna have to happen. Those of you who want to tweet each other about illegal aliens are gonna have to come up with a code phrase. You’re gonna have to come up with something other than “illegal alien” to signify you’re talking about illegal aliens or illegal immigrants. And then the trick here is to fool Twitter. So you’re gonna need a code that all of you understand that Twitter will never find out about.“Rush, aren’t you worried they could hear you talking?” Nah. Are you kidding? Twitter doesn’t know that people like this program exist. And to the extent that they do, they discount it as unreal and tiny and small. You might want to consider just using the phrase “legal immigrant” to signify “illegal immigrant.” I mean those of you who tweet or you’re tweeting amongst yourselves or maybe put your heads together, come up with a substitute phrase that will not — look it, there are two guys on Fox standing out in the rain right now talking about how it could get really wet.Florence could pack strong winds and catastrophic floodwaters and these two guys are out there standing right on the beach in the midst of the rain and the wind to tell us about it. Note the valor, the bravery.Does the media give itself medals? Anyway, I just saw the 2 o’clock. The track of this thing has changed again. Now it’s — well, it’s just unlike — four days ago, it’s nothing like what you thought it was gonna be. It’s still Category 2, claim now to hit land as a Category 2, and it looks like it’s gonna hit the just north or actually east of the South Carolina-North Carolina border.The Fox reporters and experts are at Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, right now. The winds are 105 and gusting to 125. If that’s true, those guys wouldn’t be able to stand up like they are. So the heavy winds must not have hit where those guys are.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Hey, I’ve got an idea here for you people that tweet. You know, since the Twitter Nazis have decided to ban anything that reads “illegal alien” as hate speech. They’re banning those two words, “illegal alien.” I’m not kidding. If you missed this, Twitter has decided that’s hate speech, and they’re not gonna let anybody use it. If you use it, they ban you, shadow ban you, or whatever they do to. So here’s a suggestion. Just turn it around and make it one word, alienillegal, and let that be like a code phrase that you use with each other.Because you want to talk about this, right? But Twitter won’t let you, right? They’re gonna ban you or whatever, even though (chuckles) there’s nothing morally or politically or anything incorrect about it. But Twitter doesn’t like it. They think it is hate speech. So just turn it around. Alienillegal. Use one L in “ilegal.” You want a code phrase that’s close enough that people will get it without needing some translation card standing by. See if that works. My guess is they’ll pick up on that at some point. But we’ll come up with something else that you can use.So Clarence Thomas was the victim of a high-tech lynching. That’s what he called it. Brett Kavanaugh here apparently is the victim of a low-sewer smearing. Whatever the Democrats have to do in order to stop his confirmation, it appears they’re going to do it. I don’t understand though. They’ve upon the House. They’ve already one the House. CNN said today that the Democrats have won the House — the election is over — based on a poll they’ve done.It’s over. So why do they have to do any of this?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here’s Darren in Frankenstein, Missouri. Great to have you on the program today. Hi.CALLER: No, from Sikeston.RUSH: Frank’s what?CALLER: Sikeston, Missouri.RUSH: Sikeston. I knew there’s no Frankenstein, Missouri!CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: Sikeston is just 30 miles south of where I grew up.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: Anyway. I’m sorry, Darren. It’s our bad. We got people not paying attention today. My fault, not yours.CALLER: It’s okay.RUSH: I really wasn’t trying to insult Sikeston. I mean, it literally says Frankenstein, Missouri, up there.CALLER: No. It’s okay. It might be the connection; I don’t know. Can you hear me okay?RUSH: Yeah. I hear you fine.CALLER: Awesome. Okay. So here’s my thing. It’s amazing what our world is coming to and one thing I’ve found to combat stupidity on the pro Twitter thing is humor and I have kind of just a great sense of humor. So I love your idea, it’s kind of like a hashtag, though, like the reversal thing, but I’m thinking something a little fruitier like just using a word like “pineapples” or something, something that —RUSH: Now, wait just a second. Wait just a second here. I of course thought of something like that, but wait ’til they find out, because they’re gonna find out, we’re gonna have to keep changing the code. When they find out that you’re calling illegal aliens pineapples, the next thing they’re gonna think is you’re making fun of people that have acne and then they’re gonna start banning people that make fun of people that have acne or zits or whatever.You know, Manuel Noriega, his nickname was “Grapefruit Face.” Some people called him “Pineapple Face.” I mean, I get the idea here, but you gotta come up with a name that these goofballs at Twitter are not going to think is insulting to illegal aliens. I guarantee you, you might think “pineapples” is innocent, but…CALLER: Pineapple juice, I can’t think of anything negative to say about pineapple juice. It’s great for you.RUSH: No, no. It’s what pineapples look like. Remember, these are identity-based people. You start saying illegal immigrants look like pineapples, ’cause that’s why you would have chosen the word, you’re calling — no, no, no. That’s why alien illegal, with one L in there it — work amongst yourselves, folks, maybe you’ll come up — but do not pick a name, unless you want to really blow it up, do not pick a name that they will then come back and say that’s what you secretly think they look like or insulting them or whatever. It’s gonna be very tight because that’s what Twitter is gonna think.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. Got it. Here’s the term. We invented this. “Undocumented Democrat.” Don’t say “illegal.” “Undocumented Democrat” is the new term, ’cause it’s accurate. It has the added benefit of being true. It’s a new term for “illegal alien” on Twitter. Use that.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/10/trump-rally-crowd-recycles-lock-her-up-for-difi/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 10, 2018RUSH: I want to let you hear, if you didn’t see it… By the way, Trump rallies? Fox News has stopped carrying ’em now front to back. Have you noticed that? You have to find a Trump rally either on I think One America network, or you can get ’em on C-SPAN. But Fox no longer goes wall-to-wall. I don’t think there’s anything to be said about it. I just think that these guys go on for an hour and a half, and they don’t stop to run commercials doing them, and they are now campaign rallies. Since we’re in the heat of the campaign season.So I think Fox is dialing back, you know, on the potential equal time claims, even though there aren’t any Democrats doing rallies like this. So my point is that not as many people are seeing them. And last night this… It’s such a contrast. I have to tell you, folks. And I… This is the kind of thing that you just… If you have any observational powers at all, you can’t miss this. These people at Trump rallies, they’re not violent, they are not threatening, they’re not intimidating, and they’re not dangerous.And they don’t make anybody feel in danger or threatened. These are people having a great time. These are people that are upbeat and happy, they are excited to be where they are. They are part of something that matters greatly to them. They want to be involved and they are. The contrast to the makeup of people and their behavior, the Trump rally and your average, ordinary Democrat protest is striking!You contrast the people at this rally last night, it was at Council Bluffs, Iowa. You contrast that with that unforgivable picture, to me, of these kids clawing at the front door of the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon. (Impression), “Let us in! Let us in! Let us in!” Banging on the door and clawing at the door trying to get in. I didn’t know if I was watching the Wicked Witch of the West’s army or what, but it was certainly nothing that was inspiring or promoted, or you wanted to be part of.The Trump rallies are the exact opposite. And I don’t mean the people at Trump rallies are a bunch of nerds and dryballs. Don’t misunderstand. They’re just wholesome people, and they’re having a good time, and there’s nothing threatening or intimidating. And there’s a lot of laughter and just general happiness. And you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event.And even if you do have some happy people in the Democrat sponsored event audience, it isn’t gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is gonna get mad and outraged and get everybody else ticked off. And I want you to hear a little bit of the Trump rally last night. It’s about a minute’s worth. The Trump rally crowd has found a way… They found a way to recycle and keep “lock her up” relevant and current.THE PRESIDENT: How about Senator Feinstein? That’s another beauty —CROWD: (grumbling)THE PRESIDENT: That’s a beauty. “Did you leak the documents?” (impression), “Uh, uh, what? What? No, I… Did we leak? Did we leak? No. No. No, we didn’t… Did you ever see? No.” She says, “No. He just said no, we didn’t leak.”CROWD: (chanting) Lock her up!THE PRESIDENT: And I think they’re talking about Feinstein. Can you believe it…? Was that the worst body language? Honestly. In other words, did she leak it? A hundred percent. You don’t hand matches to an arsonist, and you don’t give power to an angry left-wing mob, and that’s what the Democrats have become.CROWD: (cheering)RUSH: You don’t hand matches to an arsonist. You don’t give power to an angry… Oh. By the way, that word “mob.” The left is incensed that Trump is calling their supporters the mob. And so now there are left-wing stories defining the word “mob” both on dictionaries and in Wikipedia and trying to make case that it’s Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats.They’re really… A bunch of Democrats, elected Democrats are just indignant and offended that Trump is daring to call their supporters a mob. They’re just, they’re so unused to having it thrown right back at ’em with the same force they dish it out. They are so unused to having their ideas and behavior being criticized, and they really can’t stand being laughed at. Oh, oh-ho-ho. So now Dianne Feinstein, “Lock her up!”BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here’s Matt in Omaha. Great to have you, sir. Welcome to the EIB Network.CALLER: El Rushbo, mega dittos from Nebraska.RUSH: Thank you, sir.CALLER: Been a lifer here in Omaha, and very grateful to hear your voice over here. Thank you very much.RUSH: I appreciate that very much. Thank you.CALLER: I was at the Trump rally last night, and staggering as it may seem —RUSH: Wait. You went over to Council Bluffs?CALLER: Yes, I did, sir.RUSH: You must not be far away. You’re on the border?CALLER: Exactly.RUSH: All right. Yeah. Make sense.CALLER: When we finally got in… We stood in line for about five hours, finally got in through the downpour of rain, and there was almost as many women in attendance as there were men. Some women were there with their mothers, some with their young children. I was amazed how many women were actually in attendance last night.RUSH: Why? Why were you amazed?CALLER: Well, I just keep hearing that the suburban women have completely left the Republican Party, and that was an exact opposite of what I witnessed last night at a political rally.RUSH: Well, I can imagine you were surprised. If you’ve been buying into the idea that women hate Republicans because of abortion and Trump being a misogynist and all that, then show up at a Trump rally and it’s at least 50% women, I can imagine you’d be a little boondoggled by that.CALLER: It was. I don’t know if you got any feedback from any other of the Trump rallies that you get feedback from, but —RUSH: Well, what about husband? You said mothers and daughters. Were the husbands there? Can you detect the men were husbands or were they —CALLER: The guy that I was sitting next to brought his daughter. He took her out of school all day so he could bring his daughter. I was just amazed that… I don’t think that there’s any misogyny whatsoever of the Republican base. I think that —RUSH: Of course there isn’t! This idea that this Republican War on Women is a completely manufactured lie! You know, Mitt Romney being asked in a debate by in response, “Do you think states ought to have the right to ban contraception?” “What? Who’s talking about doing that, George? I don’t care.” “Do you think so?”Romney stumbled around, stumbled around, and finally made the mistake of answering the question. “Romney says X on contraception! Republican War on Women was reborn and reignited!” It’s absurd. It’s amazing the things they get away with it happen the idea that the Republican Party hates half the population! I’ve never understood how that worked? I mean, how they pull that off. It’s nonsensical. I’m glad you saw that last night.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Donald Trump responded to Hillary Clinton’s criticism of the Kavanaugh event. She said it’s very, very bad. It’s attacking the integrity of the court. Trump said, “I guess that’s why she lost. She doesn’t get it. She never did.” Hillary said, “What was done last night in the White House was a political rally. It further undermined the image and integrity of the court.” A reporter during a press availability in the Oval Office asked Trump about her comments. “What’s your response to Hillary? What’s your response to Hillary saying that last night’s swearing-in was a political event?”Trump said, “I guess that’s why she lost. She doesn’t get it. She never did. I knew that a long time ago. Hillary never got it. That’s why she lost.” Hillary also said — get this — that the sex claims against her husband are not like the Kavanaugh confirmation because her husband faced intense investigation. Hillary has a point. We have to acknowledge she has a point. The allegations against her husband were substantiated. They were investigated, and Bill Clinton was found to be guilty!He was found to be guilty of all kinds of things. Kavanaugh is not, has not, and will not be. There’s not a single allegation against Kavanaugh that has any evidence or corroboration. But all of the allegations against Bill Clinton have been proven. Hillary’s right! She doesn’t intend to be, but she is right. The allegations against her husband were substantiated. Bill Clinton paid an $850,000 settlement to Paul Jones. Gennifer Flowers had audiotapes of his come-ons to her.Juanita Broaddrick told others about her rape immediately. There was a pattern with Bill Clinton and sexual harassment. There’s no such pattern with Kavanaugh. Oh! Speaking of that, did you hear about this? Jane Mayer — part of the duo Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow writing at The New Yorker. Remember that second story The New Yorker came out with that not even the New York Times would print because they couldn’t validate any of it?Jane Mayer showed up at… What was it, The Atlantic? There was some kind of a convention or festival or some such thing. “New Yorker reporter Jane Mayer suggested in a new interview that she and Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez’s uncorroborated accusation of misconduct by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh out of eagerness to show a ‘pattern’ of such behavior. [Mayer] told Elle her recollections of the Clarence Thomas hearings…“‘So having watched this before, I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behavior, since that helps establish who is telling the truth when there is a standoff…” There wasn’t a pattern! This is amazing. She ran an uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern. I… I’m almost speechless in my attempt to explain this. The first story that was run about Deborah Ramirez, nobody would corroborate! Her story kept changing. There was no evidence for it.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Donald Trump responded to Hillary Clinton’s criticism of the Kavanaugh event. She said it’s very, very bad.

"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/10/hurricane-michael-seems-different-and-devastating/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 10, 2018RUSH: I was told today that even the Weather Channel has evacuated their crews out of Panama City, Panama City Beach. I wouldn’t blame ’em. I think it’s ridiculous to stay out there and stand in the streets when a Category 4 is coming. The winds are now 150 miles an hour, and everybody is genuinely scared to death of this one. This one, it seems is different in terms of how everybody’s talking about it. All eyes currently fixed on Hurricane Michael.It is going to devastate the Florida Panhandle, Category 4. That puts winds anywhere from 130 to 156 miles per hour. Storm surge (which is the primary killer in hurricanes, by the way) is nine to 14 feet at the… That’s not… Don’t think of a storm surge as a tsunami. They’re two different things. Tsunami, sometimes you can’t even feel it. A tsunami’s not a gigantic wave. A storm surge is, and people get the two confused. It’s a big eyewall.It is well established. It’s not weakening. It’s continuing to strengthen. It’s gonna have a swath all the way up through Georgia. The way I look at it, it’s gonna hit Atlanta, then Augusta, and on into South Carolina, and right through the middle of North Carolina, and it’s gonna be dumping rain like crazy. The only thing different here is that this thing is not gonna stop and hover for a couple of days in the same spot.It’s moving at a pretty rapid clip, which is the only thing you can say about it. Now, there was a bunch of previously damaging hurricanes. There’s all kinds of misinformation out there, and it’s because of the corruption of news. People are trying to report today, “We’ve never had a Category 4 hit the Florida Panhandle.” It isn’t true. There have been all kinds of major hurricanes that have hit the Florida Panhandle.Experts have studied sea sediment and lake and river sediment and have found that hurricanes probably hit this region a thousand years ago, when nothing was there and nobody was there. Certainly nothing there to damage. There was a hurricane that hit in a similar location back in 1906, and it wiped out everything from Mobile to Panama City, but there wasn’t much to wipe out. There wasn’t much infrastructure then.So it’s crazy to start comparing financial damage with hurricanes of many, many years ago to today because this region was not nearly as developed with infrastructure and homes and businesses as it is today. The degree of damage that this storm is going to cause is immeasurable. But people are beginning to look at it as a rebuilding opportunity and a chance to, you know, build it all over again. But you cannot miss the devastation that’s coming with this.The governor, Rick Scott, says he’s scared to death about this. There’s no stopping it. There’s nowhere for people to go, and the evacuation plans have been underway for a while. Some people in condominiums and apartments are not leaving! They’re gonna stay there. There are those people that want to stay and live through one of these, primarily to see if it’s really like everybody says it’s gonna be. There’s a curiosity among some people.You watch the news, you watch TV, and they tell you how devastating it’s gonna be, how destructive it’s gonna be, how much rain there’s gonna be, how “you can’t survive it” it’s gonna be. And they say, “I want to stay and see this!” And then there are others who say, “I want to stay and I’m gonna protect my home. I’m gonna hang in here with my homestead. I’m gonna stay here with my pets. I am not leaving; you can’t kick me out.”So there will be some people who will hang on and stay. Now, this area is properly known even among the locals as the Redneck Riviera. In modern political parlance, it means a bunch of poor, white-privilege people live there. The Drive-Bys are surprisingly interested in this. I say, “surprisingly,” because there’s not a central major population center that can be totally wiped out, that they could equate with, “See? See how dangerous global warming is?”But there is a midterm election coming up, and there is going to be a federal response to this — and as far as the media’s concerned, there’s an opportunity. The federal response won’t be any good and so they can call this Trump’s Katrina. Don’t get mad at me for talking about this, because I’m telling you right now that is exactly how assignment editors and producers throughout the Drive-By Media are looking at this.They’re looking at this as a potential political event that they’re hoping might be somewhat helpful to them in the midterms elections that are only three weeks away. There is a heated governor’s race in Florida. Mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, running against Ron DeSantis. And then Rick Scott, the current governor, is running for the Senate against the incumbent, Bill Nelson. So there’s a lot politically at stake here.You can’t deny it, folks. And you can’t… You cannot ignore the way the media is preparing a bunch of different scenarios to report on this. It’s got the global warming component. That’s No. 1. As a Category 4, 150 miles an hour, there’s lots of destruction — human destruction as well. It’s got all the ingredients there. It is the Republican voting stronghold of the state in the views of many. (interruption) No, no.Look, you can get mad at me all you want. I’m just telling you: I know the media. You may think it insensitive of me to be speaking this way. I’m not. I’m telling you how they in the Drive-By Media are planning, and they’ll react at some point. Little Brian Stelter will go out there, “I can’t believe that these kinds of things are being said about us in the imminent danger of the storm!” I’m just telling you, it won’t be long to find out.This hurricane kind of came out of nowhere. It was little tropical storm down of the primary tobacco-growing area of western Cuba known as the Vuelta Bajo. Then it sprang to life as a Category 1, and the National Hurricane Center said, “You know, this thing is looking very bad.” Nobody was paying much attention to it, and then all of a sudden it’s a Cat 3 and it’s making a beeline for Panama City and Panama City Beach — and here we.The media is now focused on this. Do you think, Mr. Snerdley…? Do you think there is — and I know it’s gonna sound crazy. But do you think the Drive-Bys might be looking for a bit of a respite from all this Kavanaugh stuff and…? (interruption) You don’t think so? And you don’t think the hurricane is providing just a momentary opportunity for…? (interruption) Oh, I know they hope it turns into Katrina for Trump. I’ve just… And Kavanaugh. They hope it turns… And Rick Scott, of course.They want it to turn into Katrina for every Republican involved here.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: And all eyes remain fixated, once again, on Hurricane Michael. This next 45 minutes to an hour will tell the tale in terms of the actual landfall. It’s gonna be anywhere from Mexico Beach up to Panama City northwest along the coastline. Mexico Beach, I think is what it is, all the way up to Panama City, then Panama City Beach. But this eyewall, according to all of…And I’ve got some fascinating satellite photography here from the GOES-16 satellite. It’s interesting the way they do this. You know how they take the radar and they attach different colors to it. And what I’m looking at is sheer, solid black surrounding the eyewall, and most of the black is on the south and the west side. And then it gets a little lighter, then some gray, and then dark red, and then bright red, and then yellow, and then tan, and then orange, and then green, and then blue on the edges.Now, these colors do not represent rain intensity. They represent cloud tops. They represent the temperatures at the cloud tops, which determines condensation and can determine intensity of rainfall. But most people watching this have no idea. They think, “Oh, my God! Look at that, Mabel! Look! It must have been a hundred miles per hour. Look at that! It’s black — black, right around there. Dark red.” It’s designed to scare you. It’s designed to get your attention.It’s cloud-top temperatures. But my point is, it’s solid around the eyewall. It looks like the most intense area of this is due west of the eyewall, which is where the population centers are based on where the eyewall looks like it’s gonna hit now. But even on the east side… The east and northeast quadrants are where the strongest winds are, and those are gonna be blowing offshore — toward offshore — once they hit land on the northeastern side of the eyewall.But it’s a solid eyewall, and it’s a large eyewall. So it’s a very, very intense storm, and the next 45 minutes it’s gonna hit land, and then we’ll know where and the speed with which it will continue, the amount of rain and storm surge. So it’s gonna be a very, very bad bunch of days and intense, bad few hours here for people who live in that region, the Panhandle of Florida.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Pressure is dropping in the hurricane. That’s not good. It’s now 35 miles south-southwest of Mexico Beach, which is what I think the closest populated landfall area could be. But that’s just my wild guess. One thing about these storms: They’re reporting winds at 150 miles an hour, and they just showed neighboring cities and what the wind gusts are. The highest wind gust right now around 64, 65 miles an hour in the Panama City, Panama City Beach area.These 150-mile-an-hour winds are in the eyewall, folks. They are not the entire storm. I’m not trying to minimize the impact here. It’s just the reporting on these storms and the education on these storms in general is, I think, wanting; it’s lacking. Such as the way they colorize the graphics of these storms to make it look like hell on earth, when in any hurricane the strongest winds are in the eyewall and a little, you know, extended from it.But there’s not too many places they’re gonna get 150-mile-an-hour winds today. Where the eyewall hits and maybe 20 miles, depending on the size of the eyewall. Now, from there it will fall off. Nothing… I mean, 125 is no slouch. If you think that you’ve experienced 75-mile-an-hour winds and say, “Well, that’s not bad. I can…” The effect of 150 versus 75 miles is not twice when you’re in it. There is a multiplier effect of massive wind speed.So if the fastest and the highest winds you’ve been in is 75 miles an hour and you think, “Okay. A Cat 4 is gonna double this,” it won’t. On the ground, miles per hour it is. But the impact of 150-mile-an-hour winds versus 75? Just destructive capability alone is a factor of three or four. So 150 miles an hour is dead serious. That’s where the storm surge will be or the worst of it. The further you get from the eye and depending on the structure, the more the wind speed decreases.The rainfall is pretty consistent throughout a much larger area of the storm. But the devastating winds, the worst winds of the storm are only in the eyewall area. People can look at these storms and the graphics, “Wow, 150 miles an hour… Oh, winds all…? That’s all…? It’s the whole Panhandle.” No, it isn’t. I’m not trying to downplay the damage. I’ve just learned all this. We live in Hurricane Alley here, and every time one of these things…I moved here in 1997, and I quickly became a consumer hurricane expert. I became an expert in how to interpret and watch the media. I became an expert in how to analyze the graphics that they use, and I became an expert in where the actual worst damage of a hurricane is. You do not want to get a direct hit. Everybody says, “Yeah, of course, Rush. Everybody knows that.”Yeah, but outside the direct hit the damage or the strength of the hurricane diminishes quite a bit. It’s always the direct hit that is the most destructive, and then it starts to decline as you get away from the eye, depending upon the strength of the storm. Is gonna have a wide, destructive swath as a Category 4. Here’s Governor Scott of Florida. This was this morning, a press conference, audio sound bite No. 1. Just to give you a taste of how local officials in the governor’s office are dealing with this…SCOTT: I just spoke with the president, who, again, offered all available federal resources. We continue being in constant contact with FEMA and their team in the state Emergency Operations Center. That includes experts from Homeland Security, the EPA, the Department of Defense, Health and Human Services, and the Army Corps of Engineers. Along our coast, communities are going to see unimaginable devastating.RUSH: Unimaginable devastating. There’s a little hype always in this to get people to listen, to get their attention. But there’s always a lot of hype in these things. And, as an expert, a local resident expert, I can tell you that people who live in these areas for a long time have heard this over and over again, and very rarely are these storms as bad as they predict. So people, over the course of time, adopt an attitude and whereas, “Yeah. They’re making it worse than it’s gonna be for whatever reason, trying to scare everybody and get ’em to evacuate or what have you.”People deal with these in different ways who live in areas and have experience dealing with them. Now, there have been four major hurricanes in the two years of the Trump presidency. And not a one of them, outside of this mess in Puerto Rico — not a one of them — have the media been able to label Trump’s Katrina. They’ve tried in advance. They have not been able to. It seems the prep’s good here too.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, here’s the calculation on the force of wind versus wind speed. Remember, the force of the wind does not does not double as wind speeds do. The force increases in a much greater rate, and there’s a formula that scientists have developed. The force of wind goes up as a square of speed. So two times… If you’ve got 30-mile-an-hour winds that will all of a sudden become 60, the force of that would be much higher, say two times…You would square the 30. You’d get… No, you’d get close to hundred-mile-an-hour force when you get above the 75-mile-an-hour limit is what it really is. So the two times wind is four times the force of the wind. Three times is nine times. You square the speed to find out what the force of the wind is. So 150 miles an hour, it’s devastating. Now, where do those winds happen?Are those surface winds? Are those flight-level winds? And this is what you have to have the Hurricane Hunter data to know. But they are reported as winds on the surface, 150-mile-an-hour winds at the surface. I mean, there’s very little that’s gonna survive that. So we’ll see exactly what at landfall the true wind force, the wind speed happens to be and find out how close to the forecast it was.Now, look, this is a minor technical point. I’m probably gonna get in trouble for making it. There is a tweet here from the National Weather Service calling this storm the worst-case scenario. But it isn’t. It’s a Category 4. It’s not… The eyewall doesn’t look like it’s gonna hit a major population center. Now, do not misunderstand me. I am not saying it isn’t a big deal. A worst-case scenario would be Category 5 barreling right over Panama City or Panama City Beach.This thing looks like it’s gonna hit between or has hit between Panama City and Mexico Beach. Mexico Beach is such a small place that you have to expand the map to times 10 before it reads out that there’s a city there. This is basically a wooded area, not heavily populated, but Tallahassee’s right down the road from where this thing is gonna hit.Now, this does not mean that Apalachicola and Pensacola and Pensacola Beach and Panama City Beach are not gonna get hit. They are. But not by a worst-case scenario. I had to look… It’s a minor point. It’s no comfort to people in the zone here. It’s just, again, I’m a stickler for the way things end up being reported. People get all ginned up and worked into a frenzy over things, particularly in politics, and usually is not warranted.And it’s in this way that media and others so successfully manipulate people, whereas people that try to play it straight and deal with it honestly and straight on are a bit of a disadvantage.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Hurricane Michael now 155-mile-an-hour sustained winds, gusting to 175. This is at the eyewall. This is at the area of landfall, which is not far from Mexico Beach, up the coast of Florida Panhandle, about 15 miles west-northwest. The president today had a briefing with his FEMA people and Homeland Security people and as he is wont to do, he televises the briefings. One of the reasons he does it is so that he can let the media and everybody see what goes on at a cabinet meeting, what goes on at some other special meeting. This was the president being briefed by Homeland Security Chief Kirstjen Nielsen and the FEMA administrator, Brock Long, but Hurricane Michael.THE PRESIDENT: They’re reporting that this is one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit our country. Is that actually a fact?LONG: In the are, this would be the most intense hurricane that struck this area since 1851, if I remember correctly, so —NIELSEN: It’s a big storm.LONG: Yeah. Intense. Very intense. But —THE PRESIDENT: And this one is gonna be heavy rain or is it gonna be the winds that are gonna be the brunt of it?LONG: Storm surge and winds, and for Georgia they’re gonna see high inland winds; so you may see sustained Category 1, Category 2 winds with higher gusts. We’re expecting a lot of damage inland as well.RUSH: This is President Trump with the FEMA director and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen being briefed on Hurricane Michael in the Oval Office. Here’s more.THE PRESIDENT: Almost the entire size of the Gulf. When you look at it topically, it’s almost the entire size of the Gulf, and they haven’t seen that… Maybe they haven’t seen that at all. Nobody’s seen that before.LONG: The eye diameter is pretty wide, which, unfortunately, is not good news as it makes landfall. So some people may say it’s similar to an EF3 tornado making landfall in the areas that are close to the eye.RUSH: I’m glad this guy said close to the eye. That’s where… When you read about the high winds and the rain, that’s where the brunt of it is. Now, this storm is so strong that it’s bad as you get away from the eye. But the real bad stuff is the eye. This eye, I think I saw 30 miles… No, no. It’s not that big. Now that I’m looking, not that big. The smaller it is, the more intense, usually. And, as usual, it’s the north and western quadrants here with the wind speeds speeding up and heading in that direction. Here’s one more bite with the president still with the FEMA director and Homeland Security.THE PRESIDENT: We don’t know. I was going to Pennsylvania. It looks like there are thousands of people already lined up, and probably we’ll do that tonight and we’re gonna go down here as soon as we can. We don’t want to interfere with anybody but we want to go as soon as possible. You have… You know, right nearby we have thousands of people going tonight, and they’ve already… Many are there already.RUSH: Now, a lot of people… I get some emails when this stuff happens. “You know, you’re falling for it, Rush. It just approves what a suck-up you are. Trump’s not doing this for any other reason than he just wants to brag. He’s just doing this for PR.” No, friends. You may think that, and I’m not gonna try to disabuse you of it. But the president’s doing this because if he didn’t, can you imagine the stories that would be published?“Trump doesn’t care! Trump didn’t convene a meeting! Trump didn’t ask very many questions! Trump didn’t seem curious! Trump doesn’t seem to have any real interest since he doesn’t have a home there.” All this kind of stuff that they would say about him. He does this for a host of reasons. But most importantly, I believe, Donald Trump likes himself, and he’s very proud of the job he’s doing, and he wants people to see it. And he knows that the primary conveyors of information in this country do not convey properly information about him.This is only smart.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I was just watching a little bit of Fox News. They got a reporter out there standing in the middle of all this hurricane. His name is Jeff Flock. He was telling Shep, said, “Shep, you’ve been out here like I’ve been out here. Shep, I tell you, we’d much rather cover man versus nature than man versus man any day,” and Shep said, “Oh, oh, yeah. That’s absolutely true.” My heart melted. I almost… I almost broke down.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/25/two-pieces-foundational-to-understanding-the-american-left/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 25, 2018RUSH: First, Jim Geraghty. Folks, this is so right on the money. “The more time I spend covering politics,” Mr. Geraghty writes, “the more I’m convinced that a significant chunk of grassroots political activists aren’t really arguing about politics at all. These folks are actually grappling with personal psychological issues and projecting it onto the world of politics. Every problem they had with a parent is projected onto authority figures.“Every religious person who ever scolded them or made them feel guilty becomes the embodiment of organized religion and demonstrates its menace. Because they’ve had a bad experience with a member of a minority group, that experience reveals something sinister about every member of that minority group. The cop who wrote them a ticket instead of giving them a warning demonstrates the danger and corruption of law enforcement,” and can lead to Black Lives Matter.“[T]he boss who fired them for shoddy work exemplifies the inherent cruelty of the capitalist system, and every frustrating experience they had with an ex-girlfriend demonstrates some defect in all women.” And that could be the opposite. Every frustrating experience they had with an ex-boyfriend demonstrates some defect in all men. (summarized) “I think a lot of the issues they are grappling with stem from the fact that most of these people have never done anything big with their lives.“So everything has to be imbued with drama of an approaching Armageddon in order for them to feel as though their meaningless lives have meaning.” Now, I have said this over and over again a different way. Everybody wants their life to have meaning. Everybody wants to matter. And a lot of people feel overwhelmed, powerless, and like they don’t matter — and one of the faster ways to make yourself feel like you matter is to become a victim, member of an organized victim group.And when you do that, a number of sea changes occur to you. When you become a member of a victim group, you are admitting that you are a failure. But you are admitting it isn’t your fault! It’s society’s at large or the cops or capitalism or religion or something. When you become a victim, you are then signaling that you are owed. People need to give you something for all of the mistreatment that you have suffered. I think this is so right on the money, and I could give you some classic examples. Like transgenderism.I know that there are many transgenders in this audience, so I have to be careful here. I just want to tell you that there is a former — I guess he’s retired — director of the Department of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Medical Center and university who wrote many years ago that sexual identity is a psychological issue and it needs to be treated as such, not with gender-change surgery and this kind of thing.He said that it’s a sad thing, it’s very unfortunate, but it needs to be dealt with therapeutically and so forth. Of course, he has been ignored or destroyed depending on when his name comes up. But that’s not the only example of this. I think this is so right on the money, and there’s so many elements of this that ring true. The feeling of powerlessness, the comforting thought that it’s not your fault, that you’re a victim of some powerful entity or person or system. And then you become a member of the victim group, and you have instant rage and anger that is justified and encouraged.And then you enter the political system under the aegis of your psychological problems being legitimate political issues. These people all naturally will gravitate to the left because that’s where psychological disorders primarily reside. The Democrat Party has made it well known that they will use whatever they can in order to win power. So they have built a coalition of very disparate groups, minorities, including women and union workers over the years, African-Americans, Hispanics, Latinos, you name it. But in each instance, they’re not…In terms of the rank-and-file, they’re not successful. As Geraghty writes, they’ve really not had something big happen in their lives. They’ve not had something reinforcing that they’re worth liking themselves, worth loving themselves. Have you noticed the leftists are constantly angry? They’re always agitated. They’re never happy! Even when they get what they want, even when they get more than they want, they’re never happy. What kind of disorder…?Like last night Ted Cruz and his wife were hounded of how a restaurant in Washington. Ari Fleischer is writing about it. He says (paraphrased), “You know, I’ve been in Washington a long time. This is a sick town. This is a sick town! Simply because you disagree with somebody, you go into a restaurant and you start hounding them to the point that they have to leave?” That isn’t normal. But the Democrat Party normalizes it and promotes it. Validates it. Empowers it.So all of these various disorders of one kind or another become empowered and fundamentally important to the electability and future of the Democrat Party. The sad thing is the Democrats don’t do one thing to really help these people. Their policies don’t help them. Their direct attempts to help them don’t help them because Democrat constituents are constantly enraged. They are constantly angry. They are mad, unhappy, blaming everybody — somebody else — for whatever they think their plight is. They invest in the Democrat Party to fix it, and “fix it” means get even with whoever it is that’s responsible for these people feeling the way they feel.Get even with the church, get even with the cops, get even with the Koch brothers, get even with whoever it is that epitomizes capitalism. It becomes understandable when you see these people desiring tax increases on the rich. They don’t care whether it helps our hurts them. Doesn’t matter, as long as somebody gets punished. The Democrat Party has become the party where most of its constituents want the leadership of the party to punish!So Kavanaugh, as the latest example, is being punished simply because he is normal, simply because he has achieved, simply because he’s done something that most leftists and Democrats can’t and haven’t. That isn’t fair. It’s unequal. So he’s gotta be taken out just on that basis alone because Kavanaugh represents grand inequality. Kavanaugh represents what’s wrong with America in any way. So regardless whether he’s guilty or not, he’s gotta be destroyed!Once they set their targets, once they put you in the crosshairs, it doesn’t matter what you’ve done. You’ve gotta go. Because rage and demanding punishment is the elixir in their minds. That’s what’s gonna make them feel better. The thing is, it never does. Even when they succeed in having their enemies punished, it never makes them satisfied. And it can’t because, as victims, they have built a wall, a block to discovering what actually needs to be fixed in their lives to change them.By becoming a victim, you say, “I’ve done the best I can. I can’t do any more because the world’s stacked against me, and I’m gonna have my buddies in the Democrat Party protect me and get even with the people who’ve made my life miserable.” I think Geraghty is exactly right about this. Again he writes, “The more time I spend covering politics, the more I’m convinced that a significant chunk of grassroots political activists aren’t really arguing about politics at all.“These folks are actually grappling with personal psychological issues and projecting it onto the world of politics.” In other words, politics is to blame — and, of course, when we’re talking about who’s to blame, well, you blame the normal. You blame the happy, you blame the satisfied. Who’s that? Well, in the modern-day, it’s become conservatives or it’s become Republicans. That’s the battle that we’re in the middle of, and most people on our side don’t have any idea!They don’t recognize it. We think, “Well, this is the left. This is American politics, the Democrat Party,” and it is in the sense that these people are Democrats and vote Democrat precisely because they think they think the Democrats are gonna punish whoever it is that ruined their lives, made them miserable, made them unhappy, and it runs the gamut. You can explain this with every different Democrat constituency. You could illustrate the point with every group. Pick women, and you could make the point.Speaking of which, somebody sent me a note last night and said, “You know what, Rush? This #MeToo movement started out as a bipartisan movement. I don’t know what’s happened. The left has hijacked it.” What? The #MeToo movement was never bipartisan. Who thinks that? Raise your hand in there. (interruption) Do you think the #MeToo movement was bipartisan? You know why people think that? Because it went after a Democrat first, Harvey Weinstein.“Well, it must have been bipartisan.” No, it was never. Let me ask you this. Do you know of a conservative group that would ever start something like the #MeToo movement? You don’t. Do you know any? It would never happen. The #MeToo movement was a left-wing movement from the get-go. It was the Democrat Party, George Soros bought-and-paid-for structured movement from the get-go. “Well, Rush if that’s true… If that’s true, then why did they go for a Democrat first, Weinstein?”Easy! After Hillary lost the election, there were powers that be in the media (which runs the Democrat Party, don’t forget, in my humble estimation) that wants to wipe the Clintons off of the slate. The Democrat Party, there are some in there that want to get rid of the Clintons as bad as some Republicans do. They’ve known for decades what Weinstein was doing and who he was! It wasn’t a shock! The shock was the New York Times ran the story.Here comes Ronan Farrow, and adding to it, NBC blockades that because they’ve got their own Army of sexual harassers being protected in the news division. But the reason they went after Weinstein is because he’s a big Clintonista, he’s a Clinton donor, he’s a Clinton fundraiser. That’s what that was about. That’s why they went after him first, and as it kept going, guess who it kept outing? The #MeToo movement kept outing liberal Democrats in Hollywood.“We can’t have that!”The #MeToo movement was taking out its own people. The #MeToo movement was taking out its own captains. So the #MeToo movement had to make a drastic change in direction. It was never bipartisan. Now, people think it was because women across the political spectrum united against a single foe — sexual harassment and abusers — and it didn’t matter if they were Republicans or Democrats.But it does. Keith Ellison will not even be investigated for a legitimate allegation. The Democrats are ignoring it. Ted Kennedy, Bill Clinton, been through all that. But here’s a Republican didn’t do anything he’s being accused of doing, and look. He’s now gotta prove he didn’t do it. The rule of law is being stood upside down, on its head.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. My second piece that buttresses the explanation of what we’re up against and who it really is comes from is Shelby Steele, who is simply brilliant. He’s a scholar of long-standing at the Hoover Institution, a conservative tank of thinkers out there at the Stanford campus in Palo Alto. His piece called, “Why the Left Is Consumed With Hate — Lacking worthy menaces to fight, it is driven to find a replacement for racism. Failing this, what is left?”That’s the subhead. Now, here’s the conclusion. I’m gonna go backwards forward. Conclusion: “Yet the left is still stalked by obsolescence. There is simply not enough [real] menace to service its demands for power.” Meaning there isn’t real mean-spirited racism, sexism, bigotry out there. They have to make it up, have to manufacture it, have to lie about it such as Kavanaugh. He’s not a racist, sexist, bigot, homophobe, any of these things. But look what they’re saying about him.His point is they’ve run out of real menaces. “The voices that speak for the left have never been less convincing,” Shelby Steele says. “It is hard for people to see the menace that drives millionaire football players to kneel before the flag. And then there is the failure of virtually every program the left has ever espoused — welfare, public housing, school busing, affirmative action, diversity programs, and so on. For the American left today, the indulgence in hate is a death rattle.”They have run out of legitimate enemies and opposition. America is not this dastardly place they make it out to be, and they keep swooping to the bottom of the gutter and lower coming up with news menaces that they have to manufacture — and “hate” is the latest one. “How did the American left — conceived to bring more compassion and justice to the world” in their minds…? And believe me, in their minds, that’s what liberalism is:“More compassion, more tolerance, more justice. It’s absurd, but that’s what they think. “How did the American left … become so given to hate? It began in the 1960s, when America finally accepted that slavery and segregation were profound moral failings. “That acceptance,” the admittance, the admission that America had a really rotten element in its past, when America finally accepted that slavery and segregation were profound moral failings.“That acceptance changed America forever. It imposed a new moral imperative: America would have to show itself redeemed of these immoralities in order to stand as a legitimate democracy,” and as far as the American left is concerned, that redemption can never happen, by design. America can never redeem itself. America can never recover. “The genius of the left in the ’60s was simply to perceive the new moral imperative, and then to identify itself with it,” and that has carried forward even to today.  "

Great to have you, Rhonda. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Rush. I am very concerned about this weaponizing of sexuality by the left. I’m sitting here watching the poisoning of our culture by something I’m starting to think of as toxic femininity, only we’re not allowed to say that sometimes women do hurt men. You know, when women use their femininity or — I’m just gonna say it — their sexuality to manipulate, to control, to subjugate men, that’s wrong. And it’s toxic.RUSH: No. It’s nature!CALLER: (chuckle) I’m the mother with the four sons. We have talked in the past, Rush.RUSH: Hang on just a second. I don’t want this going over people’s heads.CALLER: Okay.RUSH: When I say that that’s nature, I’m saying that there are certain aspects of our humanity which are part of our creation.CALLER: Yes?RUSH: Remember one time I said, “The purpose of life is life”?CALLER: Mmm-hmm.RUSH: Life will do whatever it has to do to keep living. Well, men and women have to get together for that to happen to humanity. Men and women have to get together. Not two transgenders and not two gays. Men and women have to get together for the race to propagate and continue.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: And men are forever chasing women until she catches the guy.CALLER: (chuckles)RUSH: It’s the way it’s programmed, the way it works. Women naturally have this ability. Thank God they do! You know, some of this stuff is just nature and, “toxic feminism” is right. Toxic feminism has attempted to erase and write out some of what nature has created for the male-female relationship. There are, you know, bad women here, bad men over there. I mean, nobody is saintly and nobody is clean and pure as the wind-driven snow.CALLER: Right.RUSH: But what the left is doing… Toxic femininity is one thing. What they are doing. You’re absolutely right in what they’re doing in terms of destroying natural sexuality by claiming that all men, in their natural state, are abusers and predators. This has created… Have you noticed this, Rhonda? Have you noticed the hatred for men that some of these activist political women harbor?CALLER: Oh, you’re not kidding, Rush! I have the four boys — we have spoken in the past — and I have a husband, and I am sick of my men being shamed for simply being men.RUSH: Good. Hang on. Do not hang up. I want to continue this with you.CALLER: Okay.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We rejoin Rhonda in South Bend, Indiana. Okay. A little bit more time here. You were starting to say that you are aware of how much hatred — real hatred — for men has been created among women, particularly women who’ve been college educated in the past couple generations. You were gonna elaborate on how you know this.CALLER: Well, yes. I’m watching the… Well, for one thing, my third son is a political science student at a local university, and he’s seen the whole liberal agenda playing out. But I’m watching how my sons and my husband are being ashamed for simply being men. I see that they’re now entering a world where they have to walk on eggshells because at any moment an accusation could be leveled against them and their reputations and their careers can be destroyed.RUSH: Right. Around the wrong women, they’re guilty for simply being alive.CALLER: Yes. Yes. It’s diabolical, and it’s pitting men and women against each other. Where, you know, they’re looking for women they can respect. They don’t hate women, and they don’t look at women as just sexual objects. They respect women because their father modeled that with me. So when women, then, respect the men in their lives, it works together just beautifully.RUSH: You know, I wonder about this.CALLER: So at some point, this is going to backfire because every woman hears her biological clock ticking.RUSH: Wait, wait, wait. Everyone woman fears the biology time bomb? What does that have to do with this?CALLER: Every woman hears — at some point hears — the biological clock ticking.RUSH: And? And? So?CALLER: You want to find a spouse, a partner to find children with.RUSH: No, not anymore. Not anymore. It’s called go to sperm bank with your female husband. It’s… No. It’s called go to the sperm bank, find a way to have a kid or adopt. But no! Young women are being so poisoned about what men are or can be that many of them are forgoing all of that. They’re resisting the tug of nature, ’cause the tug of nature’s gonna pull them toward men, but they’re trying to resist it ’cause of what they’ve been taught. So there are a lot of… Look at the single parent, female head of households that are burgeoning in the country right now.CALLER: That has such a detrimental effect to our country. I know this isn’t popular, Rush, but it is just simply true. A child needs, if at all possible… I understand there’s divorce and all that, but a child needs a dad and a woman, because there are things that only a dad can give —RUSH: That’s old thinking.CALLER: — and there are things only a mom can give.RUSH: See, you’re dating yourself. That’s antiquated. That’s been proven as socially incorrect thinking. That’s one of these many traditions that we’ve gotta bust up and blow to smithereens according to the modern era of social justice.CALLER: Yes, and look at the fruit of it!RUSH: The fruit of it? Be careful. The fruit of it? What do you mean? Oh, you mean the results?CALLER: The results, yeah!RUSH: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The results. Absolutely. Look, Rhonda, I’m so glad that you called. She said that there’s gonna be a backlash. I wonder about this. Let me go back to my proffered opinion today that’s inarguable, that the left has nothing to lose with what they’re doing. That in and of itself constitutes what I think is a major, major cultural depravity, a major cultural descent. That a lawyer for a porn star can come out, Michael Avenatti, like he did last night, send a letter…Send an email to one of the lawyers in the Judiciary Committee claiming that he’s got a witness — multiple witnesses — to the fact that Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge routinely got women drunk and gave them the date rape pills so as to start a “rape train” at these parties. They’d get the women drunk and pilled up and then a train of men would go in and out of the room all night taking their turn, and he’s demanding to be heard!He’s demanding that the committee let him come in and testify since they’re gonna be talking to Christine Blasey Ford. Now, it wasn’t that long ago that this kind of… Even this New Yorker story features — with no witnesses, with no corroboration — that Kavanaugh was waving a dildo around in women’s faces. It wasn’t that long ago that if you tried that, you would pay a humongous price at the polls. The most recent example of it backfiring on Democrats that I can think of would be the Wellstone Memorial in 2002. It backfired.Is it gonna backfire on them this time? By all that is decent, the Democrats in the past 10 days alone should have guaranteed that they lose seats in the House and Senate if this country is populated by a majority of decent people. There is simply no way in the America you and I grew up in that this kind of depravity and indecency is rewarded, certainly not at the ballot box. I think if you want to trace the modern beginning of the exoneration of this kind of behavior for Democrats it would be Bill Clinton and maybe prior to that.But take a look at the 180-degrees opposite treatment. Here’s Clinton who literally did what he did. Hillary Clinton knew it and became the head of the operations in the Clinton White House to discredit the women that came forward with allegations about her husband. She is rewarded for that. She is said to be a courageous victim, but she held her marriage together and she held her husband’s presidency together. She saved the Democrat Party. She is a heroine for trashing the women that came forward.Ted Kennedy murders a woman. Let me rephrase that: Ted Kennedy is present at a woman’s death that he caused, and he ends up become the lion of the Senate with immense respect throughout the Washington establishment, including the Drive-By Media. Brett Kavanaugh is accused of things that there is no evidence that he’s done, that there are no eyewitnesses for what he’s done. In the Christine Ford story, four of the people she claims were in the room say they weren’t. She can’t remember the year or the place or the specific date, and yet they want to throw Brett Kavanaugh off every court!They want to deny his nomination to the Supreme Court. It’s only 20 years since these same people were trashing the kind of women they now bring forward and celebrate as heroines because they are helping to destroy a conservative. So you tell me: Where is our culture today? Where is the majority of our society? Because by all rights, even… I’m gonna guess here. But I would think that even decent women looking at this would have a real, real problem with this because of the lack of any evidence, the suspiciousness of the timing, the very fact that it is totally political and orchestrated at the last minute.When they’ve failed at every other effort they made to keep Kavanaugh off the court, then this thing pops up — suspiciously, politically — and now they’re finding other women when Christine Ford’s story is starting to fall apart. Now we’ve got dildos and “rape trains” and so forth and alcohol and pills and so forth. At what point do the people making these allegations just pay a general price in society at large? Yet these people think that they’re going to sail to a massive blue wave victory in November.They believe that a majority of Americans believe as they do, that Brett Kavanaugh is filth, that Brett Kavanaugh is so disgusting, he doesn’t deserve to be on the Supreme Court. They believe that they are speaking for a majority of Americans. But even if they didn’t believe that, it wouldn’t change what they’re doing, because there’s no political price for them to pay, in their minds. Their base wants this! Their base is demanding this depravity.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/18/should-it-be-so-easy-to-end-a-career/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 18, 2018RUSH: I want to ask you a couple of questions to ponder just as human beings here. Take politics out of it as much as you can when dealing with my questions. It’s impossible to totally do it, but I just want to ask: How many of you, as human beings, are capable of doing what this woman in Northern California has just done? For example and specifically, you’re minding your own business. You’re living your life. You went to high school with people. You worked with people and all that.You are a renowned left-wing activist. You wear vagina hats on your head when Donald Trump’s elected president. No, in fact, let’s not do that. You’re just an average, ordinary person. You don’t do any of that, even though this woman did. My first question is: How many of you would knowingly attempt to derail the life and career of someone you peripherally knew 35 years ago? How many of you would do that? Now, I don’t know what the law of averages is. I’m sure with as many people in this country as there are that there’s a lot of creeps and a lot of vindictive people.I’m not saying it isn’t possible, but how many of you would…? Do you realize how often this happens with the Democrat Party and conservative judicial nominees? But how many of you would do it? You didn’t know somebody well. You didn’t date them. They didn’t break your heart. They didn’t do anything to you that you can really… I mean, you can’t remember where it happened. You can’t remember even specifically what happened.This person that you are actively trying to destroy has been in public life for years, and not once in any of those occasions where his name has been mentioned publicly have you done anything to try to stop or derail it. But then this man happens to become a Supreme Court nominee. How many of you would do this? How many of you would either make up a story and send a letter? Which leads to my second question. My point is decent people just…This is not how people act. This is not how people think. I know there’s a lot of vindictiveness and I know there’s a lot of people that seek revenge. But that usually derives from knowing somebody well enough that whatever they did genuinely angered you or hurt you or harmed you. But this is peripheral. What kind of person does this — and then after doing it, doesn’t want to follow it through? I’m now seeing excuses being made for the fact that she doesn’t want to appear at the hearing that Grassley has invited her to speak to.“Well,” the excuse is, I, “look, I — I wouldn’t want to appear. I wouldn’t want to have to face those questions. I wouldn’t want to have to face those klieg lights. I totally understand this woman not accepting the invitation,” I’m hearing people say,” and just because she doesn’t accept the invitation appear doesn’t mean that she’s lying and making it up.” Okay. So we’re told by this woman’s lawyer that she does not have to corroborate her allegation. It’s not up to her.We have got to prove she’s lying. She does not have to prove she’s telling the truth. That stands justice on its head. The next thing we’re being told is “It’s perfectly normal for an accuser to not want to be part of the process of getting rid of her accused. It’s perfectly normal that she wouldn’t want to appear before these senators! It’s perfectly normal she wouldn’t want to appear. I wouldn’t,” they’re saying. “I wouldn’t want to do.” Well, not only would you…How many of you would get yourselves involved in this situation in the first place, unless you are a dyed-in-the-wool political activist? My second question is a little bit more basic. Is it really this easy? Is all you have to do to derail the career of an acknowledged-as-great human being and justice…? Is all you’ve got to do is send a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein? Is that it? It’s that easy?We’re to believe that all somebody has to is sent a letter, an anonymous letter — well, a letter requesting anonymity — to Senator Dianne Feinstein, and that alone can derail the life and the reputation and the career of a decent human being? Is it really that easy? Do we want it to be that easy? Not only is all you have to do is send a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein, but that you will automatically be taken seriously and that you will automatically be believed. If that’s all it takes, we could start a letter writing campaign to Senator Feinstein today!Could we not?I mean, we’re being asked to really swallow a lot here, folks. We’re being asked to believe quite a bit. These kinds of things just don’t happen in the real world except when Democrats are involved and the Supreme Court’s involved. And, by the way, you know, there’s a dance everybody’s doing to avoid hitting the bull’s-eye here. (interruption) What do you think the bull’s-eye really is here? What do you think has the Democrats so paranoid, so frightened, so agitated, so animated and motivated to stop this guy? What is it?(interruption)Well, yeah, but why? I know they don’t want him on the court. It’s one word. It begins with an A. This is all about abortion. It is about nothing else as far as the left is concerned. They want to be able to continue uninterrupted with their behavior when it comes to abortion. Sex without consequence, life without consequence. They are scared to death that a Republican or a conservative majority is going to overturn Roe vs. Wade. Now, there are other concerns too. I mean, just the fact that a majority conservative court is enough.Nobody’s talking about it. That’s how you know that that’s what this is really about. They cannot allow anything to happen to Roe v. Wade — and it won’t. That’s what’s crazy about it! It won’t. But is it really just this easy? That’s all you have to do. A letter from somebody that can’t even remember where or when or for sure with who some allegation, some activity happened. That’s all it takes. How many of you would do this? My point is, this isn’t normal, folks. This is not how the normal segment of the people in our country live and operate.And yet it defines, shapes, influences the way Washington, D.C., works. And it’s just another add-on as to why so many people are so fed up and disgusted because all it takes is a letter that Dianne Feinstein didn’t even act on immediately. And then when she did announce it, she announced it because her colleagues were gonna leak it, and the person that wrote the letter supposedly didn’t want her name used, didn’t want anything done with this? Well, then why send the letter in the first place?Do you think they have given one iota’s thought to the impact this is gonna have on Brett Kavanaugh’s life, his wife, his two kids, all of the people with whom he comes in contact? He coaches little girls in softball and basketball or whatever. He does incredible amounts of charitable work for the needy and the homeless. You think they have the slightest concern over the fact that they are trying to destroy a career and a life and a future? I can tell you right now it’s not even crossed their minds.Except to the extent that if that happens, it’s justified because this guy’s a conservative judge, and he deserves it! He deserves to have an excrement sandwich as his life every day. That’s how they look at all of this. But it really got me today when I found the woman’s lawyer claiming, “It’s not up to us to corroborate our charge.” (chuckling) It’s not? “No! We don’t have to corroborate anything!” As I said, this is just textbook. This is Harry Reid calling the press and saying, “I have a friend that told me that Mitt Romney hasn’t paid his taxes in 10 years.”And the press said, “Well, who’s your friend? Where’d you get this? How long ago?”Reid got mad at them. Dingy Harry got mad. “What do you mean? What are you asking me for? You need to go ask Romney why he hasn’t paid his taxes in 10 years!”The press said, “Oh, yeah! You’re right,” and they did.They left Harry Reid and they started chasing down Romney, wanted to know why he hadn’t paid his taxes in 10 years. All it took was somebody, a phantom, anonymous letter to Harry Reid claiming that Mitt Romney hadn’t paid taxes in 10 years — when, in fact, he had. Now we’ve got a letter to Dianne Feinstein that arrived this past July. Nothing was done with it because the Democrats tried to keep Kavanaugh off the court using everything but it.But now it’s desperation time.Plan B.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I just checked the email. Many of you are very concerned. Let me read a sample here. We had, “Dear Mr. Limbaugh. When you just said, ‘We’ve all done this. We’ve all done this since high school and so forth and so on,’ you better clarify what you mean. I know you were talking about underage drinking and playing spin the bottle and playing around. Yeah, but you didn’t mean that we’ve all held girls down against their will like this.”Of course because I don’t believe that happened. That’s the whole point here. We’re just supposed to believe what she says because she said it and she doesn’t have to corroborate it? Well, I’m gonna choose to believe Kavanaugh, folks, that it didn’t happen! That he doesn’t remember it happening, that he thinks it’s a case of mistaken identity. I don’t believe it happened! That’s what’s driving me on this.Of course, I do not mean to say that everybody that I knew in high school practiced habitually holding women down trying to kiss ’em in high school. I don’t believe that happened. I was not even referring to that! I’m talking about what happens when high school kids and even junior high — I don’t care today or back then — had parties. We all remember things, the hormonal rages, the coming of age. But I don’t believe the allegation! So I’m not even talking about that.I don’t believe it’s what happened. Maybe… I got another email. “Rush, have you stopped to think that maybe this woman really liked Kavanaugh and felt rebuffed and she’s simply taking all this time to get back at him for rejecting her?” Oh, gee. How can we possibly know any of this? And if she doesn’t have to corroborate any of it, then she can allege anything, and we’re supposed to accept it and try to disprove what she’s saying.And then she will not accept the invitation to come talk about it. Now, I don’t even think that I have to make this clarification because this is my point. None of you would believe that I would come here and admit to engaging in behavior such as that charged by this woman. But we all, in high school, did things. We drank when we shouldn’t. We snuck around our parents. This is part of growing up — and I’m talking about the innocent kind. Don’t anybody confuse things here.Kavanaugh didn’t do what she’s alleging. That’s what I choose to believe — using intelligence guided by experience, by the way. Let me ask this. Why is it not controversial to believe what she says but very controversial to believe his denial? ‘Cause that’s what I choose to believe here — and if nobody has to prove it, then what is the point? I take it back. He has to prove that it didn’t happen. Do you realize how impossible that is? That’s why our criminal justice system does not require that the accused prove it didn’t happen.You accuse?You allege?You have to prove it or you’re gone.Now, in the real world, as I pointed out — in court — a strategy might be, because juries are juries. Your lawyer might say, “We’re gonna have to find out who really did this and we’re gonna have to prove they did it as a means of getting your innocence. Even though they don’t have a case beyond circumstantial, we may still have to do this ’cause juries are affected by prosecutors.” I understand all that. But under the rule of law, the accused has to prove. And for them to come out and say that she doesn’t have to corroborate anything? Fine. I’m gonna choose to accept Kavanaugh that this didn’t happen because that’s not what decent do.Pure and simple right?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So there’s this Looney Toon on ABC, Matt Dowd, Matthew Dowd. He used to be a strategerist for George W. Bush. Now he’s gone left. He said, “If Republicans don’t believe a thousand scientists on climate change, why would they believe one woman from Palo Alto?” (laughing) These people… What a strange way to try to get people to believe you. This is absurd. All of it’s absurd.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/17/larry-king-gets-me-all-worked-up-by-what-he-doesnt-know/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 17, 2018RUSH: It’s Thursday night on the RT Network. That’s a Russian television network. It’s an international TV network funded by the Soviets, the Russians, and they had an interview with Larry King. And he’s speaking with somebody in Chattanooga about… Let’s see… Oh, it’s Larry King’s show! I take it back. Larry King has a show on the Russian TV network. That’s what it is. Larry King is talking to a radio host from Chattanooga about conservative claims of bias at Facebook and Google.By the way, speaking of which, have you heard the latest outrage about Google? Google, in order to do business in China, had to accede to ChiCom demands — and they did. And one of the things Google did is they built a prototype of the search engine, the Google search engine that will be used in China. They built a prototype for the ChiCom government that links every user’s searches to their personal phone number so the ChiCom government will be able to know who everybody in China is by virtue of their phone number and what they are searching.Google, in order to do business in China, had to agree to this. The ChiCom government can now monitor people’s search querys and will have their phone number as a means of either reaching or intimidating or just identifying them — and Google didn’t think twice. “Okay, fine. Is that what you want? We’ll do it.” Now, if they’re willing to stand up in partnership with a pure totalitarian, communist regime like the ChiComs, why wouldn’t they if one were elected here?If a Democrat someday is elected and wants this exact kind of data from everybody using Google search, you think Google would do it for a fellow Democrat president? They’re showing they’ll do it for the ChiComs, and they’ll do it ’cause that’s what they have to do to be in business in China. So, anyway, there’s legitimate outrage amongst conservatives at the bias. Did you hear Jack Dorsey? Did you hear Jack Dorsey, the founder, the CEO of Twitter, did you hear what he said about Twitter last week? He said that conservatives employed at Twitter literally feel unsafe to express their views at work for fear of what will be done to them by liberal employees.The Twitter CEO admitted this! He was on the Recode Decode blog, which is part of the Vox empire. It used to be part of the Wall Street Journal. He admitted it! Conservative employees at Twitter do not feel safe expressing their political opinions at work. So, anyway, Larry King with his show on the Russian television network is asking a Chattanooga radio host about conservative claims of bias at Facebook and Google. Larry King said, “Now, reportedly Attorney General Sessions is exploring a potential investigation of social media companies because of bias against conservatives. What do you make about that?”BRIAN JOYCE: Up until the late 1980s, we had a law on the books in the United States called the Fairness Doctrine. And by law, that required radio stations, TV stations to be fair and balanced. Well, it was Republicans — not Democrats, Republicans — did away with that law. So I find it ironic that 30 years later they’re complaining about bias and Facebook and bias with Google. Look. If we want to solve that problem, bring back the Fairness Doctrine, apply it to all media, including social media. But short of that, suck it up! I mean, you reap what you sow. If Facebook and Google are biased against Republicans, well, guess what? Fox News is biased against Democrats. Rush Limbaugh is biased against Democrats.RUSH: (chuckles) Okay. The Fairness Doctrine. It is clear that many people talk about it don’t really know what it was or what it. By the way, here’s Larry’s reaction to that. It’s only eight seconds, but we’ll get it in.KING: I know. I lived with the Fairness Doctrine for a lot of years, and I’ll tell you it worked. We gave equal… What was wrong with giving equal time?RUSH: Hey, Larry, the Fairness Doctrine wasn’t about equal time. You did an interview show, you needed guests to get your show done, you had guests from all over the place. The Fairness Doctrine was never gonna apply to you anyway. The Fairness Doctrine had nothing to do with equal time. (sigh) I get so fed up explaining this — and the reason because everybody says if it weren’t for Reagan lifting the Fairness Doctrine, this show would have never happened. It’s bohunk.The Fairness Doctrine was in place when this show actually started in Sacramento on KFBK, and it was the same show then as it now. There is no “bias” here. Bias is when you hide what you’re trying to persuade. We don’t make any pretenses here about the fact that I’m conservative and believe in that. I don’t try to hide the fact that I think liberalism sucks and is dangerous and destructive. There’s no bias. There’s no attempt to fool anybody here.This program is the epitome of up-front honesty. There’s no deceit! There’s no lying! There’s no misdirection! There’s none of this that is commonplace everywhere else in the Drive-By Media. The Fairness Doctrine didn’t say that if I have a 30 minute monologue ripping Democrats that I have to bring Democrats in for 30 minutes and let ’em react to it. That’s the equal-time doctrine. It’s for media in politics.The Fairness Doctrine had nothing to do with that. The reason it was lifted is because was it ambiguous, difficult to enforce. It was all about balance, and radio stations have to balance to get their license approved. The way radio stations… Say I have my show on every day three hours a week. It doesn’t mean that it has to be followed by three hours of commie bastards saying whatever they’re say. It just says that some time, it does.If you want to measure balance on a broadcast day, if you want to measure balance on a broadcast week, if you want to measure balance in a month, it just says that you have to bring some kind of programming that’s a little different any time you want. You don’t have to balance three hours for three hours, guest for guest, any. That’s the equal-time doctrine, and it’s not applicable to a program like this. (Snort!) That would be a problem, if the equal… But the Fairness Doctrine was nothing that these people think that it is. The way radio stations balance…Look at us. We’re the Excellence in Broadcasting Network, and we don’t have another show. Are we in violation of the Fairness Doctrine? No, because it’s not in place now. We wouldn’t be anyway because we’re not a radio station license holder. But a station carries this show for three hours a day, which is 15 hours a week. It just means that at some point they have to carry some liberal programming or some opposition programming whenever. It doesn’t have to be right after. It doesn’t have to be the same time.It doesn’t have to be measured in that kind of way. It just was nebulous, and that’s why it was lifted. As I say, I worked under it for three years in Sacramento, and it did not impair me in the slightest. One-day some NAALCP leader wanted to come in and complain about something eyed said. I said, “Come on in, man. Liberals are afraid to talk to me anyway. Come on in.” He spent 30 minutes talking about Senegal and how much he loves Senegal and we have so much to learn from Senegal, and I tried to make it interesting.I did my best to make it interesting. But the Fairness Doctrine’s not a suicide pact, and that’s how they want to use it. They want to employ the Fairness Doctrine to basically muzzle people. It’s typical of the left. They cannot deal with us intellectually, and they cannot deal with us politically, so they set out to destroy us. Whether it’s Kavanaugh, whether it’s Clarence Thomas, whether it was Romney, whether it’s Trump, it doesn’t matter. We do not try to destroy anybody. That’s not the objective.We get our jollies defeating them. We get our jollies educating people to who they really are, people on the left. But destroying people? Destroying their livelihoods, their reputations, ruining them? That’s something exclusively owned and operated by them. I keep waiting for the American people to figure it out. “How could at any time be more obvious?” But then I have to stop and pinch myself. The media. The media is not reporting this Kavanaugh thing in any way factually, fairly — and if people only watch the media, they’re not gonna learn half of the story here. (chuckles) I had other sound bites I wanted to play but Larry King got me all worked up again about what he doesn’t know about broadcasting.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/11/washington-soap-opera-obsessed-with-rosenstein/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 11, 2018RUSH: It’s funny to observe official Washington. You can do that by tuning into any Washington-based media. From day to day, you can see what the narrative, the top narratives are. The soap opera script of the day. It seems today that one of the overriding concerns among the Drive-Bys is the president’s relationship with Rod Rosenstein. The debate today centers on whether or not Rosenstein was kidding or not in a meeting with other FBI officials when he suggested wearing a wire the next time he went and talked to the president.What’s compounding this or confusing to people is that Trump has not fired Rosenstein. In fact, he had Rosenstein up to the White House and then had him on Air Force One, flew him around and got off the airplane with him. He said they have a good working relationship. The president still will not declassify documents that Devin Nunes and a number of other people want declassified, which would answer a whole bunch of questions about the soft coup and who really started it and when and where and all of that.And the president said, “I talked to Rosenstein — and I, frankly, told Fox News today in the morning on the phone — I don’t understand why he won’t tell people I had a great conversation with him. Some things he told me didn’t need to be under oath.” So the Drive-Bys are confused (chuckles) ’cause Trump talked to Rosenstein; Rosenstein told Trump everything he wanted to know. Trump says, “I don’t see anything wrong with it.”But then Rosenstein won’t go up to talk to Congress and Trump’s not making him do it! So people can’t figure out what’s going on. Let me tell you how to observe this or how to deal with it. Trust that Trump knows what he’s doing here. That’s all I can tell you. Don’t fall for the fact that Rosenstein’s playing Trump. Trust the fact that Trump knows what he’s doing and just be patient.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: It’s Ralph in Las Vegas. Looks intriguing up there. What’s up, Ralph?CALLER: Well, I have two questions. If you only take one, that’s fine. During the judge’s hearing, all I heard was the FBI only investigates. They do not come up with conclusions or opinions or anything.RUSH: I heard that, too.CALLER: But Fox News and the president have both bought in to fact that Connor (sic) did exactly the opposite. He was judge, jury, and not executioner, but probation officer for Hillary. He violated all of it. So why did he get away with it and nobody else can? I don’t understand. I really don’t.RUSH: Who is? Comey! You mean Comey.CALLER: Comey yes. I’m sorry.RUSH: I made the same point. When I heard they don’t draw conclusions. Comey exonerated her before even interviewing her.CALLER: Judge, jury, and probation officer.RUSH: Right. And we all know the reason why. She was the Democrat nominee. Their jobs and futures and the shenanigans they had pulled required her to win, for them to stay employed and for the tricks they had pulled on Trump to remain unknown. So she had to be exonerated. She had to be found not guilty and not even charged in relation to the emails and the trafficking in classified data and so forth. See, I had the same reaction you do? What do you mean, you don’t come to any conclusions?CALLER: I understand that, that she had to get off, but he did not have the right to. He was not a judge. It was never in trial.RUSH: No, he… No, wait, wait, wait. He claimed that he did because Loretta Lynch ended up having to… She didn’t officially recuse, but because she met with Slick Willie on the plane, on the tarmac out in Phoenix, Comey said she’s compromised. So he basically took over the gig of AG for the purposes of exonerating Hillary, and he went out there on July 5th, did that press conference, under the auspices of making the decisions because Loretta Lynch couldn’t.CALLER: So why can’t we just reopen it and say he didn’t have the legal right to make the decision; so let’s start over from where he just gave his speech?RUSH: I agree with you. And this is why… You’re not the only one. Devin Nunes and a bunch of his other House members that are on the House Judiciary Committee are hell-bent on getting to the bottom of this and not letting these people get away with it. They have been uninvestigated. That’s not the right word. They haven’t even been investigated. They haven’t looked at. You’ve got this special counsel which is ignoring the real crimes and criminality that’s taken place, while spending all of this time trying to find a crime that they can lay on Trump.And they haven’t been able to. It’s frustrating. This is why, by the way, there is increasing frustration at the president for not declassifying these documents that will answer the questions that you’re asking. They don’t understand why the president is protecting Rosenstein, the guy who, in a meeting, suggested wearing a wire in his next meeting with Trump to try to get incriminating evidence that Trump’s unfit.They were gonna gather the cabinet after Rosenstein had had a conversation with Trump, which supposedly was gonna show that Trump is insane and unfit. And they were gonna play that for the cabinet to try invoke the 25th Amendment. Rosenstein said, “Oh, I’m just kidding.” The people in the meeting said he was not kidding. None of us were. And I believe that. I believe these people back then were hell-bent on getting rid of Trump!I think they still are!I think official Washington, the political-media complex of Washington is still inside out and upside down over Trump. And I think with every success and every smile on Trump’s face, with every piece of evidence that Trump is enjoying this, I think they go a little further insane each and every time that Trump succeeds at something, that Trump is not damaged by… And every effort, everything that they’ve done to try to take Trump out, I think theory beyond frustrated that it hasn’t worked.And I don’t think they are giving up on it. I don’t think they will give up on it. Now, the Rosenstein or Rosenstein, however he pronounces it, heard it both ways, this is really curious. Trump had him on Air Force One. People thought that Rosenstein, “No way. He’s got to be fired after this, after credibly being discovered suggesting wearing a wire to entrap the president? He’sotta go.” But Trump says I got a great relationship with the guy.I’m not letting him go. I’m not doing anything about that now, and I’m not declassifying those documents yet. People are scratching their heads as to why. Some are saying, “It’s just the election, Rush. Trump’s not gonna do any of this ’til after the midterms. Doesn’t want any of this to become an election issue. Well, declassifying some of these documents that Nunes wants that would prove that there was a cabal, was running a soft coup or silent coup in the FBI, the DOJ.It would go a long way toward nullifying whatever it is that Mueller is gonna end up saying! And would establish that the deep state actually exists and has had as a project to get rid of Trump. Proof of that before the midterms would seem to be helpful. Then there’s the aspect of this that the allies in Europe, our European allies, a primarily the British, have asked the president not to declassify. (impression) “It’d be terribly, terribly humiliating, don’t you know. Terribly embarrassing.The Brits are very, very close allies of ours, and there have been some questionable behavior on their part, and then certainly wouldn’t want that knowb.” And the president said, “Okay. Okay. I’m not gonna embarrass you.” By the way, every bit of that’s true. This whole thing has been a circus involving academics from Cambridge, Harvard, Yale, and Oxford, as they intermingle with the CIA, the FBI, and MI6 in the U.K. I mean, academics and spies are pretty much the same people.The CIA and MI6 recruit students from the Ivy League and from Oxford and Cambridge and the U.K. ’cause they’re looking for smarts and, in many cases, they’re looking for left-wing tilt. Don’t ask me why, other than the obvious reasons. But Trump has chosen to protect the wishes of our British allies, primarily, and not declassifying some of these… It’s got Devin Nunes frustrated like you can’t believe. And some of his buddies that are on the committee as well.But back to your original question about the FBI not drawing conclusions. Comey did. They certainly concluded that Trump committed all these crimes and Trump this and Trump that. But in truth they’re not supposed to. In truth, they are information gatherers. In the case of Kavanaugh, the task, the job, WAS to go out and re-interview people already been interviewed and turn over the 302s, the interview forms, the results of the interviews to the Senate! To the Judiciary Committee. And they draw the conclusions. That’s how it’s always been.Look, I’m glad you called out there, Ralph, but I gotta go.  "
"RUSH","https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/11/if-democrats-are-headed-to-a-landslide-victory-why-are-they-so-angry/","For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 11, 2018RUSH: For example, let me ask a generic question. We had Eric Holder out there, who’s campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia. Holder’s supposedly gonna run for president himself in 2020. Eric Holder, the attorney general for Barack Hussein O, was involved in many scandals himself. And I’m seeing a lot of people on our side in the so-called conservative intelligentsia shocked that Eric Holder would say what he said.You know, Michelle (My Belle) Obama is out there saying, “No, no. My motto is, ‘When they go low, we go high,'” and Holder said screw that! “When they go low,” meaning Republicans… “When they go low, we kick them!” So people said, “My God. He’s out there inciting violence,” and he said, “No, no, no! I didn’t mean it literally. I’m saying that we can’t take it anymore. We have to stop being the nice guys and stop taking it anymore.”He did mean it. Obama meant it when he said, “They bring a knife; we bring a gun.” Obama meant it. So does Maxine Waters when they’re both encouraging people to get in our faces. They mean it! They are already inciting violence. They’re inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators. They’re engaging in bullying tactics. My question is, “Why? Why are the Democrats doing all this? Why are they inciting violence?”Let’s look at the things that they think are supposedly on their side, things that are helpful to them. We start with the fact that they are convinced that they’re gonna win control of the House. It’s already done. The blue wave, it’s just a matter of the days on the calendar passing by until we get to Election Day, where we can confirm that the Democrats already won. Remember, we had a poll from CNN and a sound bite John King couple weeks ago.He cited a poll indicated the House races are over. Their poll said that the Democrats are likely winners of the House of Representatives. So it’s over. In their minds, they’ve won the House. In their minds, they’ve almost won the Senate. They have the Mueller report. And the Mueller report is gonna link Trump to Russia; right? They know that Mueller’s got the goods. Oh, they can taste it. Ho-ho-ho-ho. Folks, they can scratch their backs with it. They just can.They know that Mueller has secretly collected the goods. They know that Mueller is gonna issue a report, and it’s gonna tie Trump and Russia, and it’s gonna prove that Trump stole the election from Hillary and that Hillary should be president. That should make them happy, right? Why all the desperation? CNN engaging in full-fledged, 1,000% racism directed at Kanye West. (Media impression), “Yeah, Kanye West is what happens to a Negro when he stops reading.”That’s what they said on CNN, with Don Lemon laughing and yukking it all up. It wasn’t that long ago the cover of TIME magazine… When was this? In 2005, the Drive-By Media proclaimed Kanye West “The Smartest Man in Pop Music — Hip-Hop’s Class Act. Defying the rules of rap, Kanye West goes his own way.” So what would that be? Thirteen years ago? Kanye West was the future. Kanye West was the hero! But now, Kanye West is having lunch at the White House today with Trump as is Jim Brown.By the way, Trump is funny today. (Media impression) “Why did you do that rally? Why did you do that rally with the hurricane coming and climate change destroying Florida? Why did…?” Trump said, “You know what? You have a point. But there were people that have been lined up for a day and a half to get in to see the rally. I couldn’t disappoint them. I had to go, and it was a great time.” Trump just slam-dunked ’em on a number of things in a short little press availability at the White House.So now a CNN panel calls Kanye West a “token Negro.”“Black folks are about to trade Kanye West in the racial draft, okay? They’ve had it with him,” they said. “Now all of the sudden because he’s put on a MAGA hat and he’s an attention whore like the president, he’s all of the sudden the model spokesperson. He’s the token negro of the Trump administration.” This is “ridiculous.” says the CNN panel.Why are they so mad, folks? Why all the separation? They’re gonna win the House, they’re gonna win the Senate, Mueller is gonna prove that Trump colluded with Russia. Between inciting violence and launching racist attacks, we are witnessing an attempt to bully the American population into surrender. That is what’s happening here.Their soft coup failed. Now it’s time for the second phase. The soft coup, that’s where Rosenstein and the rest of the guys are gonna wiretap Trump and are gonna wire Trump, wear a wire and get Trump indicting himself for certain things he was saying, they’re gonna get rid of Trump, the FBI, the DOJ, the Clinton administration, the soft coup, it didn’t work. Remaining silent about the Scalise shooting should have been a clue of the Democrats’ depravity and intentions.What I mean by that, there was actually a shooting of Republicans at baseball practice in preparation of a joint Republican-Democrat baseball game, a traditional, annual thing, and a lunatic, deranged Democrat fundraiser-donor-supporter from Illinois shows up, starts firing, and almost kills Steve Scalise. And the Democrats didn’t say anything about it, and the media didn’t condemn it; there wasn’t any condemnation. There was an overwhelming silence.That should have been, and it was to me a clue, to the Democrat depravity and their intentions. Now we’ve got Hillary. Now we got Maxine Waters. Eric Holder explicitly directing Democrats to physically attack Republicans, with CNN going full racist on a prominent, black Trump supporter. By the way, they can see the polls. Trump approval number in the African-American community is 35%. One year ago, it was 23%. That’s on the upswing. Democrats are strangely angry at a time when they think everything is going their way.Let’s look specifically at some Democrat strategies. How the Democrats have decided they want to defeat Republicans. No. 1, and in no particular order here send ricin. Send poison to the offices of Republicans. Shoot them at softball games. Kick them. Blacklist them. Get in their faces at public places. Falsely accuse Republicans of sexual assault over and over and over. Falsely accuse Republicans of tax evasion. Hello, Mitt Romney.Falsely accuse Republicans of colluding with Russia to win the election. Falsely accuse Republicans of racism. Register illegal immigrants to vote by giving them driver’s licenses. Create and publish phony polls. Indoctrinate students. This is the sum total of the Democrats. Why…? Do you notice what’s not on the Democrat list of things, strategies to win the elections? Ideas. Policies. The only thing the Democrats have? (summarized) “Get rid of Republicans because it’s ours. Get rid of the Republicans because we own it.“Get rid of Republicans because power is ours. It’s our entitlement. It’s our birthright.” No issues. No ideas. Not anything promoting because they can’t and don’t dare be honest about it. I just find it strange. All of this negativism and panic and hysteria and paranoia from people who are so convinced that they’re right and so convinced that America agrees with them; so convinced that the American people want them back in power. Why, then, all of this rage and paranoia and anger?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: How about this, folks: “Passenger with Emotional Support Squirrel Escorted off Jet — A female passenger was removed from a Frontier Airlines flight after bringing an emotional support squirrel on board the plane, the company confirmed on Wednesday. Police in Orlando, Fla., had to have all passengers exit the plane to deal with the passenger after she refused to deplane on Tuesday…”An emotional support squirrel? The first thing I thought of was: I wonder if this woman happened to be flying home from Washington after a weekend clawing on the doors at the Supreme Court or trying to harass Republicans in the halls of the Senate Office Building. “Hudson Valley Man Arrested After Allegedly Planning to Blow Himself Up” because he’s upset about Trump.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Yeah. So not only do we have a female passenger traveling with an emotional support squirrel, a rodent… You know, Frontier Airlines had to point out to people that we do not allow rodents on our airplanes, and a squirrel… I know they look cute, but a squirrel is nothing but a tree rat. That’s all it is. It has a little cuter face and has a bushy tail out there, but it’s a tree rat. It’s a rodent, and Frontier Airlines doesn’t allow them on their airplanes.People say, “That was just so mean. She needs her support squirrel!” Wouldn’t it be great if this is one of these babes that lost their minds in Washington over the Kavanaugh stuff? And then there was this: “A Hudson Valley, New York, man was arrested after allegedly planning to blow himself up on the Washington Mall around Election Day because he’s upset about the country’s direction.” Now, who do you think this guy’s gonna vote for?This guy’s obviously gonna vote for the nearest Democrat he can find. This is how they’re being inspired? Further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring people to vote for them because of the great improvements that will happen in their lives. Nancy Pelosi. Right here. “Nancy Pelosi: Trump’s Tax Returns a Top Priority if Democrats Win the House.” Now, how is that gonna benefit your average Democrat voter? Well, I’ll tell you how.The Democrats have so poisoned their voters; Democrat voters want revenge. Not a job, not a raise, not a bonus. They want revenge, and they hate Trump. So anything the Democrats can do to harm Trump, why, the Democrats will vote for whoever will promise to make Trump suffer. You think that’s a majority of people? You think that’s the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave? I don’t. I don’t believe that the country is that deranged. But the Democrats are counting on the fact. They think it is.Okay. To the phones. Ben in Fresno. You’re up first today. Great to have you with us, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hey, Rush. Thanks for having me on.RUSH: Yes, sir.CALLER: So I was there. I was in D.C. for the three days of the nonsense last week. I saw them screaming and yelling and attacking us and the folks. So what I felt was, this is all they have. The reason that they continue, the reason that Don Lemon’s saying the nonsense he’s saying on CNN, the reason that they just continue with this game plan is ’cause it’s the only game plan they have. And they’re hoping that the American people are dumb enough told them buy it, but I believe that the American people… Even in California where I’m at, the American people are seeing this crap, and they’re like, “This is an old game. We don’t buy it anymore,” and they have nothing else to play. There’s nothing else for them to do; so they just keep doing the same nonsense. And the look in their eyes? It’s like they know they’re losing, they know we’re not buying it anymore, but they’ve got nothing else to say.RUSH: Now, hold on here. That’s an interesting point, because if they do have the maturity and presence of mind, they do have to realize they’re losing. Trump won. Trump is getting elements of agenda either passed or implemented. Kavanaugh was confirmed. Everything they’ve done to stop Trump — everything, from the judges to the courts, travel — not much has worked. And so I think you’re right. They do realize they’re losing. And you think they’re in a fit of desperation, that they’ve got nothing else to do; that’s why they’re not proposing any ideas to counter Trump’s.CALLER: Absolutely.RUSH: That’s why they’re not proposing any new policies to counter Trump’s, ’cause they don’t have any.CALLER: Absolutely. The left loses when they’re exposed. The right loses when we’re silent. For so long, they’ve expected us to just shut up and go away at some point.RUSH: That’s true too. I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving, and Republican voters and certainly conservative media — well, some conservative media — caving as well. I think they’ve gotten accustomed to bullying working, the threats.CALLER: Lying. Yep. Threats. Lying. All of that. And they’re hoping that it’s gonna work again. And the only way it works is if we don’t show up. That’s why you see the polling data still showing them winning. That’s why it showed Hillary was gonna win in a landslide because they know that if they can dissuade us, if they can discourage us enough to make us not show up, that’s the only way they win. But if Republicans, if conservatives stand up, we’ll win every single time. We just have to show up. We have to convince other people to show up and convince them to convince other people to show up.RUSH: You say you were in Washington for three days. What did you actually see? What kind of activities were they engaged in that you saw?CALLER: Oh, I was right in the middle of it. I was live streaming the whole time. I went right up to Linda Sarsour and told her. They’re out there saying stuff… (unintelligible) They’re out there saying, you know, “Believe women and stop the assault on women,” and my question to Linda was, “What does Islam do to women? How does Islam…? You’re out here promoting Islam and Islam oppresses…”RUSH: And you get no answer because you’re not supposed to ask it. Linda Sarsour is the Palestine Liberation Organization apologist disguised as a feminist advocate. She was at the Supreme Court leading that clawing at the door.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here’s Larry in Pine River, Wisconsin. I’m glad you waited, Lar’. How are you?CALLER: Good. How are you?RUSH: I’m good. I’m very good. Thank you.CALLER: Is a real privilege to be speaking with you.RUSH: Well, thank you, sir, very much.CALLER: I just have a thought to give to you. As unhinged as the left has become and now they’re advocating violence, this really shouldn’t come as a surprise to us. This has been going on on our college campuses for decades. They’ve been trying to silence conservatives on campuses, and it’s just seems to be a situation now that if it worked so well on campuses, why don’t we take it nationwide?RUSH: I’ll tell you something, Lar’. I think you’ve nailed it. In fact, I heard noted scholar and farmer, Victor Davis Hanson, who is a senior fellow and thinker at the Hoover Institute (it’s at the Stanford campus in Palo Alto) say the same thing. He basically said what you just said, that the campus has come to American life. He made the same points that you just did, is that this that this violence and intolerance and bullying and so forth has now become mainstream left-wing cultural belief and behavior. So you’re in great company there with your thinking. That’s is exactly right. The question then becomes, you know, how do you get it back and relegated to the campus — and then how do you kick it out of there?  "

There’s a big argument going on here about putting polygraph results into the record during Amy Klobuchar’s time. Let’s JIP it and see what this is about.MITCHELL: I’d like to shift gears and discuss the last several months.FORD: Okay.RUSH: Oh, good. Here’s the prosecutor.MITCHELL: In your statement, you said that on July 6th you had a, quote, “Sense of urgency to relate the information to the Senate and the president.” Did you contact either the Senate or the president on or before July 6th?FORD: No, I did not. I did not know how to do that.MITCHELL: Okay.RUSH: She didn’t know what “exculpatory” meant either, by the way. Dr. Ford didn’t know what “exculpatory” meant.MITCHELL: Okay. Prior to July 6th, had you spoken to any member of Congress — and when I say “Congress,” I mean the Senate or the House of Representatives —RUSH: She had to have the word defined for her.MITCHELL: — or any congressional staff members about your allegations.FORD: No.RUSH: Yeah. Oh, that’s… Wait, folks.MITCHELL: Why did you contact the Washington Post then on July 6th?FORD: So I was panicking because I knew the timeline was short for the decision —RUSH: Yeeees?FORD: — and people were giving me advice on the beach, people who don’t know about the processes they were giving me advice (chuckles) and many people told me, “You — you need to hire a lawyer,” and I didn’t do that. I didn’t understand why I would need a lawyer. Ummm…RUSH: What?FORD: Somebody said, “Call the New York Times. Call the Washington Post.”RUSH: Who?FORD: “Give them an anonymous tip!”(crosstalk)RUSH: They’re trying to tell us this is not political activism and look at what she says she’s being advised to do!FORD: It seemed like the best option was to try to do the civic route, which is to —RUSH: Call the New York Times; right?FORD: — uh, go to my congressperson, who happens to be Anna Eshoo. Uh, so I called her office —RUSH: And she said, “Call the New York Times!”FORD: — and I also put in the anonymous tip to the Washington Post.RUSH: Yes, she took the —FORD: Neither… Unfortunately, neither got back to me in — before the selection of the nominee.RUSH: Ohhhh!MITCHELL: You testified that, uh, Congresswoman Eshoo’s office contacted you on July 9th. Is that right?RUSH: Yes.FORD: They contacted me the date that the nominee was announced. So that seems like — likely when it was.MITCHELL: Had you talked to — about your allegations with anyone in her office before the date of July 9th?FORD: I told the receptionist on the phone.MITCHELL: (whispers) Okay.RUSH: What is that!MITCHELL: On July 10th, you texted the Washington Post again, which was really the third time.FORD: Mmm-hmm.MITCHELL: Is that right?RUSH: Where’s my cigar?MITCHELL: Second date, third time?FORD: Let’s see. (shuffling papers)MAN: One moment.FORD: Correct.MITCHELL: And you texted, “Been advised to contact senators or New York Times. Haven’t heard back from Washington Post.”FORD: Yes.MITCHELL: Who advised you to contact senators or the New York Times?FORD: Beach friends coming up with ideas of how I could try to get to people, because people weren’t responding to me very quickly. So very quickly, they responded to that text for what (sic) unknown reason.RUSH: The Beach.FORD: Once I sent that encrypted text, they responded they quickly.MITCHELL: Did you contact the New York Times?CALLER: No.MITCHELL: ‘kay, why not?FORD: I wasn’t interested in pursuing the media route particularly.RUSH: What!FORD: I felt like one was enough, the Washington Post.RUSH: You weren’t “interested in the media route,” yet the Washington Post —FORD: (crosstalk) My preference was to talk with my congressperson.MITCHELL: (whispering) Okay.RUSH: Wait a minute.MITCHELL: So the Washington Post texted back that someone would get in touch, get you in you touch with a reporter. Did you subsequently talk to a reporter with the Washington Post?FORD: Yes.MITCHELL: Okay.FORD: Under the encrypted app and off the record.MITCHELL: Mmm-hmm. Okay. Who was that reporter?FORD: Emma Brown.MITCHELL: Okay. The person who ultimately wrote the story on September 16th?FORD: Correct.MITCHELL: Okay. Did you talk to any member of Congress — and again, remember, “Congress” includes the Senate or the House of Representatives — or any congressional staff members about your allegations between July 10th and the July — and July 30th, which was the date of your letter to Senator Feinstein?FORD: Yes. I met with Congresswoman Eshoo’s staff, and I think that was July 18th on the Wednesday, and then on the Friday, I met with the congresswoman herself.MITCHELL: When you met with her, did you meet with her alone or did someone come with you?FORD: I was alone. She had a staff person.MITCHELL: Okay.RUSH: Really getting a lot of ground here.MITCHELL: What did you talk about with Congresswoman Eshoo, uh, and her staff on July 18th and the 20th?FORD: (deep breath) I described the night of the incident, and we spent time speaking about that, and I asked her how to — what my options were in terms of going forward and —RUSH: She didn’t want to go forward!FORD: — how to get that information relayed forward.RUSH: She didn’t want to go forward.FORD: I also talked to her about fears about whether this was confidential information. Um, and she discussed the constituent confidentiality principle.RUSH: “Constituent confidential principle.”COONS: Thank you, Chairman Grassley. I’d like to ask unanimous consent to submit for the record five articles, including one titled, “Why Sexual Assault…”RUSH: Okay. Okay. We can JIP out. Chris Coons is gonna take his time. You see what I mean there. What did we learn about this? In that five minutes of questioning by the prosecutor, who was advanced? So I’ll tell you, what people are gonna say is, “Be patient. She’s laying the groundwork. She’s establishing the witness is…” What? Not remembering or is being very contradictory or what have you. You know, the gut reaction here is that this isn’t effective.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We’ve got some more questioning here from the Republican prosecutor. So let’s JIP a bit of it and see what’s happening here.MITCHELL: …how to take a polygraph?FORD: Never.MITCHELL: And I don’t just mean countermeasures, but I mean just any sort of tips or anything like that?FORD: No. I was (pause) scared of the test itself but was comfortable that I could tell the information and (chuckles) the test would reveal whatever it was going to reveal. I didn’t expect it to be as long as it was gonna be. So it was a little bit stressful.MITCHELL: Have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test?FORD: Never. (chuckles)MITCHELL: Okay. Did you pay for the polygraph yourself?FORD: I don’t — I don’t — I don’t think so.MITCHELL: Okay.RUSH: What!MITCHELL: Do you know who did pay for the polygraph?FORD: Not yet, no.RUSH: Ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. New York Times, Washington Post, lawyer?MITCHELL: You have a handwritten statement, um, that you wrote out. Did anyone assist you in writing that statement?FORD: No. But you can tell how anxious I was by the terrible handwriting.MITCHELL: Um, did you…? We — we touched on it earlier. Did you know that the committee has requested the — not only the charts from the polygraph test, but also any audio or video recording of the polygraph test?FORD: No.MITCHELL: Were you audio and video recorded when you were taking that test?FORD: Okay, so, I remember being hooked up to a machine, like, be — being placed onto my body and, uh, being asked —RUSH: What?FORD: — a lot of questions and —RUSH: Now, wait a minute.FORD: — crying a lot. That’s my primary memory of that test. I don’t know. I know he took, uh, laborious detail in explaining what he was going to be doing —RUSH: Are you kidding me?FORD: — but I was just focused on, kind of, what I was gonna say and my fear about that. I wasn’t listening to every detail about what — whether it was audio or video recorded.MITCHELL: Well, you were in a hotel room; right?FORD: Correct.MITCHELL: Uh, regular hotel room with a bed and bathroom?FORD: No, no, no. It was a conference room. So I was sitting at a chair and he was behind me.MITCHELL: Did you notice any cameras in the room?FORD: Uh, well, he had a computer set up. So I guess I assumed that he was somehow taping and recording me.RUSH: You just said you didn’t think so!MITCHELL: Okay, so you assumed you were being video and audio recorded?FORD: Correct.MITCHELL: But you don’t know for sure?FORD: I don’t know for sure.MITCHELL: Okay. Thank you.RUSH: That’s okay, because —(crosstalk)RUSH: Take it down. Take it… She remembers that it was all over her body. (interruption) What, you don’t…? (interruption) That’s exactly how she described Kavanaugh and Judge in the room: all over her body. The pol… (interruption) Well, no, she… (interruption) The polygraph. She just remembers the guy, and she was reduced to tears. She’s crying, and she just remembers it was all over her body. Hey, I’m just noticing speech patterns. A polygraph test. She reacted to a polygraph test in much the same way her description of what happened to her in that room is, is my only point. Let’s take another brief time-out, as we continue here on the EIB Network.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The hearing has resumed. I’m gonna JIP it here again. Mazie Hirono is now questioning Dr. Ford. Thanks for the call and let’s put it back up here.HIRONO: …she will persist in asking these questions all to undermine the memory and basically the credibility of Dr. Ford. But we all know, Dr. Ford’s memory of the assault is very clear. Dr. Ford, the Republican’s prosecutor has asked you all kinds of questions about who you called and when, asking details that would be asked in a cross-examination of a witness in a criminal trial, but this is not a criminal proceeding. This is a confirmation proceeding! I think I know what she —RUSH: Wrong, Senator. You’re running a criminal trial here!HIRONO: — very plainly, Dr. Ford. Is there a political motivation for your coming forward with your of the assault by Brett Kavanaugh?FORD: No, and I’d like to reiterate that, again, I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other — (interruption) thank you — what looked like fully qualified candidates.RUSH: Okay.HIRONO: And yet they’re not here to testify. Dr. Ford, I’d like to join my colleagues who have thanked you for coming forward today, and I — and we — all admire you for what you are doing, and I understand why you have come forward. You wanted us and the American people to know what you knew about the character — the character of the man we are considering for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. I want to take a moment also to note the significant personal sacrifices you’ve made to come forward to share your traumatic experience with us and the American people. You’ve had to move, you’ve had death threats, all manner of — of (chuckling), basically re-victimization experiences have come your ways. (sic)RUSH: Gotta make a note about this, folks, to remember to tell you something.HIRONO: But by coming forward, you have reintroduced the question of character into this nomination and hopefully back to American life, and rightly so. We should be made to face the question of who it is we are putting in positions of power and decision-making in this country. We should look the question square if the face: Does character matter? Do our values, our real values about what is right and what is wrong —RUSH: Hey! Does her character matter, Senator?HIRONO: — and when we treat our fellow human beings with dignity and respect? Do they matter anymore?RUSH: What about hers?HIRONO: I believe they do, and I believe the reaction we have seen to this coverage right now and your courage all of this country shows us that we’re not alone. You’re not alone.RUSH: What is this “we”?HIRONO: Women and men all across America are disgusted and tired of the way basic human dignity has been driven from our public life.RUSH: HA! HA! HA! Really? That’s a good one.HIRONO: The president admits on tape to assaulting women. He separates children from their parents. He takes basic health care protections from those who need them most. He nominates and stands behind a man who stands credibly accused of a horrible act. I again want to thank you for coming forward. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that six items consisting of various statements, letters, fact sheets, uh, posts are inserted into the record.GRASSLEY: Uh, is that one request or do you want me to wait for six?HIRONO: Well, I have six separate items.GRASSLEY: Okay.HIRONO: Because… I can go over them for you.GRASSLEY: Okay. No.HIRONO: I would like to —GRASSLEY: Let me not interrupt you. Your request is accepted without objection.HIRONO: Thank you. And I would like to read from a, uh — an item that has already been entered into the record. But this is from a letter from the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence. The letter states — and I quote this letter — “Do we start by believing victims of sexual assault and treating them with dignity, or don’t we?So far, Senate leaders are failing that test. Prejudging the outcome of the hearing. Sympathizing with her perpetrator. Attacking her credibility. … They send a message to every victim of sexual violence that their pain doesn’t matter, that they do not deserve justice [and], that — for them — fair treatment is out of reach. This will only serve to drive victims into the shadows and further [embolden] abusers.” Once again, Dr. Ford, thank you very much. This is a moment for our country.RUSH: Huh-shhh! It sure as hell is.GRASSLEY: Senator… Uh, Ms. Mitchell for Senator Crapo.RUSH: Okay. Let’s see what happens here.MITCHELL: Um, when we left off, we were still talking about the polygraph —RUSH: Oh! (chuckling)MITCHELL: — and I believe you said it hasn’t been paid for yet. Is that correct?KATZ: Let me put an end to this mystery. Her lawyers have paid for her polygraph.BROMWICH: As is routine.KATZ: As is routine.MITCHELL: Dr. Ford, do you expect the price of that polygraph to be passed on to you?FORD: I’m not sure yet. I haven’t taken a look at all of the costs involved in this. Uh, we’ve relocated now twice, so I haven’t kept track of all that paperwork. But I’m sure I have a lot of work to do to catch up on all of that later.RUSH: (laughing) For crying out loud. What? (laughing)MITCHELL: You’ve had a lot going on and you’ve had there for several months.RUSH: (impression) “I don’t know. I…” (sigh)MITCHELL: Is it your understanding that someone else is going to assist you with some of these fees including the costs for your polygraph?FORD: I’m aware that there have been several GoFundMe sites. I haven’t had a chance to figure out how to manage those ’cause I’ve never had one.MITCHELL: I’m sorry, several what?FORD: GoFundMe sites that have raised money for my —RUSH: The prosecutor even know what it is.FORD: — security detail; so I’m not even quite sure how to collect that money or how to distribute it yet.RUSH: Your lawyers will figure that out. Probably already have.MITCHELL: Um, in your testimony this morning, um, you stated that Senator Feinstein sent you a letter on August 31st of this year. Is that right?FORD: (long pause) August 31st?RUSH: (impression) “See, I don’t remember. My lawyers are having to consult with… I’m really lost here. I don’t… Let’s see.”FORD: I got her letter on July 30th, and I don’t have the date.RUSH: Yeaaaah?FORD: I’d have to pull up my email to find out the date of her email to me saying that. It was right before the hearings that she was going to maintain the confidentiality of the letter.MITCHELL: Say that again. It was ’til right before the hearings that what?FORD: My memory, but I can look it up for you. If you would like the exact date, I can pull it up on my email.MITCHELL: Yeah. I just —BROMWICH: Counsel?MITCHELL: I want to make sure I understood what she — you said.KATZ: That document’s been turned over to — in response to a request for documents. You have it.MITCHELL: Thank you, Counsel. Um, I want to make sure I understood what you said. Uh, was it your understanding it was going to be kept confidential up until right before the hearing?FORD: It was my understanding it was gonna be kept confidential, period.MITCHELL: Period? Okay. Um, between your polygraph on August the 7th and your receipt of the letter from Senator Feinstein, did you or anyone on your behalf speak to any member of Congress or congressional staff about these allegations?RUSH: Ohhhh.FORD: I personally did not.MITCHELL: So my question was did you or anybody on your behalf.FORD: I don’t… What do you mean? Did someone speak for me?MITCHELL: Somebody that is working with you or helping you. Did somebody at your behest, on your behalf speak to somebody in Congress or staff?FORD: I’m not sure.RUSH: (impression) “I don’t know.”FORD: I don’t know how those exchanges meant.RUSH: (impression) “How does that help me get rid of Kavanaugh? What does that have to do with getting rid of Kavanaugh?”MITCHELL: Is it possible that somebody did?FORD: I think so. It would be possible.RUSH: “What does this have to do with getting rid of Kavanaugh?” she’s saying.MITCHELL: Okay.KATZ: Excuse me. You asked her not to guess and now you’re asking her what’s possible. So I think if you want to ask her what she knows, you should ask her what she knows.(crosstalk)RUSH: This is just like a deposition! It’s exactly what a deposition looks like, which is not what’s called for here. But we’ll stick with it, folks. We gotta…FORD: (whispering) I don’t understand.RUSH: (impression) “I don’t understand. How does this help get rid of the judge?”GRASSLEY: You should answer the question unless there’s a legal reason for not answering it, uh, on advice of your counsel.FORD: So, I don’t totally understand the question, but I didn’t speak with anyone during that time frame, other than my counsel.MITCHELL: Okay. Um, you’ve said repeatedly that you did not, uh, think that that letter that you wrote on July 30th was going to be released to the public. Is that correct?FORD: Correct.MITCHELL: And is it true that you did not authorize it to be released at any time?FORD: Correct.MITCHELL: Okay. Uh, besides your attorneys, did you provide — you provided that letter to Senator Feinstein, is that correct?FORD: I provided her a letter on July 30th.MITCHELL: We’re talking about the July 30th letter.FORD: Okay.RUSH: Right.MITCHELL: And you provided that letter to Senator Feinstein, correct?FORD: (silent)MITCHELL: Is that a “yes”?FORD: Yes.MITCHELL: And you provided the letter to, uh, Representative Eshoo to deliver to Senator Feinstein?FORD: Yes.MITCHELL: Besides those two individuals — Representative Eshoo and Senator Feinstein — and your attorneys, did you provide that letter to anyone else?FORD: No.MITCHELL: Do you know how that letter became public?FORD: No.MITCHELL: (whispers) Okay. (full voice) After that letter was made public or leaked, did you reach back out to the Washington Post?RUSH: Ugh. This is painful. She doesn’t have the slightest clue what’s going on here, folks.FORD: Um, I reached out to the Washington… Well, they were continuously reaching out to me, and I was not responding. Um, but the time that I did respond and agreed to do the sit-down was once the reporters started showing up at my home and at my workplace.MITCHELL: Okay.MAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Ford, um, th-thank you for being here.RUSH: Okay. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. No, we’re not. We’re gonna bump out right now. Timing worked out perfectly.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Spartacus is doing the questioning. He’s not really questioning Dr. Ford, who looks… She’s in a side view right now. It looks like she’s on the verge of tears here. Some people think she’s stalling by acting like she doesn’t understand these questions, stalling as to prevent as many questions being asked as possible. Cory Booker just said — and Chris Coons said it, too — that they’re both getting overwhelmed with phone calls in their Senate offices from people who now realize that they have been raped or they are being sexually abused, and that Dr. Ford is an awakening a new unit of America.She is inspiring — with her courage — numbers and numbers of people to finally come forward. Spartacus and Chris Coons are saying this is a wonderful, wonderful thing here. Now I have a story. I was waiting for this. “Boys More Likely to Be Victims of Teen Dating Violence than Girls, Study Shows.” You want to talk about phone calls? I can tell you this. I have been told by some ranking Republican staff people for members of the House and Senate that a lot of women are alarmed at all of this because of what it’s doing to their sons, what this is maybe going to cause to happen to their sons, this characterization of boys that’s taking place here.In other words, this may be backfiring in a sense on some people with women who don’t like what’s being done to their sons in this whole process.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let’s rejoin as the Republican prosecutor is again querying the witness.MITCHELL: This is not a cognitive interview. Um, did anybody ever advise you — from Senator Feinstein’s office or from Representative Eshoo’s office — to go get a forensic interview?FORD: (long pause) No.MITCHELL: Instead, you were advised to get an attorney and take a polygraph. Is that right?FORD: Many people advised me to get an attorney. Um, once I had an attorney, my attorney and I discussed using the polygraph.MITCHELL: And instead of submitting to an interview in California, we’re having a hearing here today in five-minute increments. Is that right?FORD: I — I agree that’s what was agreed upon by the collegial (sic) group here.MITCHELL: Thank you. I have no further questions.GRASSLEY: Okay, uh, I have something to submit for the record. We received, uh, three statements under penalty of felony from three witnesses identified by Dr. Ford, Mark Judge, Leland Keyser, and Patrick Smith. All three denied any knowledge of the incident or gathering described by Dr. Ford. Without objection, I’ll enter in the record.BROMWICH: Mr. Chairman, I have, uh, something for the record as well, a number of letters from the witness’s family, friends, including her husband.GRASSLEY: Okay. Uh, I’ll get to you just soon as the ranking member.FEINSTEIN: Mr. Chariman, uh, I have three letters addressed to both you and, um, the ranking member and I’d ask that they be entered into the record.GRASSLEY: Without objection.FEINSTEIN: And it’s also my understanding that Mr. Judge is not willing to come forward to answer our questions. Um, as a result, we cannot test his memory or make any assessment of his thoughtfulness or character. Ummm.RUSH: No, he just denied it under oath, that’s all.FEINSTEIN: That’s why the failure to call him to testify is so very critical, and I hope the majority would reconsider that.RUSH: Yeah. Right. (grumbling)GRASSLEY: Senator Blumenthal?BLUMENTHAL: Mr. Chairman, I ask if you have sworn statements that you’re submitting for the record, that we have those individuals come before us so that we can ask some questions about those statements. I think that the nature of this proceeding would be compromised if we lack an opportunity to ask them questions about sworn statements that will be part of the record. So frankly, uh, Mr. Chairman, I would object to entering them in the record.WHITEHOUSE: Mr. Chairman?GRASSLEY: Senator Whitehouse?WHITEHOUSE: I have a number of letters that I would like to ask submitted, uh, to the record, ummm, that relate to the importance of proper investigation by trained professionals in pulling, uh, these kind of — of, uh, investigations together from the leadership conference on human rights, the National Women’s Law Center, the National Organization for Women, and so forth.GRASSLEY: Without objection. (crosstalk) Senator Kennedy?KENNEDY: Mr. Chairman, I have a question for our chairman. The — the statements, uh, that Senator Blumenthal talked about? Those were statements taken by our majority staff, is that right?GRASSLEY: They’re already in the record.KENNEDY: Yes, sir, but those statements were taken by majority staff?GRASSLEY: Yes.KENNEDY: Uh, did majority staff participate?GRASSLEY: No.KENNEDY: Why not?GRASSLEY: Uh, you’ll have to asked them.KENNEDY: Well, were they instructed not to participate?GRASSLEY: No.KENNEDY: They chose not to?GRASSLEY: That’s right.FEINSTEIN: I-i-if I may, Mr. Chairman, I’m told that minority staff was not notified.KENNEDY: If I could, I still think I have the floor, Mr. Chairman.GRASSLEY: Let’s listen to Senator Feinstein.BROMWICH: Can we be excused?GRASSLEY: Um… Uh…FEINSTEIN: I am told by staff —BROMWICH: Um, uh, the witness is very tired.(crosstalk)GRASSLEY: If you’d wait just a minute, I’d like to judgment thank Dr. Ford.BROMWICH: All right.GRASSLEY: In fact, we’re gonna continue this meeting. We can, uh, uh… So let’s just be nice to her.(ripple of laughter)GRASSLEY: Dr. Ford? Dr. Ford, I — I can only speak of one of 21 senators here, but I thank you very much for testimony, and more importantly for your bravery coming out and trying to answer our questions as best you could remember. Thank you very much. We’ll adjourn for 45 minutes — or, not adjourn, take a break for 45 minutes.RUSH: I guess that’s it. She’s finished. That’s it! That’s it. The Democrats are flooding the zone with letters from this and that claiming that didn’t happen, that should happen, the Republicans stink, the Republicans are mean, the Republicans are racist — and the Democrats want to submit all those letters. The big deal here… Grassley announced it and then the Democrats immediately flooded the zone so everybody forget it. But Grassley’s got sworn affidavits from her three witnesses claiming it didn’t happen!And their sworn affidavits, as he said, are “under penalty of felony.” Meaning felony perjury! “See you later. Here’s the orange jumpsuit. Say good-bye to anybody that you care about ’cause it’s gonna be a few years before you see ’em.” They have signed these sworn affidavits. The incident didn’t happen! They were not there. And one of them is her best friend or at the time a good friend of hers, Leland Keyser — who, by the way, as an added little bit of information, used to be married to Bob Beckel. (interruption)Yeah, this Blasey Ford, one of her best friends was married to Bob Beckel for a few years. So Leland Keyser has obviously has run in Democrat activist circles, and she is saying the incident didn’t happen. Dr. Ford places her there! Dr. Ford says she was there. In one of her more lucid moments, she said she doesn’t remember everything, but she does remember enough to put her there. Anyway when Grassley entered those three into the record, that’s when the Democrats lost their cookies and started introducing tiddlywinks and Monopoly money and everything else into the record to try to cover it up.There’s another lie that Blumenthal and all these Democrats are saying, and that’s that Mark Judge has not testified. He has! The committee staff, the Senate Judiciary Committee staff has interviewed Mark Judge. He has testified. Well, he has submitted to questions. He hasn’t testified but he has been interviewed under oath by the Judiciary Committee staff. Richard Blumenthal, who is such a stranger to the truth anyway, is still out there lying about it! And he’s not the only one.We had Senator Kamala Harris, who has been flooding Facebook with 3600 ads, anti-Kavanaugh ads. She ended by saying that Blasey has nothing to gain by doing this, which caused Blasey to start tearing up. Never mind that she has a lot to gain. She gonna be a hero to all of her beach buddies out in Santa Cruz. The books? The movie deals? The Democrats… If Kavanaugh… Well, it doesn’t matter. If Kavanaugh’s confirmed or not, this woman is now in Anita Hill’s league, and she will be made a heroine. She will get book deals.An incident that she doesn’t know where, when, or what will be written about in a 400-page memoir for which she will be given a Hillary Clinton-type advance of $10 million. Because the publishers and everybody else will make the mistake of thinking the American people can’t get enough of Christine Ford (they’re gonna make that mistake), just like they think they couldn’t get enough of Hillary. All this is coming, and this is gonna be the HBO movie. So what do you mean nothing to lose, nothing to gain?This is absolutely absurd. She’s got everything in the world to gain. She can quit her job. She doesn’t have to pay her lawyers anything. So now we’ll have to find out if anybody thought that the Republican prosecutor succeeded in linking Christine Ford to the Democrat Party and this whole thing as being nothing more than a Democrat Party strategic operation, which, folks, that’s what it is! All of this today is designed to cloud and make murky the issue. Just start with the timing of this.The fact that Kavanaugh has been nominated to several courts and the woman never popped up once. She pops up and supposedly doesn’t want to be known but is and doesn’t have seem to have a problem with it now. She shows up at the last moment, after it looks like the Democrats have failed in their quest to keep Kavanaugh off the court. There’s no question the Democrat Party’s behind this. That’s what they do! This is why I think there’s going to be some kind of a backlash in November.By the way, remember all of the times we had polling data on the midterms back in May and June, and I would caution everybody to remember, “The events that are gonna shape the November elections haven’t even happened yet.” Well, this is one of those events. Now that it’s happened, this is gonna shape them. It’s gonna have some impact on the November elections. We don’t know yet what. We don’t know if there’s gonna be a backlash against Democrats. By all rights, there should be.We don’t know if there’s gonna be a backlash against Republicans for not stopping this, for not having the vote earlier, for falling prey to yet another Democrat stall technique. It’s up for grabs right now as to what the outcome of this will be. By the way, Richard Blumenthal — who lied about valorous service in Vietnam — objected to the affidavits of the three people named by Ford as not being at the incident. They weren’t there. It didn’t happen. As far as they know, it wasn’t there.Blumenthal objected to those being put in the record without those three being brought forward in chains to be queried and interrogated about it. Grassley pointed out the Democrats refused to be at the committee when those affidavits were made! Grassley reminded him: You had a chance to talk to these people and you didn’t! The Democrats refused to be part of the interview with Judge or any of the other four witnesses. They have been interviewed by this committee. The Democrats chose not to show up and are now lying to everybody about the fact they were left out of the process. They were not!  "
