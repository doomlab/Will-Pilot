"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/02/04/durbin-only-way-to-avoid-shutdown-is-gop-joining-with-democrats-to-oppose-shutdown/","During an event at Georgetown University on Monday, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) stated that the “only way” another government shutdown can be avoided is if Republicans in the Senate join Democrats to say, “we’re just not going to go through this again.”Durbin said, “The only way to avoid another shutdown is if Republican senators will join Democratic senators and say, we’re just not going to go through this again. I think we’re close to that. I think there are enough Republicans that are just fed up with it. … So, we need 60, 47, we need 13 of them. At a high-water mark, we had nine, before this last shutdown was lifted. I think it’ll be hard as heck for the president to keep his ranks solid among Senate Republicans if he tries to go for another shutdown. So, I’ve got my fingers crossed that that will avoid that possibility. With votes in the Senate and in the House, we can fund the government, maybe even over his veto…if it reaches that point.”Durbin added that it is possible to find common ground on immigration, “but I don’t know if we can find common ground with this president.”(h/t Grabien)Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Karen Bass (D-CA), the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) should just give the State of the Union address “since she’s obviously the one running the country.”.@SpeakerPelosi should give the State of the Union since she's obviously the one running the country.— Congressmember Bass (@RepKarenBass) January 25, 2019Pelosi cancelled Tuesday’s State of the Union address and said on Friday, after Trump decided to open the government on Democrats’ terms, that she and Trump still have to “discuss a mutually agreeable date.”“The State of the Union is not planned now,” Pelosi said when asked if there will be a State of the Union address on Tuesday. “What I said to the president is when the government is open we will discuss a mutually agreeable date, and I’ll look forward to doing that and welcoming the president to the House of Representatives for the State of the Union when we agree on that.”SOTU on Tuesday? Pelosi doesn't seem to think so: pic.twitter.com/ERpaCFrPM0— Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) January 25, 2019Pelosi indicated that the State of the Union address will occur only after the government is permanently open. Trump, though, warned that he is willing to shut down the government again on February 15 if he does not get a “fair deal from Congress.”“If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government either shuts down on February 15th again or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States to address this emergency,” Trump said on Friday.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/25/senate-approves-short-term-spending-bill-by-voice-vote/","The Senate approved a three-week short-term spending bill by voice vote on Friday, which would end the government shutdown if passed by the House and signed by President Donald Trump.The Senate passed a short-term spending bill on Friday afternoon after President Trump announced a deal with congressional leaders that would temporarily open the government and allow for Congress and the president to work out a potential compromise that would fund Trump’s proposed wall along America’s southern border.The bill will now go to the House, where they will likely pass it sometime Friday and then send it to the president’s desk to sign. This will end the longest government shutdown in American history.Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), one the president’s staunchest allies in the Senate, said while the spending bill will end the government shutdown, it will not end the crisis at America’s southern border.Blackburn said:President Trump has reached a compromise with Democratic and Republican leaders to reopen the federal government with a short term continuing resolution. While this action solves the immediate problem of funding the back pay of 800,000 federal workers, it does not address the urgent need to end the humanitarian crisis on our southern border. It does not end the illegal flow of drugs, gangs and human traffickers. Congress’ work on this issue is far from over. I will continue to support our border patrol and their three essential needs: a border barrier, additional technology and more officers and agents on the border. I also support ending the DACA program, chain migration and the visa lottery system.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), another strong ally of President Trump, said that now is the “last, best chance” to fix America’s broken borders and immigration system.Graham said, “I hope Congress, in a bipartisan fashion, will work with the President and take advantage of this moment.”“This is the last, best chance to take a major step toward fixing broken borders and a broken immigration system,” Graham added. “Thank you, Mr. President.  Let’s make this a win-win for America!”

The deal he reached with congressional leaders contains no new money for the wall. However, in his remarks, President Trump still made the case for a border wall and maintained he might again shut down the government over it.“If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on February 15, again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and Constitution of the United States to address this emergency,” he said. The president has been considering declaring a national emergency in order to fund the border wall unilaterally.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/01/25/microsoft-newsguard-humiliation-branded-drudge-monster-shutdown-scoop-fake-news/","Despite Microsoft and NewsGuard working to brand the Drudge Report as “fake news,” the conservative news website was the first to break the news about the temporary re-opening of the government in a monster scoop of the NewsGuard approved establishment media.Recently, Microsoft teamed up with NewsGuard, a web browser extension app which has become a default extension in Microsoft’s Edge mobile browser. Advised by individuals such as Tom Ridge, the first Secretary of Homeland Security for the George W. Bush administration; Richard Stengel, the former editor of Time magazine and Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy for the Obama administration; and Don Baer, the chairman of Burson, Cohn & Wolfe and former White House Communications Director for the Clinton administration; Newsguard aims to apply rankings of “trustworthiness” to individual news websites in an attempt to fight “fake news.”NewsGuard has marked both Breitbart News and the Drudge Report as “fake news,” calling the credibility of both sites into question. However, the Drudge Report was the first to break the recent news that the President has worked with lawmakers to re-open the government.The Drudge Report is primarily a link aggregator but also breaks news with remarkable accuracy.Drudge is reporting an agreement to re-open the government. https://t.co/vR0Rvk86YZ pic.twitter.com/ittSZ9P79t— Jim Roberts (@nycjim) January 25, 2019Despite the fact that the Drudge Report was correct and posted real news before the entire media, NewsGuard brands the site as fake news, warning users to reconsider visiting the page both on Google and in social media posts:Twitter posts linking to Drudge’s scoop feature the NewsGuard fake news warning symbol as well:From a Breitbart News report:“I’m very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government,” Trump said in the Rose Garden. Trump also disussed the option of using a “very powerful alternative,” meaning a declaration of a national emergency to build the wall with executive authority in contravention of Congress, but said “I did not want to use it at this time.”
“In a short while, I will sign a bill to reopen our federal government for three weeks until Feb.15,” Trump said, confirming details first reported by the Drudge Report and subsequently confirmed by other media outlets. He said that he will ensure federal employees will receive back pay “very quickly.”Trump also said this deal will trigger a bipartisan conference committee on Capitol Hill to begin reviewing a request from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for a border wall.“Walls should not be controversial,” Trump said, adding that Border Patrol agents have told him that “walls work” citing previous Democrat support for barriers on the border and foreign countries like Israel that have built walls to protect their borders.Trump ended his White House Rose Garden remarks by noting that if the Congress does not reach a deal by Feb. 15, the government will shut down again or he will use the executive authority for a declaration of a national emergency to build the wall.While NewsGuard claims that they are fighting “fake news” and publications which are untrustworthy, they are in fact targeting websites that break important national news on a regular basis.Similar scrutiny is, however, not applied to websites that publish fake news about high school students.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/25/donald-trump-announces-decision-to-temporarily-end-government-shutdown/","President Donald Trump announced Friday a plan to end the partial government shutdown, by temporarily caving to Democrat demands to reopen the government.Trump agreed to reopen the government for three weeks while negotiations continued — with no apparent wall funding concessions from Democrats.The president warned that if Congress could not successfully negotiate a deal including wall funding in three weeks, he would be forced to announce a State of Emergency, which would allow him to shift funds to build border structures without Congress.“If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government either shuts down on February 15th again or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States to address this emergency,” he said.He argued that he had heard from enough Democrats during the shutdown who were willing to support border security including physical barriers as part of the solution, allowing him to reopen the government temporarily.“Many disagree, but I really feel that working with Democrats and Republicans, we can make a truly great and secure deal happen for everyone,” he said.The president announced a bipartisan congressional committee to review border patrol requests for security and asked them to come up with a compromise deal.“They will put together a homeland security package for me to shortly sign into law,” Trump said. He urged both parties to work together to solve the problems at the border. He defended the idea of a wall or a physical barrier as part of the negotiations.“Walls should not be controversial,” Trump said.The president delivered his remarks in the Rose Garden at the White House. Vice President Mike Pence together with several members of Trump’s cabinet attended the speech including Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Other White House staff including senior adviser Jared Kushner watched the speech. They clapped as Trump announced his decision.Trump announced his decision as Federal workers face a second missed paycheck as the government shutdown enters its 35th day.The president thanked federal workers who suffered financial difficulties as a result of the shutdown, vowing that they would receive back pay.“You are very, very special people. I am so proud that you are citizens of our country,” he said. “When I say ‘Make America Great Again,’ it could never be done without you.”Trump made his announcement after Congress reached an impasse on a bill to reopen the government. Both Senate measures failed to meet the necessary 60-vote threshold needed to move a bill forward. Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to compromise with Trump on any wall funding, demanding unconditionally that the government be reopened first.The White House finally caved to Democrats demands, despite Trump’s repeated assertions this week that he would not do so.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/01/25/michael-moore-calls-for-federal-workers-strike-dont-go-to-work-without-pay/","Left-wing documentary filmmaker Michael Moore urged federal workers on Thursday to stop attending work in protest over the ongoing government shutdown that has left 800,000 people either furloughed or working without pay.Appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Thursday, Moore explained that there is an “easy way” to end the ongoing government shutdown, as Congress remains in a deadlock over proposed funding for a wall on the southern border.“Any sane person—even if they’re for the wall—knows this is crazy that we’re in month two of this. Nobody should be working without pay,” he explained. “Federal workers, don’t go to work without pay. And we, the people, we shouldn’t be supporting anything that requires someone who’s not paid working for us.”Moore also weighed in on speculation that Trump may declare a national emergency over the immigration crisis at the southern border, comparing it to the style of authoritarian leaders and warning that people would have to “non-violently rise up” against him if he chose to do so.“Listen, if he declares a national emergency, this man is out of control,” Moore argued. “This is our country. We are a democracy, we’re a free society. If this were any other country, if it were Turkey or the Philippines or Russia, and they had an election and the ruler’s party somehow lost half their legislative branch like he did in November and then that ruler declared a month later, I’m shutting down the government, what would we call that if it were another country doing that?”“This guy doesn’t want the government to be open, he certainly doesn’t want the Department of Justice to be open” Moore continued. “So if he tries to pull a national emergency, we the people have to declare a national emergency. We have to non-violently rise up. We have to take to the streets. We have to build our own wall—a human wall—around the White House.”It is not the first time that Moore has proposed acts of civil disobedience in protest of the government shutdown. Last month, the 64-year-old activist filmmaker also called for a “mass uprising” of federal workers that included sit-ins, the storming of buildings, and the harassment of lawmakers.“What would a nonviolent mass uprising by 800,000 federal workers look like?

Read Breitbart News Network’s original report below. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday halted flights into New York City’s LaGuardia airport amid air traffic control staffing shortages, according to reports.The development comes after airline officials warned the partial government shutdown is causing great strain the U.S. aviation system.Flight delays have been reported at several major East Coast airports, including Newark Liberty International, Philadelphia International, and Reagan National in Washington, D.C.The FAA told NBC News that the delays are caused by staffing issues at two air traffic control facilities impacting New York and Florida and said it is “augmenting staffing, rerouting traffic, and increasing spacing between aircraft as needed.”However, a spokesperson for the FAA said Thursday that the agency had seen “no unusual increased absenteeism and there are no operational disruptions due to staffing.”In a statement, the White House said President Trump has been briefed on the air travel issues and are “monitoring the ongoing delays at some airports. We are in regular contact with officials at the Dept. of Transportation and the FAA.”

Mazie Hirono (D-HI) said Democrats can not negotiate a solution to the government shutdown with President Donald Trump because he was “a hostage taking amoral person who makes no distinction between right or wrong.”Hirono said,  “I think most of us live in the real world where people need their paychecks to pay their bills and keep a roof over their heads and put it on the table. That’s where most people live. But obviously not our commerce secretary, who said, ‘why can’t they go out and get a loan.’ This administration has an unlimited capacity in their lack of empathy. So the president is not somebody we can negotiate with because for one, he’s a hostage taking amoral person who makes no distinction between right or wrong. So I think that the compromise must be forged at the legislative level, that’s congressional. And we should pass these bills to get the government running and then we can have all kind of discussions about border security —which we all support, by the way—and the other things that the president wants.”She added, “I think the reason that he took hostages is, he cannot make a valid argument for a multi-billion dollar wall, because you know the $5.7 is only a down payment. He can’t justify that wall on its own, on its merit. So he needs to take 800,000 people and contractors hostage. That’s who we are dealing with, with the president of the United States, an amoral, lying person whose mind is changed at a whim, and I guess if Ann Coulter yells at him he turns into a total wimp.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/24/exclusive-excerpts-from-team-of-vipers-john-kelly-overheard-undermining-president-trump-on-syria/","Former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly was overheard in the West Wing in a conversation with former Deputy White House Chief of Staff Joe Hagin deliberately undermining President Donald Trump’s strategy on Syria, an excerpt from a forthcoming book from a former White House official provided exclusively to Breitbart News alleges.Former West Wing communications official Cliff Sims, the author of Team of Vipers: My Extraordinary 500 Days in the Trump White House, describes in the book how he heard Kelly in conversation with Hagin about how to stop Trump from withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria–a point of contention between Trump and Kelly.Sims describes the hallway between the Oval Office and the Vice President’s suite in the West Wing, setting the scene for what he heard Kelly saying about Trump’s policies:On the afternoon of Thursday, March 29, I was sitting in the back hall­ way of the West Wing, outside Jared’s office, waiting to fill him in on my impending move to the NEC. The President was in Richfield, Ohio, announc­ing plans to “rebuild America’s crumbling infrastructure,” so in his absence, the West Wing was uncharacteristically quiet. But since he was flying straight from Ohio to Mar­-a­-Lago for a long Easter weekend, most of the staff had stayed behind, including General Kelly and Deputy Chief of Staff Joe Hagin.The back hallway of the West Wing is a roughly twenty­-five­-yard straight shot from the Oval on one end to the Vice President’s suite on the other. Work­ing your way down the hallway from the Oval, on the left side was the Pres­ident’s private dining room, Jared’s office, then the Chief’s suite. On the right side were the Roosevelt Room; the scheduler, Michael Haidet; and Hagin. This was the most prime real estate in the entire building. In an environment where proximity to the President was power, this was the inner sanctum. The hallway was lined with the usual combination of historical paintings, an­tique cabinetry, and famous busts and sculptures. The ceiling was slightly curved, like the top of the number zero. While the upper press office, where I worked, was the bustling center of activity, not to mention accessible to the media, this place was almost serene.About fifteen feet down the hallway from where I was sitting, I could hear the TV inside the Chief’s suite airing coverage from Trump’s Ohio event, which was set to begin any minute. Hagin sauntered out of his office and across the hall, where he found Kelly standing in front of the TV with a couple of other close aides. Though I hadn’t intended to, I overheard their entire, un­ guarded conversation.At that point, Sims then describes the conversation he overheard between Kelly and Hagin, in which they criticized the president’s style of rolling out major announcements–and where Kelly said that Trump “better not” announce a U.S. withdrawal from Syria:“I talked to the President on the plane and he swore to me that he wouldn’t announce anything about Syria,” Kelly said, in an exasperated tone. I knew immediately what he was talking about. The President had for some time been privately expressing a desire to pull U.S. troops out of Syria. I wasn’t involved in the national security decision­-making process, but his inclination to pull out was well known throughout the building. Top military officials were urg­ing him to keep a couple of thousand troops in the country to clear out the last remnants of the so-called Islamic State. To that point he had begrudg­ingly acquiesced, but his patience was running thin. Kelly clearly was expect­ ing him to say something about the topic anyway.“We won’t know until he walks offstage,” Hagin replied with a resigned chuckle. This was a common sentiment among staffers who bristled at Trump’s tendency to go off script during his remarks. It also happened to be what made him interesting to watch—no one knew what he would say, not even the staff.“He d— well better know not to screw us on this,” Kelly growled. I was taken aback by this brief but revealing exchange, which seemed to encapsu­late Kelly’s view of his job and of the President himself: which was that Trump was a missile of chaos and Kelly was the general trying to keep him in the silo. Many reporters over the years reported that this was Kelly’s view of the job—to various denials from the White House—but we all knew it was true.Later in the year and after the midterm elections, the president would announce the withdrawal from Syria despite opposition from Kelly and other military officials.At the end of this excerpt, Sims describes the attitude of Kelly and others who viewed it as their mission to stop Trump from doing what he set out to do as president:In fact, there was a pervasive view among some of the President’s most senior aides that there was something patriotic about undermining Trump’s most disruptive impulses. I know that many people reading this will say, “Thank God.” And if I give them the benefit of the doubt, it may have been a sincere effort to do what they thought was in the best interest of the coun­try. But whether they were sincere or not, I found it cowardly. There’s noth­ing patriotic about being a part of “the resistance” inside the building. Imagine the arrogance of saying, “I know sixty­ three million of my fellow Ameri­cans voted for this guy, but I’m going to sabotage him anyway because I know better.”This is hardly the only excerpt regarding Kelly in Sims’ explosive book, which has already seen stories come out about how Sims recounts the creation in a secret meeting with Trump of an enemies list of people Trump could not trust and a separate list of those he could trust. Sims, unlike many others who have left the White House and gone on to attack the president in books or public comments, remains loyal to Trump and is trying to out leakers–or sleeper cells, as they are called–in the West Wing. One alleged leaker exposed in another excerpt in Sims’ book is White House counselor KellyAnne Conway, who, Sims recounts in an excerpt published by Vanity Fair, asked him to write a statement on her computer saying she was not disloyal or leaking–while he watched messages appear on her screen between her and media figures in which she allegedly trashed the president, his family, and his administration.The other Kelly excerpt in Sims’ forthcoming book recounts Kelly’s first day as White House chief of staff, and a speech he gave to the entire staff of the White House, including the broader campus which includes hundreds of officials who do not work regularly in the West Wing.Sims recounts how he thought Kelly’s speech started strong, and he thought he might actually become an ally of the president’s agenda in the White House:Kelly assembled all of the staff working in the EEOB to deliver his introductory remarks. He stood at a podium at the intersection of two large hallways, black­-and-­white-­checkered floors stretching the length of a city block. Several hundred staffers crowded around him. Some of us from the West Wing walked across the driveway as well, curious to hear what he would say.“Nice to meet you, I’m from Boston,” he said right off the bat. I smirked and nodded my head. We were from dramatically different places, but I was proud of where I came from, too. I felt like it said something about who I was. Kelly clearly felt the same way about his blue­-collar roots. I liked that about him right away.Sims’ positive impressions did not last long. He continues:But then things got a little weird.The primary theme of his speech was that he planned to approach his new job by serving the country, then the President, in that order, and that we should do the same. At first blush, this didn’t seem like a particularly profound state­ment, much less a controversial one. But the more he spoke, the more he seemed to really be hammering on this construct: country, then President, country, then President. And the more I let it soak in, the more I thought that what Kelly was saying—country first, POTUS second—was, at best, a bit curious, and at worst, potentially hostile.We believed that the way we served our country was by serving the Pres­ident. Kelly, on the other hand, seemed to be intimating that those two goals might be at odds, perhaps even mutually exclusive at times. And you know what? Maybe they would be. But if they ever were, the honorable response would be to resign. Maybe we were being paranoid after being in the Trump bunker for so long, but Kelly seemed to be saying that, in such a scenario, it might be necessary to subvert the President’s wishes in service of some amor­phous higher calling.Most of us had met his arrival with optimism after enduring six months of staff upheaval. Now I was watching some of the President’s most ardent supporters shuffling back to their offices, hanging their heads in concern.“What a letdown,” one of them said. “He comes across like he doesn’t even like the President, much less want to work for him.”I am still not certain what motivated Kelly to use his first interaction with the majority of the White House staff to say what he did… But right off the bat his remarks hurt his stand­ing among loyal aides who were hoping he could unify the fractious staff behind a singular mission: advancing the President’s agenda.This week, Kelly signed onto a letter with other anti-Trump forces pushing the President to end the shutdown without a border wall. This is powerful evidence supporting Sims’ claims Kelly had wanted to subvert the President’s agenda.Kelly, who served as Secretary of Homeland Security before taking the chief of staff position in the White House, signed a letter with other former Secretaries of Homeland Security calling on Trump to cave on the government shutdown and reopen the government without a border wall.JUST IN: 5 former DHS secretaries, including former Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly, call for President Trump and Congress to ""fund the critical mission of DHS,"" according to letter obtained by @NBCNews – @jesserodriguez https://t.co/whd8qQSFCW pic.twitter.com/UBwYqYPQYT— NBC News (@NBCNews) January 24, 2019In addition to Kelly, the letter was signed by former George W. Bush DHS Secretaries Michael Chertoff and Tom Ridge, as well as Barack Obama DHS secretaries Janet Napolitano and Jeh Johnson.

Both the Republican proposal and the Democrat proposal failed to meet the 60 vote threshold needed to move forward.“You need 60 … We knew they both were not going to go anywhere, we thought, and now Mitch is negotiating with Chuck Schumer and we’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters at the White House.Trump noted that both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were discussing a possible short-term deal to reopen the government while talks continued.White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also issued a statement about Trump’s position on a short-term funding bill.“As was made clear to Senator Lindsey Graham, the three week CR would only work if there is a large down payment on the wall,” Sanders said.But the president also spoke about alternative ways to fund the wall, reasserting its importance in stopping human trafficking, illegal drugs, and illegal immigration.“We have to have a wall in this situation,” he said.The president spoke about the ongoing government shutdown during a meeting at the White House with members of Congress on trade.He thanked furloughed federal government workers as well as those working without pay.“I love them, I respect them, I really appreciate the great job they’re doing,” he said. “Many of those people that are not getting paid are totally in favor of what we’re doing.”Trump said that he supported technology like sensors and drones, but only with a physical barrier.“Any technology only works with a wall,” Trump said.

Officials think it will be harder for Democrats to keep sticking together amid President Trump’s offers, according to a person familiar with White House thinking who was not authorized to speak publicly. They are hopeful for defections by Democrats who may cross party lines to vote with the president. President Trump is asking for $5.7 billion for the wall in exchange for some temporary protections for immigrants facing deportations.Meanwhile, President Trump said Wednesday that he is postponing his State of the Union address until the partial government shutdown ends, yielding after a weeklong showdown with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “As the Shutdown was going on, Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union Address. I agreed. She then changed her mind because of the Shutdown, suggesting a later date,” the president tweeted. “This is her prerogative – I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over.”As the Shutdown was going on, Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union Address.

I look forward to giving a “great” State of the Union Address in the near future!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2019The gamesmanship is still unfolded as the Senate prepared to vote this week on dueling proposals on the shutdown. A Republican one would give President Trump money for the wall while one from Democrats would re-open government through February 8, with no wall money, giving bargainers time to talk about it.Both proposals were likely to fail to reach the 60-vote threshold needed in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. As well, House Democrats are putting forward a new proposal, aiming to lure the president away from his demand for a border wall by offering billions of new dollars for other border security measures.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The senseless and prolonged shutdown is inflicting chaos across the country.”She continued, “It is really unfortunate that not only is the president holding the American people and America’s workers hostage, he is holding the Republicans and the Congress of the United States hostage. Not all of them. Some of them understand what it means in the lives of American people. We hope that more of them will. ”She added, “Congressional Democrats support smart, effective border security, but we do not support the president holding the health, safety, and paychecks of the American people hostage, again, to a campaign applause line. There is serious and justified concern that this president would shut down the government any time he does not get his way legislatively.

Many of those in the crowd were wearing hats or shirts that identified them as with activist groups or union groups, including Code Pink and SEIU.A protest leader announced to the media at the end of the silent portion of the protest that there were some furloughed federal workers sprinkled among the crowd and would be available for interviews. Breitbart News attempted to interview several individuals who identified themselves as furloughed workers, but they declined to be interviewed. One woman who identified herself as a furloughed worker declined to be identified but provided a statement to Breitbart News: “I love my job and I want to go back to it and I’m dedicated to the country and I’d like to go back to working for the country.”For 33 minutes the protesters silently stood in the Hart building holding disposable plates with handwritten messages on them. The 33 minutes of silence represented the 33 days that the government has been in partial shut down. The group concluded their protest in the atrium of the Hart Senate building by beginning to chant, shortly after which capital police told the protesters to disperse.Shortly after the protest ended in the Hart building, a portion of the protesters continued on to the Russell Senate office building to protest outside Senator McConnell‘s office. Upon arriving at McConnell’s office, the group stood for a period of time without any chanting and moved to one side of the hallway as police had requested. Soon after, the group began chanting, and capital police began pushing the protesters back from the door of McConnell’s office.Some protesters remained outside of the office door and did not move. Those protesters were eventually placed under arrest by Capitol Hill police. Directly after the arrests, the group dispersed from the area.Michelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News — follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook

Jim Justice (R-WV) on Wednesday invited President Donald Trump to deliver his State of the Union address in West Virginia after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) requested that the high-profile speech before a joint session of Congress be rescheduled due to the partial government shutdown.“I called the President yesterday to convey our invitation for him to come to West Virginia to give the State of the Union Address in our State Capitol. Giving the speech in a state full of people who love their country would truly reflect his focus on the forgotten men and women of America,” Justice said in a statement.Justice, who switched from Democrat to Republican shortly after President Trump ascended to the White House, said he consulted with Speaker of the House Roger Hanshaw prior to sending the invitation.“No matter where he chooses to have the speech, I want the President to know that he is always welcome in the Great State of West Virginia,” the governor continued.Last week, North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore wrote a letter inviting President Trump to deliver the speech in the state’s Raleigh chamber, and on Friday, Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield also extended an invitation to deliver the address at the state Capitol in Lansing.However, the White House is moving forward with plans for President Trump to deliver his State of the Union speech next week in front of a joint session of Congress.The White House sent an email to the House sergeant-at-arms asking to schedule a walk-through in anticipation of a January 29 address, according to a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the planning by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.“Nancy Pelosi made the invitation to the president on the State of the Union. He accepted,” said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “At this point, we’re moving forward.”At the same time, the White House is continuing to work on contingency plans to give Trump a backup in case the joint session plans fall through. The president cannot speak in front of Congress without both chambers’ explicit permission. Both chambers must agree to a resolution specifying the date and time for receiving a presidential address.Officials have been considering a list of potential alternative venues, including a rally-style event, an Oval Office address — as Pelosi previously suggested — a speech before the Senate chamber, and even a return visit to the U.S.-Mexico border, as Trump is expected to continue to hammer the need for a barrier, according to two people familiar with the discussions.Multiple versions are also being drafted to suit the final venue.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

If you want to — if you want me to consider something like that, I need to see comprehensive immigration reform. I need to see an end to the cruelties of the last two years.

This is not amnesty. There’s no pathway to citizenship there’s no permanent status here at all, which is what amnesty contemplates.”He added, “I think as the American people look at this, Chris, they’re going to see this for what it is.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/19/lindsey-graham-on-trump-shutdown-compromise-fantastic-proposal-lets-get-it-done/","Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Saturday lauded President Donald Trump’s compromise proposal to end the partial government shutdown and expressed enthusiasm about turning the plan into law.President Trump offered Democrat leaders a three-year extension on the temporary legal status of 700,000 “Dreamers” — immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally by their parents — plus a three-year extension of the temporary protected status (TPS) for 300,000 immigrants whose status faces expiration.The president floated $805 million in port and border screening security and $800 million worth of humanitarian aid. Further, he vowed to hire 2000 additional border agents and 75 more immigration judge teama to handle the backlog of border cases.The president declared in his highly-anticipated announcement from the White House’s Diplomatic room that “both sides in Washington must simply come together” in an effort to “break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis on the southern border.”Shortly after President Trump’s remarks, Graham signaled he was ready to do just that, tweeting: “A fantastic proposal Mr. President! Let’s get it done!”A fantastic proposal Mr.  President! Let's get it done! https://t.co/m8bzYGRLTw— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 19, 2019Last month, Graham urged the White House and Democrats to back what he described as a “breakthrough” compromise to re-open the government, now in its 29th day of partial shutdown – the longest in U.S. history – which would trade protections of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients for $5 billion in wall funding.Following a two-hour lunch at the White House, the South Carolina Republican signaled the president was open to supporting the proposal, which would entail backing the Bridge Act — a bill championed by Graham that would give DACA holders three-year extensions on their work permits. The proposed legislation would also give TPS recipients an extension on their status.“I think that’s in the realm of possibility. The president didn’t commit, but I think he’s very open-minded. I know there’s some Democrats out there who would be willing to provide money for a wall, border security, if we could deal with the DACA population and TPS people,” Graham told reporters at the time.“I don’t see Democrats giving us more money, unless they get something,” he added.Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), an ally of the president, signaled her support for Saturday’s proposal in a statement, calling on Congress to agree on a compromise to re-open the government. “The president has once again shown he is willing to work with Democrats to end this shutdown and find a compromise that will secure our border,” Blackburn said. “This proposal that has bipartisan support would provide the much-needed $5.7 billion for a border barrier.”“The border patrol agents have repeatedly asked for three items: a physical barrier, more technology, and more agents and officers. As members of Congress, we must deliver for them,” she added.However, almost immediately after the president’s offer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Chuck Schumer (D-NY) balked at the deal, adding to a list of compromises the Democrats have shot down from the White House.Pelosi said in a statement:Democrats were hopeful that the President was finally willing be to re-open government and proceed with a much-need discussion to protect the border. Unfortunately, initial reports make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people’s lives,” she said in a statement. … It is unlikely that any one of these provisions alone would pass the House, and taken together, they are a non-starter.In a separate statement, Schumer described the president’s offer to an ongoing hostage situation. “There’s only way out: open up the government, Mr. President, and then Democrats and Republicans can have a civil discussion and come up with bipartisan solutions,” he said. “[O]ffering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking.”

But, Democrats aren’t going to fund Donald Trump’s little racist wall,” Sanders said.She continued, “And that is why the government is shut down, because Donald Trump came back and said, ‘Actually, I want money for my wall,’ a wall that he told us Mexico was going to pay for.

Democrats have never said that they’re not going to fund border security.”“All of the measures that have been put on the floor have included border security. What they have not included is his wall funding. Are we going to allow the president to hold us hostage over a campaign promise he knew was a lie? I don’t think so.”The government has been shut down for 29 days as Democrats have refused to pass a spending bill that includes the wall funding the president has demanded.President Trump gave a speech Saturday where he offered a package that funds border barriers and more immigration judges in exchange for a three-year extension of amnesty for DACA recipients.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/01/19/klobuchar-trump-should-come-back-to-the-table-end-shutdown/","During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) asked President Trump “to come back to the table,” and end the government shutdown.Transcript as Follows:“I’m Amy Klobuchar, the Senator from the state of Minnesota.This weekend, we are on the verge of what soon will be a month-long government shutdown, and it’s the longest and most senseless shutdown in American history. That’s nearly a month of hundreds of thousands of workers not getting paid. That’s nearly a month of everything from air safety to medical advancement being undermined. Nearly a month of unnecessary anxiety and unwarranted chaos.This past week, the President declared he’ll ‘never back down’ from his decision to shut down the government until he gets what he wants.We ask the President to come back to the table, and to stop holding the hard-working people of America hostage by requiring them to pay ransom to reopen their government. Especially after we already passed bills to reopen the government and to help secure our borders.We ask the President to end this shutdown.We ask him to listen to his own employees. Like Kathleen, from my home state, a newly hired employee at the Department of Agriculture who was so excited about her new job, but now she is no longer getting paid. She wrote a letter to me:‘My funds are exhausted,’ she says, ‘At this point in time, I don’t have the money to pay for my mortgage or for childcare for my daughter.’She goes on to ask the question no parent should have to ask: ‘Do I risk losing my home or do I risk having my daughter lose her daycare and then be unable to go to work when I’m recalled?’She finishes by saying, ‘This may be a story you have heard before, but I felt it needs to be shared until it is heard by the right ears.’Kathleen, today a whole lot of people are hearing your story.Thanks to our workers and businesses—we have reached a moment in our country where we should be governing from opportunity, and not chaos. We should be working together to pass major legislation to bring down prescription drug prices and health care costs for Americans, to make it easier to afford college and child care, to create incentives for clean green energy, to pass immigration reform, to train workers for the jobs we have today and could have tomorrow.But what is happening instead? The President’s own economic adviser has estimated that this shutdown will cost the American economy billions of dollars every week. That’s billions of dollars.With this shutdown the administration is not creating opportunity, it is fomenting chaos. Instead of lifting the economic burden of health care and family expenses off the shoulders of our citizens, the administration has chosen to place the costs of its chaos firmly on the backs of the hard-working people of America: forcing them into lines in airports, reducing help for our farmers and rural areas, closing the gates to our parks and the doors to our small businesses.As one furloughed FDA employee told a newspaper after visiting a food shelf for the first time just to feed herself and her five children: ‘President Trump’s talking about a crisis on the border, but we have a crisis right here.’I ask the President and my Republican colleagues to listen to those words, the words of an ordinary American, who like so many others, does extraordinary work for us every day. These are people working on the front lines without pay to keep us safe from terror, guard our coasts, investigate and prosecute those that do us harm, and keep our food safe and our life-saving cures moving forward.I ask my fellow citizens to make their views clear and to tell this President and my Republican colleagues to stop the self-inflicted manufactured crisis and enact one of the many bills Congress has passed on a bipartisan basis to end this shutdown. I ask Leader McConnell to take up the House-passed bills in the Senate and send them to the President’s desk.Why? Because in this week of Martin Luther King’s birthday, we remember the words of Dr. King: ‘the time is always right to do what is right.’Now is the time to do what is right Mr. President. End this shutdown and put hard-working Americans back to work.”Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Democrats refuse to pass spending for the government that includes money for President Trump’s promised border wall.Moore’s social media rants often target the president and Republicans. After the 2018 midterm elections, the 64-year-old said that the only way Republicans win elections is by making it harder for African-Americans to vote.“It has to feel awful knowing that your side is outnumbered by the millions and the only way you can hang on to any power is to simply rig it/steal it/prevent black people from voting. That is the work of cowards,” he said.More recently, the Bowling for Columbine creator declared that the GOP tax cut in 2017 was like an “act of terror.”“All the Republicans in that photo you showed standing there on the steps with him a year ago today all looking so slap happy and ah, remember it’s not just Trump, all of the Republicans, all of them, nobody has had the courage to stand up and say this is wrong, this is un-American,” he said.“This hurts this country. This is— this tax cut in a sense an act of terror because it’s going to make the people who are already struggling to get by that much harder to get by.”

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/18/poll-trumps-support-among-hispanics-soars-amid-fight-for-border-wall/","President Trump’s support among Hispanic American voters has soared as he is refusing to buckle to pressure from Republicans and Democrats to reopen the federal government without funding for his proposed wall along the United States-Mexico border.In the latest NPR/Marist/PBS Poll, about 50 percent of Hispanic American voters this month said they approve of the job Trump is doing in the middle of the government shutdown. This is a 19 percentage point increase from last month, when only about 31 percent of Hispanic voters said they approved of Trump.The poll revealed that since the start of the shutdown, Trump’s approval has barely changed among nearly all demographic groups. For example, Trump’s approval — since doubling down on obtaining border wall funding — with swing voters has hardly moved, with about 37 to 38 percent approving of the job he is doing between December 2018 and January 2019.The data does suggest Trump could be losing ground with white American voters for the administration’s lack of progress on the issue of immigration. Last month, about 50 percent of white voters said they approved of Trump. This month, only about 40 percent of white voters said they approved.In the meantime, support for Trump’s proposed border wall has skyrocketed in popularity with swing voters, as Breitbart News reported.This time last year, an ABC News/Washington Post poll found that only 34 percent of voters supported a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Today, support for the wall has climbed to 42 percent overall. Most notable, about 40 percent of swing voters now say they support a border wall. This is a ten percentage point increase in support for the wall among swing voters since last year.Currently, the federal government has remained partially shut down as House Democrats block any funding for physical barriers at the U.S.-Mexico border. A handful of Senate Republicans crafted a plan to give amnesty to illegal aliens that ultimately failed to gain traction.Border crossings in November 2018 — the last month from which data is available — hit close to 52,000, marking the highest level of illegal immigration in the month of November since 2006. Projections indicate that illegal immigration for next year will reach 600,000 border crossings, the highest level of illegal immigration in more than a decade. Meanwhile, drug overdoses in 2017 killed an unprecedented 72,287 U.S. residents, nearly three times the number of individuals killed by global terrorism. Nearly 50,000 of those deadly overdoses were caused by either heroin or fentanyl.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/18/nancy-pelosi-claims-democrats-planned-to-fly-commercial-from-an-air-force-base/","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Friday canceled a visit to Afghanistan, accusing the White House of leaking commercial travel plans to the war zone after President Donald Trump denied her and other Democrats access to a military aircraft for a seven-day foreign trip.“We weren’t going to go because we had a report from Afghanistan that the president outing out trip had made feet on the ground much more dangerous because it’s a signal to bad actors that we were coming,” Pelosi told reporters on Friday. “The fact that they would leak that we were flying commercial is a danger not only to us but to other people.It is “very irresponsible on the part of the president,” Pelosi said of the purported leak. She would not answer how she learned that the White House had leaked the information.
In a statement, the White House denied leaking the speaker’s flight plans, calling the accusation “a flat out lie.”“When the Speaker of the house and about 20 others from Capitol Hill decide to book their own commercial flights to Afghanistan, the world is going to find out. The idea we would leak anything that would put the safety and security of any American at risk is a flat out lie,” said the White House.In a Thursday letter to Pelosi, President Trump notified the speaker that he was revoking access to the plane for her trip to Egypt, Brussels, and Afghanistan, writing: “In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I’m sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate.”“I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown,” he continued. President Trump said Pelosi was welcome to fly on a commercial plane to make the visit. “Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative,” he wrote.Democrats were scheduled to depart around 3:00 p.m. EST for their overseas trip, according to the White House. Shortly after access to military jet was revoked, Hamill said Democrats planned to meet with NATO leaders in Brussels to “obtain critical national security & intelligence briefings from those on the front lines.”Speaking to the media after jet access was revoked, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) accused President Trump of breaking the law by revealing Pelosi visit to Afganistan, citing potential security concerns. “I don’t understand if Mr. Trump understands the laws and procedures in our country,” Warner told CBS when asked about the cancelation. “I don’t know what Speaker Pelosi is doing, not doing. Sometimes members take trips into dangerous areas, and only announced after the fact.”“If someone had revealed about the president’s trip beforehand, around Christmas when he went to the war zone — if someone had revealed that beforehand, that would have been a violation of law, policy, and procedure,” he continued. “I don’t know why what the president may have done today isn’t that same kind of violation.”The trip’s cancellation comes as President Trump and Democrat leaders remain locked in a bitter fight over a bill which would fund a U.S.-Mexico border wall to the tune of $5.7 billion White House officials met with rank-and-file Democrats on Wednesday in an effort to carve out a deal with centrist lawmakers from states where the president enjoys high levels of support. During a conference call with supporters this week, President Trump showed no signs of backing down on his chief campaign promise, reiterating his pledge to build a wall.“We’re going to stay out for a long time, if we have to,” he said of the shutdown. “We’ll be out for a long time.”Editor’s Note: This article has been updated to clarify that Pelosi’s office claimed the White House leaked new, overnight plans to travel commercially to Afghanistan — not that the trip referenced in President Trump’s Thursday letter had been planned as a commercial flight.

Every time they do that it’s a slap, it’s a stab, it’s a kick in the gut, in the groin,” said Durden. “It’s not a matter of if you’re going to be affected by illegal alien crime, it’s when you’re going to be affected,” said angel mom Mary Ann Mendoza. Mendoza’s son Mesa Police Officer Brandon Mendoza was killed when an illegal alien allegedly drove drunk the wrong way on a highway in Arizona and hit the off-duty officer’s vehicle.At the time the angel families stormed into Pelosi’s office, the government remained in a partial shutdown as Democrat leadership has refused to negotiate border security and barrier funding. Michelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News — follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook.

Items on the agenda at the conference included meetings on how to address the aftermath of Hurricane Maria and several parties — including one where cast members from Hamilton would be in attendance.“Congressman Smith’s comment was directed at all the Democrats who were vacationing down in Puerto Rico last weekend during the government shutdown, not towards any individual member,” Joey Brown, Smith’s communications director, told Politico.But one Democratic House member, Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-CA), took offense at Smith’s comment because his phrase sounded like he was telling Hispanics to “go back where you came from.”“When people blurt things out like that, it certainly sounds like the old saying, ‘go back to where you came from,'” Cárdenas told the Hill.“Since I was a little boy I’ve heard that blurted at me many times, but it’s sad that anything even remotely close to that would be said to me on the floor of the House,” he added.Cárdenas, a California Democrat of Mexican heritage, added that he spoke with Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) following the exchange, asking the Oklahoma Republican to clarify the comments.“I don’t remember exactly what he said. Markwayne Mullin tried to clarify what was said, and when I asked if he had said it, he didn’t say he did — and I’m not accusing him of saying it — but he kept talking and said, they didn’t mean for you to go back to Puerto Rico, what they meant is go back to Puerto Rico this last weekend.”Smith later reached to Cárdenas to apologize.He “took responsibility for the comment and sincerely apologized. I accepted his apology,” Cárdenas said.

A Republican member of Congress telling me just minutes ago, members of Congress are always told never divulge any trip to a war zone until after you have left the war zone. The move by the president was widely interpreted as a response to Pelosi suggesting yesterday a delay or postponement of the president speaking to a joint session of Congress at the annual State of the Union because Pelosi said it was unfair to force security agents to work without pay.”Tapper added, “A White House official tells CNN that Pelosi and members of Congress are welcome to fly commercial to Afghanistan, a remarkable statement given that the president just announced to the world, including the Taliban, that the Speaker of the House was headed there.”Later in the segment, Tapper said, “I have to say I’ve been to Afghanistan twice, once with President Obama on Air Force One.

But regardless of what the president’s motivation is for this, the one thing here is—we will not let the president of the United States tell the Congress you can’t do your oversight. That appears what’s going on here. And we are a coequal branch of government. It may not have been that way over the last two years when he had a Republican Congress willing to roll over any time he asked, but that is no longer the case.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

In Brussels, the delegation was scheduled to meet with top NATO commanders, U.S. military leaders and key allies–to affirm the United States’ ironclad commitment to the NATO alliance. This weekend visit to Afghanistan did not include a stop in Egypt. The purpose of the trip was to express appreciation and thanks to our men and women in uniform for their service and dedication, and to obtain critical national security & intelligence briefings from those on the front lines. The President traveled to Iraq during the Trump Shutdown as did a Republican CODEL led by Rep. Zeldin.”In a letter to Pelosi on Thursday, President Trump wrote that due to the shutdown, a trip to Egypt, Brussels, and Afghanistan would be delayed, declaring, “In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I’m sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate.”“I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown,” the president continued.Pelosi is welcome to fly on a commercial aircraft to make the trip, he told the House speaker.Read the full letter below: While the shutdown drags on, on Thursday, the State Department instructed all U.S. diplomats in Washington and elsewhere to return to work next week with pay, saying it had found money for their salaries, at least temporarily, despite the ongoing government shutdown.In a notice to staff posted online and sent to employees, the department said it had found money to pay most of its employees, beginning Sunday or Monday, for their next pay period. They will not be paid for time worked since the shutdown began in December until the situation is resolved, said the notice, which was signed by Deputy Under Secretary for Management William Todd.President Trump declined to address the stalemate over the speech Thursday during a visit to the Pentagon, simply promising that the nation will have “powerful, strong border security,” including $5.7 billion in funding to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, I guess in lieu of having actual briefings here, just tweeted this out, ‘Madam Speaker, due to the shutdown, I’m sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule the seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over in light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay. I’m sure you would agree postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate.'”He added, “It goes on to talk about how the president is going to continue to defend the nation’s borders, and he’s calling upon the speaker to join his strong border security movement, as he’s calling it, to end the shutdown. What this letter does not include, Brooke is any kind of response from the president to what he’s actually going to do about the State of the Union coming up on January 29.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2019/01/17/mark-green-gop-is-lockstep-on-border-wall-were-not-giving-in/","Rep. Mark Green (R-TN) told Breitbart News on Wednesday that House Republicans are in “lockstep” and “all together” on the issue of border security amidst an ongoing partial federal government shutdown, offering his remarks in an interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.Green said, “The Republican Caucus, usually we tend to not stick together. As you know, the Democrats seem to be able to stick together better than we do, and they’ve done that in the past. This time, we’re lockstep. We know this issue is critical. It’s worth putting a stake in the ground and saying, ‘We’re not giving in.’ The American people want border security. This president has sort of said, ‘How about 234 miles?’ and ‘How about 2,000 more law enforcement officers?’ and ‘How about 750 more border patrol agents?'”LISTEN:Green continued, “[Donald Trump] has made, I think, a great effort to use 21st century technology on the part of border security, and [Democrats] are just ignoring it. They don’t want to negotiate. They have no interest in it. We’re lockstep. We’re all together, and we’re not giving in.”Green added, “[Democrats] came to us today with, ‘What if we just opened it for 14 days or for 21 days?’ Any promises they make at this point have no merit.”Pollak responded, “Right. You say, ‘Let’s open it, again,’ and at the end of 14 days — if they don’t want to come to an agreement — you’re in the same position you’re in now, and you’ve lost the support of your own side.”Green replied, “Yes. That’s right.”Mansour segued to the issue of health care.“This whole standoff is not what the American people want to happen,” said Mansour. “We didn’t vote for this gamesmanship going on. We want a wall. We voted for a wall. We also voted for movement on things like health care.”Mansour highlighted Green’s professional background as a physician and military veteran. Green served two tours in Afghanistan and a tour in Iraq as a member of the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division.Mansour said, “As a member of the Tennessee State Senate, you had worked on the healthcare issue trying to find innovative ways to get some solutions concerning health care. This is needed now more than ever, because right now — according to the latest Gallup poll that come out on Monday — we learned that 70 percent of Americans — seven in 10 Americans — believe that our current healthcare system has major problems or is in a state of crisis.”Mansour asked, “Overwhelmingly, the American public feels that our healthcare system is falling apart. Drug prices are rising. The Democrats ran on this issue [and] said they were going to have some solutions. Are we getting any action on this?”Green explained how both healthcare consumers and providers are often ignorant of pricing given the status quo of the healthcare system.Green explained, “The real issue in healthcare is the incentives are backwards. We have not incentivized people to save or shop for price. It’s gotten so bad that if you go to your doctor and ask, ‘How much is this knee replacement?’ the physician probably doesn’t even know, and there may be five different prices because with each payer — with each insurance company — there’s a different price, because they’ve independently negotiated with each of those.”Green added, “It also explains why inflation in health care has grown at twice the rate of the rest of the economy for thirty-plus years. What we’ve got to do is incentivize people to shop and save, and health savings accounts did that. You have a system where patients are paying first dollar out of their own pocket, they consume significantly less healthcare. We have got to get people shopping for healthcare again. Obviously there are people out there we need to help. We give Medicaid and we have Medicare which people pay into. Let’s take a Medicaid patient; we are helping them and [providing] them with resources for healthcare. We need to find a way to incentivize them to save and to shop for price.”Green proposed, “My idea was a swipe card similar to the EBT card. … What you don’t spend of this [card], you’re going to get it back at the end of the year as a part of your earned income credit. Now the patient is motivated to shop, save, and only spend when they need to. It will also allow the free market back into health care. Right now, there’s no free market in health care. Some people would suggest a free market can’t work in health care, but it can. Look at laser eye surgery. When it came out, it was $6,000 an eye. While the technology has gone up, the price has fallen to almost like — I saw it the other day — $300 an eye, and the ophthalmologists are doing just fine. When we let the market set the price it’s significantly lower. … We’ve got to get people spending first dollar out of their own pocket and shopping for price. The true problem in health care is we have patients improperly incentivized.”Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.

On the shutdown’s 25th day, President Trump did not move off his demand to have Congress provide $5.7 billion to build his promised border wall with Mexico. Democrats say they will discuss border security once the government has reopened, but Pelosi is refusing money for the wall they view as ineffective and immoral.The White House invited rank-and-file lawmakers to lunch with Trump at the White House as part of a strategy to build support from centrist Democrats and newly elected freshmen, including those from areas where the president is popular with voters.The president, on a conference call with supporters, showed no signs of backing down.“We’re going to stay out for a long time, if we have to,” Trump said. “We’ll be out for a long time.”A short time later, a group of House Democrats made its way to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office demanding that he consider House-passed bills to fund the government. McConnell was not in his office at the time, so the Democrats left a note.McConnell says he doesn’t want to waste the Senate’s time and will only bring up measures that Trump will sign into law. Democrats, he said, have turned Trump’s wall into “something evil” and it’s time to get the country off the “political carousel” of the shutdown fight.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

STENY HOYER: No, I don’t think it’s officially off we — I had not seen the speaker’s letter. What she suggests is a real security problem, unless we’ve opened up the government. Uh So — and we haven’t gotten a reply from the president and his thoughts. So, it’s not officially off, no.BAIER: So, the Homeland Security Secretary tweeted out the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Secret Service are fully prepared to support and secure the State of the Union. We thank the service for their mission, focus, and dedication and for all they do each day and secure our homeland. They suggest there’s not an issue here.REP. HOYER: Well, I’ve heard that and we’ll see what the president has to say. But, obviously, the speaker is absolutely correct. This is a very high-security event, as you well know. You have all the Supreme Court, you have all the Cabinet, you have the vice president and the president, and the Speaker of the House and the majority leader and minority leaders of the United States Senate. So, it’s a very high-security issue. But, the other thing from my perspective, Bret, is we ought not to be doing business as usual with a government shutdown that has 800,000 of its people not getting paid, including everyone one of secret service agents that there would be assigned.Now, it’s tough to believe that they’re on highest security alert when they’re concerned about whether they’re going to get a paycheck and be able to pay their mortgage. So, from that standpoint, I think the speaker’s point was well taken and our position has been we ought to open up this government and then proceed with the business of government while it’s operating, not while its shutdown.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2019/01/16/markwayne-mullin-democrats-refuse-to-fund-health-services-for-native-americans/","Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) told Breitbart News that House Democrats blocked his proposed legislation to fund Indian Health Services (IHS), whose annual funding is in jeopardy due ongoing partial federal government shutdown.In a Tuesday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour, Mullin explained that Democrats on the House Rules Committee blocked his amendment, called the Pay Our Doctors Act, which would fund health services for Native Americans through the fiscal year. Democrats voted it down on an 8 to 4 party line vote.Mullin explained, “In our district, we have a very high Native American population. In fact, I represent more tribes than any other district in the country. I have 19 separate tribes, which is 19 separate governments, essentially, in my district alone.”LISTEN:Mullin continued, “Caught up in this fight is the Indian Health Services, because it’s part of the Interior, and the Interior is shut down, so the Bureau of Indian Affairs is underneath the Interior, and on the other side is the Indian Health Services. The tribes throughout my district is by far the largest employer in my 26 counties I represent.”As the statement on Mullin’s congressional website noted, his amendment would “ensure that both tribally-run hospitals and Urban Indian Clinics receive the funding they need to pay their doctors and keep their doors open.” The statement explains:During a government shutdown, tribally-run hospitals and Urban Indian Clinics do not receive annual funding, which is typically distributed in a lump sum at the beginning of a fiscal year. Hospitals and clinics are forced to make ends meet by using any remaining rollover funds from the previous year.  If no funds are available, hospitals and clinics are forced to furlough or lay-off staff.Mullin described the importance of the federal government’s treaty obligations to our sovereign Native Americans tribes.“The issue we have right now is that even though it’s a federal obligation because Indian Health Services came out of treaties that were signed with tribes, we essentially removed them from their traditional land.” said Mullin. “[We] said, ‘If you move to this part of the country, mainly Oklahoma, we’re going to take care of X, Y, and Z for you’ as part of a treaty.”Mullin went on, “Somehow that got caught up in this political crossfire, and in my opinion the federal government isn’t living up to their end of the bargain which is in breach of a trust, or the treaties to which it signed decades ago.”Mansour noted Mullin’s belonging to the Cherokee Nation. “You are also a member of the Cherokee Nation, so this is close to home for you in many ways,” she said. “These are sovereign nations, sovereign tribes. We have a duty to them.“Mullin replied, “I really appreciate you doing your homework on that, understanding that they’re sovereign nations, and it’s based on treaties. You’d be surprised how many — even among my colleagues — don’t understand that.”Mullin added, “Border security is vitally important. There’s no question that we’re locked in on this fight, and we have the same win to fight for, so losing’s not an option here. We’re all in on securing our border. What I’m trying to do here is expose the federal obligation. The IRS is an agency that was created by Congress. The EPA and Interior were services that were outside of the original Constitution or federal obligations we have as a nation. The responsibility we have to Indian Country is a true federal obligation. it is no different than us having to pay our national debt or the interest on it, because it is a treaty we have signed with these tribes. So this is outside of just shutting down the government, this is still a federal obligation, regardless.”Mullin stated, “So what we’ve been trying to do is make that argument to our colleagues on both sides, and so we put an amendment today in front of Rules; the Pay Our Doctors Act, and it was to make sure that during this government shutdown that the federal government doesn’t fail on their true responsibilities that we have to Indian Country.”Mullin recalled how House Democrats shut down his funding proposals for funding of Indian Health Services.“Unfortunately, I made the arguments, and then they didn’t let me stay in to receive questions,” stated Mullin. “In fact, the only questions came from the Republican side of the Rules Committee. Democrats never asked me a single question, and then they voted it down straight on party lines. I was extremely disappointed in that. I’m all about securing our border, but we also have to make sure we pay attention to the obligation that we have, because I feel like the federal government is going to actually get sued if this continues to go down this road, because we are in breach of the trust that we have with Indian Country, and we’re trying to cut that off.”Mullin implored, “We consider this payment. We were promised something to give up all of our land, so this is considered still paying off a debt that they had because we gave up a whole lot of land that we really, really, really liked that we had been on for generations prior to this — which is called our traditional land — and we were moved, and they said they would take care of this for the rest of infinity, because there was no end to the treaty. So this is still considered payment for the land that they stole — truly stole — from Indian Country.”Mansour asked what advice Mullin would offer President Donald Trump in pursuit of a deal with Democrats to fund southern border wall proposals.“Democrats are running scared of Nancy Pelosi,” assessed Mullin. “Right now, they’re all getting their committee assignments. Committee assignment are vitally important up here. None of them want to feel like they’re working with the president, at this point, because Speaker Pelosi isn’t working with the president. So the freshman members, they don’t want to look like they’re pushing against leadership by going up there and trying to negotiate something with the president. They’re afraid that Speaker Pelosi will retaliate and not give them a committee assignment, at all, much less one of their choices. Behind the doors, that’s what’s going on.”Mullin described Democrats as recalcitrant in opposition to Trump’s overtures for negotiation.“The president has done everything that he can,” said Mullin. “He’s offered to make deals. There was an offer on the deal before Christmas which was for funding the border wall. We would in return offer DACA [and] TPS, which is a program set up under the Clinton and Bush administrations, and anyone that served in the military with an honorable discharge or is currently serving with honorable service, that we would give them legal status; not citizenship, but legal status. In return, though we wanted funding for the wall. We felt like we were making a fair offer. I know the White House is feeling like they were making a fair offer, and it went nowhere. It’s not even like we were negotiating. It was, ‘No, we’re not giving you a penny for the wall.'”Mullin concluded, “At that point I don’t know what the president does. The president is obligated as commander-in-chief to make sure he’s doing all he can to protect the American people, and we have a huge national security risk on the southern border. We’ve known this for a long time. This is why in 2006 Chuck Schumer, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and even Joe Biden voted for the Secure Fence Act, which was to build no less than 700 miles of fence. If you look at the math of that, that was funded at $52 billion, which is about $74 million a mile, and they voted for it in 2006. Now, the only reason why they’re not doing it with President Trump is because of political reasons. That’s it, no other reason. So there’s no room to negotiate when people are making political decisions, and not rational decisions.”Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.

It is not going to fix the problem. She has to get serious about doing her job, not just be serious about being a political figure, and hopefully, we’ll see something break on that soon.”She continued, “Certainly we do not want the government to remain closed, which is why we asked Democrats to sit down help us solve the problem. We can’t continue kicking this down the road. We can’t continue to ignore it. We know there is a crisis at the border. American lives are at stake. The president wants to do what his constitutional duty is to protect those. I find it just appalling that Democrats are unwilling to do anything to fix this problem, work with the president and open the government.”She added, “The president will negotiate, but at this point, he will not negotiate with himself. He is the only one that has a proposal on the table. Democrats have yet to put anything forward other than obstruction. They have to put something on the table. They have to at least sit-down, willing to have a conversation. So far they have been unwilling to do anything. The president’s proposal has actual things that Democrats specifically asked for. They asked for more technology at ports of entry. They asked for a processing center, asylum processing center for people from Central America. They asked that the wall be not concrete but steel barriers. The president has given and puts the specific requests of Democrats into his proposal that he laid out for them. It is time for them to come to the table, work with us.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/16/pro-amnesty-group-shutdown-about-racism-racist-rally-chant/","The director of one of the country’s top pro-amnesty organizations blasted President Donald Trump on Tuesday for shutting down the federal government to “keep his reputation as the tough guy who stands up for white people who want to keep out brown people.”Frank Sharry of America’s Voice ripped the “damaging and absurd government shutdown” for not being “fundamentally about national security” or “fundamentally about immigration policy.”Sharry claimed the shutdown is actually “about racism” and a “racist rally chant” that appeals to Americans who want to “make America white again.”“If this was really about national security, we’d be talking about intelligence, radicalization, countering violent extremism by disrupting networks and modernizing terrorist watchlists. No serious national security expert obsesses about a border wall,” Sherry said in a statement. “If this was really about immigration policy, we’d be talking about modernizing our outdated immigration system in order to create a regulatory regime that manages immigration intelligently rather than represses it ineffectively.”Sharry also called the “Build the Wall” chant often heard at Trump’s rallies a “racist rally chant” and accused Trump of appealing to “white grievance.”“It’s about a racist rally chant. It’s about Trump appealing to white grievance by saying he is going to keep out the brown people with a medieval wall,” Sherry continued. “It’s about appealing to the lowest instincts of his base voters with the simplest and stupidest of prescriptions. It’s about Trump’s implied promise to stop the demographic changes underway to make America white again.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Tuesday evening said it is “criminal” for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to shut down the government and block the paychecks of federal workers because “he wants to look like a man.”Ocasio-Cortez went on Instagram Live and said, of the government shutdown, “frankly a lot of this is on McConnell” because “it’s not like they’re voting [appropriations bills] down.” She ripped McConnell for “blocking this whole process” and “sitting on appropriations bill after appropriations bills”McConnell, saying that border security has taken “a back seat to the political whims of the far left,” has emphasized that he will not bring up “show votes” that do not “lead to an outcome” while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) refuses to even negotiate with Trump on the border wall.“To sit on millions of dollars and fly on private jets while you are blocking the paychecks of 800,000 people is just criminal and, honestly, I wouldn’t want that karma on my head because that is a horrible, horrible thing to do,” Ocasio-Cortez said.Later, Ocasio-Cortez said the government is shut down because “Mitch McConnell wants to look like a man or Trump has to look like a man.”Ocasio-Cortez also wondered how Trump and McConnell have so much power.“You have to question how these people have this much power to begin with because this is ridiculous,” she said.The freshman Democrat said though she wants her Green New Deal, single-payer health care, and more criminal justice reform, she would “never told TSA workers’ paychecks hostage” for policies she wants.Ocasio-Cortez also said that some Republican Senators are ready to re-open the government, echoing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) suggestion that some of the appropriations bills could receive a “veto-proof” majority in the Senate.

Additionally, almost half of voters who describe themselves as “moderate” say a wall at the southern border is not immoral.Americans also by a majority want all immigration to the U.S. “tightly” controlled. About 53 percent of all U.S. voters said they supported strict controls on immigration, rather than the Democrat, billionaire donor, Wall Street, and business-first Republican preferred policy of mass illegal and legal immigration, in which the country current admits more than 1.5 million foreign nationals annually.Roughly 56 percent of swing voters said they support a policy to “tightly control” all immigration to the U.S., along with 80 percent of GOP voters who agree.Support for Trump's border wall increases 11 percentage points among swing-voters over year-to-year. https://t.co/ZQliDCvfJn— John Binder <U+0001F47D> (@JxhnBinder) January 15, 2019Currently, the federal government has remained partially shut down as House Democrats block any funding for physical barriers at the U.S.-Mexico border. A handful of Senate Republicans, meanwhile, crafted a plan to give amnesty to illegal aliens that ultimately failed to gain traction.President Donald Trump has said he is reviewing a plan to deem the border and illegal immigration a national emergency in order to fund a wall along the southern border.Border crossings in November 2018 — the last month from which data is available — hit close to 52,000, marking the highest level of illegal immigration in the month of November since 2006. Projections indicate that illegal immigration for next year will reach 600,000 border crossings, the highest level of illegal immigration in more than a decade. Last year alone, about 2,000 illegal aliens convicted of murder and those suspected of murder were arrested by federal agents.Meanwhile, drug overdoses in 2017 killed an unprecedented 72,287 U.S. residents, nearly three times the number of individuals killed by global terrorism. Nearly 50,000 of those deadly overdoses were caused by either heroin or fentanyl.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/15/accidental-opioid-deaths-top-car-accident-deaths-for-the-first-time/","Deaths from accidental opioid overdoses now top car accidents for the first time, according to a report from the National Safety Council.“Data, collected in 2017, shows Americans have a one in 96 chance of dying from an opioid overdose. The probability of dying in a motor vehicle crash is one in 103,” reports Fox News.“Opioid pain relievers are the most fatally abused drugs and they’re entirely legal. Roughly 60 people die every day as a result of overdoses from opioids – that’s 22,630 Americans,” Fox adds. “To put that in perspective, that’s roughly the size of the entire population of Auburn Hills.”Death from opioid overdose still don’t come close to deaths by natural causes: heart disease (1 in 6), cancer (1 in 7), respiratory disease (1 in 27), or even suicide (1 in 88). But the far-left New York Times reports that while deaths from natural causes are decreasing, “deaths from preventable causes have ticked up, and the result is that Americans’ life expectancy has actually decreased over the past few years.”The primary cause of this increase, according to the Times, is not pills like Oxycontin, but fentanyl, which is generally administered through a patch or intravenously.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump made opioid death and addiction a cornerstone of his campaign. He was well ahead of both the media, his own Republican Party, and his opponent, Hillary Clinton, when it came to this issue.Currently, the president is fighting to keep fentanyl out of America with additional border security, something Democrats and their media allies are fighting bitterly against, up to and including a partial shutdown of the government, which is now in its third week.Earlier this week, Breitbart News reported on the amount of fentanyl stopped at the border last year.“The Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit revealed in a year-end report that in total, about 2,737 pounds of fentanyl were seized in Fiscal Year 2018.”“The nearly 3,000 pounds of fentanyl is enough to kill about 600 million individuals, nearly twice the population of the U.S. where about 330 million residents live.”According to National Safety Council’s grim death statistics, whatever is being stopped along our porous border is nowhere near enough. The problem is getting worse as Democrats party in Puerto Rico. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

About 86 percent of Republican voters agree, as well.Swing-voters by a majority of 54 percent say there is a crisis at the southern border, while 58 percent of American men and 50 percent of American women say the same. Roughly 51 percent of college-educated whites say there is a crisis at the border and 64 percent of non-college educated whites agree.(Quinnipiac University Poll)Quinnipiac Poll: Do you believe there's a security crisis along the border with Mexico (Yes/No)Overall: 54%/43%GOP: 86%/12%Dems: 25%/71%Indies: 54%/42%College Whites: 51%/46%Non-College W: 64%/31%18-34 Yr. olds: 56%/39%Whites 57%/39%Blacks: 36%/59%Hispanics: 51%/48%— Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) January 14, 2019The poll is a blow to the establishment media’s narrative that illegal immigration and drug trafficking are not out of control at the southern border, though federal data does not support these claims.In her response address to Trump’s Oval Office address on immigration, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed the president was “manufacturing a crisis” at the southern border.Angel Mom Mary Ann Mendoza — whose 32-year-old son, Arizona officer Brandon Mendoza was killed by an illegal alien — blasted Pelosi and the media narrative in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News.“You will never know how hurtful that is to every one of us Angel Families who have been fighting this,” Mendoza said of the “manufactured crisis” claims. “It’s basically a slap in our face and a kick to our loved ones’ graves. A manufactured crisis — it’s unbelievable they can even come up with these words.”Currently, the federal government has remained partially shut down as House Democrats block any funding for physical barriers at the U.S.-Mexico border. A handful of Senate Republicans, meanwhile, crafted a plan to give amnesty to illegal aliens that ultimately failed to gain traction.President Donald Trump has said he is reviewing a plan to deem the border and illegal immigration a national emergency in order to fund a wall along the southern border.Border-crossings in November 2018 — the last month where data is available — hit close to 52,000, marking the highest level of illegal immigration in the month of November since 2006. Projections indicate that illegal immigration for next year will reach 600,000 border crossings, the highest level of illegal immigration in more than a decade. Meanwhile, drug overdoses in 2017 killed an unprecedented 72,287 U.S. residents, nearly three times the number of individuals killed by global terrorism. Nearly 50,000 of those deadly overdoses were caused by either heroin or fentanyl.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.

Today, support for the wall has climbed to 42 percent overall. Most notable, swing voters are increasingly supportive of the border wall to control immigration.Last year, less than 30 percent of swing voters said they supported the wall.

Democrat voters have not increased their opposition to the wall over the last year by even one percent.Among midwest voters, college educated voters, men, and white Americans, the border wall has jumped in popularity since last year. For midwest voters, the poll claimed only 35 percent supported the wall last year. Today, midwest support for the wall is up to nearly 50 percent, a 14 percent increase.Only 30 percent of college educated voters supported the wall last year, the poll stated. This year, 43 percent support the wall, a jump of 13 percent. Similarly, a majority of 54 percent of white Americans now support the wall, up ten percent from last year, and nearly 50 percent of American men support the wall, an increase of nine percentage points.Exclusive–Kris Kobach: A Wall Stops Illegal Immigration, ‘Drones and Sensors’ Don’thttps://t.co/3kGg2CsPDu— John Binder <U+0001F47D> (@JxhnBinder) January 8, 2019Currently, the federal government has remained partially shut down as House Democrats block any funding for physical barriers at the U.S.-Mexico border.

I couldn’t believe it,” Walls said, recounting the moment she realized she had won the lottery. Walls’s husband, John Walls, an employee of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is one of 800,000 government employees impacted by the shutdown, now in its fourth week and the longest in U.S. history.The shutdown talks are at an impasse as President Donald Trump weighs declaring a national emergency to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Despite several attempts to negotiate with Democrats, including comprises on the materials used to construct the way, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer refuse to support legislation to provide $5.7 billion in border wall funding.While collecting her prizes Friday, Walls told reporters she plans to take her family on a vacation to Disney World in Orlando, Florida.

Do you agree with him that there is a crisis at the border?CASTRO: What I believe is that he’s created a tragedy at the border. This policy of separating children from their parents and the terrible way that Customs and Border Protection has managed its responsibilities, including the deaths of two children within the last few weeks. That’s a real tragedy. And, you know, the folks down on the border know – and many of them have said – in fact, I just saw one border resident the other day on camera that said that a wall is not the answer. That we can have strong border security with personnel, with technology, but that the wall is not the answer. So the president may have his rhetoric, but everybody else has the facts right that a wall isn’t the answer.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that family separation policy has been paused at least. But there are a record number of family units crossing the border, and that creates a lot of challenges. So what would you do? Would you extend the amount of time that families can be held together in detention?CASTRO: I don’t believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we’re able to keep track of them in the country. And we have developed some ways to do that but that we don’t detain them the way that we have been. So no, I don’t agree with that. The other thing I’ll say Margaret, and this is very important is, I hope that folks remember that the president said that he wanted to do this family separation policy because it would deter more families coming from these countries. And actually, the exact opposite happened. And so he’s failed. He’s a failed leader on this issue, and now he’s just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time. And it’s just a failure of leadership all around. I would end this kind of family detention. I would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology, and that does not scapegoat these immigrants but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system.MARGARET BRENNAN: You’ve been calling immigration system broken for some time, and you were critical even under the Obama administration, specifically about their high level of deportations. So what do you offer as an alternative if you’re not going to detain and you’re not going to deport what do you do with illegal immigrants?CASTRO: Well, what I believe we could do and what the Obama administration did do I believe toward the end of its tenure was to look at things like ankle monitors so that you’re able to monitor where people are in the country and ensure that they report back when they need to and that they are part of, you know, legal proceedings. But we also need to be serious about recognizing the right of people to seek asylum. And the president is playing games with this, blocking people’s right to seek asylum. I would change that. I would make sure that we push as hard as possible for comprehensive immigration reform so that for the people who are already here, if they’ve been law-abiding, if they pay a fine, that- that they can get an earned path to citizenship. I still believe that that should be part of the answer.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

There should be timely negotiations on border security after the government is open.’ Once the president realizes he’s lost the Senate Republicans, we can roll up our sleeves, open the government and get down to business.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

So did Ms. Pelosi.”Davi went on to note that Schumer and then-Senators Barack Obama (D-IL) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY) supported The Secure Fence Act in 2006, which funded a 700-mile long border fence for $50 billion over 25 years.President Trump has repeatedly stated he is weighing whether to declare a national emergency to end the shutdown, allowing the government to build the wall without congressional approval. However, on Friday, he signaled that the move may not come so swiftly. “The easy solution is for me to call a national emergency. I could do that very quickly,” the president said at a White House event on border security. “I have the absolute right to do it. But I’m not going to do it so fast. Because this is something Congress should do.”On Wednesday, President Trump invited Pelosi and Schumer to the White House and kicked off the high-stakes sit down with a question: Will you support a wall in exchange for reopening the government?After Democrat leaders refused to support the idea, the president walked out of the meeting.Shortly after the failed tete-a-tete, the president tweeted that it had been a “total waste of time,” revealing that he told Pelosi and Schumer “ bye-bye,” because “nothing else works.”Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Schumer claimed a frustrated President Trump “sort of slammed the table,” then stormed out of the room. “Again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldn’t get his way,” the Senate Minority Leader said.On Saturday morning, President Trump chided Democrats for traveling to Puerto Rico, calling on them to cut a deal to end the “massive” humanitarian crisis at the border.We have a massive Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. We will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their “vacations” and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2019

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/12/hillary-clinton-americans-cant-afford-another-day-government-shutdown/","Hillary Clinton commented on the partial government shutdown, tweeting on Saturday that “Americans can’t afford another day” of what is now the longest-running government shutdown in U.S. history.Clinton made the comments as Saturday marked day 22 of the partial shutdown, surpassing the 21-day shutdown under former President Bill Clinton’s administration, which ended on January 6, 1996.Several government agencies are not receiving funding during the shutdown— including the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Interior Department, the Agriculture Department, the State Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and a few smaller agencies— but these agencies are providing “essential” government services despite the lack of funding.Clinton warned her followers at the start of the day that a continued government shutdown would cause “harm to our food safety and national security.”“As of today, this shutdown is the longest in history. The costs are already high: People are missing paychecks, losing business, or working without pay. Our national parks are overrun with trash,” the former 2016 Democrat presidential nominee tweeted Saturday morning. “The FDA and FBI warn of the harm to our food safety and national security”:As of today, this shutdown is the longest in history.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/01/12/dem-rep-scott-peters-theres-a-humanitarian-crisis-at-the-border-created-by-trump/","During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Representative Scott Peters (D-CA) stated that President Trump has created a “humanitarian crisis” at the border and that the wall “is never going to get built.”Transcript as Follows:“Hi, I’m Scott Peters and I represent San Diego, California in the United States Congress.When I first came to Congress in 2013, I asked the president of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce in San Diego – who also happens to be the city’s Republican former Mayor and Police Chief – what’s the number one thing the federal government could do to promote job growth in our region. He said we needed to make a federal investment in critical infrastructure at our border with Mexico.But this former Police Chief wasn’t asking for a wall.He was asking for a gateway – a bridge, and improved customs facilities at the San Ysidro Port of Entry because long delays at the vehicle crossing were costing our region billions of dollars in economic activity and 60,000 jobs per year.Working together, San Diego’s Congressional delegation, Republicans and Democrats, secured the additional $442-million in federal investment to modernize the San Ysidro Port of Entry. It is the busiest land border crossing in the Western Hemisphere, where commercial trade between San Diego and Tijuana is valued at $2.1 million per day.Our nation’s investments in Ports of Entry support a thriving international economy. They also provide critical border security. Customs agents inspect, weigh and x-ray vehicles and bags. They make sure travelers have proper identification and valid visas – that they are properly vetted and screened before entering the United States.215,000 tons of hard drugs were intercepted at ports of entry from 2012 to 2016. Agents at our ports everyday arrest criminals, seize narcotics and guns and deny admission to people they identify as a threat to national security.That’s what real border security looks like, and I can tell you that San Diegans want that border security. But we do not want a wall.In the last Congress, my colleagues Pete Aguilar of California, a Democrat, and Will Hurd of Texas, a Republican, proposed legislation with wide bipartisan support that included border security measures we could all agree on.It would have directed Homeland Security to perform a mile-by-mile assessment of our entire southern border to determine the most practical and effective way to secure it, and to offer Congress a strategy for each section of the border.It might be state-of-the-art technologies to detect tunnels, because even in places where we have a fence, as we do in San Diego, it’s easy to dig tunnels underneath.It might be sensors and radar to spot moving people and objects in any weather or time of day.It might be cameras mounted on drones to surveil places where the terrain is tough to monitor.Or, it might be, a physical barrier, such as a levee or fence if that makes sense in some places. But if Homeland Security wanted to recommend something as expensive as a wall in a particular place, they’d have to justify the extra expense against other less costly tools.In the last Congress, 193 Congressional Democrats and 23 Republicans acted to force a vote on these smart approaches to border security. But unfortunately, Republican leadership did not allow a vote on our bipartisan bill, but I bet most Democrats would support these measures in this Congress this year.So, when President Trump says Democrats are against border security and for open borders, he’s lying.We do not support a multi-billion dollar wall that will destroy sensitive lands, take private property, and can be tunneled under, climbed over or cut through, all while illegal border crossings have steadily declined over the past two decades. No. That’s not border security. That’s borderline crazy.The one truth the President did state is that there is a crisis at the border.There is a humanitarian crisis created by him.It’s a crisis when the President threatens to shut down the nation’s legal immigration and asylum process over a border wall that is really just a campaign gimmick.It a crisis when the President spends 72 million of your tax dollars to send our military to the border to confront a threat that didn’t exist, like he did in November, as a political stunt to rally the base.It’s a crisis when this Administration is allowing women and children – babies – to be dumped on American streets in the middle of the night with nothing more than the clothes on their back, without food, money, health screenings, or plans to get them to their destinations.And there is a crisis, when a government shutdown means that 800,000 federal workers are denied a paycheck this week, and now can’t pay their mortgage or rent, student loans, or medical expenses, hurting their credit rating because our President won’t budge on his impossible wall.And by the way, this shutdown includes the Coast Guard, which is a cornerstone of our border security. How stupid is that?Mr. President, Senator McConnell – Democrats have laid out for you several border security measures we can all get behind. Let’s re-open the government and talk about these ideas and quit holding the paychecks of 800,000 federal workers hostage to a wall that is never going to get built.”Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

The world envies those institutions. Why do you think those people are lining up to get into our country? They want to be in a place that has those kinds of institutions.

And all of those contracts and other people.”He added, “So this is something I think Donald Trump really does not—I think he comprehends it but doesn’t care, because he lacks that gene of empathy. He only does things that are going to benefit himself. I think that’s been his way not just since he was inaugurated, and long before that.

So what we’re saying is, Mr. President, we need to negotiate. It could be hard; you can veto some of our bills, but don’t shut down government in the process.

Mitt Romney (R-UT) on Thursday came out against a proposal for President Donald Trump to declare a national emergency to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall.“I don’t want to see a declaration of national emergency, I think that’s an action that would be taken in the most extreme circumstances, and hopefully we don’t reach that,” Romney told MSNBC host Kasie Hunt on Thursday.""I don't want to see a declaration of national emergency, I think that's an action that would be taken in the most extreme circumstances, and hopefully we don’t reach that,"" @MittRomney tells me, joining other Republicans discouraging POTUS from taking that route— Kasie Hunt (@kasie) January 10, 2019Ahead of his visit to Texas Thursday, President Trump told reporters that he is seriously considering an emergency declaration if Democrats continue to block legislation allotting $5.7 billion for a southern border wall.  “I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency. I haven’t done it yet,” the president said. “If this doesn’t work out, probably I will do it, I would almost say definitely.”In a recent interview with KSL Newsradio’s Dave & Dujanovic show, Romney called on the White House and Democrat leadership to reach a bipartisan agreement on wall funding which to end the government shutdown, now it isn’t 21st day. “The right approach is for there to be some kind of deal that can be done where both sides get something that they feel is important,” said the freshman senator. “But I don’t see movement to suggest that’s about to happen.”The Utah Republican expressed support for president’s position on building a wall, stating it “makes all the sense in the world.”“[President Trump] has staked out his position and he wants to build a border barrier. That’s something I concur with, by the way,” he noted.Romney also warned a national emergency declared by President Trump could set a president for future Democrat administrations to do the same for left-wing causes. “And I think we Republicans will be concerned that this kind of approach could be used by perhaps a Democrat president in the future, and that’s not something we want to see either,” he argued.While he did not propose for the president trade DACA for border wall funding, Romney argued that the time had come to address the issue, which would grant legal status to children brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents.“We’re not going to throw them out of the country, so there’s ground here to reach an outcome that’s good for both parties and that’s good for the country,” said Romney.Romney quickly set himself apart from other Republicans in the new Congress with a blistering attack on President Trump’s leadership and character.Romney put to rest expectations that he would take his time getting his footing in Washington. Instead, in a Washington Post opinion-editorial published two days before he was sworn into office, Romney said the president’s “conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions last month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.”In a Twitter response, President Trump said he hoped Romney wouldn’t follow in the footsteps of  Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) who often criticized the president and paid the price, opting to retire rather than risk defeat in a GOP primary in 2018.“Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful,” the president tweeted. “I won big, and he didn’t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!”Romney’s remarks prompted swift backlash from allies of the president in the Republican Party — including his own niece, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.McDaniel retweeted Trump’s remarks about Romney and added that the president is constantly “attacked and obstructed” by the media and Democrats.“For an incoming Republican freshman senator to attack” Trump @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the Democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive,” McDaniel tweeted.Romney, who was soundly defeated by President Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election, heavily criticized then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential race, describing him as a  “con man,” and a “fake.” “Dishonesty is Donald Trump’s hallmark,” he said in the same speech. However, in a show of unity, president-elect Trump put aside Romney’s criticism, and interviewed him for the position of Secretary of State, a job which ultimately was given to former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson. During the 2018 midterm election, President Trump supported Romney, an endorsement Romney gladly accepted.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The people who are seeking asylum who can no longer can get in, even though it’s legal to seek asylum, and not just at a legal port of entry.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/01/10/dem-rep-hill-toddler-trumps-tantrum-shutdown-is-political-terrorism/","Thursday on MSNBC’s “Live,” Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA), a newly sworn-in freshman member of the U.S. House, argued President Donald Trump was like “a toddler having a tantrum,” which is resulting in the “political terrorism” of a government shutdown.Hill said, “You know, has nothing to do with any of the issues that he’s suggesting and when you talk about declaring an emergency, a federal emergency, we’re from a state where we know all about emergencies and what should be a national emergency. And this is simply not one of them when you’re talking about pretend facts. You can say it’s a true humanitarian crisis for the people trying to come here but it certainly is not a national emergency, and it’s just like —it gets more and more frustrating every single day to see how irrational he is. We can’t accept this anymore. We have to hold the line. This is like a toddler having a tantrum. This is unacceptable moving forward. Negotiate with us but not on the backs of people who again have nothing to do with it.”She added, “In my district, we have a number of air traffic controllers, one actually came here from my district. Her name is Christie. She’s a veteran, mother of two. She told me about the stress that this is putting her family through. I have stories of people whose kids are trying to open up lemonade stands because they want to help their parents. We have people picking up second jobs. This is with air traffic controllers. We have to have these people operating at 100 percent capacity, and they are picking up second jobs to pay their rent or mortgage. Talking to lawyers, it’s not even an option. How are you going to pay them? It’s just —it really is a tragedy. this to me — I know it’s a strong word, but this is political terrorism.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Thursday called on President Donald Trump to declare a national emergency to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall, citing Democrat leaders’ unwillingness to comprise on border security legislation which would reopen the federal government.“Speaker Pelosi’s refusal to negotiate on funding for a border wall/barrier — even if the government were to be reopened — virtually ends the congressional path to funding a border wall/barrier,” Graham’s statement reads. “It is time for President Trump to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier. I hope it works.”Senate Judiciary Chair @LindseyGrahamSC: “It is time for President Trump to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier. I hope it works.” pic.twitter.com/y4LWRW8njj— Craig Caplan (@CraigCaplan) January 10, 2019Graham’s support for a declaration comes after expressing caution about the move earlier this week, saying it was not his “preferred route” and should be a “last resort.” Speaking with reporters earlier Thursday, the South Carolina Republican said he doesn’t see lawmakers will find a solution to end the shutdown, which has entered its 20th day.  “I have never been more depressed about moving forward than I am right now. I just don’t see a pathway forward. Somebody’s got to like, get some energy to fix this,” he said.In a Fox News interview last week, Graham predicted it will likely be “the end of [the Trump] presidency” if the president reopens the government without securing border wall funding.“This is a battle, to me, worth having, and I know it’s inconvenient,” Graham told host Sean Hannity. “By the way, I support all those furloughed employees. I don’t want them caught in a political crossfire. They deserve their back-pay. It’s through no fault of there own that they’re not viewed as essential services. But, does the president have other options for the wall?”“He’s not going to sign a bill that doesn’t have money for the wall,” he continued. “If he gives in now, that’s the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective president. That’s the probably the end of his presidency. Donald Trump has made a promise to the American people. He’s going to secure our border.”Meanwhile, President Trump, departing to the border town of McAllen, Texas, Thursday reiterated his willingness to declare a national emergency to build a southern border wall. Asked by reporters about a declaration, the president said as he left the White House, “I’m not prepared to do that yet, but if I have to I will.”“So we’re either going to have a win, make a compromise —because I think a compromise is a win for everybody— or I will declare a national emergency,” he added.It’s not clear what a compromise might entail. President Trump affirms he won’t reopen the government without money for the wall. Democrats say they favor measures to bolster border security but oppose the long, impregnable walling that President Trump envisions. He is asking $5.7 billion for wall construction.President Trump’s comments came a day after he walked out of a negotiating meeting with congressional leaders — “I said bye-bye,” he tweeted afterward.The White House meeting in the Situation Room ended after just 14 minutes. Democrats said they asked Trump to reopen the government but he told them if he did they wouldn’t give him money for the wall. Republicans said Trump posed a direct question to Pelosi: If he opened the government, would she fund the wall? She said no.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/01/10/robert-davi-rotten-corpse-schumer-lying-about-border-wall/","Veteran actor Robert Davi eviscerated Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) for reversing his support for a U.S.-Mexico border wall and criticized media networks for ignoring the New York Democrat’s “flip-flopping” on the issue.To the American people pic.twitter.com/oEkouZBnYL— Robert Davi (@RobertJohnDavi) January 9, 2019“My dear Mr. Schumer, what I find that you are doing is absolutely disingenuous,” Davi began in a video shared to his Twitter account.“How many times are you going to continue to sit there like a rotten corpse with a bald-faced lie on your face? I saw you, sir, vote for the wall.” the Die Hard actor continued as he wagged his finger disapprovingly.  “You voted for a wall, sir, several years ago. So did Ms. Pelosi.”Robert Davi then noted how Democrats, including Schumer and then-Sens. Barack Obama (D-IL) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY), voted for The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which funded a 700-mile long border fence to the tune of $50 billion over 25 years.“How come the networks aren’t showing your flip-flopping?” Davi asked. “Show that CNN, MSNBC! Show Schumer wanting a wall and now saying it’s ‘un-American, it’s immoral.'”The The Expendables 3 speculated the establishment media won’t challenge Schumer and other Democrats over their reversal because they possess a “Marxist-Socialist” background.”Davi’s remarks come as President Donald Trump visited the border wall town of McAllen, Texas, to push his demand for a wall, one day after failed negotiations with Democrats to end the partial government shutdown.On Wednesday, Trump invited Democratic leaders to the White House and began by asking if they would approve the wall in exchange for him ending the government shutdown. When the Democrats said no, he walked out.“A total waste of time,” the president tweeted of the meeting. “I said bye-bye, nothing else works!”Schumer told reported that President Trump “sort of slammed the table,” then “got up and walked out.”“Again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldn’t get his way,” he claimed.The Texas trip gives the president yet another high-profile stage to push his wall plan, following a national television address Tuesday in which he reiterated his demand for $5.7 billion for its construction. “We want a secure country,” he told journalists just before departing.President Trump has reportedly stated that his administration is evaluating the possibility of declaring a national emergency to build the wall.The Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.

Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security,” the president said in his nine-minute address, before lamenting a partial government shutdown entering its 20th day Thursday, could come to an end with a “45-minute meeting” with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).President Trump also highlighted the various crimes committed by illegal aliens, pledging to “never forget the pain” of those he met who have been impacted. “How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? For those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask to imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken,” he said.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/01/10/johnson-national-emergency-declaration-pandoras-box-likely-overturned-in-court/","Thursday on “The Hugh Hewitt Show,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) said it is likely if President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to build a border wall it would be overturned in the courts.Partial transcript as follows:JOHNSON: Well, first of all, I think the President will. He’s certainly shown himself more than capable of standing his ground whether you talk about trade or whether you’re talking about the border right now. And from my standpoint, I think one of the things Republicans ought to be looking at is just some really bare bones budgets. You know, acknowledging the fact that we are requiring people that are essential for national homeland security to work, we should pay those individuals. We should be preparing, and I’m actually working on a piece of legislation, there’s already one right now that I’m a co-sponsor of to fund the Coast Guard, but other essential personnel, we should pay those people. Hopefully, the administration will agree to do something like that. Hopefully, Mitch McConnell will bring it up on the floor of the Senate. I don’t think we should be fully opening these agencies, because Democrats simply will not negotiate in good faith if we were to do something like that. And of course, Nancy Pelosi was very clear in the White House yesterday that when President Trump said well, if we open up the government, will you work with me? You know, will I get my barrier funding? And she said no. And so again, the Democrats are being hypocritical. They’re paying lip service to border security. Barriers actually work. They absolutely do. We need them. It’s kind of a first step table stakes issue. But they’re playing politics. And I hope the President stands strong.HEWITT: Should the President invoke a national emergency declaration even though there are good arguments on both sides whether or not that is Constitutional?JOHNSON: Yeah, you know, I hope he doesn’t. I think that does open up a Pandora’s Box. I think we’d be far better off, again, with a very bare bones type of budget funding essential personnel, making sure those individuals get paid, funding just essential services of these agencies that are shut down right now. You know, one thing from a conservative standpoint, we could really take a look at, you know, where is the fat in some of these agencies and simply don’t fund it. And I think that would provide a fair amount of pressure on Democrats to really come to the negotiating table in good faith.HEWITT: But the consequences are spreading. I know one person whose home purchase is screwed up, because FEMA can’t issue flood insurance, and the cost of private flood insurance is prohibitive. And so there are consequences to a government shutdown that very few people see, but a lot of people feel. I’m not sure of the politics of this, but a national emergency declaration would allow you to reopen the government and then move the conversation to the courts, although as an Article I guy, you’re not going to like the idea that Article II can act unilaterally.JOHNSON: No, I don’t think any of us should. And let’s face it, I think we probably understand what the courts would rule in this case. I mean, they’re going to take it up to the 9th Circuit, and we know the result of that, so we still won’t get the barrier. So I want the barrier. I want a secure border. And I think the best way to do that is to acknowledge the fact, you know, the President was, came to our lunch yesterday, told everybody to hang together. You know, I’m all for doing that. I’m happy to hang with him. There will be increasing pressure, and legitimate pressure. I mean, there are some people really being harmed by this. There’s no doubt about it. So let’s address that specifically. Don’t completely reopen these agencies, but we should be ready with Plan B as Democrats, as Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer continue to dig in, let’s give them basically an offer that they simply can’t refuse, but still puts an awful lot of pressure on them to negotiate in good faith and provide the barrier funding that we need.HEWITT: But that ends up, again, leaving if not 800,000 people out of a paycheck, 400,000 people without a paycheck and the consequences of a shutdown, whereas a national emergency declaration allows you to reopen the government and moves the question of the president’s power concerning the border squarely, and Jonathan Turley has written a great piece on this in the Hill. I know you’re an Article I guy. But I’m not sure, it goes to the 9th Circuit, they’ll lose in the 9th Circuit. It would go up to the Supreme Court. Are you sure it would lose at the Supreme Court, Senator Johnson?JOHNSON: No, I have no idea. I’m not a lawyer. But let’s face it. The administration hasn’t been doing really well in court on a lot of these issues, because we still have a lot of very liberal, progressive judges that are not going to really rule based on what the law is. It’s going to be based on their policy preference. So let’s face it. Our courts have become very politicized, and that concerns me.HEWITT: Now, but do you believe if it got to the Supreme Court where there is a 5 member conservative majority, that he would win there on his right to protect the border via unilateral action?JOHNSON: I really don’t know.HEWITT: I don’t think anyone does. That’s the right answer. I don’t think anyone does. So given that it’s an open question, and I know Jonathan Turley thinks it’s an open question, you’ll get some ideologues and both sides who will say it’s a closed question. It’s not. Nobody knows what they would do. The key case here is Youngstown Sheet and Tube. Given that that is an open question, isn’t that preferred to opening the government sort of halfway? Or do you think yours is the preferred solution?JOHNSON: Well, again, I want to maintain pressure, because I actually do want to fund this wall the sooner the better. You know, Hugh, we do have a crisis. You know, it drives me crazy how Democrats are minimizing this problem. You know, in 2014, remember that enormous humanitarian crisis of unaccompanied children? Everybody recognized it. The Obama administration responded to it. The CBP was praised for treating these kids with real humanity. About 120,000 kids and family members came in, in 2014. Last year, 145,000 unaccompanied children and people in family units came into this country illegally. In the first three months of this fiscal year, 75,000 just family units have come in. so this is a growing problem, because we have a broken legal system. You know, we have the Flores reinterpretation, which is creating these incentives for people to come to this country. And once they get here, they are home free. And when I hear Democrats talk about technology on the border, I mean, that’s fine. We can track somebody, we can apprehend them. We process them. And then we disburse them, and they’re here to stay, because if we don’t detain them, it’s almost impossible to remove them. That’s the incentive that is fueling this growing crisis of unaccompanied children and families coming through our borders illegally And Hugh, there’s nothing humane about incentivizing girls to come up, a third of them, I think that’s a low estimate, get sexually assaulted. I’ve seen the pictures of a dead, desiccated animal-chewed bodies in the desert because we incentivize people to try and come to this country illegally. There’s nothing humane about that. That is the crisis.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

We’ve been telling you that for a number of days. He knows that if he tries to declare a national emergency on the southern border — that’s why he’s going down today, that’s the case he’s been making since the Oval Office address a couple of nights ago. His intent is to reprogram Department of Defense money, five billion dollars. Apparently, they’ve already found it. But he also knows that the Democrats will immediately challenge him in court — just like the DACA deal. And so, he expects that, but then, he would be able to re-open the government and then tell his supporters, “look, I did everything I could. If you want a clear victory, elect more Republicans to the Congress.”BRIAN KILMEADE: It would just be a disaster in the big picture and just show us being inept and unable to govern around the world. And, it would just set a terrible precedent. They will continue — as Erik Erikson brought up, he said: “look, the next president, if it is a liberal president, will say a state of emergency will be climate change. Look at what happened with [Hurricane] Sandy, look at what happened with the earthquake, look at what’s happening to the polar bears, who’ve no place to walk on ice.” This would be a bad sign that the courts are forced to do something that politicians can’t, and that is come up with solutions to problems.AINSLEY EARHARDT: Well, authorities down in Mexico realize that it’s a problem there in their country. as well. You always talk about the southern border down there. There are 12 legal ports of entry, that Southern side of Mexico, whether there are borders with Guatemala and Belize, and authorities have identified 370 additional illegal ports of entry. It’s not just a problem in our country, [it’s a] problem down there.President Trump will visit the border in McAllen, Texas, Thursday as the White House and Democrat leaders remain at odds over proposed legislation that would secure $5.7 billion in wall funding.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/10/donald-trump-edges-closer-to-declaring-state-of-emergency-says-legal-case-100-percent/","President Donald Trump appeared closer to declaring a state of emergency to respond to the border crisis on Thursday.“I have the absolute right to declare an emergency. I haven’t done it yet. I may do it if this doesn’t work out,” Trump said. “I probably will do it. I would almost say definitely.”The president spoke to reporters as he left the White House to visit the border in Texas to highlight his demands for more border security funding.Trump said that the legal grounds for declaring a state of emergency were “100 percent,” but added it was the easy path forward in the ongoing shutdown fight.“I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency. The lawyers have advised me,” Trump said. “I’m not prepared not to do that yet, but if I have to, I will. I have no doubt about it. I will.”He said he still preferred to make a deal with Democrats on border security, but indicated that he had no qualms about doing so.“We’re either going to have a win, make a compromise because I think a compromise is a win for everybody, or I will declare a national emergency,” Trump said.
The partial government shutdown is now in its 20th day, as Democrats refuse to compromise with the president.“If we don’t make a deal I would say it would be very surprising to me that I would not declare a national emergency and just fund it through the various mechanisms,” he said.Trump said there were several ways to fund the border wall, after declaring a state of emergency.“We have plenty of funds if there is a national emergency, there are a lot of funds,” he said. “We have a tremendous amount of funds.”

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/10/most-of-government-up-and-running-during-shutdown-some-workers-without-savings-suffer/","The partial government shutdown is in the spotlight as Democrats continue to deny President Donald Trump the $5 billion in funding to build a border wall. A close look at the battle reveals that except for some hardship for workers, the federal bureaucracy is up and running.The shutdown also sheds light on how massive the government is and could spark debate about the difference between — and the necessity for both —  “essential” and “non-essential” workers.Reuters noted in its roundup of the shutdown impact that this is not a Trump presidency phenomenon. The government has been temporarily shuttered 19 times since the mid-1970s. “The current shutdown has not affected three-quarters of the government, including the Department of Defense and the Postal Service, which have secure funding,” Reuters reported. “But 800,000 employees from the departments of Homeland Security and Transportation, among others, have been furloughed or are working without pay.”The Internal Revenue Service (IRS):At the IRS, 88 percent of the 70,000 people working are deemed non-essential.  Despite the drastic reduction in its workforce, Russ Vought, acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has said Americans would get their tax refunds despite the shutdown.U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)DHS is responsible for agencies under its purview, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Coast Guard, and the Secret Service.Almost all of the DHS employees — 213,000 out of 245,000 — are essential, according to the agency’s plan for operating during a government shutdown. That means they are still working but without pay until the government is fully funded.The leftist media has generated fake news about the TSA, saying workers are calling in sick putting the flying public in particular in peril. But Reuters reported “the TSA said on Tuesday the absences were having ‘minimal impact.’” “The agency said 4.6 percent of screeners did not show up for work on Monday, compared with 3.8 percent on the same day last year” — just over a 1 percent difference.U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)The Department of Housing and Urban Development, on the other hand, is operating with just over 300 employees, with 7,500 others furloughed because they are deemed “non-essential.”Moreover, even with the drastic cutback at  HUD, the most vulnerable populations the agency serves remain secure. “Public housing authorities and Native American tribal housing entities are not part of the federal government and so are not required to shut down,” Reuters reported.HUD’s contingency plans note that a prolonged shutdown could affect home sales “reversing the trend toward a strengthening market,” under the Trump administration.U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI)While the National Park Service is operating with a “skeleton staff,” volunteers have been stepping up to clean up sites in national parks and, according to media reports, some Americans have even donated money to help the parks weather the shutdown.In Washington, DC, the taxpayer-funded Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo are closed, although officials have reassured the public employees are caring for the animals at the zoo and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia — the zoo’s headquarters.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)Although some of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) inspections aren’t taking place, the agency has said it can respond to emergencies such as a food-borne illness outbreak.“Some scientific research projects also cannot continue in full,” Reuters reported.U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)“Food stamp recipients won’t miss their February benefits even if partial government shutdown continues, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Tuesday night,” UPI reported.“The agency found a way to fund the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for 38 million Americans without new appropriations from Congress, the agency said in a news release.”U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)At the Department of Transportation 20,400 of its 55,000 employees are on leave.“That excludes most of the Federal Aviation Administration, where 24,200 are working and the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) where all 2,700 employees are funded through other sources,” Reuters reported.The New York Times reported on Tuesday on the plight of federal workers who are either working without pay or are on leave. Those who don’t have savings set aside for a rainy day are struggling to pay bills. Some are turning to credit cards.Tanisha Keller, who works for the U.S. Census Bureau, “used to live paycheck to paycheck.”“Now she’s “living nothing to nothing,” the Times reported.Keller is counting on the government to make things right.“There’s no cushion,” Keller said. “When February rolls around, my rent’s going to be due, and I’m going to need the nation to help.”CNBC reported on Wednesday that the Democrats had changed their talking points in opposing Trump’s wall agenda to focus on workers like the ones the Times profiled.”[Trump] has chosen a wall over workers,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said on Wednesday as she and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) used furloughed employees as a backdrop for a press briefing. “The president needs to end his senseless shutdown and reopen the government.”“Trump, for his part, has downplayed the shutdown’s effect on government workers,” CNBC reported. “On Sunday, the former real estate mogul claimed he ‘can relate’ to federal employees who may not be able to pay bills.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/01/10/howard-stern-mocks-morons-who-support-trumps-border-wall/","Veteran radio host Howard Stern on Wednesday mocked President Donald Trump’s proposal U.S.-Mexico border wall, describing it as a political gimmick to whip up support from “morons.”As the partial government shutdown extends into its third week, President Trump and Democrat leaders remain at an impasse over the president’s commitment to sign legislation securing $5.6 billion to build a Southern border. Signaling a willingness to comprise on his chief campaign promise, the president is open to erect a steel barrier instead one comprised of concrete. On Wednesday, President Trump walked out of a meeting at the White House with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) after they reiterated their stance against funding the wall and extra security measures.
On his radio show Wednesday, Stern slammed President Trump’s Oval Office address and proposed border security measures. “The wall’s a problem because it’s a waste of money, even Donald knows that,” Stern, whose relationship with President Trump spans decades, claimed.“You gotta know Donald a bit to understand what’s going on here. The wall’s a simplistic answer to our problems with immigration. It’s something that, you know, morons can get behind because they’re like, ‘Oh yeah, if you build a wall no one can get over it.’ But it’s not that simple,” Stern continued.The longtime shock jock then ripped the president for seeking $5.6 billion in border wall funding, arguing the amount is billions less than the wall’s true price tag.“You’re talking about building a massive wall across this country on the southern border. It’s a tremendous amount of property and a tremendous amount of area to cover,” Stern told his listeners. “You’re not going to get a whole wall for $5 billion. If you really want a wall, it’s probably going to cost you some trillions of dollars.”“I would love to see Donald come on last night and go, ‘Fuck this, I’m not going to bullshit you guys. I want $20 billion,” he added.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2019/01/09/chinese-media-shutdown-cruelly-deprives-americans-vital-panda-cam/","The Chinese Communist People’s Daily Online spoke up on Tuesday for an overlooked class of victims from the U.S. government shutdown: panda enthusiasts deprived of the Smithsonian National Zoo’s Giant Panda Cam.“Smithsonian’s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute managed to stay open for the first 11 days of the shutdown, which began on December 22, 2018, but was forced to close its doors on Tuesday, Jan. 1, after its prior-year funds ran out because Congress and the White House are unable to reach a funding agreement. The much-loved Giant Panda Cam went black the following day on Wednesday,” the People’s Daily reported.According to the Smithsonian National Zoo, the live animal cameras “require federal resources, primarily staff, to run and broadcast,” and since they have been deemed non-essential, they “will not stream live until the federal government reopens.”The People’s Daily found the geopolitical significance in this abrupt cessation of real-time panda activity monitoring:The unfortunate situation is that until a deal is reached to end the shutdown, panda fans will be unable to enjoy the 24/7 live broadcast of resident giant pandas Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and Bei Bei chomping on bamboo, playing in trees, and tumbling in the grass.This may seem like a trivial matter. But for some, the loss has been unbearable, and they are calling for an end to the shutdown so that they can get on with life and enjoy watching the pandas.Some people have even called it a step too far and are outraged at the US government for being unable to do its job and reach a deal.Alas, the People’s Daily did not see fit to quote any of those people. It did, however, quote some Chinese commenters who took advantage of the situation to mock American charges against the Chinese state:On the English-language website of People’s Daily Online, one reader joked that China might need to place a guard around the pandas for safekeeping and possibly live stream it to the world.Another reader wondered if the giant pandas will be detained for “spying” and, if so, be put in a CIA black site because they may feel threatened by the intelligence of the pandas.Some even went further and joked that the US government might use the opportunity to comb through panda waste for alleged “technology theft.”The Communist paper wrapped up by using the U.S. government shutdown to tout the wonders of Chinese authoritarianism, under which the cameras pointed at pandas and humans alike are never turned off:The loss of the Zoo’s panda cam, while relatively minor in terms of overall impact of the shutdown, is just another sign that US democracy has become what American scholar Francis Fukuyama and others have labeled as a “vetocracy” — meaning the US government has become dangerously ineffective.Zhang Weiwei, a Chinese professor at Fudan University who has debated Fukuyama on such issues, has argued that the separation of powers in the United States has its weaknesses, as many vested interest groups fight against each other to block reform initiatives that are necessary for the country. As Professor Zhang has pointed out, it is getting harder to build a social consensus within the Western democratic countries. And as a result, the Western system of democracy has become more and more problematic.That is China’s ideological sales pitch in a nutshell: authoritarian rule is more effective than democracy because maximum leaders get things done. Whatever one might think of democracy’s flaws and the reasons for them – Fukuyama’s point about “vetocracy” is far more nuanced than the People’s Daily presents it, and slipping into Chinese-style autocracy is one of his major concerns – a temporarily blacked-out panda cam seems like a modest price to pay for the freedom to disagree.Fortunately, thanks to the wealth and innovative spirit of free-market capitalism in a representative republic, Americans have more than one panda cam to fill their needs. For example, the Panda Cam at the San Diego Zoo was up and running as of 3:00 p.m. Eastern time, affording a spectacular view of a panda’s posterior as the animal snoozed away the afternoon in a tree.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/09/government-shutdown-wont-affect-food-benefits-february/","President Donald Trump directed agencies to ensure government food benefits will be dispensed in February despite a partial government shutdown.Congress has failed to pass a funding bill that secures the border, but President Trump has secured the nutrition low-income Americans need, according to a release from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). “At President Trump’s direction, we have been working with the Administration on this solution. It works and is legally sound,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Tuesday. “We want to assure states, and SNAP recipients, that the benefits for February will be provided.”USDA funding expired on December 21, 2018, as no funding bill made it through both Houses of Congress to keep a portion of the federal government open.At the president’s direction, the Office of Management and Budget has been working with agencies like USDA to find funding for prioritized programs like SNAP.The Trump administration has developed a strategy under the law to keep government nutrition programs providing services through February. Part of this solution involves directing states to submit a request for early issuance instead of operating under the regular monthly submission process. States must make their request by January 20, as this is within the 30-day provision allowed for the government food programs under the continuing resolution.Early issuance has been used in disaster situations such as impending hurricanes to issue these benefits ahead of a potential disaster in preparation. Secretary Perdue and Brandon Lipps, acting deputy under secretary of Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services (FNS), confirmed on a Tuesday conference call that this is being done without dipping into the $3 billion contingency fund.When asked what happens if the shutdown extends into March, Secretary Perdue urged that Congress fund border security as part of a bill to reopen the federal government. He pressed that the temporary solution to funding nutrition programs through February gives Congress ample time to act.Under the determined solution, those covered under SNAP will receive their benefits as usual without disruption. The USDA has ensured that other major nutrition assistance programs will have the necessary funding to proceed through February without interruptions.“SNAP monthly issuance for February is estimated to be approximately $4.8 billion and State administrative expense (SAE) is estimated at about $350 million for a total need of approximately $5.1 billion,” according to a USDA release. The process does require careful coordination between the agency and states.“The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has prior year funding which USDA will begin to provide states this week to facilitate February benefits,” according to the USDA. “Other FNS programs, which provide critical assistance to our nation’s food banks, the elderly, and Tribal nations, may continue to utilize grant funding provided prior to the lapse in appropriations. Commodity deliveries to those programs will continue.”Michelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News — follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook.

But thanks to a sharp Twitter user, we have something even more delicious to point and laugh at…It was less than 30 months ago when the far-left Vox.com was doing its explanatory explaining to explain just how useless, unnecessary, and, yes, dangerous, the TSA is.No, really…The headline says, “The TSA is a waste of money that doesn’t save lives and might actually cost them.”Did you get that? Did you get about how the TSA might actually be … killing people?It gets better:[The TSA is] annoying, but it’s also worse than annoying. The TSA’s inefficiency isn’t just aggravating and unnecessary; by pushing people to drive instead of fly, it’s actively dangerous and costing lives. Less invasive private scanning would be considerably better.Breitbart News reached out to Ezra Klein to see if there is a reasonable explanation for this massive flip-flop, an explanation for why the TSA went from “unnecessary” and “dangerous” to America-Is-Doomed-Without-It in such a short period of time.Klein responded with these three words: “Orange man bad.”Okay, I made that up, but what other explanation is there?

Sanders said the president is right to claim the United States faces a national emergency, except that the emergency, according to Sanders, is “an emergency and a crisis that [Trump] himself created.”Sanders began by blaming the government shutdown on “an assortment of right-wing ideologues,” referring to the border wall as a waste of money. The senator added border security can be implemented in another way, but did not give any specific examples.“It is inhumane that tiny children at the border have been torn away from their parents,” continued Sanders, who also suggested that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients were additional victims of the president.The senator added that it is “heartbreaking” that nearly “11 million undocumented people” worry about whether or not they will be deported and “separated from their loved ones.”During Sanders’ response to President Trump, the senator did not, however, mention officer Ronil Singh, who was fatally shot by an illegal alien one day after Christmas, permanently separating him from his wife and five-month-old son.Instead, Sanders accused the president of trying to “create fear and hatred” for speaking of such incidences, and that the real crisis was not about our southern border, but instead, about health insurance, student loan debt, and workers earning “starvation wages,” among other issues.“That’s a crisis!” exclaimed Sanders, dismissing the president’s concerns.Sanders also claimed that “thousands die each year” due to not having health insurance, but that the “biggest crisis of all” is probably climate change.“The scientific community has made it very clear in telling us that climate change is real and is causing devastating harm to our country and the entire planet,” concluded Sanders in his response to President Trump, adding that the entire planet will likely become “unhealthy and even uninhabitable in the not so distant future.”The senator finished by informing the president that his address to the nation regarding border security was simply creating “artificial crises,” and that the government shutdown must end.You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) responded to President Donald Trump’s Oval Office address Tuesday evening, claiming illegal immigrants “act more American” than proponents of strong border security.In an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, Ocasio-Cortez accused President Trump of holding the paychecks of furloughed government workers “hostage” to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, a proposal the self-avowed Democrat-socialist described as a “campaign fantasy.”“In the actual address, there was falsehood after falsehood and we have to make sure that we get our facts straight. Everyday immigrants commit crimes at a far lower rate than native-born Americans,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “And not only that but the women and children on that border that are trying to seek refuge and seek opportunity in the United States of America with nothing but the shirt on their backs are acting more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be.”Rep.

And moreover, the one thing that the president has not talked about is the fact that he has systematically engaged in the violation of international human rights on our border,” she continued. “He has separated children from their families.”“The president should not be asking for more money to an agency that has systematically violated human rights. The president should be really defending why we are funding such an agency at all because right now, what we are seeing is death,” Ocasio-Cortez added.In his prime-time remarks, President Trump called on Democrat lawmakers to fund a border wall, stating that it is needed to end a humanitarian “crisis,” blaming drugs and violence in the United States on illegal immigration.“How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?” he asked.On Thursday, President Trump will visit the Southern border to highlight his proposal for a wall.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/08/president-trumps-oval-office-address-on-border-crisis-sets-the-stage-for-2020/","President Trump’s address to the nation from the Oval Office on the border crisis Tuesday evening set the stage for the 2020 presidential campaign.The president began his eight minute address by noting that “There is a growing security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border.”It is, he added, “a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.”He then outlined the statistical evidence that proves the crisis and added to that the very personal details of individual Americans killed by illegal aliens in this country.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), two of the least popular politicians in the country, sounded a very different tone in the Democratic response.The president is trying to “manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from turmoil,” Schumer said.The real issue should be ending the federal government shutdown, the Democratic leaders argued.Both claimed Democrats also want border security, but methods other than a wall should be used to accomplish that.“The fact is,” Pelosi asserted, “walls are an expensive and ineffective way” to address border security.Trump made no mention that he is considering the possibility of declaring a national emergency in order to build the wall using Department of Defense funding, as many expected.That option, however, looms over his invitation to Democrats to meet with him in the White House tomorrow.As Breitbart’s Joel Pollak noted, the president talked victims, while Schumer and Pelosi talked government.Going in to the president’s Oval Office address, more Americans agreed with the president than agreed with Schumer and Pelosi.A poll released by Morning Consult and Politico earlier on Tuesday showed that a plurality of Americans support President Trump’s assertion that the country is facing a crisis at the border, as Breitbart News reported:Forty-two percent of voters say the “U.S. is facing a crisis,” while only 37 percent say the “U.S. is facing a problem,” according to the poll of 1,989 registered voters, which was conducted with Politico.Amid the flows of migrants and drugs from Central America, 12 percent say the U.S. “isn’t facing a problem or crisis,” according to the poll, which was conducted January 4 to 6.Among Republicans, 72 percent believe the U.S. is facing a crisis, 19 percent believe it’s a problem, and four percent say there’s neither a problem nor a crisis.Among Democrats, only 19 percent believe the U.S. is facing a crisis, 52 percent believe it’s a problem, and 21 percent say there’s neither a problem nor a crisis.Among Independents, 37 percent believe the U.S. is facing a crisis, 37 percent believe it’s a problem, and ten percent say there’s neither a problem nor a crisis.As the 2016 presidential results proved, however, aggregate voter behavior at the national level does not determine who is elected president by the electoral college.Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a 48 percent to 46 percent margin, but Donald Trump won the electoral college vote (excluding the seven faithless electors) by a 306 to 232 margin.What matters in determining who will receive a majority of the electoral college votes necessary to win the 2020 presidential election is voter behavior at the state level, and specifically, voting behavior in 17 battleground states where the outcome of the 2020 presidential election is uncertain. (Those 17 states include Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Maine, North Carolina, Virginia, and Florida).No matter who the Democratic nominee is, 13 blue states and the District of Columbia are certain to vote for the Democrat. (Those 13 states include Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, California, Illinois, New York, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Rhode Island.)President Trump, the likely Republican nominee, is almost certain to win 20 red states (Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi,  Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wyoming.)The president and the Democratic leaders spelled out two vastly different views of what is important to the American people Tuesday evening.Republicans almost universally rallied to the president’s call to action, while Democrats stood by Pelosi and Schumer.Those competing views will set the stage for the next 22 months of political battle leading up to the November 2020 presidential election.While the argument may well make the blue states bluer, and the red states redder, and perhaps even give the Democrat candidate a greater popular vote margin in 2020 than Hillary Clinton had in 2016, in the end, it will be how those arguments play out in the minds of voters in the 17 battleground states that will determine who secures the electoral college majority to win the presidency in 2020.

Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security,” he stated. “This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting.”President Trump listed gruesome examples of crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including a “beheading and dismembering,” and vowed to “never forget the pain” of survivors he met.“How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? For those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask to imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken,” the president said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

What was most apparent was the degree in which he appears to be an utterly defeated and broken man — somebody who feels the walls closing in on him. It was the low-energy speech. I suspect the political consequence of it will be that Republicans are going to crack. They’re going to take a walk in the serious way for the first time during the Trump presidency.”He continued, “Of course, Trump claimed full credit for it, celebrated it, said he would be proud of the shutdown. And so we see now Republicans living with the consequences of having an inept lying, incompetent, racially demagoguing president talking about this issue. ”He added, “This is a con man at work. And what we’re seeing here is that the wizard has been exposed. At rally after rally, what did he say? Many billions of times the Mexicans would pay for the wall. Where are the pesos? He’s talking about $5 billion when he told the American people over and over again that there would be a wall, a wall paid for by Mexico. There is no wall. There will never be a wall. No wall will ever be funded. And he has denied this central victory against all the racial demagoguery we saw from the moment he descended the escalator at Trump Tower. It’s all becoming undone. And that desperation, I think, was on full display today. And of all the things you could say about Trump until tonight, the one thing you really couldn’t say is that he’s boring. He was just boring tonight. The shtick is getting old. It was to some degree like the episode when Fonzie jumped the shark tonight, coining that famous phraseology.

Rubio, however, argued that Democrats remain defiant toward his proposed legislation, because “a significant [number] of Senate Democrats now support BDS,” and that leaders within the Democratic Party want to avoid a floor vote that would reveal their support for the BDS movement’s discriminatory economic warfare against Israel.The shutdown is not the reason Senate Democrats don’t want to move to Middle East Security Bill.A huge argument broke out at Senate Dem meeting last week over BDS.

The president is facing many challenges this evening. He needs to convince at least some of the 57% of the public who oppose a border wall that there is a clear and present need for one. He needs to buck up wavering Republicans on Capitol Hill whose constituents are starting to feel the pain of the government shutdown, convincing them that the current standoff is worth it. And if convincing the public that problems add up to the crisis, the president needs to surmount his own crisis of credibility. Polls suggest roughly 60% of the public considers the president to be dishonest and untrustworthy. And there may be no issue where the president and his administration have been more misleading than on the subject of immigration.”After highlighting the administration’s comments on terrorists crossing at the southern border, Trump changing the wall from concrete to steel, and the president’s claim former presidents said they should have built a wall, Tapper said, “Trump’s own senior administration officials privately acknowledge that the continued spreading of falsehoods about this issue has created a real problem as the president takes to the mound and prepares to make his pitch.”He concluded, “It’s almost as if the public can’t even hear what the president has to say because around the issue of border security there has been built a wall, a wall of misinformation, a wall of lies.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/08/chamber-of-commerce-end-shutdown-by-giving-amnesty-to-illegal-aliens/","U.S. Chamber of Commerce executives are urging the split Republican-Democrat Congress and President Trump to end the government shutdown by giving amnesty to more than three million illegal aliens.In a letter to Congress, Chamber of Commerce Vice President Neil Bradley writes that Republicans and Democrats must come together to grant amnesty to about 3.5 million illegal aliens enrolled and eligible for President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.Bradley writes:We urge members of Congress and the administration to expeditiously complete legislation to re-open the federal government and seize the opportunity to both improve border security and provide protection for Dreamers and long-term TPS beneficiaries. [Emphasis added]The Chamber of Commerce executive claims the DACA amnesty is necessary for the “long-term health” of the American economy.“The Chamber supports a deal that combines increasing border security with protection and legal status for Dreamers and long-term beneficiaries of the TPS program,” Bradley continues. “These are important policy objectives that would improve the near-term and long-term health of our economy while also demonstrating that it is indeed possible for policymakers to make progress on a politically fraught issue.”Corporate interests and the big business lobby have the most to gain from granting an amensty to DACA illegal aliens, as legalizing millions of low-skilled foreign workers would drag down wages for Americans, drive up profit margins for corporations, and leave U.S. taxpayers with the costs.The ‘Amnesty First’ Trap: Trump Supporters Concerned Trade to End Shutdown Would Cause Illegal Immigration Surgehttps://t.co/X7IXb7kdMX— John Binder <U+0001F47D> (@JxhnBinder) January 8, 2019A DACA amnesty would put more U.S.-born children of illegal aliens — commonly known as “anchor babies” — on federal welfare, as Breitbart News reported, while American taxpayers would be left with a $26 billion bill.Additionally, about one in five DACA illegal aliens, after an amnesty, would end up on food stamps, while at least one in seven would go on Medicaid.Any plan to give amnesty to DACA illegal aliens that does not also include provisions to halve legal immigration levels would give amnestied illegal aliens the opportunity to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country through the process known as “chain migration.”The chain migration inflow from a DACA amnesty has the potential to reach nine million foreign nationals arriving in the country, as every two newly naturalized citizens bring about seven foreign relatives to the U.S. with them.Despite major opposition from Trump’s base of supporters to for an amnesty-for-wall funding deal, the plan has been touted in White House discussions, as it is favored by the billionaire donor class.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/08/poll-plurality-agrees-with-trumps-border-crisis-description/","President Donald Trump has more public support for his argument that the nation is facing a border crisis than Democrats have for their claim that the nation is merely facing a “problem” on the border, according to a Morning Consult poll released Tuesday evening.Forty-two percent of voters say the “U.S. is facing a crisis,” while only 37 percent say the “U.S. is facing a problem,” according to the poll of 1,989 registered voters, which was conducted with Politico.Amid the flows of migrants and drugs from Central America, 12 percent say the U.S. “isn’t facing a problem or crisis,” according to the poll, which was conducted January 4 to 6.Trump’s “crisis” argument is backed by 72 percent of Republicans, 37 percent of independents, and 19 percent of Democrats.The Democrats’ “problem” rhetoric is backed by 19 percent of Republicans, 37 percent of independents, and 52 percent of Democrats.Twenty-one percent of Democrats — but just four percent of Republicans and ten percent of independents — say the cross-border flow of cheap labor and drug-smuggling is neither a problem nor a crisis.The poll is bad news for Democrats, who are increasingly claiming there is no border crisis that President Trump can cite to declare a national emergency and then build a border wall with unspent funds.Just to be clear: there is no basis to declare a national emergency. https://t.co/ZrfjzqdZR6— Eric Holder (@EricHolder) January 8, 2019However, a series of lawyers admitted to establishment media outlets that existing laws provide Trump with the legal authority to build a wall after declaring a national emergency.Left-lawyers admit past Congresses gave Trump emergency powers which he can use to build a wall with federal funds. Ooops. Next: Dems will argue that migrant/drug crisis is not a real crisis b/c Dems & biz are OK with it. https://t.co/sNoDj7Qc1w— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 8, 2019The poll also showed 44 percent support for a border wall and 47 percent opposition to a border wall. Eighty-three percent of Republicans and 13 percent of Democrats support the wall, while 83 percent of Democrats and 14 percent of Republicans oppose the wall.However, the poll also shows lopsided opposition to government shutdowns. Sixty-five percent of voters say “Presidents should take all necessary steps to avoid a government shutdown. They should achieve their policy goals another way,” while 22 percent said, “Presidents should allow a temporary government shutdown if it helps them achieve their policy goals.”Twenty-nine percent said Trump has done enough to foster agreement, while 52 percent said he has not done enough to avert a shutdown.

For example, Nancy Pelosi kept talking about the concrete wall, and during the meeting, the president talked to Nancy and said, look, we’ll design it together. We’re looking more at steel barriers. We’ve been listening to our Border Patrol agents, and they believe that that’s the most effective way to ensure that we’re able to decrease illegal crossings from the border. And so, in essence, the president has been wanting to negotiate it. It’s why he stayed over Christmas here and sent over a good faith offer to the Democrats. In fact, we sent over a budget request that included specific items that the Democrats requested, including humanitarian assistance at the border, and — as well as counternarcotics technology. There is — and the Democrats, Stuart, refused to negotiate. They refused to come to the table, while the president is here, ready to make a deal.”Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Kamala Harris (D-CA) accused President Donald Trump of spreading “propaganda” to get the funding to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.Partial transcript as follows:BEHAR: We’re now in day 18 of Trump’s shutdown. Let’s call it what it is. It’s his shutdown.HARRIS: Yeah.BEHAR: He’s going to give a speech tonight. There will be a lot of lies in the speech. We know that. They need, in my opinion, to chyron the truth. What if he is effective? What if he convinces people of these lies? What will the Democrats do?HARRIS: Well we have to keep speaking truth. There’s no question. Whenever faced with a lie, we have to speak truth. Again, that’s part of my book. And it’s going to be about the media. I mean, I think that there’s no question that the American public is increasingly starting to understand that they do need to question the veracity of the administration’s statements.BEHAR: Yep. In real time.HARRIS: But—but for good reason. But for good reason. We’re two years into an administration that has proven itself and there’s plenty of empirical evidence that—that there are statements that are being made that are simply just not the truth. And are frankly—and are frankly often, especially leading up to the midterm, pardon this term, propaganda.BEHAR: Right.HARRIS: And we have to call it what it is. And again, the American public deserves better. We have enough problems. One doesn’t need to create a problem. One does not need to create a problem. This issue is about a vanity project for this president. And it is a problem of his own making. And listen, when I travel this country, folks have plenty enough problems that they need their president to focus on instead of a wall that, by the way, because I was a prosecutor for many years, including the attorney general of California—I specialized in transnational criminal organizations.

Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), the first Palestinian-American woman elected to Congress, refused once more to apologize for her profanity-laden pledge to impeach President Donald Trump — but did express regret that the remark became a “distraction.”“I am a person that is authentically me,” Tlaib said during her remarks at an event for the Michigan Veterans Foundation on Tuesday. “I’m very passionate about fighting for all of us, and the use of that language was a teachable moment for me.”Rep. Tlaib on ""impeach the motherf—er"" comment: ""I don’t want anything that I do or say distract us. And that’s the only thing I will apologize for, is that it was a distraction … I want you to know that I will never apologize for being me, and for being passionate and upset"" pic.twitter.com/4Mp7nbvPZR— NBC News (@NBCNews) January 8, 2019“I understand I am a member of Congress. And I don’t want anything that I do or say to distract us. That is the only thing I apologize for, is that it was a distraction,” the freshman congresswoman added. “We have a course that we have to stick to, and nothing I say should distract us from that. The shutdown has to be at the forefront, that’s what I am here for, to shift to. This is so much more important.”During the event for veterans, Tlaib discussed the partial shutdown’s effect on government workers and the impact on her constituents.“It’s a critical moment for us in our country to fully grasp the human toll that this shutdown has in our communities,” said Tlaib.“As we enter the third week of this shutdown, we are still waiting for the United States Senate to take action and for the president to signal a willingness to end this harm not only for our federal workers but for our families and resident impacted by government programs they need today,” she added.Tlaib’s pledge left many fellow Democrats unhappy, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said she does not condone Michigan Democrat’s coarse language. In a town hall event broadcasted on MSNBC, Pelosi reminded viewers that Tlaib’s impeachment pledge does not represent the Democrat caucus’s position on the hot button issue.Asked about the remark in a Rose Graden press conference, President Trump said Tlaib “dishonored” both the United States and her family.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) slammed the reaction to the Tlaib’s pledge and vowed to protect her fellow freshman congresswoman from what she described as “faux outrage” stirred by Republicans. “Republican hypocrisy at its finest: saying that Trump admitting to sexual assault on tape is just ‘locker room talk,’ but scandalizing themselves into faux-outrage when my sis says a curse word in a bar,” tweeted Ocasio-Cortez over the weekend.“GOP lost entitlement to policing women’s behavior a long time ago. Next,” the Democratic-Socialist continued.In a subsequent tweet, the self-avowed Democrat-socialist then told Tlaib that she has her back, proclaiming that the Bronx and Detroit “ride together.”

If the government is still closed on Feb. 1, the Feb. 15 payment can also be delayed.The issue has some urgency for baseball teams in particular.

I am convinced the courts would stop the president if he declares a national emergency to build a wall.

The president can’t go around that power by making up a national emergency and appropriating funds Congress didn’t authorize. This national emergency is completely made up.

He’s not going step away from it. He’s going to have a prime-time address in the Oval Office tomorrow, and he’s going to be talking to his base. He’s not talking to the country, like most presidents, Democrats, and Republicans, have done in the past. He’s just talking to his very small and shrinking base. We talk a lot about illegal immigrants, and that’s who he goes after. There’s one more thing I want to say, we talk a lot about undocumented immigrants, and that’s whom he goes after. I think Donald Trump wants to get rid of legal immigration. And it’s because of people who come from brown and black countries. Just a year ago, it was reported that he said, ‘I don’t want anybody coming. Why do we have to have people from African nations, s-hole countries?'”She added, “That was just a year ago. He’s made himself really clear from the moment he announced coming down the escalator, talking about Mexicans are rapists.”Jean-Pierre continued, “He said he wants people from Nordic countries. That’s what he wants.”She concluded, “I think that’s what all of this is about. Right? This is the type of country he sees that he wants.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/07/exclusive-kris-kobach-a-wall-stops-illegal-immigration-drones-and-sensors-dont/","Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach says only a wall can stop illegal immigration, while promises of “border security” with “drones and sensors” merely facilitate crossings at the United States-Mexico border.In an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriot’s Breitbart News Sunday, Kobach says it is a border wall, coupled with U.S. Border Patrol, that can stop soaring illegal immigration at the southern border, not the Democrats’ and Republican establishment’s preferred promise of “border security” measures.Kobach said:The argument we sometimes hear from people who say they want border security but really aren’t serious about it is ‘Oh, we’ll just have drones and sensors.’ Well, a drone and a sensor tells you that somebody is entering the United States, it doesn’t stop the person from entering the United States. The wall is exactly, the single most effective tool, other than Border Patrol agents, and that’s what we need. The American people recognize it. [Emphasis added]Listen to Kobach’s full interview here:Kobach said a wall along the southern border is immensely popular with Americans, pointing to the GoFundMe campaign that has raised close to $20 million to fund a border wall.“We the American people are so desperate for a wall, so desperate for control of our southern border that literally [hundreds of] thousands of people have donated millions of dollars … in a 19 day period, the GoFundMe campaign raised $19 million, which is just staggering,” Kobach said. “There’s never been a campaign on GoFundMe that’s raised money that quickly.”“It’s amazing that the most basic, straightforward appropriate the money, build the wall option is encountering so much resistance among the open border crowd in Congress,” Kobach said.The loyal Trump supporter revealed he is also considering a run for the U.S. Senate to replace Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS), who announced his retirement.“Securing our nation’s border and stopping this illegal immigration problem that’s been plaguing this country for so many decades is one of my top priorities,” Kobach said. “It’s been the central focus of my career, so one way or the other, I’m going to keep pushing towards that objective.”“In the months ahead, if running for the Senate is the best way to achieve that objective, then I’d certainly consider it even more seriously,” Kobach said.The federal government has been partially shut down for more than 15 days now as Republicans, Democrats, and the Trump administration have yet to reach a deal to fund a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal immigration.Meanwhile, border-crossings in November 2018 hit close to 52,000, marking the highest level of illegal immigration in the month of November since 2006. Projections indicate that illegal immigration for next year will reach 600,000 border crossings, the highest level of illegal immigration in more than a decade.Breitbart News Sunday is broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. eastern.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/07/tax-refunds-will-go-out-despite-partial-government-shutdown/","The Trump administration has ensured that tax return checks will go out despite an ongoing partial government shutdown. The administration has worked with the Office of Management and Budget to ensure the IRS issues tax refunds despite a partial government shutdown that affects the IRS.Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought emphasized during a Monday briefing with reporters that the Trump administration has worked to make the partial government shutdown as painless as possible consistent with the law. Vought on Monday acknowledged concern over whether tax refunds would go out while the government is shut down. He assured refunds will go out.Vought added that they made sure the Coast Guard has gotten paid and that flood insurance policies will be covered. The administration has also worked with OMB to ensure the park service has not only remained open, but that over the weekend the trash was collected. Fish and wildlife services will be kept open as well. Pence repeatedly pointed out during Monday’s briefing the refusal of Congressional Democrats to negotiate on border security and reopening of the federal government.The vice president called weekend meetings between Trump administration officials and staff of Congressional leaders productive, but added, “That does not mean to imply that we made progress.”“I think we gained a better understanding” of the crisis on the southern border and priorities to address that crisis, Pence explained. He said he pointed out during the meetings that the staff representatives had been given no power from their members of Congress to negotiate reopening the government and securing the border.Pence said the president and his administration’s position is very simple – that there is a humanitarian crisis at the U.S. southern border. He said the president has been negotiating to reopen the government and to secure the border and has directed OMB to mitigate effects of the shutdown for the American people.Michelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News — follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook

No, he does not have to build a wall.”She continued, “Listen I spent a year and a half talking to Trump supporters, there is one exchange with a man at a rally in Ohio in late 2016, I wrote about it in my book. I asked this man ‘Why do you support Donald Trump?’ ‘Because he’s going to build a wall,’ he says. ‘What if he does not,’ I countered. ‘I trust his judgment,’ the man said. In other words in the eyes of Trump’s base, whatever Trump is doing is the right thing or he would not do it. It is just that simple. So no, Donald Trump’s base is not holding him to a wall.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/07/the-nuclear-option-time-for-taxpayer-shutdown/","Well, this is awkward.The federal government has been shut down for three weeks now and it is hard to find a single tax-paying, Average-Joe citizen who has been affected — unless, of course, you happen to work for Uncle Sam.It is literally true that you could go from building to building along the National Mall and completely shutter a good number of federal government agencies and it would take years before the first regular American knew the departments had been killed off. (Except, of course, for the incessant, alarmist yammering about it from the left-wing media.)Sure, it’s a big deal if you are a federal employee or a contractor who earns a living off the Byzantine web of debilitating red tape and federal bureaucratic regulations that define most of the federal government these days. Otherwise, even if you are actively looking for ways the government shutdown might affect you, it is nearly impossible.Now, stop and think about that. Take a look at your last pay stub. Look at the percentage of your check that went to Uncle Sam. You didn’t even get to hold that money. It just got dumped right into the government coffers.Now compare that amount of money that you spend on something else. Say, a car payment. Or bills around the house. The house note.Now consider that you made your payment every month on that car — but you never got to drive the car you were paying for. Or you paid all your house bills but the heat never came on.The lights never worked. Or, if they did, they came on so dimly that you couldn’t actually see the light.What is the difference between that and dutifully paying your taxes every pay period for services from the federal government that you actually never even notice?Obviously, there are exceedingly important, yet amorphous, things that your payment to the federal government pays for. The most important, of course, being enough aircraft carrier groups that nobody gets any funny ideas about invading our rich little island home here.But even when it comes to this — the single most important job of the federal government — Washington fails.Sure, we have the greatest, most powerful military ever assembled by human beings. But we have an illegal invasion of millions of immigrants across our Southern border and these people cannot even build a wall to stop it.Of course, the idea that the federal government can be shut down for weeks and nobody notices is a matter of great alarm to the left-wing media.So, they write wacky stories to scare you into thinking that this government shutdown is actually something terribly grave.“Three dead in national park system as shutdown wears on.” I am not making this up. This took not one but two crack reporters from The Washington Post to think that one up.I am not sure which is worse: Reporters so stupid that they think a federal government employee could have prevented these accidents or a couple of reporters so craven that thought it was acceptable to politicize such tragedies.Either way, the biggest outrage in the whole sordid mess is that even though nobody seems to notice that the government has been shut down for three weeks, innocent taxpayers are still paying all the bills.You know, if Republicans in Washington were actually serious about winning one of these government shutdowns, they should immediately introduce legislation to bar the federal government from collecting any taxes while the government is closed. No work, no pay.Now, that is a fight that even Republicans could win.• Contact Charles Hurt at churt@washingtontimes.com or on Twitter @charleshurt.

It’s probably the biggest section we’ll get out. So while we’re fighting over funding, we’re also building.”A White House aide told Breitbart News that there is always a possibility that the president will visit the border in January but did not have specific guidance on the president’s future plans.Trump faces a messaging war with Democrats over the government shutdown fight, as Democrats began the new year sounding the alarm on how the partial shutdown is hurting Americans and government employees.The White House bargaining sessions with Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have delivered few results, but the president continues to argue his case for border security. Trump spoke at length about the issue during a Rose Garden press conference with reporters on Friday and spoke to reporters twice on Sunday as he traveled to and from a staff meeting at Camp David.As the fight heats up, the president still has two cards to play in the messaging war with Democrats.Trump allies continue to press for the president to deliver an Oval Office address to the nation about the crisis at the border. A trip to the border would also demonstrate to Americans the need for more border security.The White House is also exploring the idea of declaring a state of emergency on the border, which would allow Trump to shift funds immediately to the border. That decision would require a full-scale messaging war to make his case to the American public.

Mia Love (R-UT) and Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) as new political commentators for the network.The two discussed the continued partial government shutdown, which “New Day” host John Berman suggested that if both Love and Gutierrez were still in Congress, they would work to get a deal done to end it.“We would get it done,” Love declared.“This thing was set to fail right when it started,” she continued. “You have people in a room. You have a president that says if you don’t give me a wall, I will own the shutdown. I thought the Democrats were like, ‘Great, take it. Deal done,’ because it was just, we don’t have to give you a wall, and you’re going to own a shutdown. There was no leverage. There was nothing that would even set the precedent for a really good deal or compromise in Congress. In the House, we actually had a good comprehensive bill that had a border wall, it had border security, it had helping people at the borders, helping families stay together at the borders, had a fix for DACA, which is something that we have worked on together as the daughter of parents who immigrated to this country — this is something that has been very important to me and getting Republicans to come along with that. We actually had a really good comprehensive bill that we couldn’t get through. And so it was just really frustrating to me because we’re leaving everything in the hands of the administration. That’s where it shouldn’t be. Whenever you consolidate too much power in the White House, it’s doomed to just fail.”Gutierrez stated, “I think [Democrats] should continue to maintain their current posture until this administration comes forward and says, ‘You want to do something comprehensive, here’s our comprehensive.’ Not this, ‘Oh, we’re going to go from concrete to steel.’ What I want to do is to go from this cruelty to a little bit of humanity versus our immigrant community.”Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

A senior Government source added that Ms Cooper’s amendments would be “the first of many” attempts to stop a no deal Brexit should MPs vote down Mrs May’s unpopular EU Withdrawal Agreement in the week beginning January 15th.There was no mention of a ""deal"" on the ballot paper. The British public were given the binary choice of Leave or Remain.Fantastic point from @PeterBoneUK on #Ridge this morning!#LeaveMeansLeave pic.twitter.com/yt5kEL7Mw9— Leave Means Leave (@LeaveMnsLeave) January 6, 2019May’s withdrawal agreement has found opposition from Brexiteers resulting in the prime minister postponing the House of Commons vote before Christmas in face of certain defeat — mainly over the issue of the Irish backstop which could see Northern Ireland locked into regulatory alignment with the bloc after the transition period, should London and Brussels not strike a deal, in order to stop a so-called ‘hard border’ with EU member state Republic of Ireland.While the establishment media has taken to referring to the plot as a “Trump-style” government shutdown, the comparison misses a fundamental point: President Donald Trump’s shutdown is intended to push the American government to fulfil the will of the American people by securing the U.S.’s southern border, while Cooper’s team seeks to shut down the British government to frustrate the will of the people.Both the Labour and Conservative parties’ 2017 General Election manifestos ran on pledges to respect the referendum vote and leave the EU; while Mrs May has been pushing MPs to accept her Withdrawal Agreement, a ‘no deal’ Brexit — the default legal position if the lower house votes down May’s agreement — is fulfilling the referendum result as Tory MP Peter Bone told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.“The only way you’re going to get on and deliver Brexit is what’s called a ‘no deal’ Brexit. And then at the end of March we’ll be out of the EU and we will have left.“There was no question, that I remember, on the referendum about a ‘deal’ or not; it was ‘leave’ or ‘remain.’ And the way you leave is to come out on the 29th of March.”REPORT: May Could Postpone Final Brexit Agreement Commons Vote Again https://t.co/WqOys2AONP— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 6, 2019

In an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press, set to air Sunday, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney reiterated that the administration was willing to cut a deal with the Democrats, stating President Trump is willing to forgo a concrete wall for steel or other materials.“If he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence in order to do that so that Democrats can say, ‘See? He’s not building a wall anymore,’ that should help us move in the right direction,” Mulvaney told host Chuck Todd.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Pelosi said that the conversation was “lengthy” and “contentious.”Schumer said that Trump warned Democrats the government would remain closed until border security was funded — even if it took “months” or “years.”Trump said Democrats wanted to do “something” but did not respond to their demands to reopen the government.The partial government shutdown is now in its 14th day.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/04/shutdown-showdown-donald-trump-releases-border-security-briefing-democrats-ignored/","President Donald Trump released a Department of Homeland Security briefing that Democrats interrupted on Wednesday, as they refused to fund border security in their bills to reopen the government.“Some of those present did not want to hear the presentation at the time, and so I have instead decided to make the presentation available to all Members of Congress,” Trump wrote in his letter released moments prior to a second meeting with Democrats at the White House.According to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Democrats interrupted Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen’s Wednesday briefing in the Situation Room.The White House released the eight-page briefing as well as a letter from the president to all members of Congress.Trump congratulated the newly anointed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and urged legislators to fund border security.“As we begin this new Congress, our first task should be to reopen the Government and to deliver on our highest duty as elected officials: the security of the Nation and its borders,” he wrote.Trump called for members of Congress to listen to law enforcement personnel on the border and take into account the facts on the ground regarding the border.“Absolutely critical to border security and national security is a wall or a physical barrier that prevents entry in the first place,” he wrote.The federal government is now in the 14th day of a partial shutdown resulting from the impasse between Democrats and President Trump.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/03/democrat-spending-bill-offers-12-billion-more-for-foreign-aid-0-for-border-wall/","The spending bills proposed by House Democrats to end the partial government shutdown offer no funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, but provide over $12 billion more in foreign aid than the Trump administration requested, according to a statement on Thursday from the White House Office of Management and Budget.The statement warned the new House Democrat majority of President Trump’s intention to veto the bills, noting that the administration “cannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the Nation’s urgent border security needs.”The statement reiterated President Trump’s request for “at least $5 billion for border security” and asserted that the Democrats’ proposal “does not come close to providing these necessary investments and authorities.”The White House then highlighted the billions in funding the Democrats are offering for “unnecessary programs at excessive levels” beyond what the Trump administration requested, including:The statement’s full passage regarding the Democrats’ additional funding reads:The six bills provided for under H.R. 21 provide funding at levels nearly 20 percent higher than the President’s FY 2019 Budget. For instance, H.R. 21 provides $12 billion more for international affairs programs, 29 percent higher than the President’s request. This includes $2.9 billion more than the request for economic and development assistance, including funding for the West Bank/Gaza, Syria, and Pakistan, where our foreign aid is either frozen or under review. It includes $700 million more than requested for the United Nations, including restoring funding for the United Nations Population Fund. The bill would also undermine the President’s Mexico City Policy (Presidential Memorandum of January 23, 2017), which prohibits the funding of foreign nongovernmental organizations that promote or perform abortions. Further, H.R. 21 includes approximately $2 billion in excessive Environmental Protection Agency funding, providing funds beyond the Agency’s core mission and including funding for programs that can and should be executed at the local level. The bill also includes substantial unrequested funding for HUD programs, including $7.1 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request for HUD rental assistance programs. These and other excessive spending items makes the lack of adequate border funding in the combined package all the more unacceptable.“The administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that will adequately secure the Nation’s borders and get the federal government back to work for the American people as soon as possible,” the statement concluded.Update: The Democrat spending bills passed the House on Thursday night. The first bill, a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8, passed by 239-192. The bill would “keep border security funding at $1.3 billion, providing no new funding for the barrier along the southern border,” the Hill reports. The second bill to fund the other six agencies through September passed by 241-190.

So, Democrats are not going to cave in on this wall demand. Because the American people do not support the wall. However, Democrats, we will support border security. We can compromise and work on funding border security. I think that’s what we should do.”He added, “I would be open to a comprehensive package that deals with different elements of immigration. However, we can’t do that in the context of a government shutdown. Democrats will never cave to Donald Trump’s demands in a government shutdown. Because if we do, it’s just going to incentivize him to do this again any time he doesn’t get his way. So, we cannot talk about wall funding in the context of a government shutdown.

We believe the wall is wrong on many counts. The wall is ineffective, most experts agree with that. The wall is expensive,” Schumer stated. “He says it’s a campaign pledge he must keep. That was not his campaign pledge. His campaign pledge was to build the wall and have Mexico pay for it, not American taxpayers. So it’s not a campaign pledge.”He added, “The Trump administration has not even spent the border security funding allocated by Congress last year.”Schumer then stated he had much rather have the Statue of Liberty represent America than a border wall.“To so many Americans, we do not want the wall to be a symbol of America. Much preferring the Statue of Liberty be that symbol. The symbolism is bad for the country, for our economy, for our security, for our ability to get along in the world.”“Democrats certainly support strong, effective border security,” Schumer argued. “Fencing, drones, technology, roads. What the experts say actually works.”Schumer then said he asked the president on “multiple occasions” during their meeting why “large portions of the government” should be shut down while having a separate debate about the border.Schumer claims Trump “couldn’t name one.”“President Trump is holding the government hostage over his wall, using the well-being of millions of Americans in a futile attempt to get what he wants. A concrete border wall,” Schumer claimed.In concluding his speech, Schumer said, “We have given our Republican colleagues a way out of the shutdown based on Republican approved proposals. All leader McConnell needs to do to reopen the government is to bring to the floor the legislation that he, and nearly every other Republican senator, already supports.”Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) predicted Wednesday evening that it will likely be “the end of [the Trump] presidency” if the president reaches an agreement with Democrats to end the government shutdown without funding for a southern border wall.A partial transcript is as follows:SEAN HANNITY: You offered a compromise [to end the shutdown]. Now, Democrats also say they care about the DACA kids. What is your compromise?SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: The compromise is [to] give the president the $5 billion we need for walls [and] border security as a down payment to securing the border. The DACA population is about 700,000. Give them work permits, three-year work permits, so they don’t have to worry about getting deported anytime soon. The TPS people who came here years ago from war-torn areas, hurricanes, and floods, and renew their legal status — no pathway to citizenship — and call it a day. It’s called a compromise. The president said, “let’s make a deal.” The Democrat’s response is, basically, “got to hell.” They’re going to send a bill from the House to the Senate that has no money for the wall. It’s not going to see the light of day. Mitch McConnell is never going to bring a bill on to the floor of the Senate that doesn’t have money for the wall. We need the wall. They’ve all voted for the wall. And the only way we’re going to get the wall is to fight for it.HANNITY: This is a battle, to me, worth having, and I know it’s inconvenient. By the way, I support all those furloughed employees. I don’t want them caught in a political crossfire. They deserve their back-pay. It’s through no fault of there own that they’re not viewed as essential services. But, does the president have other options for the wall?…SEN. GRAHAM:  You can move some money around, but he’ll get sued. There will be lawsuits in California to stop any effort to have other agencies fund the border, but there is some money you could use for sure. But, why should this president have to play that game? Why should Donald Trump have to do that, when Democratic presidents and Republican presidents in the past were able to get money to secure the border from Democrats?…HANNITY: If this takes 150 days, I think the Republican Party needs to stand united with the president. I have confidence in you. I don’t have confidence in some of your colleagues, but saving lives, stopping drug trafficking, and human trafficking is worth the fight. Will the president hold the line?SEN. GRAHAM: Let me tell you how our government works. Any bill passed in the House has to come from the Senate, has to get 60 votes, and for it to be signed into law, the president has to sign it. He’s not going to sign a bill that doesn’t have money for the wall… If he gives in now, that’s the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective president. That’s the probably the end of his presidency. Donald Trump has made a promise to the American people. He’s going to secure our border.

Now, this seems abstract and for now maybe a couple of museums are closed. But these are real agencies that do real things for real voters and real interest groups who are in touch with real senators. I think with the Agriculture Department shuts down and can’t roll over loans and can’t fulfill various obligations to farmers, when EPA can’t tell a business, yes, we are signing off on this, so you can go ahead and build this—suddenly the businessman calls up his or her senator, I would say, including Republican senators and says, ‘What’s going on here?’ I mean, fine, have a fight about the wall and DHS if you want, Homeland Security, didn’t the House just pass the bipartisan appropriations bills that everyone agreed to in the Senate already? Can’t you pass those?”He added, “I think people underestimate how much political pressure there will be on Republican senators to accept the six appropriations bills that the House is going to pass, which are not connected to Homeland Security and not connected to the wall and affect real people and real businesses and real citizens in these different states.

One day tweeting a picture of these sort of Venetian blinds looking things and then the next day saying ‘No, no, it’s still a wall.’ It’s hard to deal with, and this is why you also have a Senate majority leader also saying we are not going to do anything until we know where he stands because they know that they can’t necessarily trust that that he will keep a position that he takes from one day to the next.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

He’s not going to get $5 billion for a wall. And the most mysterious, unexplainable part in all of this, is why the president decided that he’d rather deal with House Democrats than House Republicans in order to avert, or get his way out of a government shutdown.”He continued, “I think the president has backed himself into a corner.

And they just don’t.”“You can’t really make a bargain with somebody who is irrational because they won’t keep it,” the one-time failed presidential candidate continued. “The Republicans and the Democrats in Congress have got to do the best they can to run this country in the absence of the chief executive. Until the Republicans realize they have an obligation to the country, not just their party, that’s not going to happen.”With 2019 just hours away, a resolution to the government shutdown, which went into effect December 22, does not appear to be tenable with Democrat leaders Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY). President Trump is holding out on a deal to secure $5 billion in funding to construct a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.On Monday morning, President Trump once again reaffirmed his commitment to fulfill his chief campaign promise to build the wall. “I campaigned on Border Security, which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall,” the president tweeted. “Our Southern Border has long been an ‘Open Wound,’ where drugs, criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country.

Linsdey Graham (R-SC) met with President Donald Trump over lunch on Sunday and suggested a new deal in which the president would renew 700,000 work permits in exchange for $5 billion towards border security.The premise upon which Graham’s deal is based is that Trump would win the court case currently working its way through the system about the legality of the administration’s decision to cancel President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Trump’s decision was blocked by a California court, whose ruling is still awaiting an appeal decision before the Ninth Circuit.There would be no deal in which Trump offered legal status to all DACA-eligible illegal aliens — those brought to the U.S. as minors, even if they did not apply for DACA status — according to Graham. The veteran South Carolina Senator, a long-time advocate for immigration reform, said that even he would not provide DACA for $5 billion, because Democrats had refused to provide Trump with the full $25 billion requested for a border wall in return for legalization of all DACA-eligible illegal aliens earlier this year.Meanwhile, Graham said, Democrats might pass a new budget resolution in the House when they formally take the majority on Thursday, to re-open those parts of the government that had been shut down, but Trump would not sign it without at least $5 billion for border security. He suggested that the Senate would therefore never even consider that option.“The president is firm in his commitment to make sure we get money for border security, and there will never be a 60-vote deal in the Senate that doesn’t include money for border security-slash-wall. And I don’t see Democrats giving us more money unless they get something,” he said (via CNN).He added that the $5 billion would pay for “border security-slash-wall-slash-fencing, whatever you want to call it, in areas that make sense.”He said that he might re-introduce a bipartisan proposal from three years ago called the “Bridge Act,” which he introduced with Sen. Dick Durban (D-IL), to protect the 700,000 DACA recipients for three years, with one renewal.Graham said that while the president had not committed to the deal proposal, it was the “outline of a potential breakthrough.” He said Trump was “open-minded” about “combining wall funding with other things.”Graham also said that Trump wanted to destroy the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS, before pulling U.S. troops out of Syria: “We’re inside the 10-yard-line.”Joel B.

Jon Tester (D-MT) said President Donald Trump wants “to use the American taxpayer like an ATM machine” to pay for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.Partial  transcript as follows:BRENNAN: Your colleague Senator Shelby said negotiations are at an impasse and they need to find out what Democrats want and when. As the Democrat here what can you explain?TESTER: Well first of all, Margaret, I would just say that you know we passed a bill a couple of year- couple of weeks ago to keep- keep the government open. And the House refused to take it up. I think that the fact we’re at a government shutdown is nothing short of ridiculous. I think that Senator Shelby and- and others are- are spot on. We need to sit down and- and pound out a deal. I think that that agreement that the- the Senate passed- in a bipartisan way, a couple weeks ago would have give us the opportunity to come to an agreement. The problem is-is- is that the president has one point three billion dollars from last year for- for border security, actually $21 billion for border security, one point three for the wall that he has spent very, very little of that.BRENNAN: He says needs more.TESTER: Yeah. And he says yet he needs more. Yet there’s no plan to go where the money how the money is going to be spent or any analysis on what’s most effective to secure the border. Bottom line is, Margaret, is that I don’t talk to anybody in the Senate that doesn’t want secure borders. It’s just how the money is going to be spent. And if the president wants to continue to take a campaign promise that he made, which was to have Mexico pay for a wall and say no the rules have changed now we’re still going to build a wall but we’re going to have the American taxpayer pay for it we’re going to use the American taxpayer like an ATM machine. That’s not the right direction to go.BRENNAN: The White House says it’s Democrats who walked away from the table. You heard Senator Shelby say there there was an offer that he put forward of two and a half billion this year two and a half billion next year. What happened to that?TESTER: Well I think that- that that deal never got passed leadership. But- but what did happen this last year is the president asked for one point six billion dollars in his budget proposal for this next year. The Appropriations Committee, which Senator Shelby chairs, and Senator Leahy is a ranking member of agreed to that in a bipartisan way. Senator Shelby voted for it. Senator McConnell voted for it. The president moved the goalposts and said, no, now I want five billion.BRENNAN: Well and they’ve come down to around two. Why can’t Democrats come up from one point three?TESTER: Well I think that that’s negotiations that need to be done between leadership between Senator Shelby, Senator Leahy and others and move forth. But the big thing is is that how is the money going to be spent. What’s the most effective way to secure that southern border. And that’s really what’s important here. I think we can do it with technology and manpower and much more effectively than- than with a wall.BRENNAN: You heard Senator Shelby say there that he thinks probably you’re going to have to talk about things that Democrats have said they wanted including protections for dreamers. Is that the kind of sweetener that would get Democrats to reconsider?TESTER: Well I think we’ve been here before. I was- I was in the room when the president said if- if Congress passes that I’m going to sign it. And then he moved back away from that. And so I think ultimately in the end we do need comprehensive immigration reform, there’s no doubt about that, Margaret. But- but in the end we need to know what the president wants. And hopefully he’ll stick to it. When we passed the bipartisan funding to go to the first of February, a couple weeks ago, the president said he was gonna sign it. And then after we passed it he said he wasn’t going to sign it. We need some predictability.BRENNAN: The president said, of those two migrant children who’ve died in U.S. custody, that it’s Democrats fault. Essentially he’s arguing that there’s incentives that are in U.S. law that encourage people to cross and take this really dangerous migration route. How do you respond to that?TESTER: Well I respond to the fact that we need comprehensive immigration reform that needs to be there for a while. I think it’s everybody’s fault. This is unacceptable. And- and the bottom line is is that if we’re able to get comprehensive immigration reform done, which is going to require some–BRENNAN: That’s a big ask.TESTER: Senate leadership and leadership in the White House too. Then I think that we will see things settle down in the southern border in a big, big way.BRENNAN: Is there a cost for Democrats to appear to work with the president?TESTER: No, I think what Democrats need to do is they need to work for the country and make sure that not only the southern border, but the northern border is secure make sure that we have the ability on the borders to be able to screen every vehicle coming across to make sure that drugs don’t come into this country. And I think that if we’re able to get a plan to be able to do that, which I don’t think is that hard to do, I think Democrats and Republicans can work together to- to make sure that we have a secure border and- and keep this country safe.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

He lives in a world in which he watches things on TV, on one network, sometimes CNN a little bit. In that world he’s got designated talkers who are paid by the network, sometimes to go on TV and tell Donald Trump things that he likes. Like the Democrats are divided, or that the country will blame them.”He added, “Meanwhile, he is about to face this decision. December 31, New Year’s Eve is coming up. There are people who have paid $200,000 annual memberships to go to Mar-a-Lago and schmooze with the president. That’s money that goes into his pocket. He’s expected there. The Secret Service has paid $50,000 for tents for the Secret Service for them at this Mar-a-Lago New Year’s Eve party. Will President Trump go? I assume he will want to go. How will things look the next day when there are images of the president in black tie talking to people who paid $200,000 a year for access to the president while people are out of work? This is a dynamic situation. And there is no exit for the president.”“He’s already begging for a fig leaf,” he added. “Five billion dollars doesn’t build a wall, now give us $2.5 billion, eventually, give us $1.3. At that point Democrats will say, do they want to give the president cover, and maybe for a lot of reasons they’ll want to do that and proclaim it a victory or they won’t and make him eat it.

In the decades I’ve had battles with him here in New York, Donald Trump is not as smart as we give him credit for. What he was reacting to was Rush Limbaugh and many that talk to his base had started saying things that were negative, which is why he panicked about his base. There is a direct correlation between Limbaugh and Ann Coulter and all of them saying you’re not getting anything done, even Tucker Carlson. Now he comes back with the wall, now we’ve got migrants marching, he does the move to go to visit the troops in Iraq, and then, again, opens his mouth and jams himself again.”He added, “A fish wouldn’t get caught if he kept his mouth shut.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/28/nancy-pelosi-endures-partial-government-shutdown-luxury-resort-hawaii/","Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), House minority leader and, most likely, soon-to-be House speaker (D-CA), is enduring the partial federal government shutdown at a luxury resort in Hawaii.The Washington Free Beacon reported that Pelosi, who calls the impasse over $5 billion for a border wall the “Trump shutdown,” is at Fairmont Orchid resort, where prices range from $899 per night for a standard room to $4,899 a night for the presidential suite:The resort, on Hawaii’s Big Island, features a golf course, six restaurants, and a 10,000-square-foot oceanfront pool. It also features a “Spa Without Walls,” where the 110-minute Ali’i Royal Experience is available for $369 and a 50-minute couples massage runs $549, according to the spa menu. While at the spa, guests can snack on a gluten-free grilled prawn summer roll for $19.This is not Pelosi’s first holiday vacation to Hawaii. In 2011, it was reported by the Hawaii Reporter that Pelosi had in previous years stayed in a $10,000-a-night suite at the Four Seasons Resort in Kona for her holiday vacation.Pelosi slammed Trump on Twitter during the Christmas holiday, claiming his holding out to get border funding is harming Americans. Apparently, it is not harming her vacation plans.“Instead of bringing certainty into people’s lives, @realDonaldTrump is continuing the #TrumpShutdown just to please right-wing radio & TV hosts,” Pelosi tweeted:Instead of bringing certainty into people’s lives, @realDonaldTrump is continuing the #TrumpShutdown just to please right-wing radio & TV hosts.— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) December 24, 2018The Daily Caller reported:The House passed a stopgap funding bill on Dec. 20 that included $5.7 billion to construct a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, however, with a 51-seat majority, Republicans fell short of the necessary 60 votes needed to send it to President Donald Trump’s desk for signature. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed to kill the legislation on arrival in the Senate, and consequently, a government shutdown has been in effect since funding expired Dec. 21.The Democratic leaders pledged not to appropriate a single dollar towards funding a wall, and Pelosi further promised to put forth a funding bill that does not include any of Trump’s demands when she assumes the speakership in January.When the Democrats officially take over the House on January 3, Pelosi is expected to get final approval as the next speaker of the House.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/26/primer-what-happens-partial-government-shutdown/","President Donald Trump’s fight with Senate Democrats over border wall funding partially shut down the government and left many Americans wondering what happens during a partial government shutdown.Various things transpire when the government shuts down.Government agencies that have not received funding include the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Interior Department, the State Department, the Agriculture Department, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), among other federal agencies.During a government shutdown, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney runs, issues guidance to each agency to develop its own shutdown plan. In a shutdown, federal agencies must stop all “nonessential” work, and all non-employees must stay home until the shutdown ends.The shutdown will end when President Trump signs a spending bill passed by Congress. Former President Bill Clinton experienced the longest government shutdown at 21 days.Essential government services will continue, which include:Some minor government services will close during the partial shutdown. The Agriculture Department will close its state and local farm service centers across the country. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) might slow down loan processing, and approvals and new loan applications may not be considered until after the shutdown.A shutdown also impacts many of the government’s hundreds of thousands of federal government employees.More than 420,000 federal employees will have to work without pay. Additionally, the government will furlough, or send home without pay, roughly 380,000 federal employees, as the government considers them “nonessential.” Nonessential employees include:Congress does not have to backpay furloughed employees; however, historically, it has done so.Establishment media publications such as Politico and NBC News have attempted to portray the devastation that comes with Trump’s partial shutdown.NBC News reported that in Washington, DC, lights were off at the Korean War Veterans Memorial and that part of the National Christmas Tree was closed following electrical repairs.Politico wrote that the partial shutdown would slow down research at the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The publication also contended that furloughing nonessential employees would serve as a “blow to morale.”Previous government shutdowns have been more painful for some, including America’s veterans.Former President Barack Obama shut down the government in 2013 and set up barriers so that veterans could not visit the World War II Memorial.In contrast to Obama, the Donald Trump administration announced last week that they will make the government shutdown as “painless as possible.”

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/26/shutdown-slim-down-95-percent-usda-office-overseeing-food-stamps/","The government office overseeing the nation’s food stamp program will slim down 95 percent of its operations by the fifth day of the government shutdown, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) documents outlining shutdown contingency plans.Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement on Friday before the holiday weekend that despite the shutdown, “critical services” such as law enforcement, services protecting life or property, or services that are already covered with available funding will continue.“There may be a lapse in funding for the federal government, but that will not relieve USDA of its responsibilities for safeguarding life and property through the critical services we provide,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement.Sixty-one percent of USDA employees are expected to remain at work during the first week of the shutdown, according to the statement. But fewer employees are expected to remain on the job if the shutdown goes on for a longer period of time.One of the USDA offices that is expected to see the most drastic cuts in staffing during the shutdown is the office of Food and Nutrition Services— which oversees the nation’s welfare programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Child Nutrition, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).The Food and Nutrition Services office is expected to slim down 95 percent of its operations, leaving only 5 percent of the office’s 1,493 employees on board, according to the USDA document outlining shutdown plans.The office’s website— like many other USDA websites— displayed a message stating that its website would not be updated until the government fully re-opens.“Due to a lapse in federal funding, this USDA website will not be actively updated. Once funding has been re-established, online operations will continue,” according to a statement displayed on the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Services website.Breitbart News reached out to a Food and Nutrition Services spokesperson for comment to confirm, but received an automated message stating that the employee was “on furlough” due to the shutdown:Thank you for your message.I am not in the office at this time. I am on furlough without access to email, due to the lapse in federal government funding.  I will return your message as soon as possible once funding has been restored.For information about available government services, visit USA.gov.Even with the decrease in staffing, the USDA notes that all eligible households would receive SNAP benefits for the month of January. According to the latest USDA data on food stamp enrollment, 19,395,894 households are currently enrolled in SNAP.Other welfare assistance programs would still be able to continue at the state and local levels with the funding that is already available, and Child Nutrition Programs— like the school lunch program— are funded through February and will operate as usual.

We are already building and renovating many miles of Wall, some complete. Democrats must end Shutdown and finish funding. Billions of Dollars, & lives, will be saved!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018The announcement comes after President Trump met with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and other officials on Monday to discuss border security issues as a partial government shutdown over the U.S.-Mexico border wall entered Christmas without a clear resolution in sight.Though both sides have traded offers over the dollars, they remain far apart on the wall. The White House insists Trump will reject any deal that does not include money for a wall or fence; Democrats were holding firm in their opposition to a wall or other physical barrier.In a joint statement Monday, Democrat leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), vowed that as long as the president keeps listening to the Freedom Caucus and others on the right flank, there is no easy resolution to the impasse.“It’s Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos,” the leaders said. They pointed to problems beyond the shutdown, including the plunging stock market and the president’s firing of the defense secretary. “The president wanted the shutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it.”Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said a counteroffer was presented over the weekend to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Mulvaney would only say the offer was between President Trump’s $5.7 billion request and the $1.3 billion Democrats have offered.“We moved off of the five and we hope they move up from their 1.3,” he said Sunday, a day after a senior administration official insisted Congress would have to cave into Trump’s spending demand for the shutdown to end. The comments highlighted Trump’s unpredictable negotiating style.Mulvaney said he was awaiting a response from Schumer, whose office said the parties remained “very far apart.”Further, President Trump told his over 50 million Twitter followers Monday that he is waiting in the White House for Democrats to make a deal on border security. “I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,” President Trump tweeted. “At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!”I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security.

But the Senate refused to vote the legislation forward, shutting down the government.Trump remained at the White House while members of Congress went home for Christmas.“At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about,” Trump wrote. “Crazy!”He reminded the United States that Democrats used to support border security but desperately want to keep him from a political victory.“It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked, that they turned against it,” he wrote. “Desperately needed!”The president also defended his foreign policy decision to get American troops out of Syria.Several hawkish senators continued to criticize Trump’s decision, sparking a response from the president.“To those few Senators who think I don’t like or appreciate being allied with other countries, they are wrong, I DO,” he wrote. “What I don’t like, however, is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States, both in Military Protection and Trade.”He said that Saudi Arabia had agreed to help Syria rebuild once American troops left.“See? Isn’t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country, the U.S., that is 5000 miles away[?]” he asked. “Thanks to Saudi A!”He explained that he is tired of the United States subsidizing the military of wealthy countries, as allies continue to take advantage of the U.S. on trade.“General Mattis did not see this as a problem,” he wrote. “I DO, and it is being fixed!”Trump also griped about the Federal Reserve for sending the stock market in negative territory.“The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the Market, they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders,” he wrote. “The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch – he can’t putt!”The president usually spends his holiday golfing in Florida at Mar-a-Lago, but he remained in Washington, DC, after the shutdown.First lady Melania Trump was in Florida but is returning to the White House to spend Christmas Day with the president:I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence. It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked, that they turned against it. Desperately needed!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States. See? Isn’t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country, the U.S., that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018To those few Senators who think I don’t like or appreciate being allied with other countries, they are wrong, I DO. What I don’t like, however, is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States, both in Military Protection and Trade…— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018….We are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world, while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the U.S., and our TAXPAYERS, on Trade. General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO, and it is being fixed!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the Market, they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch – he can’t putt!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018The Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security. The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand. The reporting has been inaccurate on the point. The problem is, without the Wall, much of the rest of Dollars are wasted!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018

We’ll see what they come back with. Our goal is to get somewhere between 1.6 and 5 billion. I mean, this is so ironic that it’s the Democrats, like Schumer, who said that we need strong border security, where Durbin has said that we need to find a bipartisan solution to border security, yet they are not willing to budge, at least at this point, in terms of providing funds for [a] physical barrier in that area. And as we know, illegal crossings have increased over 90 percent in the last two months. And you’ve seen the issue with the caravan. That’s been a huge crisis on the border. And the mere fact is that at this moment if we want to make border security a bipartisan issue, the Democrats need to step up to the plate. It’s up to them to stop the shutdown.”(h/t Grabien)Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Because the GOP have no spine. Mitch McConnell, the outgoing speaker of the House as well, are RINOs on this issue. So we can’t expect a solution in the next month,” he added.“For the next two years, the Democrats have the House, they have appropriations. So it’s not going to get built the way it should under another leader.”Gorka says he expects to see much more progress from President Trump in the next two years regarding the wall and stated once the Republicans get the “House back after two years of lunacy under Nancy”, Republicans and the president will have a “cakewalk” with funding the border wall.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum in College Station, Texas, are also closed due to the shutdown. But some presidential libraries will remain fully or partially open during the shutdown.The George W. Bush Presidential Library in Dallas will remain open, but it will not be providing archival services during the government shutdown.The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, California, announced on its website that it is open despite the shutdown.The partial government shutdown affects nine out of 15 Cabinet-level departments, including the Department of Interior and the Department of Agriculture. Interior is responsible for running the National Park Service, and Agriculture is responsible for maintaining national forests.Although the Senate is expected to reconvene Thursday to negotiate legislation to fund these parts of the federal government, the shutdown may continue into 2019.Office of Management and Budget director and incoming Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday that it is “very possible” the shutdown will extend into the New Year, when a new session of Congress goes into effect.

Bob Corker (R-TN) said President Donald Trump causing a government shutdown over funding for a wall on the U.S. Mexico border is “juvenile.”Corker said, “This is a purposely contrived fight over, at the end of the day no matter who wins, our borders are still going to be insecure. I think you know that back in 2013, John Hogan and I crafted a border security amendment that passed with 69 votes in the Senate where Republicans were in the minority. I’m a junior senator from Tennessee, and 69 people voted for $46 billion to secure our border. It was overly prescriptive, and it was overkill, but our borders would have been secure. Not long ago, just a few months ago, the president could have received $25 billion in border security just by dealing with the DREAMers which, by the way, most Republicans want to deal with the DREAMers issue. We had $25 billion that could have been spent on now the government is shut down over what ultimately is going to be $2 billion. This is a made-up fight so that the president can look like he’s fighting. Even if he wins, our borders are going to be insecure.”He continued, “Part of it is because of what we’re spending the money on. We have all kinds of technology, as you know, that we can use to secure the borders. $46 billion did include 700 miles of fencing, which is important, but there are all kinds of technology that we use in Iraq and Afghanistan to secure our borders. It’s not like going to the about Pentagon and saying we need to buy fighters, stealth fighters and they’re supersonic and have precision guided missiles but let’s use the Wright brothers. It’s not just about the money. It’s about what we’re spending it on. We can secure our borders. We can solve this problem. This is a made-up fight.”He added, “This is something that is unnecessary. It’s a spectacle and, candidly, it’s juvenile. The whole thing is juvenile.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/18/shutdown-looms-despite-white-house-retreat-no-border-funding-solution-in-sight/","About a fourth of the federal government is barreling toward another partial shutdown at the end of this week with no solution for border wall funding in reach, and leaders of the Republican and Democrat parties at a standstill just days away from the deadline.Congress has not taken up a spending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other parts of the government, as President Donald Trump has previously insisted upon $5 billion for his planned border wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and Democrats have refused to budge on the matter. The White House on Tuesday, through Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, signaled a retreat from the president’s previous position to an as-of-yet-unexpressed willingness to compromise on the border wall funding as she blamed the Senate for the lack of a deal, all while a solution remains elusive.While the White House has scaled back the original demand, the government remains unfunded past Friday with no apparent deal in Congress’s or the administration’s grasp yet–and that has opened up a circular firing squad among U.S. leaders over where responsibility lies. The blame game comes as the White House is backing down from President Trump’s original push for $5 billion in border wall funding in this spending bill.Last week, Trump sounded off in a heated Oval Office argument with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi–the likely incoming Speaker of the House when Democrats take the majority in January after their midterm election boons–with both sides threatening to hold firm over the border wall money.During a rare White House briefing on Tuesday, Sanders put the onus for a lack of a funding deal on Congress–particularly the Senate–and said the White House is waiting to see whatever can pass the chamber.“You know, at this point, the Senate has thrown out a lot of ideas,” Sanders told reporters. “We’re disappointed in the fact that they’ve yet to actually vote on something and pass something. So when they do that, we’ll make a determination on whether or not we’re going to sign that.”Sanders putting the blame for lack of a deal on Congress is literally the exact opposite of what GOP leaders in the Senate have said. Republican Senators driving this process on Capitol Hill have all said they are looking to the White House for guidance, and that they have yet to receive clear answers from the president and his team.“We don’t know,” Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said when asked what President Trump wants out of this funding battle, per Politico in a report earlier on Tuesday before the White House briefing.“If there’s a plan, I think at the moment it’s the president and the Democrats trying to figure out what they can agree upon,” Sen. John Thune (R-SD), the number three in Senate GOP leadership, added.While the White House had remained firm through Tuesday morning behind the president’s commitment to$5 billion for the border wall or nothing–which would lead to the partial shutdown at the end of this week–Sanders appeared on Fox News earlier in the day before her afternoon briefing to begin walking the administration’s position back. Sanders said:We will continue to have these conversations with both Senate and House Republicans and Democrats. Our team has been in constant communication. We’re continuing to do that–I’m not going to negotiate here. But we’ve been talking to them even as late as–as recently as this morning. Those conversations continue. The President has been clear about what the parameters are that we he wants to see in the legislation–and we hope Democrats will not play games and will support legislation, frankly, that they have supported in the past. Democrats have voted for legislation that we want to see happen.When pressed by Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer on whether the president would take half of the $5 billion that he wants for the border wall, Sanders replied:We have other ways that we can get to that $5 billion that we will work with Congress if they make sure we get a bill passed that provides not just the funding for the wall but there is a piece of legislation that’s been pushed around that Democrats actually voted [for], 26-5 out of committee, that provides roughly $26 billion in border security including $1.6 billion for the wall. That’s something we would be able to support as long as we can couple that with other funding resources that help us get to the $5 billion.When asked if the Trump administration is pushing for a more “creative” way to fund the wall, Sanders replied to Hemmer that the administration is, indeed. Sanders said:Look, we’ve been very transparent with both Republicans and Democrats–the House and the Senate–on what we want to see and we want them to work with us. At the end of the day, we don’t want to shut down the government–we want to shut down the border from illegal immigration, from drugs coming into this country, and make sure we know who’s coming and why they’re coming. That’s what the president is focused on and he’s not going to back down until he gets what he needs to make sure the people of this country are protected.Asked about senators saying that the White House has not been clear, Sanders told Fox News that she sees it differently–and  argued that the White House has been clear and in “constant contact” with Senate leaders on these matters–despite what senators, especially Republicans like Shelby and Thune, have been saying.What happened later on Tuesday, though, that leaves the avenue open for a shutdown as no specific deal has been reached, is that Senate Republicans offered Senate Democrats a different deal–one that Democrats rejected.The Washington Post summarized the quickly rejected deal offer thus:President Trump on Tuesday retreated from his demand for $5 billion to build a border wall, as congressional Republicans maneuvered to avoid a partial government shutdown before funding expires at the end of Friday.But Democrats immediately rejected Republicans’ follow-up offer, leaving the two sides still at impasse as hundreds of thousands of federal workers await word on whether they will be sent home without pay just before Christmas.The new border funding offer from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) calls on Congress to pass a $1.6 billion homeland security spending bill that was crafted earlier this year in a bipartisan Senate compromise.Under the offer, Congress would also reprogram $1 billion in unspent funds that Trump could use on his immigration policies. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who oversees the panel in charge of homeland security funding, said the reprogrammed money would not be able to be used for a physical wall but could be spent on other border security measures.Quickly after the deal was offered, though, both Schumer and Pelosi shot it down:Sen. Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told McConnell Tuesday that Democrats would not accept the deal, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) criticized the plan to reprogram the funds.“Leader Schumer and I have said that we cannot support the offer they made of a billion-dollar slush fund for the president to implement his very wrong immigration policies,” Pelosi said. “So that won’t happen.”Back in the briefing room, and in her Fox News appearance, Sanders attempted to soften the blow of the president’s border wall cave by presenting a new argument–that the administration would be seeking to fund the wall from a variety of other sources than new congressional appropriations. But Sanders has not specified exactly what she means by this–a signal that the administration is angling to frame this retreat as strategic, even if it is not.Sanders said the White House is “looking at every avenue available to us possible” for extra bits of cash for a border wall. She continued:The President has asked every one of his Cabinet Secretaries to look for funding that can be used to protect our borders and give the President the ability to fulfill his constitutional obligation to protect the American people by having a secure border. So we’re looking at the other options. In the meantime, we’ll see what the Senate does, and we’ll let you know when we have an announcement on that front.When pressed later in the briefing on this so-called “reprogramming” of already appropriated funding, something Pelosi argued the administration cannot legally do, Sanders said that there are various “pots of money” around the government that could supplement funding of the border wall.“I would never use Nancy Pelosi as my source for legal authority on probably anything,” Sanders said. “But I would use attorneys that work here at the White House and in agencies – that that’s their entire job is determining whether or not something is legal. And we’re looking to those individuals to find out those specific pots of money that can be used for that.”It remains to be seen exactly what “pots of money” are available, how much cash exactly they could provide, whether it would be legal to use them for a border wall, whether the administration will try to do so, whether the administration would succeed if it tried, and what the fallout would be if the administration went this route.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/17/democrats-funded-wall-under-bush-obama-refuse-same-barrier-to-trump/","Many House and Senate Democrats voted to fund the same bollard-style fencing constructed by Presidents Bush and Obama that they now oppose under President Trump.Ahead of a government shutdown, Trump is asking the Republican-controlled Congress for $5 billion in funding — just a fifth of the funding needed — to build what he continues to call a U.S.-Mexico “border wall,” though the barrier is almost identical to the bollard fencing erected by both Bush and Obama.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), along with their Democrat caucuses in the House and Senate, have objected to funding any barriers resembling a wall along the southern border.Many of those same Democrats now opposing the funding of border barriers, once supported the use of fencing at the southern border less than a decade ago.The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized the construction of 700 miles of the same style of bollard fence that Trump is building at the border, was supported by 26 Senate Democrats at the time. In the House, 64 Democrats joined 219 Republican lawmakers to fund the border fencing.Those Democrats in support of funding the bollard border fencing included:All 54 Senate Democrats, in 2013, voted again to commit funding to secure 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border in the Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act which was authored and introduced by Schumer.Though the border legislation never became law, the Democrat-backed plan would have authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to implement “a Southern Border Fencing Strategy to identify where 700 miles of fencing and technology should be deployed along the Southern border.”As the New York Times has noted in a series of charts, almost 700 miles of barriers have been constructed at the southern border since 2006 with little-to-no objection from elected Democrats.(Screenshot via the New York Times)The Trump administration’s bollard fencing is more than 10 feet higher than those same fences constructed by the Bush and Obama administrations. Since his inauguration, Trump has replaced portions of existing border fences with this new 30-foot high bollard fence.As these photographs show, the Calexico, California project was completed in October:Border Patrol officers keep watch before US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen M.

(MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images)This same bollard-style fencing, between 18 to 30 feet high, was used by the Trump administration in June to begin replacing about 14 miles of existing fencing in San Diego, California. Similarly, in El Paso, Texas, the 18-foot bollard fencing is replacing chain link and metal fences.In Santa Teresa, New Mexico, the Trump administration has constructed the 18 to 30-foot tall bollard fencing to replace existing fencing in the region.Photographs captured below show the construction underway in April of this year:US workers are photographed during construction of 32km of the border wall by order of US President Donald Trump on the border between Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua state, Mexico and Santa Teresa, New Mexico state, US, on April 17, 2018.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Friday, Feb. 24, 2017, that it plans to start awarding contracts by mid-April for President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico, signaling that he is aggressively pursuing plans to erect “a great wall” along the 2,000-mile border.

(AP Photo/Christian Torres, File)The Obama bollard fencing was showcased in a short video by PBS called “Obama’s Border Fencing” where a Texas resident living on the border complained that the fencing had been constructed by DHS in her backyard.Watch the video here to see a clip of the fence:While House and Senate Democrats say they will risk a government shutdown to not fund border barriers under Trump, illegal immigration to the country has soared to record levels over the past two months.In November 2018, there were close to 52,000 border crossings on the southern border, alone, marking the highest level of illegal immigration in the month of November since 2006.The continuing rise of illegal immigration at the southern border indicates that Fiscal Year 2019 will see the biggest boom of illegal immigration in more than a decade, with more than 600,000 border crossings, according to Princeton Researcher Steven Kopits.In October 2018, illegal immigration at the southern border soared to the highest level for a single month since April 2014. The month’s illegal immigration levels are almost exactly double what southwest border crossings were this same month in 2017.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/17/mark-meadows-stay-stay-congress-past-christmas-get-wall-funding/","House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) told reporters on Monday that he remains willing to stay past Christmas to get President Donald Trump’s requested $5 billion in border wall funding.Meadows told reporters that he does not think Democrats will give into Trump’s demands to give him his requested $5 billion in wall funding.Meadows said he is “not very optimistic that Democrats are going to yield in providing $5billion in Wall funding.”Trump has threatened to shut down the government if Congress does not give him his requested five billion dollars in wall funding in the December spending bill; if the government does not pass a spending bill before December 21, the government will partially shut down.The North Carolina conservative also opposed a potential short-term spending bill that punts the wall funding fight to January, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) will likely become the new speaker of the House.“What makes January any better than December 21st? I’m willing to stay here through Christmas to get it done right on behalf of the American people,” Meadows said. “And we continue to punt. This is not to anybody’s surprise.”Meadows continued, suggesting that if the government does shut down after December 21, he does not “think it would open back up until those discussions happen in earnest on a bipartisan basis” when Democrats regain control of the House of Representatives.Meadows’ contention mirrored President Trump’s recent thinking, which, according to a Bloomberg report, suggested that Trump will likely not support a one-week- or two-week stop-gap spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown.President Trump tweeted Monday that America can save billions of dollars every year with a wall along the U.S. border.“Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line,” Trump wrote. “Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control!”Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/12/15/dem-rep-roybal-allard-republicans-have-the-responsibility-to-keep-government-open/","During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA) said Republicans “have the responsibility and the power to keep our government open.”Transcript as Follows: “Hello. I’m Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard of California’s 40th Congressional District, and I serve as the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security.Appropriators understand we have a critical responsibility that transcends politics: to keep our government funded, so it can serve the needs of the American people.Unfortunately, House Republicans and the President have – once again – walked away from that responsibility. Due to their obstruction and failure to govern, Republicans are driving our nation to the brink of another disastrous government shutdown – at a time of great economic uncertainty, and right in the middle of the holiday season.Here’s the bottom line. Republicans still control the House, the Senate, and the White House. They have the responsibility and the power to keep our government open.But this week, before the eyes of the American people, President Trump declared that he’d be ‘proud’ to shut down the government, saying ‘I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down’ if he cannot force American taxpayers to spend billions of dollars on an immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.Democrats support a strong homeland security policy, that protects our borders and honors our values as a nation. Yet, the President is proposing squandering $5 billion on this border wall – when our nation has so many homeland security vulnerabilities that, if left unaddressed, threaten the safety of the American people.We need funding to hire more law enforcement agents to focus on opioid, gang, trade and child exploitation investigations.We need more funding for the Coast Guard’s air and sea fleets, including to pay for the first heavy icebreaker since the 1970s – because, as the Arctic ice recedes, Russia, China, and other countries are winning the race to lay claim to the vast resources of that region.We need thousands of additional customs officers to help intercept illicit drugs and other contraband, almost all of which comes into our country through the ports of entry.And we need to be investing more in first responder grants to better prepare states and localities to prevent and respond to terrorism and disasters of every kind.These critical national security needs cannot be met if we waste $5 billion on an unnecessary and ineffective border wall.On January 3, Members of Congress will take an oath: to support the Constitution and protect the American people. Democrats are ready to honor that oath on Day One.Democrats have presented the President with options to keep the government open. It’s President Trump’s choice to keep government open, or to shut the government down – and the American People are waiting for his response.And if Republicans do steer our nation into a Trump Shutdown, we will swiftly pass the remaining appropriations bills with a CR for Homeland Security to re-open the government.On Election Day, the American people spoke, and demanded a government that would work for them.House Democrats are ready and proud to deliver For The People: lowering their health costs, increasing their paychecks, cleaning up corruption, and protecting our national security.Let’s get to work.”Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/11/nearly-2-in-3-trump-voters-support-government-shutdown-for-border-wall/","Nearly 2-in-3 supporters of President Trump and Republican voters say they support shutting down the federal government in order to secure full funding for a border wall on the United States-Mexico border.The latest Marist Poll reveals that 65 percent of Trump supporters and 65 percent of GOP voters say the president should not compromise on his proposed border wall, even if it means a government shutdown.Among those who call themselves “strong Republicans,” nearly eight-in-ten say Trump should shut down the government to secure the border wall funding.A plurality of about 47 percent of Trump’s base, the white working class, say the president should stay strong on the border wall and not compromise, even with the possibility of a government shutdown.Non-college educated white men, 50 percent; white evangelical Christians, 53 percent; and Americans living in rural communities, 51 percent, are the most supportive demographic groups of shutting down the government to secure the $25 billion needed to build the border wall.When asked if building the border wall to stop soaring illegal immigration at the southern border was an “immediate priority,” about 67 percent of Trump supporters and 63 percent of Republican voters said yes, the border wall is an immediate priority for the nation.A plurality of the white working class, 42 percent, said the border wall is an immediate priority, as well as 45 percent of non-college educated white men and 42 percent of Americans in rural communities, who said the same.As Breitbart News reported, Trump said on Tuesday he is fully committed to shutting down the federal government if Democrats do not help fund his border wall, although Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he and fellow Democrats would not waver in refusing to fund the wall.Currently, the House version of the Department of Homeland Security funding bill, as Breitbart News reported, includes only $5 billion for the border wall but ties the funding to a variety of cheap labor giveaways to the big business lobby, the outsourcing industry, and the open borders lobby, including:The House DHS spending bill does not include any additional funding for the Border Patrol to effectively detain illegal aliens without releasing them into the American general public.The bill also does not provide Trump with the funding for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to hire an additional 1,000 ICE agents. Trump has said for more than a year that he wants to increase the number of ICE agents, but the GOP Congress failed to provide the funding.The continuing rise of illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, researchers say, indicates that Fiscal Year 2019 will see the largest level of illegal immigration into the country in more than a decade.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/12/11/pelosi-i-told-trump-to-pray-for-biblical-wisdom/","Tuesday, Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told reporters that she asked President Donald Trump to pray for “understanding and wisdom.”Pelosi said, “I thought we would open the meeting with a prayer, which I did.”She continued, “I told him about King Solomon, when he was to become king of the Jews, he prayed to God, he said, ‘How can I ever follow King David? I need you to give me great understanding and wisdom, Lord.’ And after he prayed and prayed and prayed, God came to him and said, ‘Solomon, because you did not ask for longevity, great wealth, or vengeance against your enemies, I will give you more wisdom than anyone has ever had.’ The wisdom of Solomon.”She added, “It had nothing to do with that. It had everything to do with—let us be prayerful and listen to each other and have an understanding of where people are coming from on all of this. Whatever you think about it, how many times did he mention the word wall? That’s all he could say. How many times did he mention that? How obsessed he is with the wall. Is it worth shutting down the government and hurting the American people? The economy has uncertainty and people are losing their jobs and the market being in a mood, unpredictably, that again. Services being cut off from people who need them. It is not the right thing to do. It is the wrong thing to do and he shouldn’t do it no matter what he thinks of his campaign promise.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

"BREITBART","https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/11/chuck-schumer-trumps-temper-tantrum-not-give-wall/","Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said after a meeting with President Donald Trump on Tuesday that Trump’s “temper tantrum” will not give him his proposed border wall.President Trump, Schumer, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) sparred in an on-camera fight over border wall funding in a December spending bill.Trump surprised the press by calling reporters into the meeting that was initially supposed to be closed the press.President Trump said he will shut down the government if Congress does not fund his requested $5 billion for border wall funding in the December spending bill. Schumer and Pelosi have proposed $1.6 billion in border security, not border wall funding.“I am proud to shut down the government for national security, Chuck. … I will take the mantle,” Trump said.After the meeting, Schumer said Trump will not receive funding for his border wall, suggesting that Trump had a “temper tantrum.”The New York Democrat said, “He will get no wall, and he will get a shutdown.”“This temper tantrum that he seems to throw will not get him his wall,” Schumer said.“He does not have the votes in the House to pass whatever his agenda is with that wall in it,” Pelosi said.The conservative House Freedom Caucus released a statement late on Monday night, contending that they stand with President Trump, ready to fight for his promised border wall.“This is our last chance to address illegal immigration before Democrats take over the House,” the Freedom Caucus said in a group statement. “Republicans in Congress must fulfill our promise to the American people by building President Trump’s wall, ending catch and release, and securing our borders.”During the meeting at the White House, Trump said he would not sign any funding bill without substantial border security funding.“If we don’t have border security, we’ll shut down the government,” Trump said. “We have to have the wall.”
